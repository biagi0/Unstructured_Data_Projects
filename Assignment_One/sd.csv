6-Oct,"   ""  kia hyundai under-achieving  ""  kia hyundai  and   ""  kia hyundai performance  over-achieving  ""  kia hyundai  are relative terms . . . boy i learned that lesson in school, the hard way. lol. achieving top 20% income level as early as the late-20's is quite impressive. keep in mind however the average income earner do not buy the average-priced new car . . . the avearge income households buy used  car . it's really quite tough to afford a car that costs more 30-50% of the buyer's annual income at the time of purchase, unless the buyer is still living off parents or something. a typical car cost 50% of its purchase-time price in the three years after acquisition, through depreciation, interest payment, taxes, insurance, etc.. that means roughly 16% of income each year for someone acquiring a car that is priced at 50% of his income . . . that means roughly 30% of after-tax income each year for the first three years, for someone who buys a $40k car on an $80k income. that's just not manageable for most households. lease subsidies, and manufacturers' rebates that do not get reflected in the lease residual can change the numbers significantly . . . but neither is available for  bmw  at this time.

6-Oct,"   ""  kia hyundai most bmw's owners paid for the badge, rather than the performance car imho.  ""  kia hyundai i'm glad you added imho. because you don't speak for me, and i assume you know nothing about a bmw buyer, except for a small select few.you are right, people do pay for the badge. but a potential buyer understands what is behind the badge. bmw has worked very hard to engineer their  car  for people who want the ultimate driving experience. if you haven't driven a bmw borrow one from one of your friends overnight and have some fun with it.

6-Oct,"   ""  kia hyundai it's not a matter of   ""  kia hyundai if  ""  kia hyundai  i can afford a $43,500 car, but is the car   ""  kia hyundai worth  ""  kia hyundai  $43,500.  ""  kia hyundai why is a porsche 911 twice the price of a  chevrolet ?how is an $8,000 rolex better than a $30 timex?why would anyone pay $30 for an 8 oz tenderloin when you can get a 1/4 pounder with cheese for $2?rocky, just because you can't tell the difference, doesn't mean it isn't there. it may not be worth it to you, but for many of us, it is.i applaud cadillac for having the guts to build and market a car like the cts. it's not sublime like a bmw, but it is a competent and appealing sport sedan by all accounts. gm is doing good things right now (solstice/sky,  chevrolet , cts) and i hope they continue moving forward down the path they started.
