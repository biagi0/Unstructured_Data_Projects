18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2714.0,96541.0,6695549.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 14% to $2.52 billion. Return on invested capital was 34%, down from 66%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 465 million shares compared with 461 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 36% to $12.95 billion or 37%, excluding the $139 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection of free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime. 
Media revenue increased to $5.23 billion, up 12% or 13%, excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM revenue increased to $7.39 billion, up 60% or 62%, excluding foreign exchange rates. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 48%. Worldwide unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 130 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 30% of total units. Consolidated gross profit grew 33% to $2.63 billion and gross margin was 20.3%.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $2.01 billion or a 15.5% of sales, up 101 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.06 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 7.7%. Tech and Content was $456 million or 3.5% of revenue compared with 3.1%. Marketing was $368 million or 2.8% of revenue, consistent with prior year. 
Now we'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $7.21 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $2.37 billion. EGM revenue grew 71% to $4.56 billion, representing 63% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $295 million, a 4.1% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 26% to $5.74 billion. Revenue growth was 29%, adjusting for the $143 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 11% to $2.87 billion or 13% excluding FX. And EGM revenue grew 46% to $2.83 billion or 50%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 49% of international revenues, up from 43%.  International segment operating income increased 3% to $327 million, a 5.7% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income increased 16%. 
CSOI grew 4% to $622 million, or 4.8% of revenue, down 146 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $18 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI grew 7%. Unlike CSOI, GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was relatively flat at $474 million or 3.7% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $84 million in Q4 or 17% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $416 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared with $384 million and $0.85 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss full year results. Revenue grew 40% to $34.2 billion. North America revenue grew 45% to $18.71 billion, and International grew 33% to $15.5 billion, 34% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI grew 23% to $1.94 billion or 25%, excluding $28 million of unfavorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin decreased 75 basis points to 5.7%. GAAP operating income grew 25% to $1.41 billion or 4.1% of net sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $8.76 billion. Inventory increased 48% to $3.2 billion, and inventory turns were 11.4, down from 12.2 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved the in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 44% to $8.05 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 68 in the prior year. Our Q4 2010 capital expenditures were $328 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we've described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2011, we expect net sales of between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion, a growth of between 28% to 39%. This guidance anticipates approximately 140 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $260 million and $385 million or between 34% decline and 2% decline. This includes approximately $140 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, but we anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $400 million to $525 million or between 21% decline and 4% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. 
And with that, Rob, let's move to questions.",1011

Would that have been impacted by the strong sale of Kindle devices in the fourth quarter? And second, could you just talk broadly about the Subscribe and Save offering that you have and to what extent you've seen cross selling into more consumer-staple items amongst your customer base?",59

You are seeing some volatility to look at the individual quarters from 2010. You saw that we were down a bit in Q1, up the next two quarters slightly and then down a little bit in Q4, about approximately 45 basis points. And we haven't been talking much more on the gross margins because we don't think it's that meaningful, and that's what we're trying to point people to the bottom again. And the reason we're doing that is because of the mix of business. And so what you're seeing there in gross margins in Q4 is we have a very broad mix of businesses and geographies that are going into that number. And again, you're seeing some volatility in the individual quarters. But again, we're very pleased with what we saw in Q4 in terms of growth and overall performance of the business. And it reflects a very heavy investment load to support the growth that we expect. In terms of the Subscribe and Save, could you repeat the question again?",177

But just picking into two components. First of all, is there any big obvious reason why international growth decelerated while the domestic growth accelerated? And then secondly, in the Media business, if e-book sales are now bigger than paperback sales and paperback sales continue to grow, is there a big obvious reason why total media sales is growing at 13% rather than a slightly faster number? I assume that the agency accounting for e-books is part of that, perhaps?",101
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2714.0,96541.0,6695558.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,11,"In terms of overall growth, we are very pleased with what we saw, just kind of frame up that discussion a bit. We saw 40% growth year-over-year total year 2010, which is the best growth rate we've seen since 2000. We saw Q4 growth rate overall of 37% on local-currency basis, which matches our best growth rate for any Q4 we've had on a local-currency basis since 2000. And then unit growth was 43%, which certainly going back several years, we haven't seen any quarter that's had that growth. So we're seeing very strong growth across many categories, across many geographies. In terms of the international growth specifically, if you look back to last year, we did have very strong media growth in international in Q4. You'll see that it's up 26% on a local-currency basis, which is one of the strongest quarters we've had, and we're overlapping that. There were some new releases that were in Q4 last year. Most notably, the Windows 7 release one, Dan Brown's book in Germany is other, those are a few examples, but there are a few releases that were in there. The other piece to that we haven't -- certainly difficult to quantify but there was certainly some impact from some of the weather that we saw in Europe during the month of December. But again, we're very pleased with the growth that we saw in Q4 in total, including international, and we're happy with what we see there. In terms of some of your questions surrounding media. Again, we are seeing good growth there. As you mentioned, we're seeing, so far, quarter date this quarter, we saw that Kindle books exceeded paperbacks, which is very exciting and while having paperbacks continue to grow, year-over-year. So again, we're seeing very strong growth there. So again, we're pleased with the growth we're seeing across the business.",313

Could you just give us a little bit more color on is it still fulfillment centers? Is it tech and content, all of the above? And secondly, with the Lovefilm's acquisition, can you just walk us through the rationale and how you'll integrate that with perhaps your other video-on-demand businesses?",74
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2011",2011-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2714.0,96541.0,6695565.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,18,"Sure. In terms of the guidance, let me just put that in context. And probably the best way to do it is just again a reminder on 2010. The fact that we had very strong growth, the best growth we've seen in 10 years. Fourth quarter matched the best, on a local-currency basis growth, matched the best fourth quarter we've had since 2000. And again, very strong unit growth and the best we've seen. With all that growth, we had to add a lot of capacity, most of which was in the second half of last year. We added fulfillment capacities for the corner retail business. We added fulfillment capacities to support our growing fulfilled by Amazon business was part of our seller business. We added a lot of infrastructure capacity to support our fast-growing AWS business, as well as our retail business. So those reflected, when you look at our Q4 results and our 2010 results, those are reflected in the CapEx numbers that you're seeing, and those are reflected in the fulfillment as well as the tech and content lines when you look at our operating expense line items. And so because it was largely back half of the year loaded, you're seeing more of that in Q1. So those are reflected in the growth rate. Now the question will be we're not giving guidance beyond Q1, but what will this mean going forward? And so one of the things that we're doing is certainly, when you look at our Q1 guidance, you look at our topline guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about Q1, in a very strong growth. And we'll have to see how much we invest throughout the year in 2011 based on that. But again, I'm very, very happy with the capital we're able to deploy. You should keep in mind that with the sheer amount of capacity that we added in 2010, it doesn't become, it's not fully utilized day 1 and we don't get the optimum productivity on day 1. So what that means is we get productivity on those operations. We get returns on those assets that we deploy over a period of time. But if you look at our history, we've gotten very good returns on that capital. And so to me, I'm very pleased to put that capital in place. And if we have to add more in 2011, it will be a high-quality problem.",404

It's growing at a very fast rate. We're investing in that business to support that growth rate. You're correct, in terms of seeing the North America Other growth rate drop from 52% to 45% year-over-year from Q3 to Q4. Keep in mind that there's a number of things in there including AWS that tend to be a little lumpy. But we did see actually an acceleration of growth in AWS from Q3 to Q4. So built into that number, it actually accelerated. So again we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. In terms of Grocery, we have two things that you probably could be referring to. One is our Drygoods business, which is within our Consumer business that we're very pleased with that we have on Amazon.com, as well as some other sites. In addition to that, we have a local test here in Seattle called Amazon Fresh. Again, that is a test that we've been conducting. We're pleased with how the test is going. But again, it's a test and we'll continue to see how that goes and see if we invest further on that test. Again, we do a number of tests in different parts of our business and that happens to be one of them. We have a great team that's working on it, but you'll have to stay tuned to see if we do more there.",245

I know you're not going to guide to 2011. But since you're guiding to Q1, are you planning opening on any distribution centers, and what's your CapEx for Q1?",46

We added 13 last year. We will add more fulfillment centers this year. We haven't said, we weren't saying how many yet because again we're trying to determine what the growth rate will be. And based on what we've seen in Q1, we're certainly cautiously optimistic which is reflected in the growth rate you see for guidance for Q1. So we'll have to wait and see, and we'll be back with you as we go throughout the year. But just to be clear, again, I've mentioned in one of the other questions that I think would be a very high-quality problem. And the reason why I say that is what our teams are doing around the world right now, which is the same thing we've been doing for the last 15 or 16 years in working with our various fulfillment centers is even though we're not fully utilized in some of these new assets that we deployed in 2010 or our productivity is not optimum, that team will work to utilize those assets. As we continue to grow, we'll get better and better productivity as we go, just like we have in our other fulfillment centers around the world that we've had experience with. So we're very excited about that. And so when you think about the fulfillment centers, even though they can be a little bit dilutive in the short term by looking at our fulfillment expense, the reason why I'm very excited about is that you can just look at our return on invested capital. If you take our return on invested capital at the end of 2010, we had approximately $7.4 billion of invested capital. That's a 5-point average over the last five quarters. If you take out cash and marketable securities over the same period, that's about $6.5 billion. So we have about $900 million of invested capital. And even with our heavier spend in CapEx last year, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow. So we have an excess of 250% of return on our invested capital x cash and marketable securities. And so again, that's a full business. It includes a lot of things over a period of time. But if you think about that capacity where we need it because of growth, we're certainly very happy. We do it judiciously and make sure we do it appropriately. But very happy to deploy that capital to get great returns for shareholders over time. And again, the returns that we've gotten are certainly historical, not predictive. But again, we're very happy to deploy that capital, and I feel very good about it.",446

I think historically, Amazon's pricing philosophy has been to be a price follower. And I guess I'm curious if perhaps you're loosening that strategy up a bit, maybe to be a price leader in more categories?",43

But certainly, our objective is to have great values for customers over all of our selection, over all of our geographies, and that hasn't changed. And so we're very excited to offer customers that. It's a reason, certainly one of the drivers for the growth that we've been able to have over our history. And so one of the things that we do, do is when we enter a new category and add selection within that category, we price it day 1 as competitively as we can. So in other words, we price it competitively day 1 based on the intelligence we have. And sometimes that means it's a very low gross margin because we're just entering those particular categories with those particular items. And that's something we've been consistently doing for a number of years, and we like that strategy.",158

I was wondering if you could just help us understand, the one question would be all-in Kindle hardware and software, the whole thing together, how is that impacting gross margin? And then overall, how should we think about how the agency model and the e-books how that's going to impact margin? And then just one quick one. There's been some speculation about the potential to bundle services with Amazon Prime. I was wondering if you could tell us how you think about that and if that's something that may be interesting in the future?",109

But what I can say about Kindle is it's growing very fast. We're extremely pleased with what we're seeing. We sold millions of devices in Q4. The content business, the content part of it is growing very fast as evidenced by some of the comments we put in the earnings release. .So far quarter-to-date this quarter again Q1, we have Kindle content, Kindle book sales growing at a faster rate than paperbacks, which is really exciting. And so that business is going very well. And with the opportunity that we see there, we're continuing to invest in that business. We think it's a very good business for us, and we're excited about the long-term opportunity there.",132

Even though we're extremely excited about our Kindle business, our physical book business continues to grow as well. And so we're very excited about both parts of our business. And again we think, when I was mentioning Kindle, we just think it's a great opportunity for us. It has great tracks right now. Customers like it. We're able to offer so many titles right now on less than 60 seconds right to for a customer to be able to read. And one of the things you can't do with a physical book is you can't, from a service perspective with our model, it's very difficult to get it to a customer now. And with Kindle, we can do that in less than 60 seconds. You can carry around your library with you very lightly, and so we think it's just great for customers, and we're seeing that the growth, both in terms of devices and content, is just fantastic. And so we're continuing to invest and continue to improve that experience for customers. In terms of gross margins versus operating margins, we actually don't focus a lot on individual percentages, whether it be gross margins or operating margins. We're focused on ultimately over the long term on free cash flow, free cash flow per share. We like to look at our return on invested capital. I mentioned earlier what our return on invested capital is today. That includes appropriately so the cash and marketable securities that we have in that balance. But certainly, if you were to deploy that cash and return that to shareholders over time, you can see the underlying returns on invested capital x cash are very high and in excess of 250% right now. And so we think it's a very efficient capital business, and we think that we certainly like the model that we have and the opportunity that it brings to our shareholders over the long term.",329

And so that's what you see today. We have these apps so that it's easy for customers to be able to do that. Customers like that feature, and you should expect us to continue to expand that over time. So how much is it contributing to overall growth? It's hard to say. But again, customers are responding to the vast selection that we have, the great prices we have for Kindle content, the ease of which they can carry it around with them with the great convenience on the device, the Kindle device itself, so we're very excited about it. In terms of fulfillment. We continue to work with our fulfillment to make it as seamless as possible for customers. That's really what it's all about in each of the geographies we're in, and we'll continue to do so. So wherever we can make that service within Europe, better for customers, we will. It will come from whatever fulfillment center makes sense.",189

Do you think that your lifetime kind of value of the customer equation has changed? Particularly as you looked at you have initiatives like Kindle and Prime.

But we continue to offer new things for customers to make the experience better for customers. So we're adding new selection to make that better for customers. We launched Prime a number of years ago which continues to grow because we want to make sure that we give great service to customers. Many of our digital initiatives are around how do we make sure we get customers, not only creating great price and great selection but they get to have their content immediately. And so those are the things -- that is always -- with us, we start with the customer first. That's where our focus is. We found that by aligning with the customer, it's been great for customers as well as great for shareholders over time. So that's the focus that we've had and the driver behind the initiatives over the past several years.",157

That was a part of it. We're always looking for ways to reach customers through our marketing spend. We also did, you'd probably noticed a fair amount of Kindle ads during 2010, primarily starting for the most part heavier after Q1 of last year, which we saw a great response to.

In the U.S., you can get express two-day shipping for free, you get one day and also some other offers, in terms of weekend offers as well. So again, there's some interesting service element to that.

So it'll be something that will evolve over a longer period of time. But again, if you look at the returns that we've gotten on the previous fulfillment centers that we've launched, they have been great uses of capital. So we're very happy about that. And in terms of your question on double-digit operating margins, we've said for a long time and nothing's changed in that regard. We think that certainly double-digit operating margins are possible. If it means that we have some high single-digit operating margin that maximizes free cash flow, we're certainly okay with that and have room to go there. But we're certainly focused on how do we get the best free cash flow, free cash flow per share while getting great efficiency on our invested capital. And so nothing's changed there.",164

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 9% to $3.03 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow decreased 18% to $1.9 billion. Return on invested capital of 24%, down from 45%. ROIC [return on invested capital] as TTM [trailing 12 months] free cash flow is divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 466 million shares compared with 463 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 38% to $9.86 billion or 36%, excluding the $144 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who also continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $3.96 billion, up 15% or 13%, excluding foreign exchange rates. EGM [Electronics and other General Merchandise] revenue increased to $5.59 billion, up 59% or 57% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 57% of worldwide sales, up from 49%. Worldwide unit growth was 51%. 
Active customer accounts exceeded 137 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 33% of total units. 
Now, I'll discuss the operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. The cost of sales was $7.61 billion or 77.2% of revenue compared with 77.1%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $1.78 billion or 18.1% of sales, up 234 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $831 million or 8.4% of revenue compared with 7.4%. Tech and Content was $580 million or 5.3% of revenue compared with 4.5%. Marketing was $320 million or 3.2% of revenue compared with 2.7%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments, our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 45% to $5.47 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.89 billion. EGM revenue grew 63% to $3.3 billion, representing 60% of North America revenues, up from 54%. North America segment operating income increased 6% to $290 million, a 5.3% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $4.39 billion. Adjusting for the $141 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. We estimate that the international revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points following the earthquake and subsequent events in Japan. 
Media revenue grew 13% to $2.07 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 54% to $2.29 billion or 49% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 52% of international revenues, up from 44%. 
International segment operating income decreased 25% to $175 million, a 4.0% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 28%. 
CSOI [consolidated operating income] decreased 8% to $465 million or 4.7% of revenue, down 239 basis points year-to-year. Excluding the $7 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 9%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 18% to $322 million or 3.3% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $89 million in Q1 or a 29% rate for the quarter. The tax provision for Q1 2011 includes income tax expense for approximately $8 million related to a discrete item in the quarter. GAAP net income was $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared with $299 million and $0.66 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.82 billion year-over-year to $6.88 billion. Inventory increased 59% to $2.89 billion and inventory turns were 11.6, down from 12.6 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 53% to $5.54 billion and accounts payable days increased to 66 from 59 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2011 capital expenditures were $298 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q2 2011, we expect net sales between $8.85 billion and $9.65 billion or growth between 35% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 640 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income to be between $95 million and $245 million or between 65% decline and 9% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $275 million and $425 million or between a 32% decline and 5% growth. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. With that, John, let's move to questions.",979

Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on your 2Q guidance and what you're thinking the impact from Japan could be and how you're thinking about when you incorporate that into your guidance? And then secondly, on shipping, the losses seem like they're growing. So I was wondering if you could just talk, Tom, about is that a function of more Prime usage, faster shipping or fuel cost perhaps impacting that line? Any more detail there would be great. Thanks.",91
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2355.0,117874.0,7855402.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,6,"Sure. In terms of your first question, what we saw for Japan, first of all to talk just briefly about Q1 and then I'll talk about Q2. Q1 in terms of impact, we think the impact is approximately 500 basis points on international revenue. If you take a look at international revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange, was up 27%. So about for the unfortunate events in Japan, it would have been approximately 32%. The impact on Q1 in terms of consolidated segment operating income was approximately $20 million. What we saw post the events, we certainly saw a pretty sizable slowdown for the few weeks ending the quarter. What we've seen since then so far quarter-to-date has been that certainly our growth rates have picked up, but they're not at the rates they were previous to the events. So again, we're seeing a positive growth there but not the growth rates we were seeing prior to that. And so what we believe for the quarter, along with all of our other assumptions are included in the guidance that we've given today. In terms of your second question related to shipping profit, what you're really seeing there is customers are coming out in great numbers with all of our adopting all of our free shipping programs including Amazon Prime. I think we're seeing great adoption there and that's really what's driving those numbers.",232

A couple of questions. One, I guess, when you look at your -- it looks like the International business is really starting to kick in nicely and it seems like Amazon Prime has now had a chance to really mature and ramp up in a lot of your regions. I'm curious, are you seeing the same type of kind of returns that you saw in the U.S. market in terms of customer adoption, kind of purchase frequency in the international markets around Prime? And second, it seems like Kindle, you're kind of employing a similar strategies that you did with Prime which is stagger versus the U.S. market, and is it almost following the same path of kind of ramp and returns for the Kindle initiatives globally as you saw in the U.S. market?",136

We are seeing customers love Prime in all geographies that we've offered it in. We are seeing great cross shopping that's happening, so customers really like the program. And obviously we have different offers depending upon geography, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far. In terms of Kindle, we've seen tremendous growth both from a device standpoint, as well as a unit standpoint in terms of digital books in the U.S. And where we are now offering it outside of the U.S., we're seeing the same -- even though it's early, we're seeing great adoption and growth there. So we're very, very happy to see the progress that we've made. One thing that we're doing obviously, you probably saw the launch related to -- the announcement related to Kindle special offers, we actually will start shipping tomorrow. The teams did a nice job of moving the dates up from several days from now to start shipping tomorrow, so very pleased to be able to offer that and excited about that offering.",190

That 51% unit growth seems like a real outlier. You haven't had that kind of unit growth in the past. Is there something in there that's unusual, something in there that's one time-ish, something in there that tells -- would have you warn people to think that that's not a sustainable growth level? And then very recently, you have something of an outage in the Amazon Web Services field. Was that a demand problem which is not necessarily a bad thing or are there certain efficiencies that you needed to -- or inefficiencies that you needed to address that have been fixed? Thanks.",108

What you're seeing there is we saw a great growth across the business. But the biggest thing you're seeing is that -- which primarily the consequence of growth of our digital business. That's what you're seeing in the growth rate, the acceleration in growth rate from Q4 to Q1. In terms of AWS, again, the team is working very deliberately on the way to identify and validate and fix the root causes associated with this incident, and that's what they're working on and I don't really have a lot to add to that at this time.",134

First, the midpoint of guidance for Q2 implies margins about 1.8%. So x SBC, where's the other 150 bps or so of additional spend going? How much of that is on recurring things like the 4,200 people or so you hired in the quarter versus kind of any one-time items? And second on the state tax issue, how big a concern is it to you, how big an advantage do you believe you've enjoyed so far from not paying taxes in those states? I guess in other words, would you have been able to grow at the rates you have been growing at if taxes were kind of levied across -- on your business across the U.S.?",124
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2355.0,117874.0,7855411.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,15,"Sure. In terms of your first question, we're not breaking out the individual line items, if you will, for operating expenses. But if you take a look at what we saw in Q1, you're seeing that we've added a lot of capacity to our CapEx and you'll also see the fulfillment capacities here on our CapEx and you'll also see it in the fulfillment line item. We added 13 fulfillment centers last year. If you take a look at the announcements that we've had to date, we're adding 9 fulfillment centers this year. Those are the ones that we've announced. With the growth rates we're seeing, you should expect -- if the order continues, you should expect to see more than that this year as well, more than the 9. So that's what you're seeing in the Q1. And you'll also see that reflected in the Q2 guidance as well. Same is true with Tech and Contents. We're adding a lot of capacity to support our growing business. Again, you've seen that reflected in the CapEx as well as the Q1 Tech and Content line and that's also reflected in the guidance as well. In terms of state taxes, one thing you keep in mind is we actually collect sales and value-added tax in approximately 50% of our revenue base, sort of a little over 50% of our revenue base today. And so the growth rates that you're seeing reflect the fact that we are collecting in more than half of our revenue base. So beyond that, there's not a lot I can add there.",265

Thanks very much for taking the questions. If I look at the 74% growth in North America and other revenues, is that primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then similarly, if I look at the step up in CapEx, would that also be primarily due to Amazon Web Services? And then kind of uniting the 2 questions together, historically Amazon has been very capital disciplined, how do you get confident that the capital you're putting into Amazon Web Services would generate returns over the time that you desire?",90
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2011",2011-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2355.0,117874.0,7855414.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,18,"Sure. If you look at North America, other growth in the North America includes a number of items, including Web services. So it's a combination of all those items that we've talked about in the past. And so but certainly, Web services is a meaningful part of that. In terms of the CapEx question, what you see in CapEx is -- if you look at the growth, we had $1.1 billion of CapEx in the last 12 months. And if you look at the growth year-over-year of that CapEx, approximately 80% of that is due to pure capacity. And that's capacity in terms of fulfillment, that's capacity from an infrastructure standpoint to serve the retail business as well as AWS. And another 10% to 12% is associated with just the corporate office space and the remainder is a number of small items. So again, the vast majority, approximately 80%, is due to capacity, both infrastructure and our operation capacity. In terms of your question about how we think about AWS, we, like a lot of parts of our business, we look at that business very discretely and all the services very discretely. And we look at the ROIC potential of those businesses and the opportunity to work on trying to figure out the best way we get great returns for shareholders. And that's something that we've been doing since we launched the business, and obviously we have a lot more information to do that now than we did at launch. But again, it's something that we do continuously.",258

One of the other line items that was up year-over-year was marketing expense, 50 basis points. Is that a ramp or an incremental ramp in Kindle promotion?

And so those are our 2 primary, but you're correct in terms of we are doing, as you've probably seen, some more broadscale advertising related to Kindle would be certainly incremental year-over-year and certainly impacting that number. In terms of the equity line, we do have a number of equity investments. And certainly, one of those is LivingSocial. And it's certainly impacting that number that you're seeing.",84

And many multi-general dealers and pure-play commerce companies are getting into that space or getting better at least including eBay's possible acquisition of GSI Commerce. So how does Amazon continue to spend on its competitive modes around fulfillment and shipping experience? And second question is can you make a comment about the capacity utilization of the 13 fulfillment centers you set up last year?",88

In terms of the first part, we have a fantastic operations team that is continuing to look at ways to improve delivery speed, as well as improving our cost structure over time. And that's something you'd see if you look back over our history, it's something that they've worked on. And so they're always looking at ways to better serve customers and to get better. And so there's a number of ways that they do that. And it's a constant focus. In terms of the capacity, I don't think there's anything, any way to really help you because, again, the utilization will vary from week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter. But what we are seeing is, as you would expect with this great growth that we're experiencing, there is just more demand for capacity and that's both from a fulfillment capacity, that's both from our core retail business as well as fulfilled by Amazon.",152

The -- of the 9, and we could probably have either Rob or John get back to you on the exact details, but approximately 4 those are in the U.S. or 5 in North America and the others are in international. So the fulfillment centers vary depending upon the level of automation and the locations they're in. I can't really give you a precise as 1 geography higher than another. It kind of depends on size and the level of automation.",82

I think 1 thing to add here is Tom's point. We're expanding fulfillment capacity worldwide. It's not just in a specific geography because the growth we're seeing is broad-based. The second point I just want to make is as we are building system of scales, fulfillment becomes more of a continuous investment project. It becomes less project to our end, just something that we need to undertake on a go-forward basis. And so you're certainly seeing that decision being reflected in our Q1 results and it's also reflected in our Q2 guidance.",96

What I was referring to is if you look at our equity income line on our income statement, you can see an expense there and I've said that there was -- that was made up of a number of different investments that we have which includes LivingSocial, so that was the LivingSocial piece. In terms of marketing spend, we still -- the spend is very efficient. And again, what I mentioned earlier was that still the 2 primary pieces of our spend are our associates channel and also sponsored search, so those are our 2 primary. In terms of looking at it year-over-year, you're also seeing some of the broadscale spending we're doing specifically related to Kindle that's impacting that number as well.",141

We also, certainly Prime is having an impact, as well as our other free shipping offers and so the adoption of both has been great. And so we're very pleased to that.

So it's already been noticed that the growth in units relative to growth in revenues is a pretty substantial difference and kind of a widening difference. I was wondering if you could explain when a customer becomes a digital customer and they started buying whether Kindle books or another digital product, how does their spending on Amazon change? Are they spending similar amounts with you and just buying more units or is the actual amount of spending with Amazon going up? Obviously the unit growth is a lot. Thanks.",96

But we are seeing customers who are digital customers still being very good, physical customers as well, so buying, doing a lot of cross shopping across our business. And so we're very excited about our digital offerings and it's certainly reflected in the unit growth that you mentioned. But also we're seeing very good growth amongst many physical categories across all of our geographies as well.

One, is there a point where increased digital offerings sales offset investments in selection and in stocks and we start to see that in the inventory turns number?

So we are having the benefit of seeing both a very strong growth in our digital offerings, as well as a very strong growth in our physical offerings.

In terms of the fulfillment centers, we have a lot of -- we have a wide range of fulfillment centers across a number of different states and geographies, and we continue -- our operation team does a great job in terms of figuring out where the best places are to invest and they'll continue to do that over time.",137

I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12 month operating cash flow increased 25% to $3.21 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow decreased 8% to $1.83 billion. Return on invested capital is 21%, down from 34%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 51% to $9.91 billion or 44%, excluding the $477 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $3.66 billion, up 27% or 20% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $5.89 billion, up 69% or 62%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 59% of worldwide sales, up from 53%. 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 56% compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1 2011. Active customer accounts exceeded $144 million. 
Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q1 2011 and 34% of paid units in Q2 2010. 
Now, I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $7.52 billion or 75.9% of revenue compared with 75.5%. Fulfillment, Marketing, Technology and Content and G&A combined was $2 billion or 20.2% of sales, up approximately 190 basis points year-over-year. 
Fulfillment was $909 million or 9.2% of revenue compared with 8.5%. Tech and content was $624 million or 6.3% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $331 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 3.1%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. 
In the North America segment, revenue grew 51% to $5.41 billion. Adjusting for the $3 million year-over-year of favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 50%. Media revenue grew 20% to $1.58 billion. EGM revenue grew 67% to $3.5 billion, representing 65% of North America revenues, up from 58%. North America segment operating income increased 7% to $214 million, a 4% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 51% to $4.51 billion, adjusting for the $473 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 36%. 
Media revenue grew 34% to $2.07 billion or 20%, excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 71% to $2.4 billion or 53%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 53% of international revenues, up from 47%. 
International segment operating income decreased 16% to $172 million, a 3.8% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 34%. CSOI decreased 5% to $386 million or 3.9% of revenue, down 229 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $28 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 12%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 25% to $201 million or 2% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $49 million in Q2, resulting in a 22% rate for the quarter and a 26% rate year-to-date. GAAP net income was $191 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $207 million and $0.45 per diluted share. Second quarter 2011 net income was positively impacted by equity method investment activity of $15 million, including the $49 million gain on sale of an equity position partially offset by $34 million in losses from equity method investments. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $1.25 billion year-over-year to $6.36 billion. Inventory increased 66% to $3.23 billion and inventory turns were 11.3, down from 12.5 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 61% to $5.72 billion and accounts payable days increased to 69 from 65 in the prior year. Our Q2 2011 capital expenditures were $433 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in corporate office space. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3 2011, we expect net sales between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion or growth of between 36% and 47%. This guidance anticipates approximately 450 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $20 million and $170 million or between 93% decline and 37% decline. This includes approximately $180 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $200 million and $350 million or between a 50% decline and a 13% decline. 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, John, let's move to questions.",1005

We are seeing free cash flow levels depressed in the near term. And how long can this -- do you expect this to continue? If you keep grabbing shares, should we continue to expect pressure, in terms of free cash flow? Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about incremental capital invested.",82

In terms of how we think about these investments. Our approach has been pretty consistent over the years. If you look at the, as you mentioned, the strong growth, this is the strongest growth we've had from a quarterly perspective year-over-year and over 10 years. And as a result of that, as we look forward, there's a requirement for a lot of capacity and it's something I talked about on previous calls. And if you think about our capacity, it comes in a number of different forms. First of all, our core Retail business. We need both fulfillment capacity, as well as infrastructure capacity. This is something that we've been doing really since our inception and I look at it as a high quality problem. We have a -- if you back out cash and marketable securities, you see that we have a high ROIC. I'm not saying that's really a historical performance, it's not necessarily a predictive performance, but I do feel very good about those investments. Those are something that we've done before. And it's something that we've been working to perfect really since we opened our doors back in the mid-90s. In terms of there's another set of investments certainly you're seeing we're investing in the conversion from physical to digital. We think we have good assets to do that. We're very focused on the customer experience. And that comes in a number of different forms. We feel very good about those investments in terms of the traction that we're getting from a customer standpoint. And we're certainly optimistic about our ability to generate good free cash flow while high returns on invested capital. Then we have some newer businesses. I say newer, they've been with us for several years, but at least they weren't since inception like beyond the digital initiatives like Web services. That's a business that we're investing in. We have great traction. The team has done a terrific job there. And we continue to improve that business, and it's growing very fast. And that's -- you're seeing capital requirements for that business. So that's a business that the team is operating very carefully. They're looking at best ways to improve return on invested capital over time, and we think that's a great big space to be investing in, and we think it's good for that customer set.

When I say our Retail business, I mean everything but AWS. So again, think of it as the infrastructure cost to support those 2 businesses.

On media, the revenue growth there reaccelerated pretty nicely from the last couple of quarters. Is there anything you would call out there, in terms of driving that reacceleration? Any sort of specific categories? And then the second part, I know it's still relatively early days for Prime Instant Video, but I was wondering if you could share with us some of the metrics you see and the impact on Prime membership. And then just last on the housekeeping question, how much were acquisitions to revenue growth in 2Q and in your 3Q guidance?",107
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2011",2011-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2632.0,146548.0,9409465.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,11,"Sure. In terms of media, it was pretty broad across the board. Certainly, you're seeing great growth in our digital products, including Kindle that's represented there. The other thing to call out just from a sequential standpoint as you look at international specifically. We did see -- and this is reflected in the total growth rate for international, as well as the media growth rate. We did see an acceleration from Q1 to Q2 for our Japan business. We had talked about last time being soft given the events there, that our team there has done a terrific job serving customers, so we have seen the growth rates return more favorably from first quarter. They're not quite where they were last year but certainly they've -- we've seen an acceleration there, so that is also impacting our global media growth rates and it shows up in our International segment. In terms of Prime Instant Video, we're measuring, as you'd expect, a number of different things for that business. It's very early right now. There's not a lot I can share with you. What I can say though is we like what we've seen so far. We're continuing to invest there, and right now we're seeing customers love it, and it's early. So again, that's something that we'll continue to focus on. And then your third question in terms of acquisitions impact. For Q2, the most recent acquisitions for Quidsi and Lovefilm, that impact year-over-year for those two acquisitions, is a little over 200 basis points, approximately 220 basis points. We had a small amount in Q1. So if you're looking at it sequentially, assume it was about 30 basis points in Q1, and a little over 200 basis points in Q2. Again those are both year-over-year numbers impact for those acquisitions as Lovefilm was about half a quarter in Q1. In terms of bottom-line impact or CSOI and operating income for Q2, CSOI was about negative 19, for GAAP operating income, it was negative 27. That's for Q2. In terms of Q3, it's reflected in the guidance that we're giving today, and we're not breaking out those specific numbers.",359

I know you don't run the business per [ph] markets for free cash flow, but as you brought the margins down and investing aggressively to support what's this exhilarating 10-year high growth rates, I assume you're doing with a view not to just growth rate one quarter out or two quarters out, but for a full year out. Do you feel that you've got enough to grasp over the business such that when you see that growth rate slowing down, which it inevitably must, whenever that is in the year, that you can easily ramp-up margins? Do you really feel like you're at a point in the business model where that tradeoff is a very easy thing for you to manage?",135
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2011",2011-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2632.0,146548.0,9409468.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,14,"Sure. The way you should think about it is first of all, the growth rates that you're seeing in Q2 really stem from investments that we've made over a long period of time. These aren't investments that we've made over the past few quarters. We have invested capacity over the last several quarters to help support that growth. And certainly that's one of the investments that's more recent. But again you should think about it as investments that we've made over a long period of time. For example, we've started investing in our Kindle business and AWS businesses several years ago now. And those have gotten great traction. We launched FBA several years ago. We launched Prime a few years back. We continue to launch new categories. We continue to add unique selections, so those of the things that have happened over an extended period of Time. We are also planting new seeds today. You see that Prime Instant Video as an example of that. Some of the -- a lot of the offerings that we have within AWS are examples of those. And again we have many examples of those across the business. So when we look at -- it was similar to the answer that I gave to Jim in the first question is again think about our business in a number of different pieces, but we have our Retail business that we've been offering in since inception. We continue to add capacity to support those. We continue to add selection and so those are the parts of the business that we feel very, very good about and the fact that we have to deploy more capital in terms of capacity we feel very good about. Again, our historical returns aren't predictive but we feel very good about it. And then we feel very good about the assets we have in our digital space as we convert from physical to digital, and then we talked about some of the newer investments as well that we feel very good that we're investing in today that we certainly hope and plan on getting good returns for shareholders. But our goal ultimately is, as you mentioned not to optimize for margins, but our goal is to maximize free cash flow and have high ROICs.",383

Can you give us some color on the target roll-off and whether that's contemplated here in the outlook and how much of an impact that is?",73

And so if you take Quidsi plus the operations in CS people that we added for the capacity that we've been talking about. The combination of those two make up the majority of those adds. Now we still had certainly adds across the business in a number of different areas. And particularly in some of the areas I mentioned, in some of the earlier questions. So again, the majority are of those 5,300, as well as actually the year-over-year increase, which is just under 15,000 is due to operations in CS and again, more recently, the acquisition of Quidsi. As for the margin, again, in terms of target, they've announced that they're going to be going to their new website in Q4 and we've had a very good relationship with them over the past several years. And we certainly wish them well with their new website. We were pleased to offer those services for them and again they've announced that they'll be switching to a new website in Q4.",197

In terms of lower prices, it's kind of hard to describe, to answer your question actually. We view it as an extremely important aspect of our business.

And then second, a lot of the investments you're pushing through today, in terms of facilities, OpEx, et cetera. Can you talk about maybe what year are they typically geared for?

And then in many cases, several years before cash flow positive. And so we do take a long-term view. That being said, we monitor those investments very carefully. So, for example, and we do it on a discrete basis, on an area-by-area basis in terms of our investment. For example, in our Web Services business. That team has done a very nice job of growing that business innovating on behalf of customers and we're also trying to see how do we get -- ensure we get higher ROICs on that business. And so they've been working on that for a number of years. And so they look at it on a service-by-service basis. And what they're trying to do is become not only great -- have great services for customers but to be as efficient as possible in terms of from an investment standpoint.

In terms of what enabled us to have the growth rate that we're experiencing today, I'll just take the retail part of our business for a second. There are many, many aspects of it, let me take just the retail part of it. We've continued to add great selection over a long period of time. And when I say great selection, unique selection. We've continued to get sharper and sharper arm pricing, understanding exactly where we are from a pricing standpoint. We've continued to launch new programs that get our product to customers quicker. We offered free shipping a number of years ago that made it more economical. We offer Prime to make it kind of quicker and more economical to get to customers, so it's a great service for customers. So all of these things have built upon themselves. We offer third-party offerings of [ph] 36% of total units. Several years ago now or a few years ago now, we'd launched Fulfilled by Amazon. It was a way to make that experience better for customers as well as sellers. So these things have built upon each other over a period of years. Now what you're seeing is there is a concentrated amount of investment that's going in, relative to capacity more recently. That really came out of -- you see different periods of growth that we've had where things have gotten softer, that we will absorb that investment and it becomes more productive. We saw that happen particularly in the U.S. when we had the downturn starting in late 2008. It kind of went through a portion certainly of 2009 even though our global growth was still in the high 20s. And that was a little bit softer in the U.S. for some of those periods. So we were able to add less fixed investment to support the capacity for that part of the business because of the growth. Now what you've seen is coming off of that through 2010, you saw very strong growth. We had 40% growth in 2010. You saw very strong growth in Q1. We had 36% growth on a local currency basis even with some of the softness in Japan. You've seen reacceleration in Q2 growth was 44% including a couple of hundred basis points of acquisition growth sequentially. So again it's, again these are building upon each other and some of the larger investments we've made to support capacity are more recent over the past 18 months now and that's continuing as you see from our Q3 guidance given the growth we're experiencing. So I'm trying to separate a little bit the growth to support the -- sorry, the capacity to support the growth but then we've made many smaller, some not so small investments over the past 10-years plus that have brought us to the growth rates on the customer experience that we have today.",487

So tactical, some of the investments that's required to support from a capacity standpoint in the infrastructure, as well as FCs this quarter Retail business, for example, I would consider that tactical or running the business-type adjustment. And those have been sizable. You can see step change in our capital and part of it's for that growth for that reason, part of it's for growth in FBA and part of it's for growth in Web services as well as a few other areas.",84

Eugene Munster,,Analysts,44,"Back to the tax question. It's inevitable that 100% of your business will be taxed. And let's fast-forward to that point. What message would you have for investors on how to think about the impact that will have on your business? And then a follow-up to that is there are some rumors that as you pull the affiliates out of California, you may actually have some sort of sales tax liability. Can you put any of those rumors to rest?",80

And again, I'm talking the broader issue, not any particular state. The way I think about it I talked about our approach in terms of the U.S. of having a federal our national solution and I think that's the right approach. But in terms of the business itself, one thing to keep in mind is that we do collect, as a reminder, sales tax or equivalent tax at approximately half of our business today. And so when you look at the growth rates that we're experiencing, again half or a little over half of our business we're collecting that today. So that part of the base that we have -- in the end, customers really want is they want a great experience, they want -- certainly they want low prices. They want the selection that they're looking for. They want fast delivery. They want it to be as convenient as possible. That's true among certainly our retail customers. So we continue to work on that experience. We continue to work on trying to make the seller experience even better, FBA, Fulfillment by Amazon is another example of that. That happens to also have a customer benefit the consumer not just the seller, but again sellers like it as well as consumers. We continue to make sure that our experience is good for our Web Services business. So we take that, the customers experience extremely seriously, it's something they’re working on very, very hard. And our digital offerings, Kindle, we have a great team who's innovating on behalf of customers across the business including our Kindle business. And so they're trying to make sure they continue to innovate. And so all of these things that I had mentioned are things that we think are important to customers and ultimately why customers will purchase from us or not. Those are the things that we're going to continue to work on because we can't predict what will happen in some of these other things. But we can predict that customers will still want low prices, they'll still want great selection, they'll still want convenience, they'll still want innovative products and services, on every half. So those are the things that we're going to be continuing to work on and have worked on since our inception.",410

Talk about a lot of things, but not AWS. You still think that business -- I guess how's the trajectory? Do you still it still can be as big as retail? And any thoughts on what the margin profile of that business looks like relative to your core? So just thoughts on AWS in general. And then secondly, did you change the historical third-party unit forecast? I had a couple question on that. It looks like some of the historicals might have been higher than what you might have said in a couple prior quarters?",97
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2011",2011-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2632.0,146548.0,9409504.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,50,"I'll answer the second one first. In terms of the unit growth and the third-party units, what we did this quarter, which is different than we have previously, we actually went with the paid unit growth as opposed to total units. So historically, we've been including -- there's been some amount of free units included in those numbers. And so for example, if you take a look at our current quarter, the number I mentioned was paid unit growth of 56%. That compared to again that's paid unit growth, that compared to 45% paid unit growth in Q1. The number that we reported in Q1 was actually 51% because that included free. So the comparable -- the 45% for Q1 and the 56% for Q2 are comparable. Again, those are just paid units. And then the third-party percentage of total units was 36% this quarter, up from 34% last year. And again those are paid units for the percentage of total units. And so we thought it would be an interesting, another interesting way of looking at it so we thought we'd provide it this quarter. In terms of the AWS business, it's certainly a very, very big space. Hard to say how big it will be for Amazon, but we're incredibly excited about that business. The team's done a terrific job and continue to innovate on behalf of customers. And we have just a great team of innovators and operators running that business, and we're very excited about it.",251

I'll begin with comments in our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 19% to $3.11 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $1.53 billion. Return on invested capital is 17%, down from 28%.
Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter end. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares compared with 465 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 44% to $10.88 billion or 39%, excluding the $371 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We are grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage for our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.15 billion, up 24% or 19%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $6.32 billion, up 59% or 54%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 58% of worldwide sales, up from 53%. 
Worldwide paid unit growth was 53%. Active customer accounts exceeded 152 million. Worldwide active sellers were more than 2 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $8.32 billion or 76.5% of revenue consistent with the prior-year period. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.29 billion or 21.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. 
Fulfillment was $1.09 billion or 10% of revenue compared with 8.7%. Tech and content was $694 million or 6.4% of revenue compared with 5.1%. Marketing was $360 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 3.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate segments or stock-based type of compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North American segment, revenue grew 44% to $5.93 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $1.93 billion. EGM revenue grew 56% to $3.64 billion, representing 51% of North American revenues, up from 56%. 
North America segment operating income decreased 23% to $144 million, a 2.4% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 44% to $4.94 billion, adjusting for the $367 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 33%. 
Media revenue grew 27% to $2.23 billion or 17% excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 63% to $2.68 million or 51%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues up from 48%. 
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $116 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 55%. 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 35% to $260 million or 2.4% of revenue down approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 38%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income include stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 71% to $79 million or 0.7% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $67 million in Q3, resulting in a 52% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate year-to-date. GAAP net income was $63 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared with $231 million and $0.51 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $441 million year-over-year to $6.33 billion. Inventory increased 50% to $3.77 billion and inventory turns were 10.8, down from 11.8 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. 
Accounts payable increased 42% to $6.55 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 72 from 73 in the prior year. Our Q3 2011 capital expenditures were $529 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web services and capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the trends that we've seen to date, and what we believed today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters in changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4 2011, we expect net sales between $16.45 billion and $18.65 billion or growth between 27% and 44%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
GAAP operating income or loss to be between $200 million loss and $250 million of income are between a 142% decline and 47% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $0 and $450 million or between 100% decline and 28% decline. 
We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to creating lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, John, let's move to questions.",922

In terms of the guidance for revenue for Q4, as we've done in previous years, we've given a wide range of guidance in Q4 just because of the seasonality and it's difficult to predict. But we feel very good about the demand that we've seen to date. And certainly, at the high end of the guidance, you can see there's an acceleration that's possible that's reflected in that guidance. But we are given a wide range consistent with what we've done in prior Q4s. In terms of the overall growth that we've seen so far, to date, you saw a very strong growth in Q3, up 39% on a local currency basis. That's consistent with what we've seen over the past 12 months where we're up 39%, also over the trailing 12 months. And we really saw a step change 2 years ago where last [indiscernible] year-over-year so far last 12 months up 39%. So again, we feel very good about the growth that we are experiencing, and I've seen data reflected in the guidance given a wide range. In terms of Kindle Fire in our guidance and certainly  the largest portion of that would be reflected in our revenue.",201

I guess the implied margin for Q4 is effectively 0 at the midpoint. It, again, answer the question, what's the financial model going forward? Is it to try to maximize growth on the top line even at 0 growth -- 0 margin?",56

We're seeing the best growth which we've seen since 2000, meaning in 2010 and so far over the past 12 months ending September. And so with this strong growth, we're investing in a lot of capacity and that's what we've been talking about over the past couple of quarters and that's what you're seeing in our Q3 results specifically. If you take a look at our operating expenses in Q3, as a percentage of revenue, you see -- and if you compare that to Q2, as a percentage of revenue, you're seeing very similar trends for marketing and G&A. You're seeing a slight uptick in tech content. It's about 10 basis points and then you're seeing fulfillment up approximately 80 basis points. The reason why that's growing so much, as a percentage of revenue, is again the capacity that we've been talking about. Many days ago, I've mentioned that we were -- we had announced 15 new fulfillment centers this year that's on a basis of 52 from last year. And then we'd likely open one or two more. We are  actually going to be opening 17 new fulfillment centers. And so you're seeing that impacting our fulfillment expense in Q3, as well as the bottom line in Q3. So that's what's impacting this in Q3. We are also investing in a number of different areas. We're investing to support retail growth fulfilled by Amazon growth, fast-growing AWS business, as well as infrastructure to support our retail business. We're investing in our Kindle and Digital business. I mean you're seeing that reflected in our Q4 guidance as well, all of these things. And so if you take a look at our Kindle business, for example, we've launched 4 new products at the end of September, and we're very, very excited about those products. They're at great prices, and they are certainly premium products. And so we're very excited about those. And we think about the economics of the Kindle business, we think about the totality. We think of the lifetime value of those devices. So we're not just thinking about the economics of the device and the accessories. We're thinking about the content. We are selling quite a bit of Special Offers devices which includes ads. We're thinking about the advertisement and those Special Offers and those lifetime values. So those are the things certainly that are impacting, as well as investments in other areas impacting our Q4 guidance. But we feel very good about where we are right now and the opportunities that we have in front of us.",447

I was wondering how you're thinking about individual markets in cases where specific markets are highly competitive and markets where you maybe position potentially as the #2. Do you, long-term in markets such as that do you believe that the business should be positioned as #1 and that the scale advantage has deteriorated if you're not a #1. Just wondering given some of the emerging markets and the competitive landscape that's occurring, particularly in Asia. How  you think about that?",90

We're -- maybe to step back from it a bit. Whenever we enter a new geography or even a new category, we're trying to make sure that it's something that we can, we think we can add value to. And so, for example, we like categories that have a lot of different SKUs that are complicated in a physical retail environment. We like categories where there is, we think that we can add a lot of value from a service perspective. And so in each of the categories that we operate in, we're always trying to make sure that we can -- we think we can get great returns on invested capital over a period of time. And so I'm not directly answering your question, but we certainly look at it on a category-by-category basis. We look at it where we can add value. And if you look back over of our history, you can see where we've entered new categories, new geographies. We've always started with the customer first. We've added  selection usually first from a retail standpoint. Sometimes with third parties it starts, sometimes not. But we've added third parties as we've gone if we haven't done it what we started. And so this is -- we think this model has worked very well for us. And again, we're  looking always at ways that we can add value for customers and shareholders over time.",237

First on U.S. EGM, there was a bit more deceleration there than  prior quarters. I know that comp was more challenging, but can you give us a little color on what's going on with the deceleration in domestic EGM? And then a question on mobile, our smart phone and tablet users that are buying physical goods on the Amazon mobile app, how does their purchase behavior differ from the same users who are buying stuff on PC? Are they buying more physical goods or less, not ebooks or digital goods, but just specifically physical goods?",99

In terms of the first part of your question, we are very pleased with the growth rate we saw in North America EGM. It was up 56% year-over-year. And you do have it right. It is a bit of a tough compare if you look back to last year. We did grow 80%. It was certainly high watermark for us and we're overlapping that. We had very, very strong growth last year Q3. But again, still very pleased with what we see in Q3 of this year in EGM specifically and our overall growth rates, too. In terms of mobile, we actually haven't released a lot of details and that's not much I can help you with there. But certainly, we are seeing good trends in our mobile business. And again, we like what we're  seeing there, but there's not much I can help you with that particular question.",150

First of all, I guess on lifetime value, if you look at the Kindle kind of customer versus the core retail customer, can you talk about whether lifetime value is comparable or higher, relative to that core business? If you can isolate it that way? And second, as you look at the third-party business, are you seeing an accelerated mixed shift towards third-party broadly? And is there anything -- any particular markets or kind of international that seems to be seeing a bigger pickup in the third-party side of the business?",95

We have learned a lot over the past couple of years about -- since launching Kindle. Once a customer's purchased a device, obviously, what else do they buy. And what they launch  more recently of special offers and ad-based Kindles. We certainly have some data and we're still learning, but have some data that we didn't have prior to launch. And so what we're seeing certainly is that once customers purchase a Kindle and are carrying around this really massive selection at their fingertips, they're buying more content. We've talked a lot about that on previous calls. But again as we think about the lifetime value, we thinking very specifically about the device itself. How to make sure that we get just the absolute device in customers -- the absolute best device in customers hands and have the absolute best content on those devices. And we look at the total economics which include the device, the accessories, the content, as well as any ad-based revenue and Special Offers. So those are the things that we're looking at, as we think about the lifetime value of the device. And we like what we see. And so certainly as you think about Q4 and you think about the guidance that we're giving, certainly we're going to have a -- we expect to have a record quarter in terms of device sales. And because of the back-end loading of it, you should assume that the content would, obviously, trail that device sale. The ad revenue would trail those device sales as well as the Special Offers. So those are the things you should think about as you think about our Kindle business. But we're extremely excited about it both our electronic ink and fire devices and couldn't be more pleased to offer those for customers and we think that those will be great for share owners over time. In terms of third-party, we think the business is going very well, in terms of the numbers. Our third-party units, as a percentage of total units, these are paid units, as a percentage of total units is 38% this quarter, up from 35% last year. So we're very pleased also on top  have very strong overall unit growth, so we're  very pleased with what we're seeing there. And this is a trend that's been -- you've seen for a number of years now, where we're getting both great retail growth, as well as third-party growth. And certainly fulfilled by Amazon and other things that are helping drive that growth rate.",463

In the case of video, we'll certainly have  book content, music content. So it will be a very -- our App Store as well. So it will be very easy and very integrated being able to access all of our digital content. It'll  also be easy to access physical product as well. So those are things that we're very excited about, and customers will be able to see when they receive their Fire. And so we think it's an incredible product. We're very excited about it.

First, I guess on the Target cost drop, I think Target drop -- is dropping basically in August. So wondering what the impact of that is from a onetime cost standpoint in the third and fourth quarters. And then the second quick question is on the distribution center ramp, the 17 new distribution centers that you're adding, how long would it take for those distribution centers to operate at normalized levels similar to your 52 other distribution centers?",81
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2482.0,178069.0,10943896.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,30,"In terms of Target, we're not breaking out any specific partner relationship. But certainly, in terms of you have the timing right, in terms of that did happen during Q3. We're  very fortunate to be able to partner with Target over a number of years and so we're very happy to have done that, and so that relationship ended from a partnering of their website in Q3. And any associated impact has been reflected in our actual results for Q3 and our guidance for Q4.  And then in terms of the FCs, the way you should think about it is think about just the sheer ramp up of going from 52 to 69 FCs in a year. It's happening very fast. We have a fantastic team around the world who has been working very hard, making sure that we're up and running, and we have all of our associates train. That being said, as you can imagine, we're having people come in well before starting fulfillment for training. We are signing leases and getting product available for shipment well before doing so. And so, consequently, just as a result of having a ramp up where they'll  be no output for some period of time even though we'll have people in building someplace and moving, receiving product in as productive downtime. And then there's a timeframe where it takes to ramp up during -- from a distribution standpoint. And so all these things will take time. It's something that we have been doing since the start of Amazon. It's something that I think we understand very well, and it takes a period of time depending upon the FC and how automated it is or non automated it is. So those -- all of those factors, we certainly understand well and we'll certainly feel very good about deploying those assets and get great returns on invested capital on those assets over time.",320

In terms of Prime video, customers absolutely love it. It's free video. We're adding a lot of content there. We have a lot of customers who are requesting free trials, and then the converting base on those free trials. This is the Prime trials. And so it's very early. And it's something that we'll be adding to, certainly, over the course of the next 12 months and we feel very good about that. But we're also monitoring it very carefully, and we're watching all of the customer-facing metrics that we can, as well as looking at the economics.

First, Tom, we've seen in the past sometimes when companies make changes to the site, in terms of the UI that it can take customers a little time to get adjusted to those. Can you comment on what you're seeing in the early impact on your site and how that plays into the 4Q? If it does at all? And then secondly, can you comment on whether you're paying any royalties around the Kindle Fire?",77

It's certainly that's probably the most recent data would be to look at our Q3 results. We didn't have the new UI at 100% for the full quarter. But again, we saw a very strong growth rate in Q3. As I've mentioned earlier, up 39%, so we feel very good about it and it's certainly reflected in our actual results in our guidance as I've mentioned earlier. If you think about Q4, we think we'll have certainly, we've added a lot of selections over the past 12 months, a lot of great unique selection, so we think we are well positioned for Q4 from a selection standpoint. We continue to make sure that our prices are sharp, so we have great value to customers. We continue to work on improving service levels that comes in a number of different forms, but certainly getting goods to customers fast is important and certainly Prime is playing a key role on that and we have certainly a lot more Prime members this year than we have previously. So all of those things we have 4 new Kindle products at just great prices for customers. So all those attributes set up Q4 for a nice growth quarter. Although as we have another Q4 because again our -- but again, we feel very, very good about the growth that we're  seeing over the past quarter and our prospects for the holiday season. And that's reflected in the guidance that we're giving. And in terms of specifics on royalties and everything, we certainly wouldn't talk to that.",274

I think you mentioned before that you might need to increase beyond the 15 new centers if revenue growth were faster than originally expected.

As I mentioned 90 days ago, we've given a range of guidance for the top line for Q3. We hadn't given guidance for Q4. We were very excited about the growth that we were seeing through the first half of the year, but we wanted to get through Q3. And again, I'd announced or had mentioned that 90 days ago that we had announced that we were opening 15 and potentially 1 or 2 more. And that reality is coming true. We are actually opening up 17. And so -- and again, that illustrates we feel about -- how we feel about, not the growth that's happened in the past. But certainly impacting how we're thinking about it, but it impacts the fulfillment we're adding is about growth going forward. And so we feel very good about the growth they're  experiencing and we're looking at a number of different factors, including our most recent historical growth rates. In terms of supply, you probably saw the release. But again, in the first 3 weeks since launch, orders for our EE  Kindles are double the previous launch. We're also seeing extremely strong Kindle Fire pre-orders and we're increasing capacity in building millions more than already planned. And so that's what we're doing from a production standpoint, and we're getting ready as you'd expect for just a great holiday season for customers overall and for Kindle customers.",246

But you're right, we're seeing a large sequential increase in employment and a large year-over-year increase in employment, and it's across many different areas that we're adding. But certainly the most notable, both from a year-over-year and sequential and certainly represents the majority of the additions would be our operations and customer service associates. And so those are certainly growing fast, and we're also -- given the opportunity that we have to grow. We're also investing in other areas. But again, the majority of the sequential and year-over-year increase is coming from operations and customer service associates.
