18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2829.0,956000.0,40602555.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 74% to $11.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $2.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our Fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue increased 22% to $35.7 billion, or 26% excluding the $1.2 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 304 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 51% year-over-year. Worldwide seller units represented 47% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, units represent nearly 50% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $24.3 billion or 68.1% of revenue compared with 70.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $4.4 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $3.2 billion or 9% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Marketing was $1.7 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 5.1%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to our segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $21.5 billion. Media revenue grew 11% to $3.9 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 28% to $17.3 billion. North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $6 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 12% to $11.8 billion. Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 3% to $3.3 billion or increased 5% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 19% to $8.5 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating income was $60 million compared with $65 million in the prior year. International segment operating income includes $47 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $60 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income was $1.8 billion or 4.9% of revenue, up approximately 140 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $20 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income grew 88% to $1.1 billion. Our income tax expense was $453 million. GAAP net income was $482 million or $1 per diluted share compared with a net income of $214 million and $0.45 per diluted share. 
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $107 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $63.7 billion or 26% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. International revenue grew 6% to $35.4 billion or 21% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, Germany revenue grew 18%, Japan revenue grew 19%, and U.K. revenue grew 16%. AWS revenue grew 70% to $7.9 billion. Consolidated segment operating income was $4.5 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $16 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion compared with $178 million in the prior year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.4 billion year-over-year to $19.8 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $10.2 billion, and inventory turns were 8.5, down from 8.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $20.4 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 77 from 73 in the prior year. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, recording further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q1 2016, we expect net sales of between $26.5 billion and $29 billion or growth of between 17% and 28%. This guidance anticipates approximately 130 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income to be between $100 million and $700 million compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expenses net. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense net, to be between $700 million and $1.3 billion compared with $706 million in the first quarter of 2015. 
We are grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.",1143

I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter. And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well?",53
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2829.0,956000.0,40602559.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,6,"Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. I will say we're -- it's been very strong and the AWS revenue is on a -- just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4. As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally, what we find is that price is important, but so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that are beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in the space, and we don't take it for granted and we want to serve customers better each year.",149

Did we see more aggressive promotional activity? And maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward?",47

Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed, and through Q4, we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers and in stock in time for the holiday. Another dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter. Nearly 50% of our third-party units were FBA, and our third-party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, so up 40 basis -- 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses, and we were full. It was a very busy quarter, and it did increase some of our variable cost as a result, primarily in the U.S. But a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded even our expectations.",141

It seems pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old-world assets like truck trailers and ship lanes and airfields. Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?",68

Thanks for your question. I would say that what we found is, in order to properly serve our customers at peak, we've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them. And those carriers are just no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. They've been and continue to be great partners, and we look forward to working with them in the future. It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those this past year. We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our sort centers.",119

The first one is just on gross margins. I think they were down about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite some time. Anything you'd call out there? Is it devices or more sortation centers? Is there anything pressuring gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter? And then on the Fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth in the Fulfillment cost. Anything else you would call out leading to incremental Fulfillment cost, maybe India or something else?",95
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2829.0,956000.0,40602572.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,19,"No. And again, keep in mind that the Fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number as opposed to a full revenue number. But our Fulfillment cost per unit actually decreased year-over-year. It's just we are now shipping more and more of our -- of the demand out of our warehouses because of the strength in retail and FBA. On gross margin, I would -- first, I'll caution you and say we would encourage you to look at free cash flow, which was -- grew at a minimum $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out and op profit, which was up 88% year-over-year. If you look sequentially, also keep in mind that in Q3, when it was up  500 basis points year-over-year, that was lapping the write-down of our Amazon phone inventory the prior year. So there's a little bit of noise in the Q3 number. But generally, again, we're happy with the ability to service customers, the reaction of customers in Q4, and the bottom line results that we had.",185

On the logistics and transportation side, I was curious if that's, to date, just to supplement some of the other carriers, but more broadly or longer term, is there an ambition from the services side to perhaps provide capacity to other companies. And then on AWS margins, was just wondering if we should expect more leverage there going forward and whether Q1 -- whether that should demonstrate some seasonality versus what we've seen in terms of sequential growth in prior years.",88

Let me work backwards. Don't give guidance by segments, so I cannot really comment on AWS specifically in Q1. The -- and the operational improvements -- excuse me, the gross margin -- or operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase -- reductions in purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have. So we're very happy with that. Keep in mind that we did have a -- although the year-over-year increase in capital expenditures and capital leases was not as great as we saw in 2013 to 2014, we did spend over $9 billion on those -- on capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, up from -- prior year was -- excuse me [indiscernible] number.",134

We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video. Again, when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free-trial conversion rates and higher renewal rates for subscribers. So what we are encouraged by in Q4 was that, globally, we doubled the number of -- our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year. And internationally, we had twice as many Prime members streaming year-over-year. So very encouraged by the pickup and the response of customers. The other comment I would say about video is we're very happy with the Amazon Studios content, in particular, which had some great success in 2014 and 2015. As you probably know, Transparent has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, both for actors and for the show itself. Mozart in the Jungle just won 2 Golden Globe Awards. So very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content. And we've got a lot of new content coming out this year. Catastrophe Season 2, Bosch Season 2, we're all looking forward to. And in February, we will have Chiraq, our first original movie that we got to work with Spike Lee on, which won many critical -- made many critics' best films list in 2015. That would be coming to Prime Video in February.",224

I think you added well over $1 billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there. I'm sure there are a lot of different things going on. I just wonder if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature established countries and regions relative to the investments you're making in other countries so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there.",104

Thanks for your question. We are very pleased by the international growth, 22% FX neutral, was up 1,000 basis points year-over-year. We saw that the -- we told you that the Prime growth -- Prime membership growth with [ph] 50% in -- excuse me, 51% globally, 47% in the U.S., means that the international Prime programs grew at a faster clip than that. So very, very pleased with the uptick. We rolled out a lot of additional Prime features internationally as well this year, from FREE Same-Day to Prime Now to Prime Music and Prime Video in Japan, to name a few. So very happy with that. But in general, if I step back, our investments in international are twofold. First, there's the Prime platform and all the features that I just mentioned, including the Fulfillment, adding more Fulfillment resources to handle higher and higher retail volumes, and a very strong FBA program as well. And then the remainder -- the biggest other investment area is obviously India. And we like what we're -- continue to see -- like what we see in India. In Q4, Amazon India was the top e-commerce site in India throughout the very busy Diwali shopping season, including the -- the shopping season according to comScore. And sales by sellers in Q4 were greater than all of 2014 combined in Q4. So seeing great progress with downloads, innovations for sellers and customers alike, and we like the ramp there, and we're continuing to invest in India.",254

Just first on the North America EGM growth. If you could just talk about the 28% there and the decel on an easier comp, and whether there's any particular factors within that we should be thinking about, and perhaps if there was any weather and apparel impact there. And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit, and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past. Does that statement and thought still hold as you head into '16?",109
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2829.0,956000.0,40602590.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,37,"Sure. Let me start with EGM. So EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the highest in the last 4 years. So we're happy with that. The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate -- revenue growth rate. So sequentially, last year, in the North America EGM, we dropped from 31% to 27%. This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a -- generally, a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly, very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, total customer satisfaction. Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments, as we've stated, across the globe. To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things -- businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns and are durable that can last for decades. We think Prime is that. We think Marketplace is that. We think AWS is that. And we're constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria. So -- but as we continue to invest, primarily in -- as I said, in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for Fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance, and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we're constantly looking for cost efficiencies in fixed and variable productivity. I think a thing to think about is the investments will ebb and flow over time, but our focus on cost reductions and improvement on customer experience will be constant.",310

I was wondering if you could give us a sense as we look at the slowing growth in AWS -- obviously, still from an incredibly, incredibly high level and still very strong growth there. But take -- try and take that into context with the growth in margins that you keep seeing in that business to levels that certainly seem a lot higher than you would anticipate for an Amazon business. Is there any capacity constraint or management that -- that's driving pricing strategy in AWS? We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business, and just trying to balance those -- think about how we should balance those 3 things.",133

Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have -- we just announced Korea as a region, and we'll be adding 5 more regions in the next -- in the future, in the near future, as we've mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures in -- particularly in AWS, and we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers. CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more, to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they're not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity in capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers' demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region. So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015. But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on a -- yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3. But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business. On a dollar basis, we continue to grow. We saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And again, we continue to invent. It's not all about price. We continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.",265

Obviously, you have a ramp-up into the holiday season, but was -- did December tail-off faster than you expected? Or did the ramp-up, did it spike higher than you expected? And then just on the follow-up, maybe can you add some context about how the mobile played a role in the holiday season for Amazon?",75

In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4. And if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue. So no real callouts there, I think. What was your second part of your question?
Oh, and mobile, we said for a long time, continues to be a tailwind for the business. We're working very hard to make sure that it's very easy for customers to buy the things they want to buy and access a lot of the features that they've grown accustomed to on the website. And so we're very focused on the convenience factor. And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now, that's available through a mobile app and very, very convenient for customers and, as Brian has mentioned, allowed them to shop even up to Christmas Eve and have their items delivered in 2 hours.",169

I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about purchasing and asset utilization, but do these explain the 800 bps-or-so year-on-year margin expansion? Are you seeing anything else? Like is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed cost? Is there some benefit from revenue mix shift, like services like Aurora and Redshift growing faster than EC2? Or is all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question. And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses or cost of revenues, to be more precise. Last year, you told us they were $1.3 billion, but you didn't give us a figure for '15. In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw a higher-than-usual cost for streaming content compared to the other quarters in the year?",144

So your question about the AWS margins, that business, as they continue to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive cost out of that business. And so that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you've seen in margin year-over-year. There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter-to-quarter.",128

So not around gross margins. And merely I was pointing out that, again, we've laid out all the invested areas where we're seeing heavy investment.

But generally, we're pretty transparent on where we're investing our dollars. And then, against that backdrop, we are always looking for efficiency.

First on guidance. We keep a pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance and how we value -- or how we estimate the near-term view of the business. I will point out that Q4 is obviously a very large quarter, the largest revenue quarter by far of the year. There's a lot of demand that comes in, in the last 6 weeks of the year as well. So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do the call. So we're using our best projections on a lot of fronts. We think it's a similar -- we know it's a consistent process.

On the category mix question, obviously, category mix does play a role in gross margin. I would say, though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before. The gross margins are impacted by first-party versus third-party mix as well as AWS mix if you're looking at the total for the company. So we're much, much more focused on the dollars.

We're really excited about the ecosystem and some of the new skills that are being added to Echo as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which is kind of the brains behind Echo. So we like our device business in general. As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost double the -- or doubled the -- what we did last year. So very excited about the devices. We like that they pump more energy into Prime and really the whole ecosystem. Not sure on the Internet of Things, but it's very exciting for devices standpoint. And the brains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so Echo gets new capabilities all the time as Alexa gets better and better. On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods. And so, this is one more really valuable, convenient service we can offer for our Prime customers.",214

First one, shipping costs were higher than we expected. I think it was 12.5% of net revenue versus 11% last year, I think. Just any color on the higher shipping cost. And is that percentage of net revenue a new normal as we are in 2016 now and as we look out? And then, the second question on Prime Now, in 25 markets globally. How should we think about the total number of markets that -- additional markets you can enter with the Prime Now offering in 2016?",90

Yes, as you say, net shipping margin was up 70 basis points year-over-year. Again, this is all tied in with the increase in FBA growth and the demand from Prime members. We're shipping more units -- more of our units, so this ripples through our ship cost per unit. And again, the calculation of ship cost is margin as a percent of revenue, and that is impacted by the denominator effect on the FBA sales net -- being booked at a net revenue.",84

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. 
Capital expenditures did not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligation. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million 1 year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29%, excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. 
Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined entitled Stock-based Compensation and Other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year. 
In the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion or 33%, excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.
Our operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. Operating income was $1.1 billion or 3.7% of revenue, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. This includes $50 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue compared to $706 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $475 million. Net income was $513 million or $1.07 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $57 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to $15.9 billion. Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion, and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 26% to $15 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 70 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
It's not possible to actually predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. 
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $375 million and $975 million compared with $464 million in second quarter 2015. This includes approximately $825 million for stock-based compensation and other operating expense net. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way that create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.",1003

But international retail revenue, the international regional segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. It seem like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was and how sustainable it is? And AWS, just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress?",92

Your first question on international, yes, all 3 segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% for FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in 3.5 years. I would attribute it to the Prime flywheel. As I may have mentioned in the past, so the Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% of that was -- 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally. So certainly a lot going on in the international, a lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So you'll see device -- you see devices, you see video content. So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day, everything is in Europe. It's maybe getting there a little slower than starting point in the U.S., but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases. On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside. So I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast it obviously by segment.",224

And if we look back over the last 3 quarters, you've accelerated it now to materially higher level than what we saw in '14 and the first half of '15. And I realize in 3Q last year, you had Prime Day. But I was just hoping you could comment on kind of the overall acceleration we've seen here and the key drivers behind that, and if there's something different perhaps than what you talked about on the international. And then just also on AWS, can you just talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward, kind of primary sources of leveraging? As you open up 6 new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be kind of constant build-out or something that's kind of more lumpy over time and more in waves?",154

So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver for revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth. That's been a big area of focus for us. And one important way we drive selection is through FBA. And so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from. Obviously, that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here. So selection growth and Prime though are our 2 very key drivers of our growth. On the second part, Brian?",164

Because of the leap year, there's an extra day in Q1. Every company would have seen this obviously, but we'd estimate it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate in revenue. That would be consistent North America and international. Your other comment was -- or question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with the quarter. We came in at 23.5% operating margin on a -- the new basis, including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased -- stepping back, the 64% growth in AWS, which is now a $10 billion business. But on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased, but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business. They'll be bumpy over time. At any point in time, they're going to reflect the balance of investing, including global expansion talked about. Price reductions, we may offer and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver now in this business but also the North America and international segments.",200

Just curious if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number off, assuming we're reading it the right way. And then as you roll out on AWS, as you roll out the 6 new availability zones over the course of this year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have on the capacity at AWS?",86
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2728.0,966866.0,41042775.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,13,"So I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. So as we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So this quarter, we only gave the active customers with a pay purchase in the trailing 12 months. And so that number was more than 285 million. I think that's pretty similar to the trend that we've seen in that metric. Now in the past, sometimes, we had also given a total active customers count. And so that number for this quarter was 310 -- over 310 million. So that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth. But the trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both these numbers, but we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers as well. And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 available -- availability zones in 12 geographic regions. And we have 5 -- 11 more availability zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we build out the zones. Some of it already taking place. But I will also say that, by and large, the largest increases in capital leases is to support the growth of incremental usage of customers we have now in regions we have now. And you should expect to see us continue to invest and support this business for are very, very -- we have a leadership position. We intend to maintain it, and we're very excited about where we are.",278

The first one is on Prime. You have 2 straight years of around 50% Prime subscriber growth. Just curious about how you think about keys to driving Prime sub growth going forward and kind of the thought process behind the reported monthly Prime subscription. And the second one on logistics investments. There's been a lot about kind of truck investments, logistics investments. Any comment at all about kind of learnings and what you're seeing from some of the investments in your truck fleet and your own delivery network?",90
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2728.0,966866.0,41042778.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,16,"Yes, let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth last 2 years and earlier, obviously, on Prime growth numbers. I would say it's a combination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing -- tablets were sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year. Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever. 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are 5-star reviews. We've not only have the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab. So we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock. And of course, we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader. So that is important part of the story as is the digital content. You may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. We love the -- customers love the content, and we like the results we see particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime. So beyond the award that the content is winning and the success we're having with Amazon, particularly Amazon Originals, we feel that program's working. We're going to significantly increase our spend in that area. Some of that is in Q2. You'll see that more in the next few quarters. But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.",284

I'll jump in on the second part of your question. So for the trucks, it really it's trailers. The typical use case is running a leg between a fulfillment center and a sort center. So we're running enough volume there that we're using trucks already. We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers. We're actually still contracting out the truck part. And it gives us flexibility. We think the economics will make sense over time. Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with Air Transport Services Group, an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there and similar use case. It's products that are already boxed. And we think again this is activities we've been doing already, which means they grow at a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity, and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers, and we think it makes sense over the long term.",164

Two questions related to Prime overseas. Could you talk about the status of Prime in international markets? How far rolled out it is in most of your major markets? And then you talked about Prime flywheels, and you did last year, but it seems like those flywheels spun faster than you expected in the fourth quarter of last year that caused some kind of near-term expense issues for you. Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you? How do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year?",106

Let me -- this is Brian. Let me start with the second question first. It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue. It was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have. But as I mentioned, last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result. I think you'll see some of that dissipating now in Q1. So it's a Q4 issue. We learn from every Q4. This one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity.

On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the U.S. in 2005, followed that in 2007 with U.K., Germany, Japan and then other countries after. We have Prime in all of the countries where we have marketplaces, with the exception of Mexico, China and India. And Prime is really in varying stages in those countries. We have some kind of expedited shipping offer in all of them. Here in the U.S., we've been talking quite a bit about Prime Now. That's also in Italy and Japan and U.K. at this point and not others. Also varying levels of digital benefits as well. So generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers. We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in Germany and Japan. Music is not fully rolled out yet altogether. So that's where we are with Prime.",150

I think it's the first time since 1Q '11 that we see tech and content as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is this just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or is there something else going on? And if yes, what? And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you've made and are making. And you gave the examples of devices that you guys are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? And in other words, how do you think about the effect of the deceleration in Prime on the North America margin structure in the future?",145

Let me start with that second one. So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefit of the Prime program from music to video to 2-day shipping to same-day shipping to Prime Now. So I don't see that dissipating. And again, it remains the best deal in retail. So hopefully, everyone signs up for that. On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here. Particularly on the AWS side, we had -- we just quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter. We had 214 in Q1, up from 170 this first quarter of last year. So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number's 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.",171

Actually, I just returned from India, where I spent a week with our teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad. We're breaking ground on our new 10-acre campus there. So we are solidifying and increasing our investment in India on all fronts. I had a chance to see first-hand the level of invention going on with both customers and sellers: making deliveries to customers, seeing the I Have Space program we have with merchants. It's a very exciting time in India. And again, the invention is off the charts. We're inventing things in India that do not exist in other parts of the country -- or excuse me, parts of the world. And the team there is one of our best. You can see in some of the external commentary as well, for the second year in a row customers selected Amazon India as Amazon's most trusted online shopping brand. During the quarter, we rolled out a feature called Tatkal, which is a studio-on-wheels that we go to the sellers to help them sign up. We let them do registration, imaging, catalog, uploads and basic seller training. So we're taking it to the sellers, taking the business to the sellers. We've already reached sellers in 25 cities, and we're really helping them expand their business, not only within their home region throughout the whole country.",226

So on the op margin side, although there was improvement year-over-year, you're right this is still, on FX-neutral basis, negative. We have, as I said earlier, selection expansion, infrastructure investments to fulfillment network and AWS -- excuse me, that's not the international segment, fulfillment network and digital content. So we continue to build the underpinnings of the Prime program in our international countries. You also have to keep in mind that we're making large investments in India.

First, last fall at re:Invent, you guys disclosed that data management revenue was at a $1 billion run rate. So can you provide an update on that figure and maybe just talk about how much of AWS revenue today is outside of the storage and compute layers? And then the second question is on the AWS margin. So I think everybody is trying to learn more about the structural long-term margin, and it was down a tad quarter-on-quarter. So was that solely from FX impact or was there some seasonality of expenses? Any color on what's driving the AWS margin and how we should think about that over the longer term?",118

So again, we had margin expansion year-over-year that was quite significant from 12.4% to 23.5%. But again, it's very early in this business. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving. So quarter to quarter, it will vary. We are concerned at this point about capital efficiency, returning price to customers periodically with price reductions and adding feature sets for them to make business more valuable.",101

There were a few headwinds that looked like in gross margin in Q4. Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin.

So I don't have a forecast for you on content cost in isolation or really forward looks on besides of the guidance I've given you. But yes, the hits in the gross margin, content cost do show up there. I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin and again starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year, that is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again $10 billion -- excuse me, $10 billion business growing 64% is very -- we're very pleased with that and that affects gross margin as well. The other bigger element though is the third-party contribution. Third-party units are now up to 48% of paid units. That's up 400 basis points year-over-year. So that continues to be a factor in gross margin. Again, we book that on a net basis, the third-party revenue. It's a positive factor in gross margin and can be a negative factor in fulfillment cost and some of the other metrics.",173

So will you help tie this to perhaps overall usage growth at AWS or maybe changing nature of how your enterprise customers may be using the platform to be more queue versus storage or database heavy. And I think historically on the e-commerce side you guys have been price followers as opposed to price leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part proactively taking down price. Now but now given your leadership position, do you think you'll continue to be price leaders or do you think it's now time to follow that thing?",109

So we like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they're both essentially our level investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year. I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much as year-over-year this quarter. But we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth and unit growth in FBA and global expansion and then also on AWS additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also in new regions. We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. It's very important to us. And I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency and better purchasing across all capital and capital lease, quite frankly. But again, we are spending almost $10 billion so...",185

Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we continue to see really strong usage growth. We're not in the business of raising prices. We lower prices for AWS. So there can be mix for products but, by and large, if you see our revenue growth, we're also lowering prices, which means that my math, we're typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate.

So the North American EGM segment outperformed our expectations of growth accelerating on a year-over-year basis. So given you don't break out GMV by vertical within the EGM segment and just given the strong growth at massive scale, can you cite any key verticals that were particularly strong?

I'll take the EGM question first. So just to put numbers on that, the year-over-year in the U.S. or North America was 32% growth, which was up from 28% in Q4. And there's not any single categories we're calling out there. To grow on a base that big that kind of rate, you really need pretty strong performance across the board. So a lot of categories are selling a lot, and it's a lot of drivers we talked about.

First, the point of clarification. The answer to previous question by saying that you will significantly increase investment in Prime, was that in reference specifically to video? Or should we expect new types of offerings beyond video and music? And then secondly on Prime, membership is likely hitting some saturation levels for certain demographics in the U.S. Do you intend to focus on more lower-income households for growth there?

Yes, my comment on Prime benefits was essentially one about video content and our investment there. I'm not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we are focusing on and that I called out. On the comment about Prime, I guess what I will call availability or saturation, yes, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan. We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way if that's how they choose. We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people or there's hesitancy to put up full year's payment for Europe Prime. Annual is still going to be a better deal, but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan. And that's what we're looking for. We know that once customers try, generally, they'll really like it. So we think that'll approach some other demographic groups as well.",174

Another comment on Prime. On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better. I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways, and we continue to add content, we continue to add selection. Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist 2 years ago. So all these things are making the program better, and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible. We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important to the company. Your question on China, part of the biggest thing to is more progress in selection on the Amazon Global Store. So this is our website -- this is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese language pages. So it's focused on really items that may be hard to get. And Amazon is really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods. And so really that's a big part of the focus.

I think when you see the growth rate of the segment, the 27%, it's showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things with it. We can -- on the cost side, we run our facilities more efficiently and buy better. We can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for. So there's a number of things that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But principally, what we're trying to do now is again make the Prime experience as strong as possible for customers.",110

Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 42% to $12.7 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $7.3 billion, up from $4.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.9 billion, up from $2.4 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $2.5 billion, up from an outflow of $492 million. Worldwide revenue increased 31% to $30.4 billion, or 30%, excluding the $166 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 28%. Worldwide seller units represented 49% of paid units.
Now I'll talk about our segment result. North America revenue grew 28% to $17.7 billion. North America operating income was $702 million, a 4% operating margin compared with $348 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International revenue grew 30% to $9.8 billion. Excluding the $184 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. International operating loss was $135 million compared with a loss of $189 million in the prior year. This includes $40 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Amazon Web Services revenue grew 58%, to $2.9 billion. Amazon Web Services operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year. Our operating income was $1.3 billion or 4.2% of revenue, up approximately 220 basis points year-over-year. This includes $45 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Net income was $857 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared with a net income of $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. For Q3 2016, we expect net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion, or growth of between 22% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income to be between $50 million and $650 million compared with $406 million in the third quarter 2015. 
We're grateful to our customers and remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it back to Darin.",390

Before we move to questions, I need to remind you that our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to midterm on your CapEx, depreciation, and ultimately, CSOI, especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just kind of a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance?",80

Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion, or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results, and I can talk more about that later, but Prime Day was very successful for us. It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year and it was also a record day for Amazon devices as well, sellers and customers alike. In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is typically a low -- lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched 6 in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first 3 quarters of last year on a net basis. So why we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. We had customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight in capacity. This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we're -- Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by -- units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, or 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year trended at 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year. So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there is a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 -- excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We're also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015. We have a great slate of new Amazon originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon original shows -- TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I point to India and AWS, but primarily the 2 biggest issues in Q3 guidance, I would say, are the operational ramp and also the increase in the digital content spend.",491

And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter?

So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on an order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices. It was a great day for small businesses and sellers, who saw great year-over-year improvement in their sales, and more importantly, it's a great day for customers globally. They saved over double what they'd saved on Prime Day 2015. So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.",142

So I will point out, Prime Now is now in more than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter, we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program -- again, offering free 2-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. We also have in the same vein of, I think, what you called, maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded, now we've added 11 metro areas to bring the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day. So yes, we think this is a important part of our Prime offering. We know customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now and we're very happy with it. Of course, we do always talk about -- we always, usually get asked about profitability, and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it, and we are in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.",193

But we would appreciate sort of any direction you can share on how to think about that.",71

Now the -- we don't give -- obviously, we don't give segment-based guidance, but to your question about AWS, we actually see 9 availability zones in 4 regions coming out in the next -- in the coming year. The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions. So we don't see a large step up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself. We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think, when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps, and we also open up to new customers when we add these regions. So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base.",188

As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last 2 quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course, this is reflected in the AWS margins. Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh? Now what's different between them? And how is it that -- now you are deploying Fresh in new markets, but not as fast as Prime Now and what drives the difference?",129
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2566.0,1018169.0,42894215.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,23,"Sure. On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure costs to run it, of both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site. We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving costs out of our acquisition prices. So there is a lot of great work going on there. I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we are happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins. On Prime Now versus Fresh, the -- they are separate -- sorry. The -- we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as 2 new sites in London for AmazonFresh and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for 7 years -- excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle, and what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America, and more so, we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding ZIP Codes, adding additional customers. So the move into Boston and also now to London gives us some really good data points. And as -- it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering. Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. It has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of 1-hour and 2-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So they have different roles. Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.",321

And then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin expansion we've seen in the first half of this year? Is it utilization, product mix? What's been driving the margin expansion?",95

Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Aleksei, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo, a lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from -- orders through Echo. On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this was primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a certainly a mix of products and services. I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and that's what you're seeing, but we're very happy with the year-over-year improvement.",161

I remember last quarter, you called out really starting to see kind of critical mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA and international markets. Is that what's continuing, I assume, to kind of drive that reacceleration in any geographic country? Comments behind that?",81

Yes, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really the flywheel; Prime is definitely working. It's as simple as that. The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international. We are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits. We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice versa. FBA is bringing more Prime -- multiple selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great attraction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we are seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally.",169

Brian, your operating income has been coming in stronger than expectations, but more importantly, stronger than your own guidance, at least in the last couple of quarters. I was just wondering as you look back at where you guided relative to actual, where do you think that delta was most pronounced? Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit? And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e. expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner. Is that still the plan? Or are you guys interested in maybe, instead of moving into few countries, kind of expand globally in one fell swoop?",134
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2566.0,1018169.0,42894224.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,32,"Sure. Let me start with the second question first. So on Prime Video, again, we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know that customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in second half of the year versus the last year second half, and we're tripling the Amazon originals content. That originals content, for TVs and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, both local content and also Amazon originals. So stay tuned for that, I don't have any more to announce on that today. On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came into the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high-volume, as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit, essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance. But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about levels of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content. So we continue to invest on behalf of customers, but we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have. So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right -- in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers and also driving efficiencies. And there can be timing -- quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly, continued to expand.",344

Just on the AWS side, we've been hearing a lot of talk and especially lot of media reports that larger customers tend to use AWS, they might use Google and Microsoft Azure in tandem in sort of a multi-cloud kind of architecture. Just wondering your thoughts on how you see AWS fitting in the overall ecosystem and kind of your place longer-term in the ecosystem?",73

Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for 3 factors: the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the table; our partner and customer ecosystem; and our experience. We've been in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there are room -- there's plenty of room for multiple winners in this business. What we focus on is innovating on behalf of customers and expanding the geographic footprint to make our services more widely available. You can see us continuing to invest in things like new application services higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continue to add functionality for data, analytics, mobile, Internet of Things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers. And I would say, the rapid pace of innovation continues to stretch our lead in that dimension. We have had 422 new significant services and features added in the first half of this year -- that's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features. So we feel good about the business, the position we're in and our position with customers.",211

First on EGM. I will just say, the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate and also grew 36% internationally. So when Prime customer -- when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in strong quantities. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime program. On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No -- the answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings on the transportation side, and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods. The plane deal that we were talking about is essentially planes that we're going to be leasing from other companies and you'll hear more about that as we go forward, but that is to essentially take on the demand for internal flights that we -- as we move product around -- certainly will be well utilized.",191

Or are those costs still relatively consistent? And also, we noticed some device sellout in the next 4 to 5 weeks post Prime Day. Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or did volumes take you by surprise here?",69

So I would just say, Prime Day had a enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had, and essentially, across all -- pretty much across all of our device types, e-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. And I'm sorry, your first question was around the cost of fulfillment centers. Not disclosing that -- the -- we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times, and we continue to learn and grow there. So no general trends I can point to on cost for fulfillment center to start up, but because they do vary in size and mission and some are -- have fully outfitted in using Amazon robotics, others -- some don't for economic reasons, maybe the volume's not perfect for robot volume. But yes, I can't give you any real distinct trends there.",172

We have talked about growth, certainly, globally and in North America. What I can tell you there is, we still think there's a lot of room in Prime, a lot of -- we have tailored programs to students, we've tailored video programs, we've rolled out monthly plans. We have plans related with grocery deliveries, so there's a lot of different flavors of Prime, and we are aggressively looking for a perfect Prime for everybody. We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it, so it's really just about getting them to try Prime and continuing to deliver great Prime benefits and great low prices and selection.",120

First is a follow-up on the logistics topic. So in addition to the cargo planes you just mentioned for -- in-network moving products around, you guys have registered and received a U.S. Maritime license to operate as a freight forwarder, and you recently announced this partnership with the U.K. for drone delivery that you've been working on for a couple of years. So I guess at a high level, can you just talk about how the overall logistic strategy is evolving from trucks and fulfillment centers to incorporate some of these new methods and how that might impact your unit costs going forward? And then the second question is on AWS, so you continue to post really strong results, and you guys obviously talk to a lot of customers across lots of different verticals. Just a high level, what percent of enterprise workloads do you think have shifted to the public cloud at this stage? Is it low single digits or mid-single digits? And any color there on where we are in terms of penetration in the space?",182

Let me -- this is Darin. Let me take that first question. On Prime Air in the U.K., we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers. And we're extremely happy to partner with the U.K. government to advance the safe use of drones for small parcel delivery. This is providing us with permission to trial new methods in this space, including beyond line-of-sight operation, sensing and BYOD technologies and flights where one person operates multiple drones. So we definitely appreciate the pragmatic and forward-looking approach on this topic with the U.K, and we're going to continue to work with regulators and policymakers in many countries, including the U.S., so we're excited about there. As for the ocean-going licenses, we have no comment on that today.",156

We like our position, our industry-leading position in the cloud space, and we're working on things that would incent more and more customers to accelerate their cloud conversion, the lower prices and services that we offer.

On the clarification, I appreciate the disclosure on content and how that will double year-on-year in the second half. For purposes of just making sure we sort of can understand the trajectory, is there any way to frame it within second half of this year versus first half of this year just so we can sort of try to triangulate on a gross margin basis from the content spend?

I'll take the second question on China. So we continued to operate well in China. We see China as a -- and the way we're approaching China as a way to -- a trusted avenue for our Chinese customers to access authentic international brands, and we'll focus on those global brands and bringing those to Chinese customers. Offerings like the Amazon global store, where Chinese customers can access those international brands on the China website and have them ship directly to their houses is something we're focused on.

You called out India was -- you had the most visited e-commerce site as well as the most downloaded mobile app, and you also launched Prime. So maybe you can just talk about the opportunities and the challenges that you're seeing in that market. And second, there was some press reports that you invested about $500 million of incremental capital in Italy.

So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers at the third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free 1-day and 2-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content. We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships. Recently, we've got partnerships with Motorola, Samsung, Lenovo on select phones. But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonians who have been very inventive in India. Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the U.S. or another major business, they'll invent around it, whether it's shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different. So we're looking forward to seeing what we can do on behalf of the Indian customer.",237

Since opening Italy in 2010, we've invested over EUR 450 million and created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add a future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets.

Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. 
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which are posted in our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and; cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investment, restructurings or legal settlement. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Yes, specifically to international, we are seeing expansion -- to support selection expansion and fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, Fresh location, Prime Now.

Eugene Munster,,Analysts,6,"I guess when we think about progression in margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flatlining of overall margin at this point excluding AWS, should we think about this as being a temporary kind of plateau, that at some point, resume once you start leveraging your fulfillment build-out? Or is there something structurally or philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business?",72
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2115.0,1065586.0,44658504.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,7,"Yes, thanks, Gene. Well, we'll continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. And the things that I'm not allowed to mention fall into that category. But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus last -- second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter. First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year and continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter, in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers, and we've added 5 more in October. For the year, we'll add 26. Most of those are in North America, but that compares to 14 last year. And I would look -- looking back, there's a -- the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012, when we added 11 in the third quarter. So it was a rare aggregation of start-ups in Q3 and Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes because paid unit growth continues to be strong, and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship with FBA, is significantly higher than even that. So we are continuing to build for high AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA. The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year. Last year, we increased square footage by just under 20%. The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers. So it's pretty much our -- and customer service. So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operations. So those will dissipate as we -- as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial start-up costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable costs as we train workers and also bring in inventory. And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the start-up of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. And they're inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings. So there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017. So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is the step-up in investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa, which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service at rapid growth in that business.",458

The first one, just to go back, Brian, the fulfillment build, past you talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiency. So with these new FCs opening, can you just talk about it? If you become more efficient, so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage? Or should we still kind of think about it's going to take time to get up to peak efficiency? Then the second one, AWS, Amazon as a company is very good at removing friction in the purchase process. Can you just talk about some of the main hurdles you still have to overcome for large enterprises to really start using AWS more?",127

So on the fulfillment network, as we build it, yes, they will be more productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018. So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs at Q3 and even into Q4 this year as we build that space -- the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program. The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. And then, that's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime then -- Prime's success attracts more sellers. So we're delighted to have that problem. We're just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond.",155

On the AWS question, yes, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers. In addition to the technologies that make integrations easier, it helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS. We're going to continue to do that. Specifically, things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases to -- or from on-premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime. And also, many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS scheme and conversion tool which really switches database engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and on to AWS. And so we'll continue to react to customer needs, and that will include opening up new regions. We've opened up Ohio this past quarter, and we've highlighted that we'll have another -- a number of regions coming online in a few months. So yes, we're doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.",178

Thanks, Mark. I will start with Fresh and groceries in general. So yes, this quarter, we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago. We also launched a new pricing plan, which is the monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. And we've expanded, as you know, previously into London. We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time, where we're continuing to add ZIP codes and additional neighborhoods, and also these new cities. Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after. Similarly, but not exactly the same as the Prime Now business, which has a similar overlap on things besides groceries. It's a slightly different model, obviously, where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in 1 to 2 hours. But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items. And that is now up to 40 cities across 7 countries versus 17 this time last year. We're also adding restaurant, Amazon restaurant delivery, to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. And that's up from 2 last year. So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers. And we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs. So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh. And we've now expanded quite a bit, as we've seen this year. And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously, the economics in that business are even tougher. But we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of our -- the geographic footprint and how close we are to customers.",310

In some cases, you amortize over time. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of the recent step-up is kind of being expensed? Particularly, looking at COGS as percent of retail revenues, which was up year-on-year for the first time in quite a while, how much of that was because of content that was expensed in the period? Just trying to kind of better understand that. I think also, you've been changing routing, and this is happening here shortly FBA pricing, including increasing your storage fees but also reducing your handling fees. I guess the question is, are these changes designed to just pass through kind of increasing shipping costs? Or is this more of a net neutral change, where really the goal is to try to free up capacity in some of your facilities?",161

So yes, we did make some changes to the pricing formula for this holiday season. They're essentially meant to incent the right behavior among sellers around holiday. And the biggest issue we're trying to get out is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in those -- in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year. So we are trying to incentivize that behavior. We're also trying to incentivize getting inventory into the warehouse quicker. So yes, there the formulas were -- the changes to the pricing formulas were really with that in mind, to help the flow and the space utilization in Q4.",128

On the capitalization point, I'd say the things we capitalized are the core buildings and leasehold improvements in the buildings. But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building. And I think that's what Brian is pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting our -- the profitability of second half. So yes, the capitalization is relatively small in terms of -- other than the building itself.",85

Maybe you can just remind us how many countries you're in with Prime Video, and whether there is a potential chance of maybe stripping Prime Video from Prime to allow it to be expanded to other countries? And then do you -- I know you're not guiding to 2017, but just looking at the capacity increase that you had for FCs for 2016, should we expect kind of that as an ongoing kind of expense going forward? Or is the current buildup enough to maybe give you some spare capacity to cool that down for 2017?",120

So first, on your video comment, we're in 4 countries right now, the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan, and we have stated that we will be in India soon. So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well. And the cost of that then gets amortized to those countries. It will be part of the international segment results. So yes, we consider that to be very valuable as opposed to -- versus licensing many times by country the third-party rights to content that we don't create ourselves. Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year. So we will do that obviously at the end of next quarter, but I would say we are -- this was an extraordinary step-up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units, but Amazon-fulfilled units. So really, our forecast for additional capacity additions and the rate of additions will be tied to those growth factors as well. So we'll have to see. We right now are working on getting the capacity in. It was very lumpy this time. It was 18 warehouses in 1 quarter and another 5 in the first 3 weeks of the next quarter. So -- obviously, we'll be working on the efficiencies in all the warehouses we have, including the ones we just started up this year.",250

Let me start with transportation. So yes, we are looking forward to a great holiday, and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally. We've worked very closely with them to line up capacity, share capacity plans. We certainly have additional delivery capability of our own. But with all of our partners, we work well in advance of the holiday to get our plans in place. We feel very confident. We're looking forward to a good holiday not only for customers but also for sellers. On your question on AWS, I didn't listen to the Google call, but -- you'll have to fill me in on that later. The thing I can tell you about pricing is that our pricing is -- price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So it's -- we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only do we lower the prices of our products, but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to. So they can also benefit from that as well. So if you step back and say, why do people choose AWS? I'll give you the points I said last quarter. Basically, what we hear are the functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We've added new, more new, significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722. We have a partner and customer ecosystem. You've heard about the VMware deal that we signed this quarter. So we continue to extend with partners and build ecosystems that better support our customers. And finally, experience. We've been in this business a long time, longer than anyone else. And we've used that time to make our products and services better. So there was going to be a lot of winners in this space, as we said, but we are very happy with our position and the customer reception to our products.",349

Yes, as far as the continuation of investment into next year, I cannot give you much color on that today. What I can tell you again is that we've ramped up considerably. We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so. We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year, particularly tied again to AWS -- excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend. So we will continue to invest in video content. We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes. We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience. Devices, we'll continue to invest in this, particularly Alexa and the Echo products. We'll continue to invest in getting faster and faster shipping methods for our consumers. We believe that's working. We're very happy with the results. We're very happy with the -- all the customers we have, but particularly the Prime customers that we have. As far as long-term operating margins, I can't forecast that right now. I can't forecast that for AWS business either. We are again working on 2 fronts. We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient and profitable as possible, while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line. We've said we want things that customers will love, that can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and durable and can last for decades. So that's still our mission.

But we have said investments are going to be lumpy. They are going to be high sometimes, and they'll be moderate at other times. We are -- right now, the second half of this year looks like a big step-up compared to the first half, and it is. But again, it's all areas that we will continue to invest in, some of which I just actually went through a laundry list. So I would not characterize it as a cycle. I would characterize it as continued investments.

It seems you're increasing your efforts on the auto vertical, with the recent launch of Amazon Vehicles. Just wondering if you could discuss some of dynamics of the auto industry that make it attractive and maybe how it aligns with the Prime value prop. I'm also wondering if you had any plans to work directly with auto shops, just given your ability to service most areas in 1 to 2 days. And then just the second question. On grocery, would you consider physical locations in an effort to kind of expand and/or accelerate growth in that vertical?",100

On vehicles, Amazon Vehicles is really a car research destination and was built for the automotive community for customers. It gets information they need when shopping for vehicles off-site or shopping for parts and accessories on-site. And the features include research tools, community engagement where you can talk to other customers. And certainly, we're trying to build a one-stop shop for vehicles, as an extension to the automotive store, which engages customers to add information about their cars and their garage, which makes it actually easier to shop for parts and accessories for your particular vehicle. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity there to add convenience for customers. On the B2B side, certainly, we do have the Amazon Business offering. Businesses of all shapes and sizes can sign up to be a B2B customer. And the selection that we have in our parts and automotive categories are certainly open to that channel. But I wouldn't speculate on anything we might do in a particular vertical for those Business customers.",175

And your comment -- your question on grocery and physical stores, I can't comment on any rumors and speculations there might be regarding that. But I will tell you is we have experimented with physical stores. As you may know, we have 3 physical bookstores, one in Seattle, one in San Diego and one in Portland; and 2 more coming, one in Boston and one in Chicago. And what we're finding is they're great places for customers to browse what ends up being a curated selection of books. And they also get to try out our devices, which is very beneficial. So they get to touch and try our e-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo. So we like what we see with that connection. And we also have pop-up stores that you may see and also college pickup points. So we will try different delivery methods or pickup points or ways of getting products to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now.",169

And are you seeing overall wage pressure in the fulfillment centers? And then separately, if you can just talk about trend lines you're seeing in paid units versus shipping units? Are they diverging meaningfully versus past?",61

Our challenge, generally, is the volume of headcount that we're looking to hire, and we work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees. And many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday. So nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, our headcount is up 38% year-over-year in Q3. And that is a continuation of a lot of ops roles that are supporting the site to man the opening of the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now. But also a lot of hiring in our tech areas, particularly around AWS and also the Echo, Alexa areas.",120

What's driving that growth? And what stage is India in today relative to some of the other large international markets that you've launched in the past?,43

So we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India, but it is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top-selling units on Amazon.in. And so it's very -- been well received by customers. It's hard to compare India to any other country. It's very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative. The team there in India has been very creative on whenever they find a roadblock or something that does not exist in another country, they create it themselves. Whether that's delivering stations to working with small merchants to -- you name it. So we're very happy with both of the customer engagement that we're seeing and also the seller engagement, which is very important in India, and very pleased with the team that runs it over there and the way they work with teams throughout the world.",176

I will -- so paid units grew at 28% again this year, as it did in prior quarters. And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN units, our Amazon-Fulfilled units, which include our first-party units as well as FBA units that go through our warehouses, are continuing -- are certainly higher than that 28%. And that's a result of the traction we're getting with our FBA subs.
So thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",130
