Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",426

That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?",87
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1994.0,1379289.0,55129737.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,4,"Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company. I'll note where the North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses are busy. So it was a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you'll remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off a similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offerings more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America. Although not in the North America segment, I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say it was the -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also a very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years. And this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.",309

Are there things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also how you would think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year?",59
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1994.0,1379289.0,55129740.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,7,"Sure. I -- we'll be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're at a $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- or, excuse me, $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with the -- both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response. We'll continue geographic expansion and continuing to, again, build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us, both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales. We had very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner -- partners we work with. The skills layer, we've increased rapidly. We're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000-plus smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands. So the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of Prime -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously, Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets. And we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things I would point to. And that is an area, again, where we'll continue to invest heavily and as you say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially to fuel strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate, we expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call, we do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the video content, their use of it on devices. And we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'll be release -- yes, I'll incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.",464

AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what were the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now as -- is that -- what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?",122
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1994.0,1379289.0,55129743.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,10,"Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So yes, we consider that a very strong quarter, down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that ship free. We're now over 100 million items in the U.S. So yes, shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model. And we, at the same time, look to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area. AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end, so it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth. Usage growth continues to be strong, growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate and customers continue to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost there -- excuse me, a price decrease last year, but very happy with the performance in -- of the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.",256

Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case, at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15 and previously.",97

Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4, obviously, but a lot of the costs remain from the year-over-year buildup in costs, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's -- given the 30%-plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's one major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. Those are probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.",146

Just on the second piece on just pricing. I think in the pricing environment, I mean, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS. I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business. We reduced prices more than 60 times with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal and philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers. And some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and feature launches better options for a customer that present -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.",128

And then just second on the advertising business. In particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, the headline search ads, sponsored product ads. Do you aim for a certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on user's activity, maybe a combination of both?

I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt the new standard on January 1 of this year, 2018. You'll see that reflect in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue. In terms of in the aggregate and the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter, it's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impact to this, but again, not material in the aggregate.",136

We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers.

First, Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how you're thinking about that? And then secondly, international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there. And we know that you spend about $3 billion international investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high watermark is on that? So just maybe a little bit more color on your international business.",104
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2018",2018-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1994.0,1379289.0,55129754.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,21,"Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together in our physical stores. If you look at our supplemental disclosure, the physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website. And the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program. And we expect to have more on that later in the year. We've also added Lockers and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life. And a lot of that is forward front-loaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years and then it reverses later. So excluding these noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q4 -- 3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales. Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in international countries as well. And also in that number is India. And India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing. Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon. Amazon Family is there. As I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth.",528

The first one, in the press release, you talk about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one, Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business. Curious to hear about investment needed to go into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked into as hard yet.",132

Thanks for the question, Brian. Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups for memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which is -- continues to be a fast grower for us.",193

And on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I'd say logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability, both the -- and that will be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering it ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. We continue -- I would say on the category side, the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition. And again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base. To a lesser extent, versus grocery, I would say, we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies and universities that we've been working with and their initial results.",227

I'm not -- let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say, Whole Foods has not lessened their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We've made no changes post the acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in-stock, except perhaps the fact that price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issues that may be getting press are tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues. But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to. And also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it'll be something that we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers.",212

Could you speak to your private-label strategy in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the margins in that segment versus comparable third-party products?",57

Thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection. And we look for ways to be able to find private-label items that have a high caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing to customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that we offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years in some cases. Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands. Some of the more sort of popular lines with customers have been things like Goodthreads, Amazon Essentials, which is men's and women's basics. Consumables is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and Wickedly Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly, there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there. And so we'll keep adding selection.",294

We see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we as -- depending on a position in the company. On the consumer side, the use of AWS has driven great infrastructure efficiencies, just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed cost into variable cost and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as a internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.",194

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. 
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",322

And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of '17 and into 2018, broadly, for the platform?",53

I would say, advertising continues to be a bright spot, both from a product standpoint, and also, financially. It was -- continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the -- in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So we -- our philosophy there, again, is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise, and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers, generally, are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers, generally, to drive brand awareness, discovery, and eventually, purchase. Before I go on to the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years, actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and 1-day options. And our 2-day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits, like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high. As we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119, for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.",346

And Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, I just want to remind folks that we've mentioned this last quarter on the call, but on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services are classified as revenue, rather than a reduction of costs to sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is the other revenue was, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter, again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is -- would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line items, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content and certain digital media content, are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then, the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex FX year-over-year. Prime members are -- Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognized this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year's subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.",332

As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one, on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities. What can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S., and hopefully, New York soon?",156
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1951.0,1441411.0,57353529.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,8,"Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime -- those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what'll -- what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.",198

The accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?",118

So first, with the -- you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure, but the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel, so we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital and benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple, Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So not much more I can add by product line to North America. Now I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're -- we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last 2 quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're seeing is just continued strong usage, both by existing customers and signing new customers for -- see an increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workloads to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as Aurora continues to grow at a very rapid clip. So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't, and we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to AWS customer base.",293

I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier, with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue?",162

On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised or other revenue, rather, that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%, but again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.",76

If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment and warehouses. So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we've combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we -- against bigger and bigger products. That -- it's a representative number for that period. On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months. So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So there's a couple of things at play there that, hopefully, keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.",211

Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top line growth was -- continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend than we've seen recently. So customer adoption in AWS remained strong. And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on -- with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given our -- the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers, and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially. We -- at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high -- relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilizations. We were still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without handling -- without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see to reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably was a differential versus the guidance estimate. And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers. We'll have some cost in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So -- and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1, and then, the income that, that drove.",402

That $239 million in other income, what was that? And then, could you just wax a little bit, eloquently, hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what our -- what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high-profit, high-margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that. And then, finally, as part of advertising, you've got, also, a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow -- that you don't directly charge for. How do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity?",143
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2018",2018-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1951.0,1441411.0,57353542.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,21,"Sure. Let me wax eloquently, try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million, that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we've partnered with. We have transportation companies that we've partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of those companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with -- on investments. It's also -- there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive. On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So when we show sponsored products, we're trying to show people things that they had -- maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then, we want to let sellers, for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully, purchase. So we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing the helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that we will come down on the side of the customer. On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose to not do that right now.",311

The only thing I'd add too on that, just related to Prime Video. As you may have seen the announcement earlier today, about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. We've done some things like the Prime Original Series, All or Nothing, the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was one of our first forays in the live format that -- one of the first forays in the live format where we had live ads and kind of not only learning the technology, but learning to -- learning that business. And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far, obviously, and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.",159

First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries, you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could you talk a little bit about dependency there? And then, secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states, and just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales -- taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass?",116

Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are, but we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics, it's driven the creation of sort centers, it's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the U.K. It helps with, again, Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again, we've mentioned that Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that.",174

Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3P piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in 2 states, Washington State as of the first of this year and then, Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1. So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party pieces coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So nothing really more to add on that. I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitutionally-permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.",169

We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer, as I mentioned earlier, creation of -- or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera. So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefit it's delivering. I mentioned that 4 years ago, when we last increased the price of Prime, if you get 20 million products within 2 days, today you can get over 100 million products within 2 days, and many, many, many, products within 1 day, same day, or 2 hours. So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014.

Yes, I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is, that international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America. So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So they have different dynamics. We think, at the end of the day, customers behave the same globally, and that they value low prices, selection and great customer experience. So we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices. And sorry, I cut out the last person
[Audio Gap] 
including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with -- in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access, over time, Amazon products better. We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers, and also, customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India, grew faster than any Prime -- excuse me, any Prime program we had seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India -- video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime benefits. We are rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa's up -- as you saw the press release, to [ 40,000 ]

As you listen today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",321

Thanks, Justin. Yes, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had, what I attribute it to is continued strength in some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere, we saw probably better-than-expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs and generally all of our fixed costs. You'll note that in the first half of the year, capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months. In the last 6 months, it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers, run our data centers more efficiently even to meet, again, increasing usage by our customers, usage rates that are exceeding our growth rate. So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in international segment than it is in North America. It's growing at the same rapid clip year-over-year. Even while in international, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas. We continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies. We continue to launch new countries. We launched Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries. Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued -- it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.",275

Hey, maybe 2 things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth. I think it was 17%. Any particular things to call out there that would have stunted that growth or negatively limit it? Or is that just kind of a new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry. You just talk better-than-expected efficiencies in operations. Can I ask you to tease that out a little bit more and a little more color, particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particularly newfound efficiencies that are sustainable?",92
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1899.0,1511734.0,59787616.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,7,"Sure. Let's start with the unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2 with 27% sort of comping against that. As we look back on that, there were a number of factors. I mean, in any quarter, there can be product mix or ASP differentials would shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver shipping threshold twice in early part of last year from $49 to $35 and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw a last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just -- the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by, again, Prime -- the Prime program, the efficiency -- or excuse me, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection and particularly third-party selection. On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure, cost and capital cost and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that we've grown -- that we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed headcount, excluding acquisitions. We've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June on a trailing 12-month basis. But the 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing headcount. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by headcount that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech headcount. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it's certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year can be a good test of where our cost structure is coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed headcount, that may be made that less pronounced. But this year, it's a little more apparent.",434

On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into the holiday. But if you think back the last 2 years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth both in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years. But we don't have a number for you today. I will say that the majority of it is being put in service in the back end of the year, just like in the last 2 years. But we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course, hasn't closed yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that working together with them, we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly differentiated customer experience and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.",243

Let me start with AWS. Yes, we're very happy with the results we're seeing and the backlog that we see and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. Again, the businesses accelerated in the last 3 quarters, and we're seeing great signs in a number of areas. We've added 800 new services and features so far this year. That's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS data migration service -- excuse me, Database Migration Service. And customers are just branching out to a lot of new products from us. There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things. Serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So we think that when you look at it, why do people come to us essentially? It's that functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer ecosystem. And frankly, we're the most proven in reliability, security and performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else. So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. A very strong performance this quarter, obviously. Part of that was in the capital expenditures -- excuse me, or capital leases being flat year-over-year and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency.",260

And I think we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think that's a lot of -- the focus now is really having good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead and getting those into customers' hands.",92

How successful you mentioned database, but what other areas are you potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow? And then you flagged the flat capital lease growth on a year-over-year basis. In the past, when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that infrastructure growth overall with more or less with the business. Is there some level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no longer the case? Or is it a function of timing? How should we think about what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for growth?",147
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2018",2018-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1899.0,1511734.0,59787626.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,17,"Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of a very tight period where we -- we're still adding a lot. I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases. But the rate of growth over last year was flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it. Sometimes it is higher than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be that usage growth would be very -- that our growth in infrastructure cost would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate. But we can do -- we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. So it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would say last year, in the first half, was a pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures. But in the first 2 quarters, Q1 of last year was 82% growth year-over-year in capital expenditures. Q2 was 67%. This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1 and 1% in Q2. So there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability and also in our warehouse networks. I don't have, on the other piece, on the product detail, I don't have anything more for you. I would just say that our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us. And many of them have gone -- a large number have gone all-in on AWS and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. I would count Amazon in that category because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources.",346

And then I know you guys are always focused on removing customer friction points and solving pain points for customers. Maybe talk to us about some of the still existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address with the advertising product. And the second one, I know it's an accounting question, but we're going to be asked a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in the current quarter because of the multiple accounting moving pieces?",129

So conceptually, stepping back, it's now a multibillion-dollar business for us. We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisings -- advertisers, and they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals, whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site. Pain points and improvements, I would say our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on automating the activities that the advertisers need to do and continue to invent new products for the advertisers. We also think measurement is going to be important, so we're focused on our measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.",183

Just on the accounting piece, specifically to Q2, the impact of the accounting standards update revenue recognition changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's $640 million increase to other revenue, specifically related to how we treat some of the advertising service. So you remember, as part of the adoption, beginning in 2018, certain of the advertising services were classified as revenue rather than cost of sales. So $640 million more is another revenue this second quarter. You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter. In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue. So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher but for that change.",165

On Whole Foods, any update on the integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in which you're tying those assets and customer bases together to sort of promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit? And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally and what you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt the service, putting SKUs closer to prem, what that does to the velocity of purchasing?",88

So it's a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched Prime for -- sorry, we launched Additional Savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. If you go a Whole Foods store or a Whole Foods market, 365 store, you'll see a lot of yellow stickers for 10% discount off hundreds of sales items. You'll also see deep discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted this benefit. It's one of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime Benefit, and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal favorites to, as I said, popular daily sales. So in addition, we've expanded the grocery delivery to 20 cities, so that's picking up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals with -- for Prime customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole Foods, and people had, again, the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership -- save incremental dollars because of it at Whole Foods. And the Prime Rewards Visa card, which gives you $5 -- excuse me 5% off on all purchases, has been applied to Whole Foods purchases as well. So that is the second wave. Probably after the first wave, when we've talked in previous calls about initial price drops, putting lockers in the stores, selling some of the Whole Foods products on the Amazon site and other things. So the invention level is still really high. We're -- we think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going. We'll see how that develops. Prime Now, I guess my comments are that it's in 50 cities worldwide. It's across 9 countries. The -- it is different than -- we have multiple options for you in grocery delivery. We have the delivery services, so AmazonFresh and Prime Now, which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now with Whole Foods. And then we have the combination of those 2 with home delivery and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through Prime Now to make those deliveries, as well as the new client stores with Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation -- invention on that front as well.",382

First is on the Music business. So I think you said recently you have tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime and using the mobile app? Or are they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptick and converting users into paid members? And then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin. If we look at international, it's still negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully. So can you parse where that improvement is coming from between India and the other emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western Europe?",120

So yes, we have seen, over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed headcount, operations cost, infrastructure cost and also things like marketing, working to be very efficient. I would also say that although it's smaller internationally, the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America. But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India, obviously, and have seen good traction there. We just passed our fifth year anniversary. We just celebrated our fifth year anniversary. And it's the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian customers, consumers and sellers, and that will continue. But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime Australia. We're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime Benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin. But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that on Prime Day, we're able to expand our list of countries that experienced Prime Day this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our international business. We do realize it's a period of investment, and we're at different stages of growth in different countries.",301

Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now, and the catalog, there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things. Of course, we started in Music with Prime Music a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited scale. One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see, as you probably imagine, for using those devices or just interacting with Alexa wherever you may be is being able to listen to music, so that's proven to be, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy, in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set. We now have more than 45,000 skills available to customers.",209

So right now, our emphasis is around expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network that's expanded, and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique brands. You're seeing things like expansion into the hotel space, where we're partnering with hotels to allow you to experience Alexa while you're traveling. And you saw from the quote that was in our press release that Jeff -- from Jeff, the number of Alexa-enabled devices has tripled in the past year, including some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota, to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also are developing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there.

Yes, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had 2 reductions on our super saver shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content -- not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited, in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you just the units, those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So yes, I would say, essentially with that backdrop, we're still very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers. On the consumer side, we have -- Amazon-fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime-eligible items available for free 2-day shipping for Prime members. And again, all -- a lot of -- when I'm talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest-growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising, are not caught in that metric.",223

So on a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at 2 things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May, so the full pick up on that year-over-year was in 2017, and now, we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year, they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple of factors that hit the international growth area, particularly. But I'll also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter, and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continuing to invest in Prime Benefits, international expansion, as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pick up. Story is different country-by-country, obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall, we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far, that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So a great first wave of the -- what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which leads into Diwali.",210

Let me start with Q3. And this will be a commentary pretty much on the whole year. That was especially true in Q4. So first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitably businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in 3 specific areas I'll call out. So first, on headcount. If you'll remember, we grew headcount 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%. But without Whole Foods, we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple of years. And as we funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas, as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of these roles. So we're only up 13% on headcount through 9 months year-over-year, so a real step-down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In the fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last 2 years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. It's -- we're making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN, or Amazon-Fulfilled Network units, that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year, we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one which is really significant is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business but also for our Amazon consumer businesses, which is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year at the end of the year. So those 3 areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that, again, we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.",428

Obviously, in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%. Still quite strong. But dollar and percentage growth did slow. And I'm just kind of curious, are you just reaching a point in terms of law of large numbers, where it will be more difficult to sustain, not only accelerating growth but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently?

This growth rate's going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the last prior 3 quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still, 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion, and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. So -- and let me mention, on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs.",104

The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration, maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to? Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious of your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies as you think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.",112
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2018",2018-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1869.0,1580659.0,62368722.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,17,"Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth. It includes an 80 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods -- it was purchased in August of last year, and that has impacted every quarter since then. Q4 will be -- the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them in Q2 of -- since Q2 of last year. So if you -- even factoring that in. We're looking at Q4 and -- we often have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our -- not only our revenue for the quarter but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity, not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. We'll just have to see how revenue comes in. I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may have -- remember it from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight-line method. Previously, we had done it on a -- it's tilted more to Q4, was based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call. This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is, to scale it for you, under the old methodology, we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has, again, been caught up for in prior quarters. But again, not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider. On the robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now -- continue to -- into our robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint.",481

Yes, I think we started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see, even in this quarter, we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities that's -- in the U.S. giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour, thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods. We've also expanded grocery pick up, and that's available in 10 cities, so the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can order -- you can build your cart using Alexa and then checkout using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omnichannel overlap, especially in the grocery business. On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. Amazon Go is now up to 6 stores. We opened 5 in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up an Amazon 4-star location in New York City, where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We, of course, have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer wherever they happen to be.",246

Any color on -- it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure? And then the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation in fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about that 15%? Is that not a good leading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it -- any color there would be helpful.",108

I think it's comparable to -- last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30% that -- plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether -- the dynamics of the warehouse are changing, so that square footage may not be the main indicator. It might be cubic feet, but we will -- if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the 2. But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence. And we negotiate hard, and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our shipping methods. So we don't see that as being a huge issue. On wages, of course, we did raise wages. And starting November 1, over 400 -- or excuse me, just under 400,000 employees, both full time and part time in the U.S. and the U.K., will be getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored -- I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance, and it will be, obviously, factored into the guidance into 2019.",227

This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact. Brian mentioned earlier that, of course, we've been talking about it all year, the changing in the subscription revenue recognition to now a straight line. So on a comp basis, you'd expect to see subscription revenue will be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. The other piece that we haven't talked about is the re-class that we've given in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.",112

And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth, and we're now up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third party, it's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rates, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor sequentially quarter-over-quarter as -- since it has a gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time.",123

As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we don't think -- we'll continue to invent both on the product side, the tools side, with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard and invent new products for advertisers.

I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or 2 in terms of new announcements and devices out there. And I mean, I think really looking at that, the goal is make customers lives easier and make it more convenient. And a lot of that is you're seeing that in homes, and to some extent, on the go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you've seen a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers. Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter -- just getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable, and introducing a lot of really cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.",210

Any color you can share there?",62

I mean, nothing specific. I mean, I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site, in particular, and how we position those. And so we spend a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful when customers are making those purchase decisions. And so we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback's that are out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.",134

Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development?,46

Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier in the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign-up data that we've seen since then. Program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement. And a lot of our video content, music and shipping, definitely, as well as other Prime Benefits, we just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S. but in other countries. So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I'd mentioned earlier the linkage with Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up groceries from Whole Foods, adding content. We have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here. Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs, and pretty soon, you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and also a couple other things. And hopefully, you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home.",198

Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean just a reminder, the way to look at this, our pricing philosophy is work relentlessly, take costs out of our own cost structure and, when we can, pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices. And that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS, to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices of 67x since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business for us. 
Thank you for your call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website at least through the end of the quarter. 
We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",172
