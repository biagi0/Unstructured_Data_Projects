Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2016 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlement. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
And just briefly before we move to questions, I'd like to address our Form 10-K that we'll be filing with the SEC. We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures. We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the company or our segments. 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",437

So just wondering if you could frame in order, if possible, the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins. And then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017?",60

Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well. We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximate -- excuse me, yes, on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact, which brings the non-FX adjusted rate down to -- excuse me, range down to 14% to 23%. I'll also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day leap year was worth 150 basis points to in our -- to us in our Q1 revenue. This year, that reverses, so we have a 150 basis point headwind to growth. That's been factored into our guidance range. But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you're seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up in investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step-up. We had 26 warehouses we added last year. 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content and marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in those 2 areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh. And of course, we're continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess I'd point out India, which continues to be a rather large investment for us.",260

I was just wondering if you can just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in '17 as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly. And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of as the aggregation tools that are being provided now, where some of the value is being perceived longer term? Is it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful.",122

Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look at on Prime Video is customer usage patterns. And in 2016, we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading. So we're happy with the engagement that customers have. We're also happy with the -- especially on the Studios side, the people we've been able to work with, some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we've created. We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers. I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last -- or excuse me, in Q4. And what we see there is again original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we'll be. But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries. And this takes us to over 200 more countries. So we're very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing, and that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.",224

Yes, we're very pleased with our FBA offering, and that's really helpful to sellers around the world. Certainly, our international sellers have access to more and more customers through that offering, and that doesn't exclude sellers in China as well. The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement. And we have a very, very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there as we continue to focus on great offerings through the AmazonGlobal store, which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there's a mix of things going on in China, and we're happy with what we're seeing in both of those.",122

But can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment, and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer term?

Let me start with India. So it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer, if you remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. So we've had Prime -- we've had success with Prime in every country we've been in. We don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We're bullish on India longer term. And it's early, but we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers.",139

On China, like I said, we're very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers.

Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third party, and within that, the growth in FBA, is having on these sequential growth rates? To the extent that there's a 150 basis point impact from leap year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that, that shift to third party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter or for what you've reported in the fourth? And then on the AWS side of the business, can you -- with the price cut in November, can you give us some sense of what impact the price cut had on the deceleration in growth compared to the impact that presumably it had in driving incremental volume to the platform?",139
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2313.0,1124300.0,46641972.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,17,"Sure, let me start with that second question first. So more basically on AWS, very happy with the response from customers. We feel we've got a very broad base of customers, from start-ups to small, medium businesses to large enterprises to the public sector. And we're continuing to see strong growth across all those sectors. The business is now $14 billion annualized. It's running at a $14 billion run rate. You are right that we had 7 price cuts in Q4, essentially timed for December 1. So about 1/3 of the impact was seen in Q4. But these are -- that's going to be constant in this business. We've been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts and then working on the operating efficiencies. So very pleased with Q4 and the pace of the business. The new services and features last year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so the -- excuse me, in 2015. So we continue to innovate on behalf of customers. We're working with some very large customers in each industry. You've seen probably press releases on companies like Capital One, Workday, Salesforce and others. So again, widespread usage and new customer adoption, which is great. Your second question on FBA, I can't break out the year-over-year difference there. What I will say the impact of FBA on our business is, and first, that's one of the things that we look at is how well are we attracting new FBA sellers? Because again, FBA reinforces Prime; Prime reinforces FBA. It's a good flywheel. And we added -- active sellers in FBA grew 70% year-over-year in 2016. So we're very happy with the continued adoption of FBA and what that does to Prime-eligible selection for Prime members. The other data point I'll give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon-fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year. And that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4. I'm giving you Q4 and a full year number, but they're similar in relative proportion. So the fulfillment center expenses and a lot of our shipping costs are tied to the increase in that FBA percentage and that growth of Amazon-fulfilled units. So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer standpoint, and it's one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to work on every day. But that's about -- I think that's the most I can give you on FBA at this point.",430

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2313.0,1124300.0,46641974.0,Question,Colin Sebastian,,Analysts,19,"Maybe as a quick follow-up on the quarter. We've heard from other e-commerce companies and retailers about a high degree of promotional activity during Q4. So I wonder if there was any conscious decision on your part to pull back from some of the more aggressive discounting. And then my other question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business. But also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or longer term, offer excess capacity or logistics as a service.",115
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2017",2017-02-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2313.0,1124300.0,46641975.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,20,"Sure, Colin. On your first question, holidays are always a very promotional period. So we don't see -- I can't really comment on the year-over-year differential in promotional activity to us. We are always looking to not be beat on price. We want to offer the best options to customers, and we saw a lot of great response from customers this holiday season. I think we'd be a very trusted holiday partner, particularly as you get closer to the holiday. So on the promotion side, I -- we don't consider it a huge factor either way. It's pretty much a cost of doing business 12 months a year for us. And sorry, the second question was on the hub in Kentucky. Yes, that is -- you saw the announcement on that. That is a partnership we have to build out a facility at the Hebron, Kentucky airport. We think it'll create thousands of jobs over time. What it does for us is it gives us a base for future growth. It's all about supplementing our existing capacity, both our partners and ourselves, and essentially building capacity that can handle this top line growth and also the growth in AFN or Amazon-Fulfilled Network units, which as I just mentioned, is even higher than our paid unit growth. So same as some of the investments you saw in airplanes last year, our partnerships with companies that do air cargo, this is about supplying our need for our customers and our sellers. We value the partnership with external -- the external providers as well. And I think we're all dealing with the good problem of having lots of incremental volume year-over-year.",278

For the last several quarters here, it's been accelerating on a year-on-year basis. And I think this quarter, 24% was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of '15. Just kind of curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters and what maybe changed this quarter? And then in terms of the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance.",95

So we factored it in, obviously, into the numbers I gave through guidance. The timing of it was, again, closer to December 1. So there'll be an incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we, again, have quite frequently. And I don't think it's a large factor in Q1. The bigger one is more mechanical, that leap day comp, I would say. And if you're looking on a non-FX-adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure, which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance.",101

On our unit growth, we're very happy with the 24% unit growth that we saw in Q4. Like you mentioned, our unit growth has been strong. It's primarily attributable to our Prime program and the customers and members that enjoy that program. As Brian mentioned, that 28% is only part of the story. Our Amazon-fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers, which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales, grew nearly 40% over 2016. So we're very pleased with those results and happy with the fundamentals of the business from that perspective. Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices; the vast selection, which is helped by the FBA sellers; and the strong convenience that we can offer through free 2-day shipping and a multitude of other faster shipping options such as same day, next day, and in some cases with Prime Now, the 1- to 2-hour delivery. So Prime membership and selection continues to drive growth, and you'll see that in our unit growth numbers.",176

On the first one, we have a long-standing practice of not commenting on regulatory or tax matters. So I am not going to comment on any proposed issues out there. We certainly keep an eye on external issues and weigh in when we think it's going to impact our business. But the -- sorry, your second question was on FCs. We will continue to invest in FCs. The comparable I'll give you is that -- I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by a 30% square footage increase in 2016. That generally went to service that 40% growth in units, in AFN units. So it also included some of the additional logistics delivery stations and all, too. So it's not all FC capacity, that square footage. But I would say that we're going to continue to invest in fulfillment centers as long as our AFN growth rate maintains high, and we certainly want to keep that high and growing.",171

Let me start with the Echo. So I don't think I'm going to answer your exact question there on quantifying the retail sales through Echo devices. It's still very early days on that, so that's not material. But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have. We do look at engagement, and we like the engagement of customers who have Echos. But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together. As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echos grew 9x year-over-year during the holiday period, so great customer adoption. We're really glad to see that, and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there. We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke to you in October. And we're dealing with – or working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities, too, for our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them. Tens of thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa, so the skills addition should continue. And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect. We're doing that ourselves. If you've seen in the quarter, we added Alexa capabilities to our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better. So they're a -- it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds the engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.",280

On the customer count, no absolute number to give this quarter. As you know, back in Q1, we gave an active customer count that exceeded 300 million. I can say it's still is growing and we're pleased with the number there. What we do like is the engagement with Prime. We continue to add Prime members, and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and, in particular, the Prime program. So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.",95

The first one is on the last mile, the logistics build. Can you help us at all on what you're seeing in some of these markets, like the U.K., where you have more of the last mile build-out done on your own? Is there anything you're seeing about Prime behavior? Kind of what are the advantages and even the challenges you're facing as you're building out the last mile? And then secondly on the brick-and-mortar stores, just any learnings, and strategically, just talk to the strategic advantage of having Amazon -- a bigger Amazon storefront.",98

Let me start with your first question. So as you point out, we've had Amazon logistics deliveries in the U.K. for more years than some of our other countries. And what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer. We can, again, shift order cutoff times out. And time is valuable to us because, again, we can avoid split shipments. We can avoid other costs of acceleration. And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us, especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network. But I've driven with drivers in downtown London, and it's a very interesting experience. I think it's a great value to our customers. It's interesting to see the route density that we see in high cities – or excuse me, in some cities, and the challenges and the upside of that. But I would say essentially in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge is always going to be cost. And as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time. So that's essentially my review of Amazon logistics. Sorry, your second question was on the stores, sorry. Yes, you probably noticed we launched the -- we opened the Amazon Go store in Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting. It's only 1 store at this time, but it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, deep learning. So it's a great accomplishment by that team. It's in beta right now, and we like the promise of that. Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon bookstores. We have 3 physical stores: Seattle, San Diego and Portland right now. We see adding 5 more this year. So we're still in that phase where we're testing and learning and getting better even on the bookstore. I would say there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop-up stores and college pickup points that we learn from as well and think can create great value, particularly the college pickup points. So not much projection beyond where we are today, except for the fact that we'll be adding more bookstores. But we test. We innovate. We think the bookstores, for instance, are a really great way for our customers to engage with our devices and see them touch and play with them and become fans. So we see a lot of value in that as well.",438

As we think about investment in the first quarter in 2017, any color how to think about domestic versus international? You did give some comments about India, but just any other color how to think about it? And then on AWS, you announced both new products at re:Invent at the low end and at the high end. Any commentary on if that impacted the types of customers who you've been adding on AWS with those new products?",79

I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year, most of those 26 warehouses we talked about. We see that being more balanced over time and being more global as we move forward. Video content is, with the new global program, global Prime Video, is becoming more global with the launch in India as well. So and of course, we had Prime Video in some of our existing countries prior to that. So that is going more global and will be more balanced. As we see devices roll out to other countries, same thing. So I would say over time, it will become more balanced. And probably what you've seen in the short run tended to be more North America-focused. But I can't give you a great split of -- I'm not giving you absolutes anyway, so I can't give you a great split of it, of the 2. And I will also say that we are -- not all of our investments are on the consumer side. AWS continues to expand our global footprint. Last year, we added regions in the U.K. and Canada. We now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions, and we'll continue to grow that business globally. So and India, again, we've mentioned, but that is obviously an international investment.",234

The multitude of launches that we had in re:Invent was great for all sizes of customers really, both large and small. Both companies starting -- just getting their start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years.

I'll take the advertising question. So yes, it's very early in the advertising space. But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that is a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience. I would say sponsored products is off to a great start. Finding it a very effective way for advertisers to reach interested customers. We also on video have not added much in the way of advertising yet, there's some pre-roll, as we call it. But for the most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times, and we like the team that's working on it.",128

These things include revenue from our cobranded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising. We have other types of advertising that's spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's kind of shared marketing investment from our vendors, which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, or it's related to other seller advertising, which is generally within the EGM and media categories. And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising.  And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that.",111

You said you're pleased with the hours of engagement. My question is, do you think that the hours of video stream need to accelerate from here to get to an adequate return on the invested capital in video? Or are you happy with those returns with the current levels of engagement? And then relatedly, on Prime Video, can you talk about your ambitions to potentially extend the video offering beyond on demand into possibly a virtual cable bundle? And then finally, just a question of do you need to aggressively partner with distributors, whether they be cable distributors or hardware device companies, in order to get better distribution of the Amazon Prime Instant Video app and content to your customers?",125

But I will say on, you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we're seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time. We're certainly spending ahead of the value of the engagement right now, but it's a good sign that it's building. And an important step was that global Prime program that we launched in the fall -- excuse me, in Q4. As I said, it's very much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. That fixed amount can go up or down, but it's the ability to amortize it over a large population is what we're looking for. So we see a double benefit of the global Prime video program, again, both to amortize the investment in original content, but also to show that original content to more and more people because we think it's done really well. We think it's won a lot of awards. And we've worked with some, again, some great talented people. And it's our ability to scale that and to amortize it over a much larger customer base, which will help us in the future.",201

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world event; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods.
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",495

Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that 9 months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced 18 Indian Original TV series, and we're customizing the content. So it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was -- the new version of it was launched in India with some important features there, such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for 3 months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So we're -- again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.",182

I can't quantify it, but -- or break out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we've seen in North America to other countries. We just opened up AmazonFresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business -- B2B business just opened up in the U.K. We have Amazon devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon-Fulfilled Network or the units we shipped are growing at much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year, we said that was a 40% -- nearly 40% growth worldwide, so we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.",212

The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not a big focus of you, the margins. I get that, but it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time and now they dip down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly, on these -- on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within household? Are you seeing that have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry, products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms?",153

Let me start with the Echo question first. So yes, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products, but the ability to use tablets -- our tablets now as Echo devices since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's over now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is -- the theme of your questions, that's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement -- as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone or going to their computer, it now has the same effect for us. So very, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there, and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investment. So right now we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us, and we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said, customers -- we want the things that customers love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category and some of the things that we are investing the most in are, as you say, the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally, things like Prime Music, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all expanding globally. And we've launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon-Fulfilled units is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we've developed in Seattle; drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses, and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So -- and that's -- of course, another area as AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list and I can keep going, but I think the general theme is we're -- there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.",550

So I'd be curious to talk -- if you could talk about examples or areas where you've been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And there's -- any still existing examples where you see low-hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then just back to the point on investment, you didn't mention brick-and-mortar at all, yet there's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick-and-mortar. I guess I'd be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick-and-mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy.",114

So particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we've -- we're now multiple generations down. We just launched a Amazon robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently. And so toward that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that the Amazon robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we had things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and a movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to cut off our -- to extend our cut-off times from 3 p.m., in most cases, till midnight. So greater control of our processes. If we do it cost-effectively, it can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth and -- is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So your second question was on stores. Yes, yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have 6 bookstores right now, and we've announced another 6. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle. And while that's not large and it's only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location. That's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have -- you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So for us, it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results.",347

Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say, the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4: the Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service-like capability to customers; and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've got customers migrated more than 23,000 databases using the AWS data -- database migration service since that launched last year. And just generally, we continue to expand geographically. We've announced additional Availability Zones and regions worldwide. So again, we signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation, all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over $14 billion run rate, but we're happy with the business and the team. And again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward.",161

Our goal is to help -- is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have -- Sponsored Products is off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue -- advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% to -- in Q4 to 58% in Q1, but the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms and that's what happened.

If it'll help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our -- we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income. And you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had 7 price increase -- or excuse me, price decreases that were timed for December 1. So about 1/3 of the impact of those was seen in Q4 and then, again, that's one element of the sequential operating margin.

It looks like CapEx, including leases, more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there?",51
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1183403.0,48678075.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,24,"Sure. Yes, CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers, was -- grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last -- fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of startup is before the startup. Some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the difference -- differential between Amazon-Fulfilled Network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers, I will also say, with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses and then they're -- generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start up. On the capital leases, as grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that's tied to unit usage growth. But I'll caution, CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. And if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly, there was a bigger step up in 2016, now carrying into 2017.",233

Just curious if you'd say -- have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're -- it still is early days in terms of advertising. But there's a perception out there that over the last year or so, that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess?",143
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1183403.0,48678078.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,27,"Sure. Let me start with advertising. So yes, I think scale is helping. We have great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale in number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs and new content -- or excuse me, video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward, but we're happy with the growth there. I think the Sponsored Products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity, here's how I'd generally -- I'd generalize it. We -- in Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal, or pretty transparent anyway, that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year, we changed some of our incentives to -- and worked with FBA merchants to try and have their throughput to our FCs, particularly in Q4. That, combined with the step up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers, especially for FBA sellers. So yes, that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime-eligible ASINs that FBA provides. So again, it's -- they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more, including FBA products. And conversely, more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in stock of things that people want to buy, Prime-eligible in stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.",324

Yes, on the deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime. But certainly, we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we've seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances as customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services. Through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discount on their usage. And so we like that model, customers certainly like that model and collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful.",157

I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So it -- our approach varies by country. If you look historically, we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business, Joyo.com, and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country, the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So we pick our spots carefully. You'll see -- you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into the strategy? Well, Souq is a pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for the customers and their multiple countries and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we -- we are in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We're -- we have a business in Brazil, but other countries will take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do.",285

The retail subscription services, that's a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships had come on to paid from trial, but just want to understand what maybe what some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. I just wanted to know what that was in terms of what's driving that, and can we expect that to possibly continue.",135

Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category, the largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video, digital music and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration. Much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category, the Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in those other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yes, that is going to -- that was a lower unit volume as well. But generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tailwind -- the headwinds obviously are going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And demand's been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within 2 days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure, but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program.",237

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions,  customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",334

Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those in terms of the ones that are -- the largest areas of investment in the quarter.

Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So to give that some perspective, the Amazon-Fulfilled Network or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year and it's continued through this year. Last year, we had 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went in to service in the back end of last year. That's what I mentioned about this time last year. The -- similar dynamic this year. We're going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year. So that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the content -- video content. Video content, last year I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between first half -- second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still -- we lapped that most of the first half of this year, and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3 and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, I can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I'll also point out that the strong usage growth at AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in the form of capital leases. We've built capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing -- accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.",363

Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around Fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store?

Any comments would be helpful.",73

First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they're very customer-centric just like us. They've built a great business focused around quality and customers. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about with the place of AmazonFresh, that include Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there will be no one solution. So we're experimenting with a number of the formats, from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and AmazonFresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think they're valuable. All those are valuable services. Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality and customer service to this offering.",190

It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward?",58
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1757.0,1256658.0,50913148.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,10,"Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that as tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that businesses as well, and gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments. The -- we're within the guidance range, and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistic services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa -- Echo devices and Alexa platform, India, the buildup at AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned, not to mention Prime Now and AmazonFresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in headcount in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past I've said most of that is driven by operations hiring. And I've even said that headquarters  office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So yes, those -- the growth rate of those 2 job categories actually exceeded the company growth rates. So we are adding -- having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On a place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores, and I would say that the benefit there is -- again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about 1/3 of the people were standing around the device table, learning how they work, how they interact with the devices. So I saw firsthand the customer experience. I think that's where we're seeing the benefit to the physical stores right now.",384

Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is going to incrementally gear towards handling growth in sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2? And if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there.",129

So yes, we've had numerous price increase -- or decrease, excuse me, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive, other services that we provide. So nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on, again, is that Amazon-Fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying it to this year. It's a global number, and we are very glad of the success of the FBA program. We're matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage. And yes, you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy -- we're very happy with the FBA program, its impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.",231

Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly on Prime, the value of the Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of an annual Prime subscription?",111
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1757.0,1256658.0,50913154.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,16,"Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the -- we're increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, the -- we are seeing great customer adoption. The -- again, as I've said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2. And also, we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating, so -- and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth. So we're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30,000 databases over the last 1.5 years. We've signed some very big customer wins like Ancestry, Hightail, California Polytechnic State University and others that we're very proud to have. So yes, the momentum in the businesses is very strong. We continue to open new regions. We'll be opening 5 regions in the near future in France, China, Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government cloud region in the east. So yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that where pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation. The innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features. We also know that customers value our partner and customer ecosystem, and really the experience we've had. We've been at this longer than anybody else.",274

So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change, but the AWS operating margin was lower, I guess, than we've seen in, I don't know, 6 quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising, but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and, I assume, other expectations. So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS?",89
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1757.0,1256658.0,50913157.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,19,"Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion, and that is showing up in tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team, both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those 2 as probably larger-than-normal impacts on Q2 operating margin.",138

The first one, as you continue to add more Prime Now markets with 1- to 2-hour shipping, can you just talk to some of the logistical challenges you've already encountered and worked through? And talk to kind of -- if you really do see 1- to 2-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue. Looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Can you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime, or was there something else in there?",109
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1757.0,1256658.0,50913160.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,22,"Sure. Let me start with your second question. On the subscription revenue, grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. So yes, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also, in that line item, are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, eBooks, digital video and digital music. But again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth, and it remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year. On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across 8 countries. We do learn something new in every city and have different -- slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go. We learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love. That's not an inexpensive service though, and we also have -- so we're constantly working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like what we see, and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, Prime benefit, but also lower-cost operation as well.",218

I'd just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of the self-service versus salespeople. And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but I'd be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show with the screen on it and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices without one.",119

Yes, it's early on the Echo Show. As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the additional -- the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. So it's -- I've used mine and it's awesome. It's a big step up, in my mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, technically, what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular headcount, and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So we build self-service tools and obviously that we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize it will need actual sales contact with accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split really, but I would see both growing.",157

I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a headcount increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RSU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also -- is a combination of the hiring we've done, but also an adjustment we've made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2. On operating margins internationally, I'd step back and say, we -- a lot of the investments we're making in North America, we're also making in international: Prime benefits, including Prime Video and remember, we launched global video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries; Prime Now; AmazonFresh; the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA, to make Prime more attractive and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, any additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along than the Prime -- or excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some respects, we are giving benefits earlier in the life cycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later. And then there's also India. As I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India, and we see great momentum and success there. So we'll continue to invest, and we have some of our best people in that business.",336

Yes, we're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience that we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up to 3 years or 3 peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility. And that's about staying the same, although the whole network gets efficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp stills stays about consistent as it was.",100

In that other line item is advertising and also other things like co-branded credit card agreements. I would say that the main -- excuse me, advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past 3 quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things that more the variance in the volatility as in the other line items. Your question on stores. We are -- again, I personally think that new devices -- the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to shortchange our -- the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated selection and the creativity we've had in taking a new look at the bookstore. So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue and cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",323

I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration? How you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past?",82

This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure since to unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So if you look at that, for the 3 months ended, around 34%, 35% for
[Audio Gap] 
And historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is big and leading contributor to that is [indiscernible] up paying $99 upfront and having that [indiscernible] that continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other one area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services, features like reserved instances where those customers can pay for services upfront, in some cases and discounts over a multiyear period. What we're seeing and more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece, we launched month-to-month Prime last year, and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go. So there's less that's deferred. So that's I think one of a number of factors. There's obviously other mix factors going into besides the pieces that I just mentioned. But we've seen monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So that's part of what you're seeing.",210

What you see in the financial results for this quarter is a -- it's shown actually in the new physical stores, revenue component $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is -- that class of revenue, physical store's revenue is going to be where we are going to book any sales that where a customer physically select an item in a store. So it also -- it does include our Amazon Books. Maybe step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores. Launching the private-label -- Whole Foods private-label products on Amazon, we've got technical work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Food's stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really, real excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.",206

The first one is, that was a bit of a usual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. Is there -- what would you -- what's most surprised you in the quarter? You've been pretty consistent to how you reported versus your guide. So something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happen? What would you attribute that to?",66

In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call, but it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime and Prime Day globally. Had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. There's also very strong quarter for AWS, revenue growth was the same as Q2 and now we're at an $18 billion run rate. Whereas last quarter, when I had this call, we were at $16 billion. So very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.",164

We had the impact of Souq, obviously this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which may be pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally and it carried to the quarter. So it's -- but generally, I would point to the increase selection, a lot of the building blocks we've been working on. All the Prime benefits, advancement and free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits that drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but stronger than -- it was stronger than probably I anticipated.",135

Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering, could you talk about 1 or 2 of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just a strategic opportunity, as you see, of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business? And the second one on the subscriptions revenue, you accelerated to 59%, could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market?",97

On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and -- what I could tell you is, I've been in meetings with John Mackey and his team and they're very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission then expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned price reductions early on, selling products on -- their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Whole Foods, as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So that's kind of the earlier report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services from digital music, digital video, audio books, eBooks. So there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships. And as I said, we had a great -- the largest new Prime -- new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction. It's an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on this -- on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.",297

This is Dave. I think we put out a release saying earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than -- roughly greater than 30% square footage growth in an operations, so we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well. And so we'll continue to hire there.",107

Headcount grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those -- without that headcount, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays.

Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy, in particular?",69

I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Lockers at the Amazon -- excuse me, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So there'll be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we'll also be developing new store formats and everything else just as we've talked about in the past with before Whole Foods, amazon Bookstores, Amazon Go and the opportunity that technology presents. We have campus -- on-campus bookstores. So we're experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast head start on that and a great base and a great team to work with that has a lot of history, and a lot of -- they probably have 10 to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So we're really excited about that. And I think working together will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.",219

I think the common view there is that's a fairly high-margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?",104
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1978.0,1322530.0,53124466.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,23,"Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right. Other revenue grew 58% in the quarter, and that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenues continues to grow very, very quickly, and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide in giving them targeted recommendations. So making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive. And then we believe that by creating that [indiscernible] and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers. So it's an important part of the flywheel and the -- so it's -- the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products. On the international, yes, I can't split it, the effects. But I'll tell you again, it is international expansion in -- primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits, and we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members joined in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there, and we're continuing to add benefits Prime Video, Amazon Family. We've had a first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music. Amazon business is also expanding in India. So a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India. Very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that -- that should be well received by the Indian consumer base. But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we've been in for a while continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In Video, we launched different member in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in 200 -- over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers. So becoming more engaged, and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So there's a lot of -- a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. It's, we believe, it's resonating with customers. So we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.",463

There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India? And then the follow-up on the Whole Foods. So do you feel like the store footprint at 460-odd stores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon bookstores or those other ones you mentioned?,93

Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yes, we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and eBooks offering without the sort of physical categories and more recently added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. So I think we're excited about the electronics that are getting out there. There's a wide variety of products included in that category: Smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So I think, really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.",141

And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington, D.C. and Austin. So yes, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce any, what that will look like, and we're working with the Whole Foods team on what maybe what they will -- how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early. So those plans will develop over time.",91

And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time? How you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into? Or maybe again, I know you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached to that in the past or in other market? And then to the extent that we are thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and obviously have about an 800 basis point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those 2 things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year?",166

I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work on that, I think is in the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now. And so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they're hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies. I mean there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that. And so I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses, multiuser accounts, improving approval workflow tools, and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime shipping, which we think will be a great way for our businesses use multiuser -- Business customers that have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and in Germany. So I think it's part of that offering, and we really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we're focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.",232

You're right, we had a number of price cuts on [indiscernible] time to -- about around December 1 of last year that certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts, but new products that have lower average costs and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and reinvent is in December, so that's -- the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.",126

The first, Prime Now, Fresh Prime Pantry and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those 4 as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even, in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint? And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in Video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years?",114

And why are we going to do that? It's because the Video business is having great results with our most important customer base, these are our Prime customers. They continue to -- it continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing engagement go up year after year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime time benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon. And we have a lot of data. We're -- that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the 2 together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make midcourse corrections. So we always do that, the -- we're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base and things they want to see. And -- so that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we're very -- we remain very bullish on the Video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects back end of this year and also lined up into next year. On the -- sorry, the second comment was, the overlap. Yes, so Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically, Prime Now, and also, AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases, combine them. We're not sure how it will play out, but we're going to cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipment. So there's no one paradigm for all customer or engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers, and we're going to continue to work on those.",439

On the ad-supported question, I think what you've seen to date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad-free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad. We think of that as the first free episode, but generally like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.",94

And there our philosophy is, again, we're going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays, by investing in those transportation options, we do so at same costs or cost parity, I would say, at the very minimum, but it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cutoff times for customers, enable Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from once was 3 p.m. in the afternoon to midnight, has huge benefits both for the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales, it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon's going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football game will start in 2 hours and 20 minutes so.",174
