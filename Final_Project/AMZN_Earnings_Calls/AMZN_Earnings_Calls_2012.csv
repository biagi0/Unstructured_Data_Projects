18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503623.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 12% to $3.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 17% to $2.09 billion. Return on invested capital is 22%, down from 34%. Return on invested capital is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 465 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $277 million.
Worldwide revenue grew 35% to $17.43 billion, or 34% excluding the $101 million favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers, who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $6.01 billion, up 15% or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $10.91 billion, up 48%, or 47% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 63% of worldwide sales, up from 57%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 46%. Active customer accounts exceeded $164 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units were 36% of paid units compared to 32% of paid units in Q4 2010.
Now I'll discuss our operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $13.83 billion, or 79.3% of revenue compared with 79.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.14 billion or 18% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.62 billion or 9.3% of revenue compared with 8.2%. Tech and content was $782 million or 4.5% of revenue compared with 3.5%. Marketing was $581 million or 3.3% of revenue compared with 2.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 37% to $9.9 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.56 billion. EGM revenue grew 51% to $6.88 billion, representing 69% of North America revenues, up from 63%.
North America segment operating income decreased 4% to $285 million, a 2.9% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $7.53 billion. Adjusting for the $102 million year-over-year favorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 29%.
Media revenue grew 20% to $3.45 billion, or 18% excluding foreign exchange rates. And EGM revenue grew 42% to $4.03 billion, or 41% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 54% of international revenues, up from 49%.
International segment operating income decreased 46% to $177 million, a 2.4% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, International segment operating income decreased 46%.
CSOI decreased 26% to $462 million, or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 216 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 27%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense.
GAAP operating income decreased 45% to $260 million, or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $86 million in Q4, resulting in a 32% rate for the quarter and a 31% rate for the full year 2011. GAAP net income was $177 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with $416 million and $0.91 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 41% to $48.08 billion. North America revenue grew 43% to $26.71 billion, and International grew 38% to $21.37 billion, 31% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
Consolidated Segment Operating Income, or CSOI, decreased 19% to $1.57 billion, or 21% excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin decreased 239 basis points to 3.3%. GAAP operating income decreased 39% to $862 million, or 1.8% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $814 million year-over-year to $9.58 billion. Inventory increased 56% to $4.99 billion. And inventory turns were 10.3, down from 11.4 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 38% to $11.14 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 74 from 72 in the prior year.
Our Q4 2011 capital expenditures were $550 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, including investments in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2012, we expect net sales between $12 billion and $13.4 billion, a growth of between 22% and 36%. This guidance anticipates approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.  GAAP operating income or loss to be between a loss of $200 million and $100 million of income, or between 162% decline and 69% decline. This includes approximately $200 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $300 million, or between 100% decline and 36% decline.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.",1037

Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?",25

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503626.0,Question,Jeetil Patel,,Analysts,5,"A couple of questions, actually. First of all, on the Kindle Fire, I guess, Tom, can you maybe talk about Kindle Fire hardware units? Or did you see an increase in terms of unit sales on a month-on-month basis in terms of linearity? Second, as it relates to fulfillment, can you talk about what's your thinking in terms of getting closer to the end consumer and trying to drop delivery times to same-day delivery as you kind of look forward in terms of planning and thinking of what's the optimal experience from a consumer standpoint?",95
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503627.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,6,"In terms of data related to Kindle Fire and actually Kindle itself, the only thing I can help you with is on the holiday season, which we put in the release. We had a -- our unit sales nearly tripled. It was up 177%, and that includes both our Kindle e-reader and Kindle Fire. So we're very pleased with the great growth we had. And obviously, we've been growing quite fast over the last several years from a unit perspective in launching Kindle. So it's on a very good base. In terms of fulfillment and delivery time, we're continually trying to improve all of our processes around from a customer standpoint, and that includes fulfillment and delivery speed. And so you've seen over the last several years, we've gotten closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. And when we do that, it not only helps our retail offering, but it helps also our third parties who are participating in Fulfilled by Amazon. And one of the things that you're seeing in our Q4 numbers is we saw very good unit growth. And you're seeing that we expanded our third party as a percentage of total units. And one of the ways we did that is certainly by Fulfilled by Amazon because again, from a customer standpoint, those units are available for express 2-day shipping or 1-day if you're a Prime member and you pay the small fee, as well as our free shipping offers.",247
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503628.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,7,And we'll take our next question from analyst Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.,14
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503629.0,Question,Scott Devitt,,Analysts,8,"Two if I could. The first one, Tom, North American segment sales decelerated, and if you can, adjustment for Kindle Fire, by a pretty good bit. You mentioned third-party mix, which I think is a negative impact on that, and was wondering if you could just talk through the other dynamics if Prime is becoming more mature in the U.S. and/or the agency book business, the mix shift you're having given the strength of the Kindle product, if that's actually having a negative impact on revenue growth?",87
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503630.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,9,"Sure. In terms of our overall -- I'll talk to the total worldwide, as well as to the North America piece. But what I was mentioning was our growth rate for global revenue was 34%, excluding exchange. That compares to 39% in Q3 and 37% last year. If you compare our unit growth, that's a paid unit growth, was 46%. Again this is globally in Q4. That compares to 37% in Q4 last year. So we saw an acceleration in unit growth. On top of that, what we saw was third-party units grew 65% year-over-year, and our third-party units as a percentage of total units were 36%, up from 32%. And so really what you're seeing is you're seeing great adoption. Certainly, great revenue from a third-party perspective. But you're seeing very good adoption of FBA that has grown considerably over the last few years, and that's certainly impacting that number. But obviously, we only book a portion of the revenue based on the commissions we receive for that business and our top line growth. So that's what you're seeing in total. And you're seeing that also happen in North America, as well as International. To the other comments, a few other things to call out in terms of North America. If you take a look at our EGM revenue, certainly there was some impact in certain subcategories related to the Thailand flood. It certainly impacted some supply. Again, the good news is we certainly had some good third-party offerings in many of those subcategories as well. Same as -- another similar fact is in North America media, we saw very, very strong growth in digital media from books to video, music. All of those grew very well. We did see video games, which includes both consoles and games. Keep in mind that Q4 is very seasonal for video games. We actually saw our revenue decline year-over-year in video games. We had very strong third-party offerings, so our third-party growth was up. Our unit growth in video games was up, but our revenue was down. And that's what you're seeing impacting the North American media number, particularly versus Q4 last year. So again, those are some of the dynamics. But again, what you're seeing is some of this, certainly the strong performance on third-party sellers, is also impacting the top line, because we just recorded a portion of that sale, the commission. But you're seeing it positively impact operating income, which is why you see it came in a little bit above the guidance that we gave.",427
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503631.0,Question,Scott Devitt,,Analysts,10,"And as it relates to CapEx, the run rate, if you go back to '05, you were about 2% -- a little over 2% of revenue, and it's been ramping. I know some of the last 2 years this included the building, but we exited 2012 I think at a 3.7% of revenue on a trailing basis. So I was wondering if you can just talk to the way that we should think about CapEx as a percentage of revenue or otherwise over the next few years.",87
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503632.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,11,"Sure. We look at it certainly on an incremental -- from an incremental growth standpoint. And we look at it versus incremental unit growth, as well as what we think the NPVs for those specific investments are. But if you break down the individual pieces, again, as we've talked about in the last several calls, we've just seen such dramatic growth in both, first of all, from a retail perspective, on our retail offerings, been growing very fast. Our third-party with Fulfilled by Amazon, very fast. AWS has been growing very fast, and so the capacity that we've needed to support both our operations capability, as well as the infrastructure capability for our Web Services and our Retail business has been very high. That said, we feel that we're efficiently deploying that capital. We added -- as we talked about last call, we had planned to add 17 FCs, which is what we did in 2011, bringing our total to 69. And again, that represents the high growth that we're experiencing. So we feel very good about the investments that we're making. And with 46% paid unit growth in Q4, we're still experiencing very high growth.",196

You talked about the unit trends and the revenue trends in video games. Anything you'd want to call out in terms of the other media segments: books, music and video? And then real briefly, the share buybacks. I think this is the first time in at least 2 years you've done that. Any particular reason why you brought back stock in the quarter?",75
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503635.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,14,"Sure. In terms of the North American media, again, across all of digital media, very strong growth. Another call-out that I didn't mention is physical books. Unit growth was double digit in Q4 year-over-year, which we were very pleased with if you think about the shift to digital content and just the really rapid growth on the Kindle side. We were pleased to see that. And then I'd mentioned the video games was again down from a revenue perspective. Third-party GMS was up strongly. Unit growth in total for video games was up. Again, there's some difficult compares as you can imagine with some of the console piece of that. And again, when I talk video games, it's both console and video games. And keep in mind that video games in particular is very seasonal, and usually, we see in Q4, and we did see this Q4 as well as other Q4s, that video games sales for the quarter is multiples of what we see in other quarters, again because of the seasonality. So hopefully that's helpful. And then in terms of the stock purchase, we've had a -- there's not a lot to comment there. We have said in the past that we'll opportunistically buy when we think it's the right value, and that's what we did.",218

One is, I think the new disclosure on service sales, maybe I missed the footnote in the press release, could you just clarify what's included there? Is that 3P, FBA, Prime, AWS and shipping? Or did I maybe miss something? And then secondly, can you share with us maybe your plans for how many fulfillment centers you plan on opening in 2012?",66
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503638.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,17,"Sure. In terms of the disclosure, I would want to guide you right to the release to see exactly what's included in there. But certainly, in terms of some of the big pieces, it is our third-party. It is also AWS and a number of other service offerings. And so those are again documented well there, and I'd like to point you to that. Also, you can see that it's growing very well, and it reflects on the comments I made earlier about the fast-growing AWS businesses, the fast-growing third-party business. Service revenue is up approximately 74% year-over-year in Q4. And then in terms of fulfillment, we added 17 new FCs in 2011. That's globally. We do plan, based on the strong growth, to add more in 2012. As you can imagine, coming out of Q4, we're finalizing our plans for what we're going to do there. And you'll have to stay tuned, and we'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year.",164

We would've thought that maybe with the launch of Kindle Fire, et cetera, we would've seen maybe a higher attach rate and therefore, maybe a higher media revenue growth. And second, just on the streaming service, any plans to separate -- to offer separate pricing for the video streaming product? And that's it.",80
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2387.0,213332.0,12503641.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,20,"Yes, just to be clear, I'm separating our digital -- when I talk about our growth rates, I'm talking about our digital content businesses across-the-board grew very strongly during Q4. The video games, physical, as well as consoles business, again grows. It's just seasonally very high. It's not -- if you take a look at it, it's not too dissimilar to what you'd see with our electronics portion of our EGM business. It's a very seasonal business, very heavy weighted in Q4. And so that's no different. That's not different this year than in other years. What is different is growth was down from a revenue perspective year-over-year. It was up from a units perspective. And again, the reason why it was up is because we had strong third-party sales in Q4. Keep in mind though, certainly console is a part of that. And again, we include consoles and video games as part of our video games line within North America media. And you've probably seen other press related to that as you look at other releases and updates. But there has been a lot of new offerings there recently.",190

One is a paid or rental offering as part of Amazon Video. We also have a service as part of Prime. We like both of them. We made some -- we put some comments in the release about the growth rates associated with those. And on the Prime that's in Video, we actually like what we see there also. And so it's still early, but we like what we see. We are investing in digital content. We're seeing great adoption. We're looking at it very carefully to understand a lot of different metrics around that business as you'd expect. And it's still early again. We really like what we see so far.

And that's part of the -- both are included in the growth rate that we had in our release, which is again during the holiday season. It was up 177% year-over-year. And again, we've been growing certainly our Kindle reader business very fast over the past several years since introduction. And so it's on top of a good base. And so we're pleased with the growth rate, and customers like both the reader and the Fire. Early to tell on Prime conversion. But again, early stats that we're seeing, we like a lot. And so we'll continue to see how that looks going forward, but we like what we're seeing.",133

First thing is we are investing in a lot of different areas across the business, as we've talked about. That being said, when you look at that increase that you're referring to, the majority of those increases are in our operations and customer service area. And so again, it's in support of the growth. And certainly, you're seeing it also in our operating costs. And again, we're fortunate to have a lot of opportunities. We're fortunate to have the growth that we're experiencing, and that's why you're seeing that growth. But certainly, you'll see that. As you have over time, you'll see that growth rate will go in cycles. But we certainly are feeding the growth that we're seeing and the opportunities that we have.",126

And specifically, I'm looking at 2 things. First, the impact of currency and really more macro weakness in Western Europe. Are you seeing anything there? Is there anything that makes you think that things could be getting materially worse in any of your territories? And specific language around which of the countries you may be seeing could be quite helpful. And second, I'm wondering if you are seeing, or have seen over the course of the last quarter, a shift of consumer buying habits towards the hardware device sales and away from media, and perhaps that could explain the deceleration in the media that we appear to be seeing in North America.",124

Again, we're using the recent exchange rates. But the range for growth was 22% to 36%, and it was unfavorably impacting us by about 50 basis points for foreign exchange. In terms of growth in, you mentioned Western Europe, if you take a look at International in Q4, it was up 29% on a local-currency basis. It did hold up pretty well given obviously the challenges that are going on, specifically in Europe from an economic standpoint. We're not -- we don't view ourselves as a bellwether for the economy, but certainly we're seeing that it is softer. Hard to quantify how much higher that international growth would have been. But it was certainly -- we're all seeing the same thing in terms of the reports in Europe and it's certainly soft. So it is impacting our overall growth rate, but hard to tell how much. And then on the -- again on the North America media growth, it's actually again very, very strong on the digital content side. Physical books were up double digits from a unit perspective, which we thought was impressive given the shift to Kindle. And again, video games and video game consoles were certainly the biggest call-out there from a negative standpoint. And that growth was down year-over-year on a revenue basis but up from a unit perspective.",251

What I would say is we have been investing very heavily as you mentioned. And as a result of that, Q4 unit growth was 46% year-over-year. That's paid unit growth. And we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. And yes, there's some pockets of softness or challenges with some of the economic impact, particularly in Europe. We did see some supply issues with the Thailand flood, with certainly some subcategories within some of our hard lines businesses as a result. We think those things will work themselves out over time. But we're incredibly optimistic about the opportunity that we have, and that's why we have invested the way we have and why we're continuing to invest in the business.

We're continuing to look. As we always do, we learn every week and every month and every quarter about more and more about customer adoption. And we're looking at just a lot of positive things across the business in terms of adoption of our digital offerings, very specifically Kindle growth from a device standpoint and the content that's following that. And we're seeing some very strong growth along many categories. If you look at EGM, we're seeing very good growth in categories like soft lines, particularly clothing. We're seeing very good growth in consumables. We're seeing very good growth outside of some of these supply-constrained areas. Within consumer electronics, we're seeing good growth. So there's a lot of positive things within EGM. Within our business, we're seeing just tremendous growth in Amazon Web Services, so I'm very pleased with how the team is doing there, and they're just doing a great job. And so there's a lot of interesting opportunities that we continue to invest in. So we're very pleased, and we're very pleased with the performance in Q4 and what it means going forward for us.",189

So you're obviously building a lot into Prime with video and also the Kindle Lending Library. Can you just give us a sense of how the profitability of a Prime customer changes over time?

In each of our video -- excuse me, in each of our digital contents that we're offering, whether it be as part of Prime, whether it be Lending Library or whether it be video, we just have early results. And so from a return perspective, we're going to see -- what we can see so far is what's happening with adoption of Prime members, what's happening with free trial conversion, what's happening with Prime memberships that we can attribute directly to those services. And again, it's very, very early. But so far, we see, we like, which is why we're continuing down the path specifically of adding more content to Prime and making Prime better. And so that's something that we, over time, we've learned both with our physical offerings and now early on in our digital offering, it's something that we think is very good for customers and very good for share owners. And so that's something that we're focused a lot on. Because we're investing a lot there, we are taking a very close look at and making sure that we understand it very well. And from what we see so far, it supports a continued strong investment there. And so that's what we're doing. But again, we'll continue to monitor that very closely.

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 1% to $3.05 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 39% to $1.15 billion. Return on invested capital was 12%, down from 24%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 464 million shares compared with 466 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $960 million. 
Worldwide revenue grew 34% to $13.18 billion or 34% excluding the $56 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.71 billion, up 19% or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $7.97 billion, up 43% or 43% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 60% of worldwide sales, up from 57%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 49%. Active customer accounts exceeded 173 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 39% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in the Q1 2011.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.03 billion or 76.1% of revenue compared with 77.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.76 billion or 20.9% of sales, up approximately 283 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.26 billion or 9.5% of revenue compared with 8.4%. Tech and content was $816 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $468 million or 3.6% of revenue compared with 3.2%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. And consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation expense or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.43 billion. Media revenue grew 17% to $2.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 44% to $4.77 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 60%. North America segment operating income increased 20% to $349 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 31% to $5.76 billion. Adjusted for the $55 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 32%. Media revenue grew 21% to $2.51 billion or 22%, excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 40% to $3.2 billion or 42%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 56% of International revenues, up from 52%. International segment operating income decreased 72% to $49 million, a 0.9% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 65%.
CSOI decreased 15% to $398 million or 3% of revenue, down approximately 170 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 14%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 40% to $192 million or 1.5% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $43 million in Q1, resulting in a 51% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $130 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared with $201 million or $0.44 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.17 billion year-over-year to $5.71 billion. Inventory increased 47% to $4.25 billion and inventory turns were 10.4, down from 11.6 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $6.89 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 62 from 66 in the prior year. 
Our Q1 2012 capital expenditures were $386 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including the Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance excludes the financial results on the Kiva Systems acquisition, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2012, and assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2012, we expect net sales of between $11.9 billion and $13.3 billion or growth of between 20% and 34%. This guidance anticipates approximately 240 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $260 million loss and $40 million of income or between 229% decline and 80% decline. This includes approximately $260 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate Consolidated Segment Operating Income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between 0 and $300 million or between 100% decline and 22% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.",1012

One, I was wondering if you could update us on your plans for fulfillment center increases in 2012. And then also on Prime Instant Video, you guys are over 17,000 movies and TV episodes now. Are you guys at a critical mass? Or do you guys expect to continue to invest aggressively there? And one last quick clarification question, the CapEx guidance, was that for the second quarter or the full year?",78

I'll take the last one first. The CapEx was for the second quarter. And the first question on fulfillment centers, in terms of announcements so far that are out there, we've announced 13 for 2012. And so certainly, any changes to that, we'd be back to you. But again, we're experiencing very, very strong growth both in terms of retail but also our FBA. We're seeing that in our third-party growth. Our third-party growth increased in Q1 over 60% again this quarter. Again, a big piece of that was certainly FBA is doing very well.

If you look at it year-over-year, I guess, or even sequentially, the International margin is down pretty materially, but you had a significant uptick in the North American margins, so sequentially and just a moderate decline year-over-year. So wondering if you can just clarify what's happening in North America versus the International markets. Is it 3P FBA having a more significant effect in the U.S. versus other markets?

But what you're seeing is, clearly, if you look at over the past couple years, we've launched a few new geographies, Italy and Spain. We're investing in those geographies. As we've talked about in the past, China, we continue to invest there. We think it's growing very fast. We like what we see. We think it's a great long-term opportunity for investing there. So those are some of the dynamics that are impacting International. And so we continue to invest again across both geographies. But those are things that are a little bit different. In terms of third-party growth, we're seeing very strong third-party growth across International, as well as North America, so we're pleased to do that. And we're investing again on behalf of customers and sellers, as well as retail for the capacity that we need to do that.",152

We are adding a lot of resources across a number of different areas. But certainly if you look at both year-over-year and sequentially, the Q1 numbers that you're looking at, the vast majority of that is in operations and customer service. Again, and those are based on the hirings that we did coming out of Q4. We have a lot of -- we do supplement our workforce with temporaries in Q4. We did hire a number of those coming out of Q4.

And it also looks within that like shipping for the first time in a while shows a little bit less deleverage than it has in the past. Is there some sort of tipping point you've reached there? And just broadly on gross margins, that real drive-up that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, is that primarily just due to product mix shifts or revenue mix shifts? Is there anything else in there? And then could you also just briefly comment on AmazonSupply.com? Would some of that -- all of the inventory that you've built up for that launch, would was that -- have we seen that in the buildup in inventory and the reduction in turns? Or are we going to see that going forward?",141

But in terms of -- if you take a look at the relationship between COGS and revenue, certainly, one of the things we're seeing, a number of different factors there, certainly mix of business is one. But another factor is certainly the one I mentioned earlier, which is around third-party growth. We saw very strong unit growth overall this quarter, up from last quarter, so we had sequential growth. Third-party units as a percentage of total units were up approximately 300 basis points over last year. And we saw just great third-party unit growth, so it was up over 60% again in Q1. And so those are factors that are certainly impacting our operating margins, if you will. In terms of supply -- AmazonSupply.com, certainly, we have inventory on hand to support that business. It's certainly something that we're optimistic over the long-term. But in terms of the inventory increase that you've seen, it's very broad over a number of different businesses and categories and geographies. So that's really what's driving it.",183

Certainly, the paid unit growth has been certainly helped a lot by e-books.

If you could first just give us some more color on the outlook around segment operating income in 2Q and just how we should be thinking about the drivers there in terms of the sequential decline. And then secondly, just the North American media business, you saw good reacceleration from 4Q to 1Q. Can you talk about the factors there leading to that acceleration?",71

I'll take the second one first on North American media. I just mentioned that a little bit in one of the previous questions. But certainly, our digital media growth has been great and certainly it's helping that. One other call-out, just to keep in mind, in Q4, I had mentioned that video games, including video game consoles, the consoles are part of North America media, that's a seasonal business that was bringing down growth in Q4. So it's also something to keep in mind. In terms of our guidance, we've given a pretty broad range on both the top and the bottom as we have previously. We think the segment operating income on the bottom end of the range is certainly appropriately conservative. But again, things that you should think about, we'll continue to add capacity as we've talked about in the past. With the growth that we're experiencing, we are adding more. And as I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we've announced approximately 13 new fulfillment centers. So those are as a result of the growth that we're experiencing. We're also adding capacity to support AWS in our retail business on the infrastructure side as well. So those are things to think about as you think about Q2 from a segment operating income, as well as the CapEx that I mentioned in the opening. Another area is certainly our digital offerings. We are certainly adding more content, and specifically, more video content, which will be as reflected in our guidance. And so those are factors, among others, that you should think about.",266

But I was just curious if you still see areas of your business in the oldest part of your business, where you think you have inefficiencies you can still work to improve execution and kind of get some margin lift out of those in the oldest part of the business just to improve execution.

Certainly, the most opportunity is the newer parts. But certainly if you go back and look at -- we're still trying to get great productivity and putting together programs to get great productivity in each of our operations. And so there's really too many to list here on the call today. But we look at in all facets for our business in terms of productivity. We think there's opportunities to partner with vendors even more to get better savings and better prices for customers. So the list is long. But I think when you look at the opportunities in terms of the ranking, in terms of at least basis points improvement, start with the newer things that we've launched -- at least directionally, the newer things that we've launched, work your way backwards, and those were usually where the biggest opportunities are in terms of basis points.",178

That's my first question. And then secondly, can you comment on any product categories in either media or EGM that either held you back in the quarter or were a tailwind?

In terms of the second part of the question, I think the -- in terms of any headwinds, I would say there's a few areas, as we talked about last quarter with some of the supply issues that we had related to the Thailand floods that caused certainly issues, some issues for us specifically in the areas of some parts of cameras, audio, video, office equipment. And so you saw some of that impact in Q4, as well as Q1. The good news for us with our platform is we have many, many different sellers. So where we had supply, we continue to offer those for customers. And in cases where we didn't, oftentimes we had third parties that may have had -- still had inventory. So it certainly helped us very well to get through that situation. So those are some of the headwinds that were in Q1. And then we had very strong broad growth amongst many categories, certainly, in terms of the retail categories. And we also had very strong growth in Kindle. Globally, AWS is growing very, very fast. So we had some very, very positive, if you will, tailwinds from the strong growth.",199

We have a very good team of people who work on this in each of our geographies, trying to make sure we have adequate capacity throughout the year, as well as for Q4. And it's always a tough balance. We want to make sure that we have enough because we want to make sure we satisfy customers. And so we'll have to see as we progress through the year what the growth looks like. And we certainly -- based on what we're experiencing so far, we expect it to be very good. And we'll have to see what happens in future months and quarters to see what that looks like. So it's a little bit early to say what we think that utilization will be. But we're trying to make sure in any time we do this is to have enough but not too much. And it's a delicate balance, so hard to predict what it will be. In terms of your second question, I don't think there's a lot I can help you with there. We have -- we certainly have a lot of technology that we develop ourselves. And we have a great technical team that's working a lot of different interesting areas on behalf of customers and will continue to do so. Beyond that, there's not a lot I can comment.",246

I don't think I heard you blame macro weakness in Europe. Now clearly, you had stronger results across-the-board, so I don't see it evident in the results. Are you clear enough about the direction of the macro or its impact on your European operations that you can kind of say, at least from what you're seeing, it's not affecting you now? And the second question is on this percentage of third-party versus first-party sales. Last quarter, I believe you said that it got up to 36% in part because of stockouts due to the Thai flood and such. At some point, one would think that the supply chain for cameras and other equipment affected by the Thai flood would normalize. Would we expect that to therefore normalize back down from 39% level back down to the mid-30s? How can we think about that relationship?",150

In terms of the macro economics of Europe specifically, it's -- we're not exactly a bellwether for the economy, and so it's hard to  assess. It certainly is having some impact on us. And you're certainly reading the same press as we are in terms of what's going on, and it's very challenging. But it's hard to quantify what that impact is, so we're certainly having some impact but it's hard to quantify, is how I would explain it. And then in terms of 3P, we have -- we've seen the dynamic that you're talking about in terms of it has helped us with stockouts both in Q4 and Q1 for sure and has helped growth. Where does it moderate? Hard to say. But we have seen outside of these 2 quarters, very good third-party growth. And that's been accelerating over the past couple years in terms of third-party unit growth. There's a number of different factors in terms of making that experience better for sellers. The most notable one is Fulfilled by Amazon. And so that's certainly having an impact in all the geographies that we operate and have that in. And so it's great for sellers, it's great for customers and it's great for shareowners. So it's a nice intersection there. So we're very excited about it, and that's really what's driving it. The stockouts and things, those will happen from time to time in various categories. And I think that's certainly one of the benefits of our model of having both first-party and third-party offerings. But I wouldn't view that as the substantial driver of what's happened in third party over the last few years. It's other things that we've done to improve that experience for sellers.",291

I can't comment on any specific geography or state. But again, you can see by the growth that we've experienced over the past few years, which includes during those past few years, certainly adding some geographies, if you will, to our collection efforts.

No, we're ready for additional demand. The team has worked extremely hard to make sure that we keep up with demand. And so as you've seen over the past few years now, you're seeing our CapEx growing.

You have different category mix. But in terms of an overall volume perspective, as I mentioned in some of the earlier comments, that it was about 30 -- approximately 39% of our total units, so it's very meaningful. And that's growing -- grew over 60% this quarter, again, up from 36% of our total units. So again, it's -- I can't give you the GMV.

In terms of what we do going forward, we certainly have a long-standing practice of not talking about what we would do going forward, so you have to stay tuned on that.

Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. 
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2012 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2209.0,333677.0,16156848.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 40% to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11% down from 21%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of a long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. 
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29% to $12.83 billion or 32%, excluding the $272 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers. 
Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13% or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38% or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011. 
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion or 73.9% of revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $2.99 billion or 23.3% of sales, up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion or 10.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million or 7.6% of revenue compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million or 4.1% of revenue compared with 3.3%. 
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments or stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36% to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $1.87 billion. EGM revenue grew 41% to $4.94 billion, representing 67% of North America revenues, up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61% to $344 million, a 4.7% operating margin. 
In the International segment, revenue grew 22% to $5.51 billion. Adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8% to $2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to $3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to $16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, International segment operating income decreased 74%. 
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to $360 million or 2.8% of revenue, down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. And excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 4%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. 
Our income tax expense was $109 million, a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a onetime expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. 
GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash from marketable securities decreased $1.39 billion year-over-year to $4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to $4.38 billion and inventory turns were 10.1 down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to $7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. 
Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For the Q3 2012, we expect net sales of between $12.9 billion and $14.3 billion or growth between 19% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $350 million loss and $50 million loss, down from $79 million income at comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. 
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $75 million loss and $225 million in income or between 129% decline and 14% decline. 
We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
We remain heads-down focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first to is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. 
With that, Sean, let's move to questions.",1050

And then last part would be, is there any impact on your 3Q guidance from the Kiva acquisition specifically?",74

We're looking forward to getting great productivity over time through the use. But again, it's very early and you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of the plans. In terms of the impact, you mentioned Q3, let me just provide a little bit of data on both Q2 actuals and Q3. In terms of GAAP operating income in Q2, it was negative $25 million. For Q3, it's approximately negative $35 million. And then on net income for Q2, it was a loss of approximately $65 million. So those are the numbers for Q2 and Q3.

It's related to overall 3P. There's a number of different factors certainly driving the improvement in the implied gross margins that you're referring to. But as it relates to 3P, it's on the broader 3P. So if you take a look at, from a units perspective, third party was 40% of our total units in Q2. That's up from 36%.

Just going back to the gross margin question, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the relative impact of a few different things, category maturity, advertising, 3P and maybe digital content on gross margins. Which ones are impacting gross margins more than other -- others? And then just a quick question on the taxes. When will the impact of sales tax collection in Texas and California be on gross margins?",80

But certainly, 3P is having an impact, mix of business is having an impact. The -- we have -- we continue to try to work with our partners to get even better prices on the goods that we provide for our customers, which is certainly impacting it. Mix of business, things like AWS is certainly impacting that as well, given the growth rates there. So again, those are things that are impacting. In terms of sales taxes, any impact that we certainly would expect to see would be included in the guidance that we're giving for Q3. But one thing to keep in mind as it relates to that is we -- right now, approximately 50% of our business around the world, we either collect sales tax or value added tax. We have very good businesses in those jurisdictions. And so keep that in mind as you think about any upcoming changes.",168

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2209.0,333677.0,16156867.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,21,"Sure, in terms of -- I'll take International and Total first and then the same is true for media. And really, the -- I'll even start with the Total business. Total business grew 32%. One thing to keep -- that's on local [ph] currency basis. One thing to keep in mind is for both the Total business, International growth and International media, we had very, very strong growth last year, Q2. In fact, our total growth rate last year was 51% for the Total business. And on a local currency basis about 44% growth. That's the highest growth quarter we've had in over 10 years. And so when you look at that, when you're comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth given that compare to last year. And that's some of what you're seeing also in international media as you mentioned. So international media was up 8%. On a local currency basis, it was up 12%. And certainly, it's a challenging compare. Also, there were some things just with -- as we -- some timing things as we launched with the unfortunate events in Japan last year, we certainly did have some releases that we know were scheduled for late in the quarter that obviously didn't happen, that moved into Q2 just from a supply standpoint. Those are certainly impacting that region and some other things. So it's, again, think of it in terms of the comparison point to last year is probably the best thing to do.",252

A couple of questions. Can you talk about -- or disclose anything about mobile, how that's affecting your business? eBay talked about mobile affecting their growth rates quite materially and perhaps, even by a few percentage points and accounting for almost 10% of the revenues maybe. And second, is -- can you talk about the broad philosophy of management about short-term profitability versus long-term growth? As in -- probably, this is the first time in a while that you have bracketed negative pro forma operating income in your guidance. How should we view our short-term investment or the short-term profitability outlook?",109

Although we're not breaking out the numbers, it's a big tailwind and -- on our business and it's going great. So we're seeing a very nice impact from that. And again it's a tailwind that we expect that will continue. In terms of short-term versus long-term, we're all about trying to make sure we do the right long-term things for both customers and shareowners. But more specifically, around Q3. Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters in that we're investing certainly for the long-term. Yet, on the flip side, keep in mind as you look at Q3 specifically, we're getting ready for our most seasonal quarter, and we expect, given the growth that we've had, we're seeing very strong growth so we're investing heavily to get ready for that. In terms of capacity, for example, we've announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We've actually opened 8 of those already this year out of the 18. And we're looking at potentially opening even more than that and -- sorry, I'm sorry, 6 opened so far this year out of 18. And so those are certainly something that are impacting cost so far and you'll be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most seasonal quarter.",232

We certainly -- as you look at -- I'll talk to Q2 since it's the most recent quarter, but we had a lot of the strength across many different areas. One of the ones I mentioned that certainly helped our operating profit, as well as our gross margin was our third-party business, continued to be very, very strong. And certainly, that was a factor. Again there was a number of factors. One thing, too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4. You see that not only in our operating results but you see it in our CapEx. In the last 90 days ago, we said that we would spend approximately $800 million to $900 million of CapEx for Q2. We spent a little less than $700 million. You see that number for Q3 being $800 million to $900 million as well, $800 million to $900 million. So again, those are the things that you're seeing, just a little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there.",182

And any insight in terms of adoption on FBA for -- by third parties would be very helpful. And then one quick follow-up just on your comments, Tom, on CapEx. I think you said it came in lower in 2Q, guidance is for another $800 million to $900 million. Is that guidance sort of consistent maybe going out going forward or is this sort of a onetime go-around technology?",112

That's one of the drivers certainly to -- that's helping us have that percentage of total units go up. And we've looked at and been working very hard over a number of years on improving the experience for both customers and for sellers. And FBA is an example of that. And what ends up happening is FBA sellers wants their part of the program. Those units that are FBA in our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs, including FREE Super Saver Shipping, Prime. So again, those are great -- that certainly that's a great program for customers, it's a great program for sellers and it's a great program for investors. And so we think of it -- I don't think of it as a bad thing at all. I think of it as a good thing. We have a lot of retail units that we send directly to customers. We're offering a great experience on third-party units, which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. So again, we'll continue to try to make that even better for customers and sellers over time. But it's working very well. And again, those -- the benefit of having third parties on our platform is we get to add great new selection. We also have competing offers directly on our detail pages, so when customers come, they get to choose in terms of who they want to purchase from. So it's a competitive environment on our platform. So we think that's great for customers and for us.",275

And so we're certainly pleased with what we saw in Q2. And we're certainly giving, as we have in past quarters, a wide range -- appropriate wide range for Q3. In terms of the bottom line, in terms of operating income and CSOI guidance that we've given, as I mentioned earlier, certainly a number of different factors like the other -- like the last several quarters, as we've been talking about, we're certainly investing a lot in the business. But one thing to keep in mind is for the guidance in the upcoming quarter to Q3 and we are certainly getting ready, given the growth rates we've had for our most seasonal quarter, that's certainly impacting the bottom line in terms of our hard guidance.

18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2314.0,370887.0,17734141.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results.
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 8% to $3.37 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 31% to $1.06 billion.
Return on invested capital was 10%, down from 17%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 469 million shares, consistent with 469 million shares. 
Worldwide revenue grew 27% to $13.81 billion or 30%, excluding the $348-million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $4.6 billion, up 11%, or 14% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.56 billion, up 36%, or 39% excluding foreign exchange.
Worldwide EGM increased to 62% of worldwide sales, up from 58%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 39%. Active customer accounts exceeded 188 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 41% of paid units. 
Now we'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $10.32 billion, or 74.7% of revenue compared with 76.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.26 billion, or 23.6% of sales, up approximately 251 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.45 billion or 10.5% of revenue compared with 10%. Tech and content was $1.08 billion or 7.8% of revenue compared with 6.4%. Marketing was $524 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now we'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 33% to $7.88 billion. Media revenue grew 15% to $2.22 billion. EGM revenue grew 39% to $5.06 billion, representing 64% of North America revenues, up from 61%. North America segment operating income increased 102% to $291 million, a 3.7% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 20% to $5.92 billion. Adjusting for the $347 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 27%. Media revenue grew 7% to $2.38 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange; and EGM revenue grew 30% to $3.5 billion, or 39% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of International revenues, up from 54%.
International segment operating loss was $59 million, a 1% negative operating margin compared with income of $116 million. CSOI decreased 11% to $232 million, or 1.7% of revenue, down approximately 71 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased to 10%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating loss was $28 million or 0.2% negative operating margin compared with GAAP operating income of $79 million. 
Our income tax expense was $83 million. GAAP net loss was $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared with net income of $63 million and $0.14 per diluted share. The third quarter 2012 includes a loss of $169 million, $0.37 per diluted share, related to our equity-method share of losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets including goodwill. As of the end of September, the book value of our equity-method investment in LivingSocial was $94 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased $1.08 billion year-over-year to $5.25 billion. Inventory increased 34% to $5.07 billion, and inventory turns were 9.7, down from 10.8 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 28% to $8.37 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 75 from 72 in the prior year. Our Q3 2012 capital expenditures were $716 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including web services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.
It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2012, we expect net sales of between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, or growth of between 16% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 45 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates; GAAP operating income or loss to be between $490 million loss and $310 million income compared to $216 million income in the prior year. This includes approximately $290 million for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation, other operating expense to be between a $200 million loss and $600 million income compared to $462 million income in the prior-year period.
We expect capital expenditures for ongoing operations, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
We expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion related to the purchase of our currently leased corporate office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington.
We remain head sound focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.",1056

Tom, first on international margin. I know some of that actually is affected by currency. And I was wondering if you could speak to the effect of currency that it's having on margin. And then secondly, what else is driving that down? I would anticipate China investment, digital in Italy and Spain being contributors there. And then secondly, on shipping revenue up 44% year-over-year, I was wondering if you could break that down between shipping revenue or more Prime versus the change in the revenue allocation of SBA?",93
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2314.0,370887.0,17734145.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,6,"To take the first part of your question, Scott, as it relates to operating profit in International, you have the big pieces, correct. The first one is we're investing certainly very heavily in capacity. And so you're seeing that, both fulfillment and infrastructure capacity that's impacting our results there. In addition to that, we're investing in a number of new geographies. We've talked about Italy and Spain over the last several calls. Those are certainly having an impact. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have there. But certainly, those are investments right now. China, as you also mentioned, is a great long-term opportunity for us, but certainly an investment, and it's impacting that number. In addition, one that I don't think you did mention was video content for international. We're investing heavily in video content through our subsidiary LOVEFILM for Europe. So those are the things that are the primary drivers of which you're seeing in operating income and  international. In terms of shipping revenue, there's not a lot I can help you with. There's a number of factors that go into that number. If you take a look at both the shipping revenue and then the resulting net shipping cost, if you will, the net shipping cost is getting a little bit better over time as we get closer and closer to customers with our FC footprint. So those are some of the things. But again, a lot of dynamics that are certainly impacting that shipping revenue number.",251

Anything about the comp or any read into that? And secondly, given all the infrastructure investments you've made, Tom, you just mentioned some of the shipping efficiencies were also film as a percentage of revenue kind of start narrowing a little bit. Do you think you've reached a bit of a cyclical -- investment cyclical tipping point? Or am I over reading into just one quarter?",81

As you mentioned, it was a deceleration from last quarter. Keep in mind still, the 39% growth is still growing at a faster rate than revenue, one. Two, if you take a look at last year's unit growth in Q3, the 53% that we had, that was the second highest quarter that we've had in growth rate in the last 10 years. So we're overlapping a very strong growth last quarter. In terms of fulfillment expense, certainly -- and as we've talked about over the past few years, stepping up very heavily in 2010 and 2011 and '12 from a fulfillment standpoint. We've just seen unprecedented growth, and we've added a lot of capacity. In terms of where it will level off, we'll have to wait and see. Right now, we're still experiencing very strong growth with 30% growth on a local currency basis, 39% unit growth. So we're going to continue to invest where we need to. And the fulfillment capacities we do have we're going to make sure that we operate it as efficiently as we can and get more efficient with that capacity over time.",199

And I was hoping you could give us a sense of how that cohort of users might be tracking in terms of their buyer activity, and in particular, how you're seeing them if they're over indexing in terms of media content, consumption, Prime usage and overall purchasing? And how do you feel about that strategy now as you're -- as you continue to tie Prime into devices?",80

We like the idea of selling our Kindle Fires and then being rewarded through purchases of content going forward. All that being said, even though we're rewarded with those sales, customers realize that we're going to make sure that we work on behalf of them to make sure that content is not only very wide but also at great prices. And so we continue to work with -- to make sure that we can provide that on the customer's behalf. But we're seeing very good shopping patterns on all types of content with the selection that we have. We're seeing customers not only purchase content. We're seeing customers -- Prime customers certainly being active in watching free content as well, and that's working very well. So it's a great combination of things that are going on there and engagement with the device.",162

So intuitively, it makes a lot of sense what it is that you were doing. But can you maybe just speak to the effectiveness of the selling the device or all these devices to kind of near breakeven may be. Is there any metric that you can point to, to help us understand the lifts you get, either in terms of the frequency or of buying or a lift in average transaction value or anything that could kind of help us gauge from the outside the success of that strategy? And then second, maybe if you could just speak to the thinking behind your content cost related to your streaming service going forward. Just how should we be thinking about it?",134

But as I mentioned in the previous question, certainly customers are engaged in a device. They are purchasing content. They are also, in the case of video, they're purchasing content as well as watching free content. In the case of books, they're purchasing books as well as, if they're Prime members, they're participating in free content. So those are things that are going very well. We like what we see there, which is why we continue to invest in that business, which is why you see the offerings, the very compelling offerings that we have out there right now. So those are things that you should expect us to do more of. In terms of the content spend, if you're referring to the -- related to Prime Instant Video, I think it's probably what you're referring to, we have added a lot of content. We like what we see so far. We'll continue to monitor it very carefully. You should expect us to add more content going forward. We launched Prime some number of years ago now, and we had a little over 1 million items at launch. We then expanded that dramatically with many physical items. We're now offering digital items through Prime as well, most notably and certainly in books and video, and we're monitoring the performance very closely. But again, so far we're seeing great new subscribers coming out of these efforts and we like what we see so far.",274

It is early. The only thing I could point to is we collect in over, either sales tax or its equivalent value added tax, we collect in over 50% of revenue today.

When I think about the types of investments that we're making in terms of predictability, certainly I would consider the fulfillment capacity to be more the running of the business-type investments. We have a lot of experience starting up new facilities, operating those efficiently. And to the point where -- as you know, we've extended that not only to offer that service for our Retail business, we also offer that to sellers through Fulfill by Amazon. So those are things that we feel -- certainly, those investments we feel good. But what you are seeing is certainly just a very large ramp that we've done starting in 2010 through now. And it's one of these investments -- we only make those investments where we absolutely need to. But in terms of deploying that capital and those resources, we feel very good about it.",156

So we feel the growth has been in the high-20s to low-30s over the past several quarters. Certainly, we're reading the same thing that you're reading in terms of the softness. Hard to tell how much that's impacting us. Again, when you look at 27% growth rates, I still think that's pretty solid in the environment. Again, hard to tell how much we're impacting -- impacted by that. In terms of social, we're certainly very -- looking at a lot of different ways to reach customers. And certainly, that's an opportunity for us and something that our -- certainly our advertising and marketing teams are very conscious of and working on ways to best monetize for those channels.",167

First is on Brazil, second on fulfillment. So you guys are hiring in Brazil for local content and relationships for Kindle and some warehouse personnel. So how important do you view that market in terms of the Retail business? When do you think you could be in Brazil with a Retail presence? And then the second question is fulfillment as a growth -- as a percent of gross profit, showed year-on-year leverage for the first time in like 3 years. So do you feel like you've turned the corner on some of the capacity improvements? Or given the pace of new facilities that you're putting in, is there any reason why that would reverse back down again from here?",123

Certainly, Brazil is an interesting geography, as well as -- there are others. And we certainly export to Brazil today. But beyond that, there's not a lot to talk to. In terms of fulfillment, you are seeing a little bit of leverage in Q3 versus what we've seen in the past few years. Again, it's one quarter. I wouldn't read too much into that at this stage. But certainly, we feel good about the footprint that we have. We feel good about a lot of the capacity that we've added since 2010. Some of that capacity, going back, is getting more productive than it had been. The challenging part is obviously we're layering on a sizable number of FCs this year on top of that, that you're seeing the cost for. So those -- again, the 19 that we've announced today.",163

And so it's very early, but that's the -- it's just one additional way that we can add a selection for customers and be able to get it to customers profitably. So again, there's not much more to it than that.",68

I guess when you look into your holiday -- as you might go into the holiday season with your third-party inventory last year hitting sort of a bump with video games as well as some of the Thailand floods, I was wondering what types of steps you guys are kind of doing to better prepare yourselves for a holiday season, this upcoming holiday season? And the second question is wondering how we should think about the increasing cost -- shipping cost leverage as you go into 2013, with your distribution centers much closer and a higher percentage of FBA units?",103

We're -- as you can see from our inventory at the end of Q3, it started. We're adding inventory, getting ready for the holiday season that will happen throughout Q4. We're continually trying to increase our in-stock levels, so you're certainly seeing some of that already in the numbers. And we're very excited about getting ready for a great holiday season, and that's with our own retail inventory. Certainly we have sellers who are selling on our platform will be doing the same thing, and we're getting forward to have a great experience for customers during Q4. In terms of shipping cost leverage, I think there's a great opportunity over a longer period of time. In terms of providing what that would happen from a short-term leverage standpoint, it'd be premature to do that at this stage. But we can check in, in future periods and talk more about that.",159

On the North America media segment, just a modest deceleration. I would imagine that digital content sales and download to rent probably grew much faster than the growth rate of that segment. And so I'm just wondering if there's anything specifically that you can call out that was weighing that growth rate down in that segment, whether it's physical, media or otherwise?",65

Digital content is growing very fast, and it's reflected in the number that you see there. Beyond that, there's not a lot of call outs with the exception of -- if you look back over the past 5 quarters, certainly, the highest growth we've had would be Q3 of 2011, which we're lapping. So that's the other factor. But again, very, very good growth on the digital media side. Also keep in mind that the growth of digital will also trail our device sales. And given the new launches that we've had recently, that'll be good for digital content sales going forward.",107

And since then, I've got more anecdotal evidence of people getting a lot of same-day delivery, especially here in New York. There was some news from Wal-Mart that they were going to start shipping from their stores. So just -- could you give us any updated thoughts or philosophy you might have around what's an appropriate amount of time to strive for to deliver to people? And then as a quick follow-up to that, it seems like every quarter you're guiding to sort of 1% operating margins. And I'm just wondering, like is that a philosophical way that you're managing the business? Is there sort of an infinite number of things that you guys could spend on if you wanted to and we should expect this sort of level going forward?",148

And what I was referring to last time was -- I said -- I talked about -- with a large amount of selection broadly, that that's certainly challenging to do same-day everywhere. It's certainly a challenge from an economic standpoint. That being said, we -- if you look back over the past several years, we have done -- added a lot of capacity. We're getting -- we have large FCs that are closer and closer to customers. That has helped improve our delivery speed to customers. And programs like Prime specifically has helped us get closer and closer to customers from a delivery speed standpoint. So what I would expect moving forward would be more of the same. We're going to continue to improve the customer experience in every possible way we can, which includes getting closer to customers from a shipping standpoint. And we feel good about that. And again, you've seen improvements in the past year and in the past several years, and New York is one of those examples where you're seeing certainly shipments going in same-day in cases.",199

Can you just talk about what you're seeing on returns on the investments you've been making over the last 2 years? And as far as like return on invested capital, is the profile of your returns changing over time as you think about history? And then when can we start seeing kind of returns on this as far as revenues improving or kind of some of the financial ratios starting to turn? Can you give us any thoughts on how you're thinking about that? And then just a financial question. U.S. revenues for other were up 63%, and then international was plus 15% for other, and I think the difference is AWS. Is there any other big differences between the 2 geographies that we should think about?",163

But what I can tell you is in terms of our profile, you think about the parts of our business, the Retail business, I feel very good. We have a lot of experience in terms of getting great returns for shareowners. We feel it's something that we have, again, a lot of experience in as we've added new categories, in particular geographies. Oftentimes we've already launched those in other geographies, so we're able to learn from the experiences we've had to date. So we feel good about those. We have a great portion of our businesses and our media business is converting to digital. So we've talked a lot about that and feel very good about the opportunity that we have there both in terms of making great devices, as well as integrating content into those devices. And so we feel good about that business, and it's growing very fast. In terms of our Web Services business, that's a -- if you start with the core operation of that business, we've been in that part of the business serving Amazon, the customers, since inception. We've added a lot of new services that have helped both Amazon internally, as well as external customers. We like the characteristics of the potential -- ROIC potential of those -- of that business as well. Our third-party business continues to grow on our consumer business dramatically, and we like the ROIC potential of those. We're investing in a lot of new geographies, a few in a last couple of years. And on top of that, China. China's -- you should think about that one as more of a long-term opportunity, something that we're going to be investing in for several years. You shouldn't be expecting high returns of invested capital in the short run in that geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective. Italy and Spain, we're in investment mode in those geographies. But again, those are more in line with some of the other geographies we're in, in terms of time line for returns and feel very good about those. So hopefully, that gives you some picture of a little bit of the landscape and how we're thinking about ROICs.",389
