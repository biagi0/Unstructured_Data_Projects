Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Olsavsky, Vice President and CFO of our Global Consumer business. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 29, 2015, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press releases, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.",215
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2719.0,752830.0,32998352.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow, divided by the average total assets, minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.
I'll turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights.",163

Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion or 18%, excluding the $895 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%. Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year.
EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21%, or 24% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased 53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 43% of paid units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web Services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of revenue compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.62 billion or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of revenue compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue compared with 6.6%. Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22% to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing 72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange. In EGM, revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 67% of international revenues, up from 63%.
International segment operating income was $20 million, down from $151 million in the prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04 billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591 million compared to operating income of $510 million in the prior year. Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion, and international revenue grew 12% to $33.52 billion or 14%, excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10%, excluding the favorable year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. And operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior year. GAAP operating income decreased 76% to $178 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior year.
And now back to Tom with guidance.",594
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2719.0,752830.0,32998354.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail at our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, a growth between 6% and 16%. This guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $450 million loss and $50 million in income compared to $146 million in income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between 0 and $500 million in income compared to $502 million income in the first quarter 2014.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services beginning with first quarter 2015. We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.",338

You had a strong holiday season, 100 million more items shipped for free this holiday while FBA units was up 50% and fulfillment expense remained relatively flat. How did you manage that? Are the new sortation centers essentially the key to controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are FBA?",56

In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units of third-party paid physical units are over 40%. And in terms of the fulfillment discussion, we certainly -- Q4 is our most seasonal quarter. You can see that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we've got in other quarters. Again, most seasonal quarter, not a lot to add to that. But we continue to ship on behalf of our, obviously, retail offerings as well as FBA that's included in that.",90

We actually started in the late summer, early fall. We go through that process. We take a break for the seasonal holidays and then we get back to it, so we're in the process of finalizing it right now. And the teams are putting even more energy and attention on driving, what we would call, fixed expense and variable expense productivity as well as other efficiency projects. There's many, many different pieces that go into that. But certainly, we've added a lot of people and structure over the last several years. And so we have been putting focus on that, but we're just putting even more focus on it as we finalize our plans for 2015.",137

You should expect that we'll be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our Web Services business, which is growing very fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity. As we've done in prior years, we've kind of updated you a bit as we've gone along. And so we'll do that from time to time during the year as well in '15. So stay tuned on that.",90

It looks like overall costs accelerated quite a bit to around 17% growth in 4Q from 30% in 3Q. I wonder if anything specific led to that improved overall growth from -- is it maybe the key of a rollout? And then quickly, I think there's mentioning around breaking out AWS results. I'm wondering if any reason now, perhaps it's getting to a level that it's -- you have to do it?",77

We had unit growth of 20% year-over-year. Certainly, our FBAs growing at a faster rate. It's -- the sellers were up 65% over the years. It's greater than 40% of our units. And again, the teams continues to work on getting productivity there. In terms of AWS, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business for 2015. And so our plan is to start breaking it out as of Q1 of this year.",92

I think you noted Prime is growing faster internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us reconcile that with the difference between your North America and international EGM growth rates?,41
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2719.0,752830.0,32998369.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,19,"If you take a look -- yes, what I had mentioned was Prime worldwide is up 53% year-over-year. So it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the U.S. and even higher in international. And so what I was -- the reason -- both are contributing to the growth rates that you're seeing. But we're certainly at an earlier stage in international. So it's an opportunity for us, but in terms of the number of Prime members relative to the U.S. is smaller. So it's an earlier phase. So again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us, and certainly something that we're focused on.",109
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2719.0,752830.0,32998370.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,20,Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Research.,10

Can you comment on your view of the relative value proposition of Prime in European markets and Japan. Is it similar to the U.S., 2-day shipping and all the other benefits? Or is it different? Because we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European markets is much, much lower. And you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the U.K., for example. So what's the fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the U.K. is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it proposition? The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position and now -- and it's a very large market and it's easy to see from the outside that you're hiring aggressively both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the opportunity in your position, what specifically prevents you from hiring faster, developing more products, investing more? How do you balance -- what prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or 3 times as much in AWS?",189
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2015",2015-01-29,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2719.0,752830.0,32998372.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,22,"In terms of, say, I'll take the AWS one first, we are expanding very rapidly. We are -- have been hiring a lot of great people over the past few years and several years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We're making sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon, and we're super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that, certainly, in our CapEx numbers and the assets we're acquiring with some of our capital leases, you see that represented. So again, we are investing very heavily both in terms of people as well as capital for that business. And we share your excitement about the business. In terms of the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography. And we continue to make it better in all of the geographies that were -- that we have Prime. That's something that we're focused on. The shipping speed is different by geography, a bit. And so -- but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in those geographies. But the one thing is different is you mentioned is that the proposition or the timing. So the proposition is a little bit different, but we'll continue to work on making it better for the geographies that we have it in but the timing is different. We did launch in the U.S. first, then we launched into other geographies following that. So as a result, it's just earlier in these other geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity and something that we're focused on.",288

What's your thought or outlook for pricing in AWS cloud business for this year? Do you -- it was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it'll be quite as competitive in 2015? And then in the media business, we've been hearing data points about a slowdown in the eBook space. Are you seeing that? And sort of what's your outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to improve as a result of that?",87

Certainly, that's something that we've been focused on since early launch. It's something we continue to focus on. It's hard to predict what will happen going forward. So it's -- we really can't comment on what we might or might not do there. But certainly it's something that we've had -- since launch, we've had many, many -- it's in the high 40s, I think, in terms of pricing actions there. So we're very excited to make sure that we have great prices for customers. In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You're seeing some softness in the growth rate there. I just want to point out, certainly one of the larger factors or largest factor that's in that number is keep in mind that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers, and last year was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is, when you have those launches, you also have video games that are -- the video game sales themselves are also strong. So for example, if you look at North American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you're seeing that impact. So that's what you're seeing there, so.",233

Amazon's always pitched itself in terms of price, selection and convenience to customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley the last couple of weeks about this global survey that kind of indicated a little bit of shift in consumers' interest in online commerce more towards convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition of consumers is shifting. If it's shifting to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years and more towards convenience. Are you seeing that kind of shift? There's a lot of implications if that's, in fact, what is happening.",112

In terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the fundamental inputs that we've talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and convenience, we see that with Prime members. Prime members are buying more. It's more convenient. They're getting their product -- physical product to them faster when they're -- versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that, so that certainly speed of delivery helps. We also see -- we need to make sure, and it's something that we are always focused on, is having -- making sure we have great prices, and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's something we focus on. We do think that's important for customers. And we need to be -- have the selection be in stock when a customer comes to our detail page, it matters. And so I don't view it as a shift. I view it as there's certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what shopping and operating a business online does.

One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire phone in the quarter. And then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices impact your model?

We continue to sell. I had mentioned we had a little bit over 80 million of inventory at the end of Q3 and it'll continue to sell through that in Q4. In terms of fuel prices, not a lot to call out there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, over a long period of time if it's sustainable, we should see some benefits there.",83

We have a lot of opportunities in front of us that we've talked about, and we're also being selective with those opportunities. We have added a lot of resources over the past years. We've certainly been in the heavy investment cycle. I mentioned earlier we're in the process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We always put energy into various productivity measures, but we're putting even -- the team is even putting more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 plans. We'll have to see where that ends up, but putting more energy and focus around our various fixed productivity, variable expense productivity, efficiency projects and again, a wide range of different activities, and so that's what we're doing. And you'll just stay tuned to see how that progresses as we go.",146

First, on India, can you talk about the India opportunity broadly and maybe some advantages you may have versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale? That market appears to be just on fire right now, so just a little bit of color on India. And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms of purchasing frequency, how it looks today versus maybe a Prime member that joined 2 years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very early Prime adopters from 6, 7 years ago. But just more recently over the last couple of years, is the behavior consistent as you grow the base?",122

In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing certainly in India and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a very good team there, and we're excited to participate. Again, we think it is very early. And so we like the opportunity there. In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with on that. But what I would say is this, certainly, as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see a very sizable step-up in their purchasing patterns. And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we're seeing -- another thing that we're seeing is certainly, as Jeff references in the quote, Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital offering. It's unique that way. We see, for example, although it's still very early and we're learning and investing in this area. But take video content, for example. What we see is customers that come in who come in through our Prime pipeline for video for free trial. Those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels. We see that customers that are streamers, video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they're renewing at even higher rates than others. We see those people, who are -- customers who are streaming have very similar purchase patterns on the physical product side as those who don't. And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from a customer experience standpoint, which we think is great. And so those are the things that we're seeing in Prime right now. And we're -- with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizable base, tens of millions, we think is very interesting and it's something that we're very focused on as we continue forward.",320

In North American media, aside from the video game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors driving the kind of low or flattish growth year-over-year. And then CapEx kind of is up about 40% in 2014. It's kind of bounced around over the years. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of the level of growth in 2015.",66

In terms of the North American media, number of different, certainly, puts and takes there. But certainly, by far, the biggest one is the one I called out, which is the video game consoles. So if you go at the growth rate in Q4 last year, meaning in 2013 and Q4 '14, you see a big difference. And the biggest, the most sizable difference there is certainly video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So another way to say it is the video game consoles and video games portion of that is down year-over-year. And obviously, years ago, we put the video game consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games and their kind of larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that when you look at the growth for when you compare '13 growth -- Q4 '13 growth to Q4 '14 growth there. In terms of CapEx, we're not giving guidance on the 2015 spend. But given the high usage rates that we've had in Web Services, you should expect that we'll be spending CapEx to support that growth and we'll certainly be adding new fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital. So if you look at our capital lease activity, point to that, that's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly, number of different investments that are -- number of different types of CapEx that go into that financing. But the biggest piece is certainly infrastructure to support our business, primarily on the AWS side. So again, that's also included in that number.",284

In terms of the sort centers, and I would say just in, I would say, in addition to sort centers, what's happened over the course of the last several years is with all the fulfillment centers that we've added, we've actually gotten selection closer to customers. And so that's helped us from a delivery speed standpoint. It's helped us from a cost standpoint in terms of transportation costs being closer to customers. And so it's a natural result of the footprint that we've added. In terms of sortation centers, a lot of benefits to that. But certainly one of them is as you get closer and closer, certainly throughout the year, it's helped us with holiday deliveries, it's helped us with Sunday deliveries, and as we get closer to in this case, December to the holiday -- end of the holidays, it certainly helped us from a delivery-to-customer standpoint. So very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers and really, the global team, fulfillment team around the world, think they did a terrific job during the holiday season as they did throughout the year.",186

First one is certainly, the growth rates -- the real growth rates are slower in international versus North America, certainly would have an impact. The second is we continue to invest in international in terms of adding capacity for infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity as our -- if you look at our international growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a higher rate than revenue.

AWS is certainly part of that and impacting that. Also, just to keep in mind, our third-party growth is growing at a faster rate than retail. And so certainly, that's having an impact. And then obviously, continuing to lower prices for customers as well as working with our partners on the vendor side to support those activities from a pricing standpoint. So those are the dynamics. And in terms of '15, beyond the guidance that we're giving, there's not a lot of call out there. But we've had a great success of being able to grow our retail offerings. Our marketplace side is -- has grown very nicely over the years, including 2014. The team's done a great job there, fulfilled by Amazon. In terms of number of sellers, continue to grow there. The percentage of paid physical units are approximately 40% -- a little over 40% of the total there, so that's become much more meaningful over the past several years, so very happy about that.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including the most recent annual report on Form 10-K.

I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 47% to $7.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $3.16 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.68 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 14%, up from 9%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends. The combination of common stock and stock-based towards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 15% to $22.72 billion or 22% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 20%. Active customer accounts was approximately 278 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 260 million, up from approximately 230 million in the comparable prior-year period. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 44% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.40 billion or 67.8% of revenue compared with 71.2%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $6.62 billion or 29.1% of sales, up approximately 290 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.67 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 11.3%. Tech and content was $2.52 billion or 11.1% of revenue compared with 9.2%. Marketing was $1.05 billion or 4.6% of revenue compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. Beginning in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. In addition, we have provided historical results for these segments for 2014 and 2013 with our earnings release filing today. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 24% to $13.41 billion. Media revenue grew 5% to $2.97 billion. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.25 billion, representing 76% of North America revenues. North America segment operating income increased 79% to $517 million, a 3.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 77%.
In the international segment, revenue decreased 2% to $7.74 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 14%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.32 billion or increased 2% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 4% to $5.38 billion or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 69% of international revenues. International segment operating loss was $76 million compared to a loss of $33 million in the prior-year period. The unfavorable impact from foreign exchange to international segment operating loss was $78 million.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 49% to $1.57 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 8% to $265 million, a 16.9% operating margin. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS's segment operating income decreased 13%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 41% to $706 million or 3.1% of revenue, up approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 45%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $255 million compared to $146 million in the prior-year period.
Our income tax expense was $71 million, GAAP net loss was $57 million or negative $0.12 per diluted share compared with a net income of $108 million and $0.23 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $5.12 billion year-over-year to $13.78 billion. Inventory increased 10% to $7.37 billion and inventory turns were 8.8, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 13% to $11.92 billion and accounts payable days increased to 70 from 68 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion or growth of between 7% and 18%. This guidance anticipates approximately 750 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and a positive $50 million of income compared to a $15 million loss in second quarter 2014. This includes approximately $600 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to $404 million in the second quarter of 2014.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.",1029

So North America operating margin, up 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%. A lot of good cost efficiency, but again, we're continuing to invest selectively as we build the Prime platform and invent on behalf of customers. So you'll see a lot of invention definitely to feed the Prime platform, which things like video content, Prime music, as we talked about Prime Now devices, and we'll continue to build fulfillment centers for selection, expansion and FBA. So it's generally what's driving the operating margin in North America.",89

So I think you'll see a lot of invention -- you're seeing a lot of invention from us in China right now. Amazon is a trusted source of authentic international products, and that's really what we're doubling down on now, with the Amazon global store on our own site, which gives Chinese customers access to over a million Amazon products globally. And then the Tmall flagship store for international brands, which you've heard about, giving thousands of direct imported products access -- customers access to these products. And those happen to be stocked and ready to ship from our fulfillment centers in China. So that's an added benefit. 25% of those are -- over 25% of those are exclusives to Amazon. So we continue to be selective in our investments there, but we're taking the long-term view, and we have hopes for the new initiatives along with the global store and the Tmall flagship store.",161

But the growth was down 2% on a dollar basis, up 14% on a local currency basis, so we did see a little bit of improvement in terms of growth rate acceleration versus the last couple of quarters. And in addition to the things that Brian mentioned earlier about the Prime platform, that's something that we're doing globally. And so we're certainly -- all those things we're working on globally. So those are things that at least in most geographies, we have today. One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at the growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1, we talked about in April 1, there was a consumption tax increase in Japan. We had some, we think, some pre-buys in Q1 and we're overlapping that in Q1 of this year, so it's a headwind, if you think about it for Q1. But we're looking -- we think there's still a big opportunity, as we mentioned last call, big opportunity with Prime. Prime's growing at a faster rate. We think there's still a great opportunity to add unique selection for category expansion, and again -- so we're going to continue to feed the Prime platform, as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories. We're also very excited about India. If you take a look at our results from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative $76 million on a dollar basis. If you back out exchange, that's approximately breakeven. Included in there, we certainly have a sizable step-up in investment in India, and we're super excited from what we see there right now. We think it's very -- a big opportunity, and we're investing appropriately for that big opportunity. So those are some of the things that we're working on, and we think there -- we still have a lot of opportunity there moving forward.",342

So it's the things that both Brian and I talked about that we're doing globally to support the Prime platform. All those things that we mentioned, video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices, those are all intertwined and certainly part of that. And then some of the things outside of -- that are more specifically related to international in addition to those are some of the geographic stuff that we talked about. So I think just think about it that way, that certainly think it's a big opportunity, and again, one of the reasons I wanted to give you an update last quarter on Prime growth, and you can see that, that's going very well. And so we're feeding that, and that's what we have been doing, and that's what you see also in certainly the results that you're seeing today.",225

And then a question on AWS pricing. It seemed like the pricing environment was pretty competitive last year. What are you seeing in the market this year? And what are your expectations going forward? Are you expecting a bit more of a stable pricing environment?",131

The one thing that I did mention around, from a country perspective, was India in terms of we certainly stepped up our investment. And if you look at it year-over-year -- so that's certainly reflected in the numbers that you're seeing. In terms of AWS, we've had 48 price decreases since inception. The team is doing a terrific job in terms of working on behalf of customers to pass on savings as they see it. But in terms of any comment on what to expect going forward, there's not pretty much to add there.",106

My first is -- my first question is about the profitability of the North America segment. You mentioned a few minutes ago that investments in Prime were part of the -- most of the explanation for what is a relatively low 3.9% margin in North America, which are much lower than the 5% to 6% EBIT margin that the brick-and-mortar retailer books despite the large benefit of booking 3P net. Here's the question. Prime is not new in North America. You probably have tens of millions of Prime users in the U.S., 30 million, 40 million, 50 million, yet margins are still low. What gives you confidence that the investments you are making will pay off? Second question on AWS, if you look at expenses like R&D, perhaps even this fixed component of marketing and sales, which presumably one day will be really fixed, are these still growing significantly? In other words, is there room for significant margin expansion at some point in the future when AWS is, I don't know, 2x, 5x or 10x its current size? Or do you expect that it will scale up as the same rate as revenues?",196
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2877.0,793870.0,34584885.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,28,"In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the comments we made last quarter that we disclosed was -- we disclosed the growth rate globally as well as the growth rate in the U.S. And the growth rate in the U.S. after 10 years is up 50% -- was up 50% year-over-year, and so 2014 versus 2013 in terms of Prime membership. And that's after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99. So it gives you a feel for the work that we've put into Prime to make that experience great for customers, and the value that we're giving them. So again, given that growth. And so that's certainly one of the things that gives us comfort. But when we look at the individual pieces, we like what we see. So in other words, from the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give -- one example would be video content, both original and licensed content. We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers. And what we've seen to date is it certainly is still an investment for us. It's certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see. We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline, if you will, for video content. They convert at a higher rate. We see -- we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who stream, actually, we retain those at a higher rate. And we bring in new customers through our video pipeline. The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipelines. So in other words, they're buying very good from a physical product standpoint as well as digital. So they're buying a diverse set of products. So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us, customers who buy consumables from us, they'll by clothing from us, they'll buy shoes from us, they'll buy electronics, they'll buy media items, so that's what we're seeing. And so again, it's -- some of these things are very early. We'll have to see over time how efficient they are, but each period we go, we keep -- the data that we see, we're encouraged. And so that's just one example, but that's why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it's a great -- the Prime platform, if you will, we think is a great opportunity. And again, as I mentioned earlier, all these things we're investing in are very intertwined.",440

But if we look in the past, I assume that if the base in '14 and in full year '13 was probably depressed for North American retail margins, North American segment margins, and if we look back 5, 6 years, it's probable that, that was running in kind of mid- to high single-digits CSOI margins, kind of similar to the incremental margins you just reported for that segment, 8.7%. So I guess the big question I want to ask is, is there a structural change in the North American retail business over the next -- this year and the next couple of years, versus what you had, call it, in 2004 to 2009 when the margins were, I think, pretty clearly higher and now you're going to be recovering to those levels.

Just in terms of going forward, we're not giving any specific guidance beyond the current quarter. So I can't predict for you what could happen. But what you mentioned is -- in some of the periods that you were describing, is you mentioned what our business looked like several years ago when we -- Prime was nascent and we were a bit early in the business. And so we go through different cycles. We're certainly still investing very heavily. That being said, we, as I mentioned last quarter, we're spending time on making sure that we get productivity. So we're working on both investing heavily in the business, we're working on fixed and variable productivity in other areas, putting a lot more energy into it. That's what's helping us with the improvement that Brian mentioned in terms of operating margins year-over-year, there's a number of different aspects, but certainly mix of business and some productivity is certainly impacting that. But again, we think there's opportunities to improve margins over time. You'll have to stay tuned on that to see what it looks like. But we're certainly, as you can see from not only the results but some of the data points that we've given over the last several quarters, we are investing heavily in the business. Again, because we like what we see in Prime growing so dramatically globally after being in it for a long time, and we think that, that's a great platform to feed.",253

First, on AWS. I think those are higher than most of us were thinking. Appreciate the disclosure. What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passing through cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through to customers. And then secondly, on international margins, clearly below history, below the U.S. What kind of things need to happen to get those at least to where the U.S. is today, much less back to where they were 6, 7 years ago?",89
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2877.0,793870.0,34584892.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,35,"Justin, I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model over the long term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers. And so we've had 48 price decreases since we launched. As I talked about earlier, that's one factor, customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly.",83

And so again, we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about related to the platform, continue to invest in some emerging geographies, most notably certainly India with the step-up, given the experience we have. And so we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there. We think it's a great opportunity for us, and so that's what we're doing. But we're excited about the opportunity, and that's why you see the results that you're seeing there.",119

And then just on the question of Prime and Prime video, as we think about the way that media growth is trending now, is there a point where you start to think of allocating Prime -- some of those Prime revenues to media to account for the -- as Prime video usage increases?",99
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2015",2015-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2877.0,793870.0,34584896.0,Answer,Thomas Szkutak,,Executives,39,"Yes, in terms of the CapEx question, there's certainly 2 pieces of that. There's the consumer, the North America and international piece. There's a number of pieces, but certainly the 2 largest pieces would certainly be the CapEx associated with the fulfillment and the second would be infrastructure. And again, that's for AWS versus North America and international. I'll take the North America and international first. We're seeing good growth, and year-over-year, in terms of overall unit growth, in terms of revenue growth, certainly x exchange, as I mentioned earlier, it's early in the year. So as we do every year, we'll continue to monitor the growth there. We're making plans for the rest of the year, and we'll get back to you as we progress throughout the year in terms of what fulfillment capacity we'll need to support that growth this year. In terms of Web Services, it's obviously growing extremely fast. We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective. Over the last few quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there. In terms of the amounts, specific amounts, we're not giving guidance on that today. And one of the reasons is it's just growing so fast that we want to make sure we put the right amount of capital in place, and the team's done a great job doing all the planning and the execution around that. So that's what we're doing there. In terms of media, I'm not fully sure I understood the question. But as it relates to, I think, it's video, could you repeat that part of the question?",277

We -- certainly, as I said earlier, we see this as a natural extension of our existing infrastructure investment. With 109 fulfillment centers, we're getting very close to customers. It allows us and locks for us, same-day and next-day deliveries and to its extreme, 1-hour and 2-hour deliveries, as you've seen with Prime Now. So we're not forecasting or giving much more on that, but we definitely see it as a valuable customer proposition. Customers embraced it. Again, a smaller number of ascents [ph], tens of thousands of ascents but available for 1 or 2-hour delivery and generally in the category of essential products that you would need in a short time period.",118

They are very different. You'll see the growth rate in India is very rapid, as we talked about last year, and it's increasing our investment. I think the biggest difference is the focus on sellers and the connection of sellers. A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers all across India to succeed and grow their online businesses. You'll see from our press release that we've launched some new apps for that, so that helps them manage their inventory better and also respond to customer inquiries. So that's probably the biggest difference that we see between India and China, but -- and still very, very early on in India.",117

And we've done a lot of interesting things to help sellers, and that's why you see the results that we're seeing today. 44% of our units today, as of this quarter, are third-party units. That's up about 400 basis points from last year. Certainly, one of the things that we've talked about that's most -- that's notable is fulfillment by Amazon. And so the benefit for sellers is they get to take advantage of our multinode fulfillment network globally, we have 109 fulfillment centers globally, as well as our customers get to take advantage of that as Prime members where we offer in those geographies. So it's really a great benefit for sellers, it's good for sellers, it's good for customers and we believe good for share owners, too. So again, we're very excited, a number of different things we're working on, but certainly one of the drivers, along with all the things that I mentioned, certainly, FBA is very helpful.",188

I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third-party units. Obviously, in the fulfillment line, there is cost associated with that, as well as our other third-party units as well, with things like payment processing and other costs that we incur.

Again, we gave -- as we have in previous quarters, we gave a wide range, and from a consolidated segment operating income standpoint, we gave 100 to 650. The implied margin at the lower end to the higher end is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%. This quarter, in Q1, we're up 60 basis points year-over-year, in total, at the upper end of that forecast, implied would be up 80 basis points.

As I look at the seasonality, I wonder if there's any seasonality in margins. It looks like margins in 2Q and 3Q came in sub-10% versus maybe mid-teens in 4Q and 1Q. And then sort of looking at a different way, maybe given the dip in profitability in 2Q of last year, did that have any impact from the pricing cuts in April?",75

So revenue grew by about 21.5% sequentially and expense grew by around 10%. So obviously, we were growing faster on top line than our expenses. And over the long term, improvements in efficiency and innovation allow us to drive that kind of cost out of the business. I mean, there certainly was an impact with pricing changes, and you probably saw some of that in Q2 as well. But over the long term, that's the model we follow.

I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 69% to $8.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $4.37 billion, up from $1.04 billion. In the supplemental financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release, we include a few additional free cash flow measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.61 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. 
Return on invested capital was 17%, up from 6%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over 5 quarter ends.
Combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 488 million shares compared with 480 million 1 year ago. 
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 22%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 285 million. Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 265 million, up from approximately 237 million in the comparable prior year period. 
Worldwide seller units represented 45% of paid units, up from 41% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $15.16 billion or 65.4% of revenue compared with 69.3%.
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined was $6.95 billion or 29.9% of sales, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.74 billion or 11.8% of revenue compared with 11.8%. Tech and content was $2.70 billion or 11.7% of revenue compared with 10.4%. Marketing was $1.1 billion or 4.7% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to $13.8 billion. Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $10.99 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 80% of North America revenues.  North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million, a 5.1% operating margin. Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.
In the international segment, revenue increased 3% to $7.56 billion. Excluding the $1.37 billion year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 22%. Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 72% of international revenues.  International segment operating loss was $19 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue increased 81% to $1.82 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin. Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 168%. 
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $464 million compared to a loss of $15 million in the prior year period.
Our income tax expense was $266 million. GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $126 million or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $6.02 billion year-over-year to $14 billion. Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion. And inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection and improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 18% to $12.39 billion. And accounts payable days increased to 74 from 71 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date in what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand. And therefore, actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effect on guidance. The guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q3 2015, we expect net sales of between $23.3 billion and $25.5 billion or growth of between 13% and 24%. This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $580 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $100 million and $650 million compared to a $136 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.

Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business, if you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer? And think, in the past, you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS. And then, in the press release, you talked about expanding AWS into some new international markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS' business today is domestic and kind of what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS outside the U.S.?",134

Thanks for your question. So we will not be providing the granular customer detail unfortunately. But I will say, the growth of 81% was up from 49% in Q1.

What I can say about India is that when we see a positive surprise, we double down on it. That's kind of our policy. And India is that kind of surprise. So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen, the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers. Over $25 million -- excuse me, 25 million   ASINs, which is the largest online store in India and continue to improve pricing and fast delivery. So we're super excited about India.

We saw this coming for a long time, and profits seem to move around quite a bit year-over-year, and year against year, and I'm just wondering how you think about that. Is that just a nature of your big bets and that's just going to continue? Or is there a way to kind of smooth that out? And then, secondly, in AWS, it does seem like pricing competition has come down. And we've been to a lot of your events, and it seems like you're emphasizing pricing a little less to your customers. Can you talk at all about the pricing environment in cloud?",107

Let me start with that second question. So as Phil mentioned, we're seeing continued increases in usage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We're also seeing great efficiency in the business on a cost basis. Innovation is accelerating, not decelerating. We had over 350 significant new features and services. And we believe that's what customers -- where it resonates with customers. While pricing is certainly a factor, we don't believe it's always the primary factor. In fact, what we hear from our customers is that the ability to move faster and more agile is what they value. And I'm sorry, the first part of your question was?",106

Well, here's how I think about it. We have 2 things, at least 2 things going on. We're continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we're in. But we're also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace, Prime and AWS. If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think, Jeff Bezos put it really well. He said, we're going to look for things that are important to customers. Customers love them -- businesses that can grow to be a large size, that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades. So we will continue to invest in the businesses that we think fit that profile. And we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile. So as far as lumpiness, admittedly, it is lumpy. And we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward.",159

That's a great exit on his part. The -- on international retail, you had nice acceleration there. Could you give us a little bit more of the why behind that? Why would international revenue grow, particularly in EGM, accelerate pretty materially? And is that the impact? Is one thesis that the impact of kind of the buildup of Prime in international markets and also in the U.S., too, but more spend per Prime customers as they go through this evolution that it's just of layering on? Is that what it is? What is causing that acceleration?",104

We saw good acceleration in both North America and international this quarter. North America was up 200 basis points sequentially, and international was up 800 basis points. And half of that, you remember, we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last April 1 of 2014. It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year, particularly in Q2. And so we're lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis point sequential again, so -- but independent of that, yes, you're right, Prime membership continues to grow faster outside -- data we gave you at the end of the year, it's growing faster outside of the U.S. than it is in the U.S. We're happy with both growth rates, quite frankly. I would say the Prime membership, the Prime flywheel, the additional benefits that we're adding to Prime, not only in North America but also internationally, and an additional selection, both retail and FBA, which feeds the Prime flywheel.",172

The first one on the North America retail profitability was up nicely. Can you just talk to some of the drivers of that? Is it more top line and more Prime subs coming on? Or is it more on the logistics side? And what's driving the North America improving profitability? And then, the international profitability. Is there any way you can help us understand the profitability of the more mature international markets like U.K. and Germany relative to the U.S. at this point?",86

So let me start with North America. 5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2. You hit a nail on the head. A lot of it is the top line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis. So we are getting very good top line growth. A lot of that is fueled by Prime, Prime adoption. And we are dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with mainly efficiency projects. In international, we have not split countries out. What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange, the operating margin is up slightly versus sequentially and year-over-year. What you're seeing there is also obviously colored by investment or recent investment in India based on the momentum and success we've been seeing there so far.",160

First on Prime Day, Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early takeaways that you have? And then, also, perhaps more importantly, how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and then also the holidays later in the year? And then, also, can you just comment on the headcount, which I believe is up 18,000 or so sequentially, which I believe is the biggest number that you've ever added in a quarter. Is there anything in particular that stands out there or just more fulfillment centers, more geography expansion as well?",106
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2705.0,837994.0,36186670.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,24,"Let me start with that second question first. Yes, headcount was up 38% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is in operations where we're adding people for our new FCs and call centers. We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers. And so we're -- but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth. If you look at Prime Day, we're thrilled with the results of Prime Day, surpassed all of our expectations. Any metric we looked at, we think it was a huge success. Customers saved millions. New Prime members signed up in higher rates than we've ever seen. People bought more devices than on any other day. So it's a great success. My hat's off to the operations team and all the people who worked on that because it was a Christmas in July, quite frankly, bigger day than Black Friday, as we've said, and orders increased 266% year-over-year. I'll also point out that worldwide FBA unit order growth approached 300%. So not only was it a great day for Amazon, it was also a great day for our sellers, which is great. So while not breaking out the impact of Prime Day specifically, it's incorporated into our guidance.",212

I may be delusional, but if I add your capital leases and CapEx, that suggests that AWS capital intensity is at least 80%, if not much higher. What gives you confidence that if AWS continues to grow so fast and consuming so much capital, 2 years out, you'll be able to fund its growth from the retail business? And secondly, can you help me understand why you are not rolling out Prime Now and Fresh faster? What specifically are the bottlenecks there?",85

We are moving very quickly on Prime Now. We've now expanded to 9 cities, 3 more in the quarter, including our first international city in London. So we're moving quick, but we'd always like to move quicker, obviously. On AWS, I think, your question is more around the ability to fund AWS. No comment specifically on that. We do realize it's a capital-intensive business. And we have modeling that shows that it's going to be a very -- it is a very good business for us, and that's what we aim for is long-term return on invested capital and free cash flow. So we're certainly cognizant of the capital part of that calculation. So not much more I can add on that, Carlos.",136

Is there a level, particularly when you've been able to maintain pricing strength the way that you have been where you feel like margins start to become and the leverage that you have there start to become a catalyst for lowering prices?

Thanks for your question, Heath. Yes, I'll point out that we have continued to lower prices. We've had multiple price cuts this year. We're now up to 49 since launch in 2006. So it is a fundamental part of our business model. So is innovation. And as I said, we have over 350 new features and services that have also significant features and services that have launched this year. And as we were just talking with Carlos, the capital investment is very large as well. So we continue to fund it, and we're super excited with customer reception that we're getting and the feedback we get from large customers, and so we're thrilled with the business, and price reductions are part of that model.

So I want to go back to something that you said, Brian. You were saying -- you said that you've seen greater efficiency in that business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you can maybe parse that out a little more for us. Were you referring to OpEx or CapEx? And if you're referring to CapEx as well, have you -- do you feel that you've reached that escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for constant decline in that metric, CapEx as a percentage for that particular business?",110

What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the cost to generate the capacity for AWS. I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS. So we see it on the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's an intercompany relationship. So we get a double whammy there.

Can you just compare maybe the reductions earlier this year versus the ones across the board from last year in 2Q '14? And then, a follow-up, just on the third-party units. I think you mentioned third-party units are now 45% or maybe 47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there? Or does it matter as long as the customer experience through FBA is seamless?",86

We're really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first party or third party. And I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FBA sellers had with Prime Day. But we see FBA as a tailwind for the third-party business in general. When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014, about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we're really happy with what that's doing for the third-party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice. On the price-reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving cost out of the business. And you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch. And so it could be lumpy, but over the long haul, that's the model we followed.",215

On the engagement of Prime customers, we -- or excuse me, PIV customers. We've seen buying habits that look like normal Prime customers or other Prime customers from the group that comes into the digital pipelines. But we do also see a higher pickup in retention rates and free trial conversions. So we're very happy with the linkage between our digital offerings and the Prime customer base. On the content side, I will say that one of the factors in the sequential guidance Q2 to Q3 being lower is 2 things. I'll bring it up. What we're talking about is the fulfillment center -- additional fulfillment center costs that we see every - this time every year as we get ready for Q4 but also additional step-up in content spend, where we spend a lot of our content in Q3.

Eugene Munster,,Analysts,41,"Just want to follow up on a previous question. In past calls, you've talked about an increased focus on productivity. Is that still a focus of yours? And separately, is any thoughts in terms of how robotics are impacting, any updates in terms of number of robots in fulfillment centers?",50
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2705.0,837994.0,36186688.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,42,"Sure thing. Thanks for your questions, Gene. On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business. We had very high expectations for Amazon robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure. And we've been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that -- by that team. So that's looking great. Efficiency, yes, as we've talked about in the last few calls, we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity. I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen. To give you a little more color on that, I would say, what does that look like? We have defect reduction, and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our costs but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience. We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think is more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into those decisions. As I said earlier, we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business as -- on the Amazon side as well. We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and throughput of the fulfillment centers. And just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses and the sort centers that we added primarily last year all have helped our cost structure, so just a little more color on maybe some specifics on the efficiency area.",272

If you can't disclose that, can you maybe just give us a general sense of focus and strategy? How should we be thinking about domestic versus international as well as sortation versus traditional?

So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and 19 U.S. sort centers. And typically, we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need, so still a little early in the year to comment on that, but in the past, we've given an update sometime around Q3 on that. But continuing to build as we have demand, and like Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having inventory close to customers as well. So like I said, a little early for the update at this point, but something we're looking at and something that the team's working really hard on.",120

You're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one. But I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors. For example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer-tail categories. And then, secondly, in the press release, no mention of Fire phone. I think, almost every other product was mentioned. Can we just chalk that one up now to a learning experience and an example of where Amazon is showing some discipline around investments? Or how should we think about that?",100

We have a policy of not commenting on a road map, so can't give you anything there. We obviously do learn from everything we do and value the feedback we get from customers but nothing to share at this point. In terms of growth, we continue to see selection as a strong driver of growth. Prime is obviously very important as well, and we really haven't teased those apart. FBA becomes very important as well, and we've talked about some of the tailwinds we see there and sort of the linkage between Marketplace and Prime that FBA provides. So all those things are going on. As you've seen, EGM strength across a lot of the categories there. There was no single category we're really calling out but continue to see good selection growth and good Prime growth as well.",148

But philosophically, if we go back a few quarters, you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years start to benefit and pay off. And we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North American retail. And it looks like you're still investing heavily on international retail. So if we kind of look out 2016, 2017, is there any high-level philosophical commentary about whether you see next year as another year of these types of trends that you're seeing now? Or are there any bigger investment areas, particularly in the retail business, that you might be looking to take advantage of?",125

Yes, I can't forecast into the future on that. But I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now, which, again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform. That includes video content, including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now. We have a robust device business, including a launch of a new Paperwhite, Fire TV, Echo with general availability, and numerous other products that we're very excited about that road map. We know that those devices drive customer engagement in sales. We've built fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners. And then we had things like same-day delivery, which we talked about. On the AWS side, we continue to invest in that infrastructure. We talked about opening -- announcing a region in India, so there's expansion there as well. Feature expansion, services expansion, internationally, very similar to the U.S. on a number of the Prime fronts but also the investment in India. And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today: the launch of Mexico, which we're excited about, an Amazon business. So lots of -- as I said, lots of investment in front of us, but we operate in 2 paths. We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the businesses that we're in. We're investing wisely in things that we think are big and important. And it's not a static activity. We continue to evaluate those investments, take into account what customer response is and make changes. So I think you can look forward to a continuation of that into the future.",274

I know you guys are partnered with the post office and deliveries. Can you talk a little bit about how that is potentially benefiting and maybe the longer-term strategy with the post office? And then you guys haven't necessarily broken this out, but I think you do generate a fair amount of revenue from advertising. I think that's in the other category. Is there anything that you can provide on advertising revenue?",80

So I'll start with the first part of that question. We definitely are delivering a lot of packages with the post office. I think, most notably, they did a lot of the Sunday delivery that you saw when we started launching Sunday delivery. So we try lots of things for fulfillment. We're constantly working to provide the best experience to customers and be as efficient as possible. And so we're happy with all the partners we have and continue to work with them to provide the best experience possible. For advertising, I would remind you that certain parts of the advertising roll up into other. Some actually roll up to EGM and media as well. So it's a business we're really excited about. We're taking a customer-centric approach as we build that to make sure we're providing engaging business, engaging ads to customers and making sure we keep the customer front of mind. And it's a business that the team is excited about and are working hard on.",169

I mean, to my knowledge, I mean, foreign e-commerce operators such as yourself are not allowed to have first-party retail operations. But given the fulfillment and hence, customer service has always been a high-focus item for you guys, what steps have you taken in the country to make sure that the consumer experience there is as good, if not better, for the inventory on which you have no direct control? And secondarily, I mean, similar to China, you have a pretty large population base and Internet penetration currently that's probably comparable to what was the case when you had Joyo -- when you acquired Joyo. So can you provide any color on how the general operating environments are the same or different? And do you expect your growth trajectory there to be similar to what you saw in China?",149

So FBA, Easy Ship and some of those programs are important to us. They're very valuable for sellers. They make it easy for the seller to get their goods to the customer. They're great from a customer experience standpoint because we can do what we do best with the logistics. And so there's a lot of investments, a lot of efforts going on in that front. I would say that India and China are totally different. And I think, as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we're seeing there so far. And so very happy with the trajectory we're on there and excited to be investing and have the opportunities we do at that point.",142

Scott Tilghman,,Analysts,62,"I wanted to just follow up on a couple things, 3 quick questions. First off, on international, I was wondering if you could compare and contrast the relative performance of media and EGM moving in different directions? Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year, and it seems like your costs are coming down. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And then, third, just following up on Brian's question around the FCs. I was just wondering, how many of the facilities lend themselves to expansion rather than having to put up a new facility?",119
18749.0,"Amazon.com Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2015",2015-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2705.0,837994.0,36186709.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,63,"Sure. Let me start with the first question on international media and EGM. I think we're seeing similar trends in both geographies, those segments that EGM growth is much -- is very strong. Media growth has been consistent for the last 4 quarters. We do like the work being done in -- by the media teams. There's a lot of pipeline of invention, things like Prime Instant Video, Prime Music, all feed the Prime pipeline and Prime ecosystem, if you will. They work great with our devices, by the way. And they drive other nonmedia sales. So they're very tied together, although certainly, the EGM is outpacing the media segment -- or excuse me, media businesses right now. On transportation costs, not a lot to add there. Again, your -- we have a combination of our own shipping and using third-party carriers. So the rate increases are staged in. We see those quite frequently. So nothing to add there. On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think, we're looking to always to get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have. And as we need new facilities, we place them closer and closer to customers. So that can have its benefits as well but not much more to add on that one.",219

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2736.0,880695.0,37769239.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. 
Trailing 12 months operating cash flow increased 72% to $9.8 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less lease principal repayments, was $3.1 billion, up from an outflow of $99 million. Trailing 12 months free cash flow, less finance lease principal repayments and capital acquired under capital leases, was $637 million, up from an outflow of $2.3 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.4 billion.
Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 489 million shares, compared with 481 million 1 year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide paid unit growth was 26%. Worldwide active customer accounts was approximately 294 million. Excluding customers who only had 3 orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior year period. Worldwide seller units represented 46% of paid units, up from 42% in the comparable prior year period.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $16.8 billion or 66.1% of revenue compared with 71.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $7.6 billion or 30.1% of sales, up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.1 billion or 12.3% of revenue compared with 12.4%. Tech and content was $2.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue compared with 10.8%. Marketing was $1.2 billion or 4.8% of revenue compared with 4.7%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international and Amazon Web Services. Consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 28% to $15 billion or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Media revenue grew 8% to $3 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange.  EGM revenue grew 35% to $11.8 billion. EGM now represents 79% of North America revenues. 
North America segment operating income was $528 million, a 3.5% operating margin, compared to a loss of $60 million in the prior year period. North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the international segment, revenue increased 7% to $8.3 billion. Excluding the $1.3 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 24%.
Media revenue decreased 8% to $2.3 billion, or increased 6% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 71% of international revenues.
International segment operating loss was $56 million compared to a loss of $174 million in the prior year period. International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 78% to $2.1 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $521 million, a 25% operating margin, compared to $98 million in the prior year period. AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year. CSOI includes $25 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $406 million compared to a loss of $544 million in the prior year period. Our income tax expense was $161 million. GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $437 million or a loss of $0.95 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $7.5 billion year-over-year to $14.4 billion. Inventory increased 23% to $9 billion. And inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 22% to $14.4 billion; and accounts payable days increased to 79 from 74 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and customer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can all have material effects on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently. 
For Q4 2015, we expect net sales of between $33.5 billion and $36.75 billion or growth of between 14% and 25%. This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $620 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014.
We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. 
Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move on to questions.",1048

And I was wondering if you can just talk through some of the dynamics there: understanding the consumption tax in Japan comp; you have some newer markets where you have physical infrastructure now in Europe; and then also the dynamics in India and China as contributors. And then secondly, maybe if you can just -- given how profitable AWS has become, if you can give a framework for thinking about the long-term profitability of that business?",86

Thanks for your questions. On international, yes, you're right. The -- first of all, the FX-neutral growth of 24% year-over-year is up 200 basis points versus Q2 and up 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Some of that is due to the comping of the JP consumption tax increase in April of last year, which we said last year impacted Q2 and Q3 and to -- and not really impacted Q4. So we're seeing the last of that in the comp. But -- and the impact of Prime Day globally, we estimated about 200 basis points, and we saw a pickup in both -- I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that as international as well. That was a great event for -- a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike. But the base international growth is really being driven by Prime adoption, greater selection, greater Prime selection, including FBA. So it's essentially the same playbook as the U.S. The additional Prime features. We launched a Prime Now location in the U.K. this quarter, not materially going to impact the entire continent, but it's a good start. So we like the trends in international, and they mirror many of the same things we see in North America. On AWS, I don't remember your question -- the business model there. Yes, let me talk about margin, which was up sequentially from Q2 from 21.4% to 25%. We're continuing to see great acceleration in the pace of innovation. We've launched 530 new significant features this year, which is more than last year already. We continue to lower prices. We've lowered prices 8 times since a rather large price cut in April of 2014 -- excuse me, April of 2014. And they like -- the customers are really responding. They like the speed and agility that AWS provides them. They like the new features that we launched, many of which are also -- enable them to lower their cost of infrastructure. Amazon Aurora, 1/10 the price of other high-end commercial databases; a new storage class of Amazon S3 quick site, also very effective and cost-effective products for our customers. So like AWS, the model remains, yes, early days. And we enjoy leading this business, and customers responded well. And we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others. And we -- the growth rates and margins will certainly remain lumpy and bumpy as we go forward. But we're very, very encouraged by the business, and so are customers.",429

Margins were obviously quite strong in the quarter. Can you speak to the sustainability of the margin improvement that we've seen there? And sort of what is your long-term expectations for profit margins for this business? And if you can give a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business looked like in the quarter and kind of the rate of growth there would be helpful. And then secondly, your employee adds were fairly strong in the quarter as well. I wonder if you could call out any particular areas of -- within the business where you're sort of -- where you're strengthening your hiring efforts.",120

So I'll sort of echo what Brian said earlier. This is a young and rapidly growing business. And as you've seen, looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy. We're taking a very long-term view on this business. We're excited about the potential there. And really, the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continue to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer. So a lot of hard work going on there. But again, we're taking a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space. On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth. And so on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have. And some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions could be a little lumpy. We've mentioned a couple of new regions we're working on throughout the world, so that's going on as well.",206

This is going to be primarily our ops area. If you exclude ops-related employees, our headcount is growing actually slower than our FX-neutral growth rate of 30%. So what's going on in ops is we've added 14 net fulfillment centers this year, bringing the total to 123 globally. We've added four sort centers in the U.S., bringing the U.S. footprint to 23. We're staffing earlier in those locations. We're in good shape for the holidays and ready to go. The other issue is -- or the other reason is that we're also doing a lot of conversion of temp workers to full-time workers, purposefully. This is a metric, employment of full-time hires, so it is a little bit higher due to that program.",145

Could you talk about 2 areas? One, EGM growth in North America, it's accelerated really strongly. Any color behind what's -- any particular categories that are driving that? And secondly, there's been -- you've made some public comments in the last 8 months about some -- on the retail side about investments internationally, particularly in India. Could you just refresh us on what kind of levels of spend you're interested in targeting in that market? And then maybe as part of that, any comments on China and your -- how well you think you're doing there now?",111
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2736.0,880695.0,37769250.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,13,"Sure. On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection both our retail selection and also our third-party, particularly FBA, which is also Prime eligible. And then just the responsiveness of our customers, that's our share of Prime customers to the EGM product line. So we're very encouraged with the EGM growth. And on India, I will not -- excuse me, I won't give specific dollar numbers around investment, but I can give you an update on India. We're really encouraged with what we seeing both on the customer side and the seller side. On the customer side, seller -- excuse me, active customer accounts were up 230% year-over-year. We're in the middle of the Diwali season, that is going really well. Sales are 4x where they were last year, so customers are responding greatly this year. We continue to invest. We've been adding products at a rate of 40,000 products per day so far this year. And just as big is the number of sellers. The sellers, number of sellers has grown more than 250% year-over-year. 90% of those sellers are using our logistics and warehouse services. And as a result, we've tripled our fulfillment capacity year-over-year. So we are very encouraged, as I said, last quarter in India, and continue to invest there heavily.",229

This is Phil. So we're continuing to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple of quarters now. So the team has some interesting ideas, really focused on making Amazon a trusted conduit for Chinese customers to access authentic international branded products and things that the customers can't get. I think AmazonGlobal store continues to expand the selection there. We added about another 400,000 items to that store this quarter, and continue to focus on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to customers. We continue to test store on Tmall as well. And the team has some other ideas, but that's what we're talking about so far.",128

What I can tell you is the 3P percent of revenue continues to grow. We're now up to 46% of paid units, which is up 400 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially off Q2. We feel that Prime and FBA are -- reinforce each other. They're inextricably linked. FBA adds Prime selection, and Prime growth attracts more FBA sellers. So we have seen growth in FBA. It increases our Prime fast-track eligible selection, which we like and customers like. So we like what we see on the third-party side.",93

So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. I think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings us up to about 17 across the globe. On the next day -- or same day here in the U.S., we continue to expand that as well. But we think that those fast options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. But at this point, we're still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. So nothing specific to call out on that. On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world, but can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation.",182

Well, I would point out that this quarter showed a lot of innovation, a lot of new products and features and a lot of investment. We've already talked about India. But domestically, we are -- or excuse me, globally, we are investing very heavily on our Prime platform, both in North America and international. And that includes video content and original content, Prime Music. Phil just said the Prime Now has expanded to 14 metro areas. We've had same-day delivery now in 16 metro areas. We've built 14 new fulfillment centers. We've launched multiple devices including e-readers, tablets that are priced under -- or $50, Echo, Dash Button. So there is a lot of investment going on, and there will be continued especially related to Prime. On the AWS side, as I said, we have 530 new features so far this year. So innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy. I hate to use that word again, but it could be lumpy over time. The other dynamic in our company, though, is definitely working on cost reductions and efficiency. I think you'll see a lot of that in this quarter's P&L and in our capital efficiency, both in the warehouse world and also in infrastructure. So we will continue to work on costs. The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well. So we will -- I would say it's not as much of a pendulum as maybe it's been portrayed. It's more of a constant. The investment will -- it sometimes ebbs and flows, but the cost reductions will be a constant presence, and the increase in customer experience and shortening the time to delivery and making the customer experience better.",298

We've had the Kindle store in Brazil for a while. I think we look at all of our investments with an eye towards trying to maximize long-term free cash flow at strong returns on invested capital. So that's across the board. That's kind of the criteria we're using, making sure we're building things that customers love that can have attractive financial returns over time, can persist for a long time. And if they work, can be big. So that's kind of the metrics we're using, there's nothing specific to call out to Brazil, though.",103

We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year -- or at the end of last year, which last year, in the year when we raised prices early in 2014, the global growth rate was 53% and North America growth rate was 50%. So by default, the international growth rate was higher. We like the adoption of Prime internationally. It's helped by additional selection that's available for fast-track shipment including FBA. So that flywheel is working. We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in U.K. and Germany. We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter. We launched Prime Now in the U.K. So it's very similar to the U.S. story, potentially time-lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates.",150

So you have told us that you have tens of millions of Prime users, that you are investing heavily in Prime. Now at this scale and with the 50%-plus growth rate that you just mentioned, if you roll the clock 2 or 3 years, one can see Prime penetration in the markets like the U.S. starting to saturate us, there are just so many homes in the country. How should we think about the level of investment in Prime once you have reached full penetration? Are there components that are driven primarily through customer acquisition? And what's the right way to think about that? And secondly, what are the economic drivers that justify the business case for Prime Now? I don't expect you to give us any numbers, I've learned that in the last few years. But what are the components of the customer life cycle value calculation, or whatever calculation that you make, to justify someone dropping a box with that $15 order to a customer?",171

Thank you, Carlos. First on what I'll classify as Prime demographics. So yes, we still think there's a lot of people in the country who are not Prime members, and we're anxious to have them try it and sign up and join. The other thing that we see is that with our vast offering of selection and faster and faster shipping programs, we have a more competitive offering for many things that they buy. So there's a share of wallet element to it as well, over time, that we are looking to be more useful to customers all the time. On your comment about the economic drivers of Prime Now, what I'll say is customers really value it. It's not our entire selection. It's tens of thousands of items that they may need on a daily basis. We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime. And it's, in many ways, something that we can do that others can't because it's a natural evolution of our 20-year effort to grow our fulfillment center network. And our scale, quite frankly, makes it possible to even offer this to customers.",192

We continue to work on the customer experience and making sure we're really delivering a quality experience for shoppers. And we're also working on the economics. And so we've continued to work on that, but not much new to add right now.",72

I guess the travel business you're kind of in again for a few months and then got out of. Also maybe just with restaurant, providing restaurant delivery. How do you view the services? They're not necessarily core to what you do. Obviously, you can provide those services. But how should we think about these types of investments longer term?",77

And we learned a lot, but we discontinued that. On the restaurant delivery, we've had it for a couple months here in Seattle, and recently announced it Portland. And it fits very well with Prime Now. So at this point, it's pretty small, but something we're excited to do for customers. We think it'll be helpful for them. And we're happy to take advantage of some of the competencies we've built with Prime Now, with our fulfillment network so far.",97

Any color, such as engagement on the recent launch of video products in Japan, including the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick and Prime video. And also, any general updates on your video content strategy or view on stand-alone streaming separate from Prime?",47

This is Brian. So no specific callouts in Japan. I would say that we are still very bullish on our Prime Instant Video, the -- especially our new original content we've created. We think it's been critically acclaimed and also a big hit with customers. Man in the High Castle is coming out shortly, as is the second season of Transparent, which won Emmys this year. So we're really excited about the creative team we've assembled and the products that they've been able to bring to Prime customers. And we still like the customer reaction. Free trial conversion rates are higher when Prime members stream, and they also renew at a higher rate, their annual subscriptions. So again, that's very important to us as well, and we're very happy with the results.",137

But do you expect to have different offerings for different cohorts? In other words, right now, Prime is sort of a one-size-fits-all model. Could we see different pricing models for different demographics in the future? And then separately, can you also talk about how shipping leverage changes during the holiday season when shoppers tend to order more items per transaction?",73
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2015",2015-10-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2736.0,880695.0,37769286.0,Answer,Phil Hardin,,Executives,49,"Sure. So this is Phil. On the Prime pricing, we do have a few different programs for different demographics today with programs like Prime Student or Prime family, which -- or parent, which we're very excited about. I can't speculate as to what we'd do in the future, but Prime is a program that's really important for us, and we're working hard every day to continue to build selection there and to continue to make Prime better. And so hopefully, you should see that in the list of things we've launched recently and the kind of continued cadence of making the services we have better. We just added a lot of new music in our Prime Music program. And as Brian mentioned, some of the upcoming programming should be pretty good in the fall. The Man in the High Castle was actually our most watched pilot, so we're excited about that one as well. So continue to work on Prime. On the shipping side, no, I would say it's a difficult equation. Yes, order size can go up, but we ship a lot of toys and bigger items, so it's hard to predict what that looks like. But having the density, having the sort centers has certainly helped our cost structure in that area, and having inventory closer to our customers.",221

So am I reading too much into this? Or have you guys put in place different processes to iterate more quickly? And second, I think you disclosed that as of the end of '14 a little less than 10% of your fulfillment centers are outfitted with Kiva. So I guess, are all of your other fulfillment centers on a go-forward basis going to have Kiva? If not, why not? And given the pickup and presumably the volume throughput there, does this mean you can slow down the pacing of build-out there?",130

On Prime Now, it is our intent to roll out benefits and functionality globally as quickly as possible. I think we're able to do that with Prime Now and get to the U.K. faster. We're happy with that. It's not necessarily a comment on AmazonFresh, just -- they're different businesses. So we're happy with the launch in the U.K., and the team did a great job to get that launched in a timely manner. On Kiva, we are up to 30,000 bots at the end of Q3, which is -- and they're in 13 fulfillment centers. At the end of 2014, we had 15,000 bots, so we've doubled that amount, and they were in 10 warehouses. So our intent is to use that more widely, and stay tuned.",130

I realize it's easier comps, but anything significantly higher or anything that happened this quarter? I know Prime Day could be it, but wondering if that was a reason? And then on AWS usage, just wondering if you can update on usage. I believe, last quarter, you mentioned usage was growing faster than revenue. I'm wondering if that's the same case this quarter.",74

On the unit side, you did see units move at a rate that's kind of highly correlated with revenue there. Keep in mind AWS and some of the other rental type offerings don't generate units, so we don't count those, but we did see -- certainly saw some additional units as a result of Prime Day. And on a longer-term bigger basis, the continued growth of Prime, the continued selection expansion is helping with the units growth there. Sorry, was there a second part to your question?",91

We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board and it's coming from customers of all sizes.

First, with the court striking down the safe harbor provision between the U.S. and the EU, how do you see changes to European data storage requirement affecting AWS potentially?

I'll take the safe harbor question with AWS.

So it's a bit of investment that has implications for a lot of the elements of your cost structure. But we're very happy with Kiva. We think it's a great -- pairing our associates with Kiva robots to do some of the hauling of products within the warehouse has been a great innovation for us.

Two questions. So first, our data suggests that U.S. Prime sub growth is growing very rapidly at scale. Just wondering where you think the U.S. Prime sub base is now in the adoption curve. And then the second question is North American EGM growth accelerating again this quarter. We're assuming growth is being driven in part by categories like apparel and consumables versus perhaps a more mature category, like electronics. So the questions are with the vertical mix changing, how should we think about the impact to margins? Are some of the newer and faster-growing categories structurally higher margin for Amazon than the more mature categories?",107

I would say that we're seeing strong growth across all of our EGM categories. And we have great teams that are chasing a lot of different product lines and working with vendors to get more selection on the site, both retail and also third party. So still a lot of room there. On the Prime sub-growth, we're not updating the statistics. We are very happy with the growth, not only in participation, but also purchases and retention. And we had a very successful Prime Day in July that we're really happy was a great event for customers and sellers. So that's about all I have on that.",121
