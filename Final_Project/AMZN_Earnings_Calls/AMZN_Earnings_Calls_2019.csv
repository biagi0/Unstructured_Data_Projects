Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. 
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",322

Just how do you feel about the overall unit growth here given that growth was higher last year in the 20s? And do you think there's some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward? And then, secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4?",74

On the second question, on the subscription services, we'd said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018, we'd said we'd anticipated about $300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX. So the $300 million is certainly part of that decelerate, the sequential deceleration and the growth rate in that line item.",111

So we don't focus as much on the number. I would direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter. We think it was a -- Q4, in particular, was a great quarter for customers. The retail, a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses. The teams here had done a great job planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continue to deliver for customers. We had a great re:Invent conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue income.",165

The first question's on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate the best estimate we have for Q1 in India. However, there's much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government rule change is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, and we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. Dave, why don't you talk about the advertising growth.",127

I think, I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set -- agencies, advertisers -- make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so was expanded sponsor, brands placements, rolled out new campaign reports, so improve campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with ad tools and the ad services that we offer. And we're continually excited about the opportunity there.",134

The -- this category also includes AWS sales and marketing. Keep that in mind because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So the overall marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods, and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing -- the variable marketing.",96

We feel very good about the long-term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences.

We did lower the free shipping threshold heading into the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that. That was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little about it before but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first-party side but also sellers continue to do well. As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of -- record-breaking number of Alexa devices as well. And I think, just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members. We had the most-ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that.",133

Can you discuss what may have driven that and how to think about retail gross margins going forward? And then, somewhat separately, retail margins last year benefited from several factors, including more modest hiring and more modest growth in fulfillment center capacity. Do you see these factors persisting this year?",107
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2019",2019-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2050.0,1645771.0,64861614.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,18,"Yes, thank you. Let me start with that last part because I think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there's some clear trends regarding our cost structure, starting with fulfillment costs. So in the prior 2 years, 2016, 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfillment and shipping by greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. Certainly, unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Demand, where we've combined FBA and retail, remained strong. So we had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior 2 years. Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68%, I believe. Last year, we're at 14% growth, and so there was a lot of leverage and a lot of -- in a way, there was a lot of prehiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018 while we still -- in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, but then we continued to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales team to an AWS device area. So their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but in total, the company grew 14%. And then, on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease line as maybe an indicator for what we invested into our AWS business support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year when it had grown 69% in 2017. So in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in 2016 and '17. So while we will continue to concurrently drive growth and customer offering in Prime benefits, we certainly do take costs seriously, and we will continue to work on operational efficiencies. I would expect those investments to increase relative to 2018. And we've reflected what we've seen so far in Q1 in our guidance.",349

We saw that investment reaccelerate in the fourth quarter after getting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first 3 quarters of last year?",113
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2019",2019-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2050.0,1645771.0,64861617.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,21,"Yes, I see total CapEx that was -- grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, negative 1% in Q3, and then positive 17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So there was, as you say, a bit of an investment in Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3. I still think the 17% is a low number for us when you talk about supporting the AWS business that's still growing at a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business. So I'm not prepared to give you the forecast for the year right now. I would say that I would consider 2018 to be a lighter investment year and a lighter year for adding fixed headcount, certainly compared to 2016 and 2017, and we'll reveal that as we go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what we expect in the first 3 months.",169

Just the first one is, to go back to the fourth quarter gross margins, I think, if we try to back out AWS, it looks like there was a little more gross margin pressure. Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter? And then, that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us -- any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter?",102

Sorry, I skipped over that gross margin question earlier, but yes, gross margins were, while up 180 basis points year-over-year, were not up as much as prior quarters. I would say, the positive tailwinds still remain. AWS had strong growth of 46% on an FX-neutral basis, third-party units continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the headwinds, I would say, were outbound shipping costs, including the free shipping that we did, but mostly it was the higher Amazon Fulfilled units and the greater use of Amazon Logistics. And I would also say retail was very strong. We had as -- as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest-selling unit globally. So devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We discussed how we don't price devices to make money. We usually will expand -- or are content expanding our device and usage throughout a group of customers who use our devices and then we monetize that in different ways through commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. So a bit of it was mixed, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment, was stronger in Q4.",208

As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. So specific to Q4, the impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion to other revenue. So you'll see that in the other revenue in total.",78

In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated. So I was curious, any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the U.K.? And then marketplace fees are changing in several categories, including home furnishings, health and beauty. Curious what the strategy is there, I assume to expand the selection. But is it also an indication of an increasing focus on those retailer categories?",88
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2019",2019-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2050.0,1645771.0,64861624.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,28,"Sure. Let me start with your second question. Obviously, third-party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there. They've had great success on our site. More than half of our units sold are from third-party sellers. So it's very important to us that we have the right business profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. So we will always be evolving that. Part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes adding new fees or subtracting old ones. Part of those involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. So you're going to see this continually from us. We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides, and we continue to have healthy growth in third party. On international, on an FX-neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4, but last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of Diwali and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust for that, and again, Diwali had -- took place primarily in Q4 this year and it was split between Q3 and Q4 last year, if we adjust for that, international growth is pretty flat Q3 to Q4.",206

Thanks for the question. I'll take the advertising piece first. I mean, I think, as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. I mean, our priorities in this space, that's certainly one of them, looking for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands, automating activities, incenting new products. And I think, in all those regards and those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to come, both in advertising for -- on our own properties but also potentially beyond -- over the longer term. So -- but even as we look for advertising opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of experimentation. I think we're learning and are a very data-interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us.",166

Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally. What we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak. So we will continue to build out our DSP or -- and flex and ship with Amazon programs. So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year. So we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint. The delivery estimate accuracy, as we call it, was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.",117

One, on the media side, has there been any step-up in terms of investments around media content to support your ambition with respect to Prime and Video? It's been a couple years now since we got an update on rate of spend or how it might impact either historical periods or going forward periods. That would be number one. And then, number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the advertising front, how do you think about the Video opportunity? You're moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored product search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting with over-the-top video or connected TV opportunities that might look in front of you going forward.",119

We're not quantifying the Prime Video spend today, but we do -- it has been increasing. We expect it to increase even further in 2019. We're seeing a lot of, again, continued strong adoption in the usage and viewing and hours watched of both our music and our -- excuse me, video and music. And as -- if you step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members. It leads to higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And we like what we see. We continue to see that engagement growing. I would say that we've had some particular success in -- recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 Oscar nominations, and Jack Ryan, Homecoming and season 2 of the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, in particular, were very well received during the quarter.",141

So that's available on the IMDb website with your laptop or personal computer. And I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well as a great way to consume content. So I think excited about that. Other opportunities we've been working with in ads and video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offerings, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football. I really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that, looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers but also take some opportunities to monetize with the advertising.",180

So just can you comment, did advertising slow down relative to third quarter? One. You're kind of adjusting for 606. And then, secondly, was there any reallocation in segments between online and physical stores? And if not, any commentary why physical stores was down year-over-year.",47

Let me start with the physical stores revenue. So physical stores decreased 3% year-over-year, and this is primarily Whole Foods but also includes our other stores, the Amazon Bookstores, Amazon Go, Amazon 4-Star. What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a period last year when we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you remember, of 2017. In Q4, we adjusted their fiscal calendar to link it up with Amazon's, and it added about 5 days of revenue into Q4 of last year. So we're comping that year-over-year. The second piece is that the -- as you said, the online orders where people go to the Prime Now app or Whole -- and then order for delivery or pickup at Whole Foods stores does count or is counted in the online stores component of revenue. So if you adjust for those, what's the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. Because of some of those, again, mostly the year-over-year counting or days true-up issue, it's showing up as negative 3% in physical stores.",185

So it's -- at 97%, still very strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. In other revenue, as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue. And we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year. So that is part of the factor there, as you mentioned. But I'd just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon's vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.",109

And how do you view the balance between using your own proprietary logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019? And then, just a quick follow-up, obviously, the HQ2 news came out during the quarter. What would you highlight as maybe the most important next steps there? And maybe some color on the feedback from that process. Would be interested to hear that as well.",103

So let's start with HQ2. Of course, in November, we announced we selected New York City and Northern Virginia, and between the 2 cities, we'll be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50,000 jobs. We also announced a operation center of excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about -- estimated about 5,000 jobs. So right now, we're working through some next issues in both cities. We're looking forward to investing in New York and Northern Virginia and being a good community partner as well as Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on that. On your comment or question on transportation, yes, we do continue to expand our Amazon Logistics and our delivery capability, and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers can get within 2 days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within 1 day or faster in 10,000 cities and towns. So Amazon Deliveries are a big part of that. Again, we have great third-party partners as well in the transportation space. What we like about our ability to participate in transportation is that, a lot of times, we can do it at same cost or better, and we like the cost profile of it, too. We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information. We know where our demand is. We know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers. And by not involving third parties all the time, we can -- we've found that we can extend our ship cutoff -- excuse me, our order cutoffs, and we've done that over the last few years. So that's also another helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own logistics -- excuse me, transportation final delivery.",320

Any color on what drove the decline sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And then, I guess, going back to the investment catch-up team, it sounds like 2019 will be a little bit more aggressive push from you guys. Can you parse out whether you expect the pace of retail margin expansion that we're seeing in North America right now. Is that going to continue and most of these investments are going to be in international and some of the stuff going on in India? And any color on the North America operating margin trajectory?",106

Let me start with the AWS operating margin, as you called it out. That number will move around. We're very pleased with the 29.3% that we saw during the quarter. Of course, at any point in time, this business is going to be a combination of lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build new -- especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead of our customers' minds. And infrastructure will -- again, it will bounce between quarters a bit. Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than the prior 3 quarters. That had a slight impact on the operating margin. But again, year-over-year, operating margins were up and were almost 280 basis points. We've said quite openly that this is going to bounce around. What we do is create great value for the customer on one end and then work to minimize our cost of infrastructure, and we're getting more and more creative around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition down.",180

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",329

I'm going to ask 2 questions because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric? Just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk through us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%. I know last -- ex FX, I know last quarter, you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate. How do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India?",103

Thanks for your questions. I'll start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services which cannibalize the unit calculations, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And also, it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated. 
So your second question was on international growth. Yes. Talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we are just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There was a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter, the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance, and we're very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you remember, with the timing of the Diwali holiday, but we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there even despite some downtime in India.",205

Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q, pretty significant there? It looks like local sales and booking and so hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in Q2 as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration. So curious what gives you the confidence.",87
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67930998.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,7,"Sure, Doug. Yes. Let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and '17 dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate. We actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year, but my point from the last call still holds in that we do expect these growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next 3 quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high end of the revenue range, which is always good from efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue. 
So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have -- we're currently working on evolving our Prime free 2-day shipping program to be a free 1-day shipping program. We're able to do this because we spent 20-plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering obviously faster than 2-day shipping for Prime members for years, 1 day, same day, even down to 1- to 2-hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to do -- to offer same-day and Prime Now selection on an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free 2-day offer morphing into -- or evolving into a free 1-day offer. We've already started down this path. We've, in the past months, significantly expanded our 1-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for 1-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q2 -- in Q1's results. This is a significant step and it will take us time to achieve and we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve the software. 
And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we -- it's -- Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees and we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2. We're seeing the same thing this year. And that's -- sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends to -- month to date and we expect -- we built the Q2 range about -- around what we've seen.",581

Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the -- not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit -- or excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share -- I wouldn't share with you today the Prime -- any Prime -- specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think the announcement I just made about morphing to a 1-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail as we say.",148

Q4 was a fairly big step-down when you strip out the accounting benefit over the last quarter -- the accounting benefit.

How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful.,104

We're seeing -- as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers. So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding more products and adding -- reporting for businesses and advertisers so they can understand the incremental customers they're seeing on Amazon through advertising with Amazon. So it's more right now around tools and making better recommendations, making it easier to use our Amazon demand-side platform, things like that, operational improvements. 
And then I guess we're very focused on serving brands as well. That's another theme that we have. These brand stores that we have our easy to create, customize, and we've had great pickup on that from brands for they can show shoppers who they are and tell their story. So it builds a better engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon. 
And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. So while other revenue grew 36% and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.",292

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931007.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,16,"Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very -- it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. We have delivery from 75 -- into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app. 
So we're very -- the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. That shows up in our online stores classification. So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4 and it's a similar number in Q1. So again, we're very happy with both the Prime adoption of -- or the recognition of the Prime benefits by -- at Whole Foods and also the purchases. And you may have also noticed that we lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts since we joined forces with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017.",224

It does sound like, as Eric noted, that there was a bit more of a slowdown again. I mean I guess I'll ask it this way. Do you believe that some of the improved relevance, some of the improved focus on brands as well as some of the new products can lead that business to reaccelerate at some point again? Or is it facing law of large numbers? And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve 1-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that -- in noting that it'll help contribute to the high end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker. I would imagine it's just simply expanding availability and that $800 million is largely related to shipping cost. But I just want to make sure we're understanding that quickly that the -- this investment rolled out relatively quickly and starts to take effect relatively quickly.",178
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931010.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,19,"Yes. I'm glad you asked that. I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to 2-day delivery right now, principally for 2-day delivery. So we do need to build out more 1-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. There is a certain tranche that we can dial up quickly, and we've started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. And then stay tuned because we'll be building this -- most of this capacity through the year in 2019. 
And then your question about advertising, I wouldn't comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth. I would just say we're early on in this venture. There's a lot of -- it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, sellers and also others. So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space.",194

18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931012.0,Question,Anthony DiClemente,,Analysts,21,"A couple of questions. In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast. So maybe just talk a little bit about that. Is this just law of large numbers as time goes by? What is Amazon doing to sort of sustain that growth rate in the third-party marketplace business? And then second question is maybe just quickly on media spend. Just update us on how you're thinking about the trajectory of video content spend. Any strategic changes there in terms of library versus originals versus films or TV content?",148
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931013.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,22,"Yes, let's step back on the third-party question. So again, let me reiterate our approach. So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the broadest selection, the best available price and also the most convenient options on how they receive the item. If we're delivering on those 3 elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third party. We actively recruit sellers to sell on our platform. It's because it adds selection. It adds -- if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime-eligible selection. We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services not only to allow sellers to sell but to help themselves more successfully. 
So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers. Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer that we have, the customers in any country. So you'll still see the percentage of third-party units increased and has been steadily over the last few years. So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience. The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in 1-day shipping, is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime-eligible selection in our warehouses.",244
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931014.0,Answer,Dave Fildes,,Executives,23,"Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave. On your question around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in digital video. It's an area where we're very excited about. Lots of very popular, critically acclaimed shows have obviously come out, things like Homecoming, Jack Ryan, more recently Hanna, Guava Island, and some great titles. So I think look for us to continue to invest there. 
There was -- on the accounting side, we did adopt an accounting standard in January that amended our accounting for how we cap for produced original video content. And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video content. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of those costs. So the net impact for the first quarter to operating income wasn't material. It was -- for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change. As we go through 2019 though, we would expect the impact to increase in the latter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production schedule as it grows throughout the year.",204

And I think you had about 100 million items available for 2-day delivery, Prime delivery. As the 1-day program starts, how many SKUs will be available? And would you expect to get the entire 100 million SKUs for 1-day at some point? And then second question, just on grocery, just curious the upside for further expansion outside of kind of all the enhancements you're doing with Whole Foods.",96

So yes, on the 1-day free shipping versus the 2-day free shipping, our goal is to evolve the 2-day free shipping program into a 1-day free shipping program, and we're making strides on that. It got into a little bit about the capacity we have to add and changes we have to make to our supply chain in order to deliver on that. We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year. We'll have more for you at the end of Q2 obviously. There's a lot of error bars around this program, especially from the cost side. We are -- feel we're doing something very important for the customer. And we have -- again trying to take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity especially with third-party partners that we have. And we'll just have to see what changes have to be made to get more and more selection into that 1-day category.",157

Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out. We are also continuing to invest in our other grocery initiatives. Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, which offers grocery as one of the components of the selection there for the 2-hour or even 1-hour delivery capabilities. And so I think we'll keep investing in those areas. I mean -- and in other initiatives as well where we can get food through Pantry, Go. There's a number of initiatives there, so excited about what we'll be able to continue to bring to customers on that space.",124

Should we expect that to rely mostly on USPS, UPS or other shipping services or you're really going to try to build out more your Amazon owned and operated shipping? And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year?",60
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931021.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,30,"Yes. Sure, Ben. I would say we're going to be using all of the available levers that we have right now, both [ the MCL ] and also third party, all third-party carriers, and we'll just see how it develops going forward. But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners. So outside of the ramp, I would say that the $800 million is what I have for you today. We will see where we stand at the end of the quarter, and I'll give you insight as to what we just saw and what our outlook is for future quarters at that time. 
I would like to -- as I don't want to run out of time here. So I'm going to ask a question for myself about AWS because I want to get some information to you. Most of the questions I can tell around 1-day are topical and important. I do want to highlight the AWS performance in Q1. We're now over $30 billion annualized run rate, 42% FX-neutral growth and $2 billion more of revenue this Q1 versus last Q1. The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business. We're continuing to engage with many large customers globally. I'm particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time. We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. Usage growth continues to be higher than revenue growth rates.",357

There was a little bit of a slowdown in the quarter. I just wondered if there's anything that you'd call out there, pricing or any other factors that you could call out that may have contributed to that. And I apologize but another 1-day shipping question here. In terms of the $800 million, just curious where that gets you to in terms of coverage of zip codes and SKUs. I assume right now, this is a project that's in the U.S. Where that gets you from a coverage standpoint? And is this something that you expect to be a near- to medium-term priority in some of your other developed markets like the U.K., Germany, et cetera?",156
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931024.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,33,"Yes. So I'm glad you asked that, Mark. It is -- I'm going to start with the second question. The program will be global. Most of the spend that we are seeing in Q2 is starting in North America, but this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. So you will see more going forward. I can't give you exact percentages of selection and all that mainly because we are still again working through that and we've -- while we have ratcheted up a significant -- we turned the dial significantly in April, and so we'll see the cost impact almost immediately in the quarter. We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of 1-day and let you know probably at the end of the quarter. I would say in the short run, it's also expanding and increasing our speed on all of our orders quite frankly. 
On AWS revenue, yes, let me just remind you the quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis. So Q1 was 48% then 49% then 46% and 46%. So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first half of last year. This is always going to be a lumpy business. It's not only dependent on us. It's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon. So there's -- or excuse me, AWS. So there's differences in sales cycles. There's differences in adoption of the cloud. There's differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. So we're happy with the growth, 42% on an FX-neutral basis and again a $30 billion -- greater than $30 billion annualized run rate.",306

And you guys have said in the past that generally, CapEx sort of tracks your -- that you're investing at the level of growth that you expect. I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like. So just trying to understand sort of where the disconnect is there and to the extent that your -- the level of investment in physical infrastructure says anything about your expectations for future growth, what the right way to read that is.",123
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2019",2019-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2257.0,1732356.0,67931027.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,36,"Sure. Thanks for that question, Heath. No. I would say, a, we're not expecting diminished returns in any of our businesses or growth rates nor are we restraining the business or constraining the businesses in any way with our capital. I would point you back again to the investments that we made in 2016 and 2017. So we did front-load a lot of the investment both in fulfillment centers and also infrastructure. But more than that, it's more than kind of bleeding through excess capacity. We have some really, really impressive gains in efficiencies in both the warehouses and also the data centers. We talked efficiency and every percentage utilization in our data centers is worth tens and more millions of dollars. So again, that's -- a big part of our model is not only investing but also working on efficiencies, adding new products and features for customers. And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers either through new rates or new deals that we have. 
So I would say that -- I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that, that was great work with -- on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of that capacity that had been built previously. Moving forward, that's why I say it will be increasing as we move through the year, and that will be a constant battle between again growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say. Although we did just launch our Hong Kong region today as well, and I want to point that out. The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there. And launching the Hong Kong region is -- gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. So it continues to be a really good story for us.",343

So Amazon, the first principle is customer obsession. And Brian, you talked about record Prime sub growth last year. I guess the question is what are the signals or the key strategic rationale behind investing in 1-day? Are there certain types of users, demographics of users, categories of products, countries? Do you think this will help you attract and retain? It seems like Prime is growing pretty well. Just talk us through what you see as the big opportunity to invest in 1-day? And then the second one, just maybe talk to us a little bit about the early learnings on the health care industry side and potentially trying to move larger into health care.",124

Brian, I would say it's as simple as price selection and convenience, which is the mantra that we talk about quite often. By going to 1-day increases the convenience and it increases the available selection into the consideration set. Although we have many items that are available in 1 to 2 hours and also same-day, the vast majority of our selection is available to you in 2 days. If we get that to 1 day, we'd literally cut it in half. That's tough math for you. I'm sorry to do that but the -- we think that, that will open up a lot of potential purchases that -- and will open up convenience to those customers. So we've been experimenting on a lot of different formats, as you know, 2-day, 1-day, same-day, 2-hour stores. There's all types of points of being there for the customer when they need us at different points in their consideration set. So we really think it's going to be groundbreaking for Prime customers, and we're very excited to add this capability. And again, part of this is we have the capability because we've been at this for over 20 years and continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity, our logistics capacity and also fine-tune it, but thank you for your question.",218

Brian, this is Dave. Just briefly on health care, I mean that term can touch upon any number of different parts of our businesses. Of course, we talked in the past about how Amazon Business serves many other companies, including the health care industry, and providing them some great selection, and fast delivery is part of that -- the business program there. So -- and that continues to do well and it's a focus of Amazon Business amongst other verticals there that they serve. PillPack, we're probably around 6 months or so in since that acquisition closed and continuing to support them in their mission and learn from them certainly, so no real update on that but excited about the potential there, to be sure.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. 
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. 
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 25, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. 
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet; online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements.

It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is driving that? And if so which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? 
And then sort of the opposite question on AWS which has slowed down a little bit, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q?",81
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2199.0,1781312.0,69740063.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,4,"Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We had a really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers. We've been breaking it out since 2015. And we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms. 
We're seeing the pickup from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services, especially our machine learning services. And continually, again, AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem and also the stronger security that we offer.
On your question about 1-day, let me update you on that because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter, and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing 1-day offering. In Q2, we had a meaningful step-up in the 1-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume was -- 1-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only at being able to expand 1-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month.
So we're in the middle of a journey here. We expect to see a continued ramp of the 1-day selection and availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be, in future quarters, there. 
On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply 1-day -- the addition of 1-day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly both local capacity and the [ FC ] also in our delivery networks. We also saw some costs for moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to the customers. And we built that, not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today.
And as I said in another setting, we've seen this before. We have had large changes to our distribution and transportation network repeatedly in our history, from -- going from media to a vast variety of different product lines, hardlines, nonsortable as we call them, the initial 2-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase 1-day and same-day, although on a much smaller scale. So it does create a shock to the system. We're working through that now, and we expect we'll be working through that for a number of quarters. But when the dust settles, we will regain our cost efficiency over time.
As far as you asked about specific product lines, nothing really to share there. We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America, and we -- could be that we are mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch 1-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.",625

Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things. And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business, are there any products or sort of product areas, AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you, that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under-growth relative to the overall business that you would call out?",120
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2199.0,1781312.0,69740066.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,7,"Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption in machine learning services, especially Amazon SageMaker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services, and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers and released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. 
Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual, increased pace of enterprise migrations. So I would say that, on a percentage growth basis, again, on a dollar basis, it's growing very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year, and there are some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that, some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy.",192

Couple of questions. I guess the first question is just happens with customer behavior when they do have 1-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to 1-day, what happens? 
And the second question, we've heard from [ smaller ] checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the 1P's side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third party from first party?",95
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2199.0,1781312.0,69740069.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,10,"Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to 1-day. I did say that generally in Q2, the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're seeing is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers. So things that maybe they can't wait 2 days on, they can wait 1 day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed that personally myself, they're just -- with 1-day shipments, it's here before you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time. 
On your comment, I assume you meant vendors, not merchants, but -- on the move from 1P to 3P, but no, there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related to shift in channel there, but I would say that we remain indifferent on whether -- we're focused on price, convenience and selection for our customers. And whether a product is a retail offering, or third-party offering is not that important to us, as long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. So as you know, our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time. It increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems, both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants, invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of them making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasing not only vendor sales but also third-party merchant sales. 
In particular, on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had over -- in our press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners.",326

So yes, continue to see growth in programs for both sellers -- for our sellers and delivery partners. In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime members, which we're very excited about. We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India but also in other geographies around the world. We started Amazon Flex in India which helps our local partners to deliver packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and increases our speed of delivery. So it's a win-win. 
We've also introduced package-free shipment program in 9 cities. This is going to be a big part of our Shipment Zero program, it's a vision to make all Amazon shipments net carbon zero. 
On the government side, our engagement with the Indian government makes us optimistic about partnering and collaborating to seek a stable, predictable policy that will allow us to continue investing in our technology and infrastructure. And it also helps us to create jobs and scale local businesses. So we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where -- looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. 
The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year. Some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday. So that's factored into our international -- or excuse me, our revenue growth rate for the quarter.",250

And Jason, this is Dave. Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is really in more and more places. I think the point you're probably referencing is we're now seeing hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built in. So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and other smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicles. 
So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies like BMW and Mini, and not just in the U.S, but in places like Europe as well. So a lot of this, of course, is just around the great power of Alexa and being able to offer even greater convenience and touch points where customers can interact with that, and we're seeing a lot of great momentum with usage and how customers are interacting with Alexa, but also when you look at the broader environment of third-party devices, devices that we're rolling out in all those things, it's -- we're seeing a lot of good momentum there. And I think it's underpinned by the fact that Alexa is always getting smarter, and so customers are enjoying the benefit of that enhanced experience.",192

Can you quantify the cost of 1-day shipping to Q3 guidance kind of similarly to what you did into 4Q too with that $800 million? And when does it plateau? How should we be thinking about it as we map it out over the next several quarters? And then you guys made a very intriguing acquisition, the Sizmek acquisition sometime back. Just wondering, how does it fit in the overall strategy? And is the idea to try to build maybe a double-click like-minded model, sorry, using that platform?",94

I'm not breaking out the specific cost this quarter as I did last year -- last quarter. Some of this is because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between 1-day and other cost issues. So we're always working within a range. We're confident we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2. And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out. We had a meaningful step-up in North America in Q2. We'll -- and it was accelerating through the quarter. We'll see more cost in Q3. We'll see about Q4 when we talk -- and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance. So while I won't break out the dollar term, I will tell you at the end of the quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and how it looks for Q4 as well.
And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that we're just getting started in international, and most of that work is ahead of us, although the speed did tick up a bit in Q1 -- or excuse me, Q2, but -- and will do even more so in Q3 and future quarters.",217

And I just -- the commentary in the press release about this acceleration from 1-day sounds great. It's a little surprising that you would see the reaction that quickly, but maybe this really is -- well, you're obviously seeing it. You're confident that you'll also see it as you roll out into international markets, if you could just comment on that.",86
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2199.0,1781312.0,69740080.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,21,"Sure. The -- of course, the proportion of 1-day shipments is higher in international, to begin with, in a lot of our countries. So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that 1-day category. But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime. So yes, I would say you're faced with the -- you see it every time you go to our site. It's automatically built in. You're surprised by the speed. It's not like you have to search 1-day shipping specifically to find out what's available. It's growing, and it's pervasive. So I think what that does is, again, it strengthens your purchase decision. It strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. So I think it becomes a part of your routine. At least that's what we're seeing in North America. And we hope, again, as we build this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP codes and more -- adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that we see already in major cities. 
I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income and both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of 1-day, I would like to highlight there are some other investment areas that are certainly going on here. If you look at Q2, our marketing expense was up 48% year-over-year, and that's a combination of a few things. First, we're continuing to add to our AWS sales and marketing teams. We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. So we continue to build out our sales force and our marketing programs. 
We're also adding more and more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video -- new Prime Video content, in particular internationally. So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. That was up 36% year-over-year. And you'll see that our headcount grew 13% year-over-year. So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas, things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on the total headcount. So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS, devices and videos, in particular.",440

The North America retail acceleration was, like, 3.5 points, and you mentioned that international is about 1. So can we attribute the difference to 1-day? Or was there other organic acceleration in North America happening aside from the move to 1-day? 
And then, Brian, related to that investing question, AWS operating margin came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just mentioned that may have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS?",91
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2199.0,1781312.0,69740083.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,24,"Sure. Let me start with that second question. So yes, the -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate, it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments, in global expansion and investment in marketing and other -- in infrastructure that is going to vary quarter to quarter. We had a -- we've come off a period where, if you remember last year, we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total. The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway, the -- oh, I'm sorry, we grew finance leases, which is essentially our proxy for capital leases, for infrastructure, by 9% in Q1, and it was 10% all of last year, coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%. So we had that dynamic. Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2. So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%. So we are starting to see, as I mentioned in earlier calls, that the investment will be stepping up in 2019. So started to see that in Q2. But the biggest -- I would say the biggest impact in the operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also, to a lesser extent, the stock-based compensation which certainly hits across all of our businesses. 
Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there are so many different factors going on in every country that it's hard to compare North America to international. But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of 1-day and the impact of that. It's -- there's other things obviously we continue to add selection, and we have again lots of engagement points with customers through Prime benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate and our retention of Prime members. But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2, excuse me, that's different, it was obviously the start of the -- and the step-up in 1-day shipments.",371

And just wonder, first, do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions that maybe, in the past, haven't always been organized internally that way? And then secondly, in terms of subscription revenue, where are we in terms of the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and rolled through to existing members throughout the last year?

Yes, so first, I'd say we're customer-focused first and primarily, but we need to have good coordination across our teams, and we grow fast, and we add new things. So there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still Day 1 here. But we're trying to minimize the negative impact on any vendor or seller out there. 
So I can't comment on any certain -- on exactly what issues you might be talking about. We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience, and we think that they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products, including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon. But as we say, they're separately run and they can meet at different points. And sometimes, at certain vendors, perhaps that may get out of hand, get out of sync. But hopefully, that is a temporary condition.
On subscription revenue, yes, we -- you'll remember, we raised the price of Prime in the U.S. last June from $99 to $119. So the largest impact, favorable impact from that, at least from a subscription revenue standpoint, would have happened in the subsequent 4 quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year. So yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. It's offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits -- or the Prime program globally. 
You may see that we -- may have seen that we launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. So it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given.",293

But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period, given some of the moving parts, 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then, of course, with the transition to 1-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand? And should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers?",108
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2019",2019-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",2199.0,1781312.0,69740091.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,32,"Yes. So I would say the first time we started discussing the rollout of 1-day, our first thoughts went to Q4 of this year and our capability for holiday and as much as Q2 and Q3. So we are confident that we will have the ability to handle seasonal demand. We are working very hard to expand our 1-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well. So we're feeling good about Q4. It's a little early to discuss that now, but we certainly had a really good test on Prime Day. It was the 2 biggest days we've ever had. A lot of good work went into Prime Day. A lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well. So it was a good test for us.
And sorry, and your question on low ASP, I think we're still figuring that out a bit. I mean, they -- what I'm reacting to is the high unit growth relative to what was also good growth in revenue, but unit growth grew faster. I'm always a little leery to put too much into the unit growth number. As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of our fastest-growing areas, and we also have -- are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. 
So there's a lot of moving parts, usually are headwinds to our unit growth number, but again, happy with the 800 basis point quarter-over-quarter jump in that.",282

So again, the biggest individual item is the 1-day shipping. As I said earlier, we had a meaningful step-up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but we're still on our way, and Q3 will be a step-up over Q2 in North America, and we'll see more in international. So it's that increase in 1-day shipping and the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place, as I mentioned earlier, new costs and things like expanding inventory, getting it closer to the customer. Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transportation network. So that is the biggest individual contributor, but as I mentioned in Q2's results, some of the investments in marketing, the step-up in infrastructure spending, that should continue. We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest, not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh. So I would say yes, we had a -- as we've mentioned in the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity. We expected a step-up in 2019. We didn't see as much of it in Q1 mainly because of the timing and the seasonality of the year and getting things going. We're seeing more of it in Q2, and we'll see it through the remainder of the year.",270

How much of the advertising business, if you're willing to say, is driven by domestic sellers and domestic brands versus the international side? Two, how do you think about the video ad revenue opportunity?

How do you think about making investments against that possibility or even just the possibility of it being a driver on your platform overall?",102

I think starting with the video advertising, I think that one focus area for us is expanding our video and over-the-top offerings for brands. We've taken some steps with live sports and then IMDb TV, but we'll continue to do things like add more OTT video supply, so things like Amazon Publisher Services integrations, simplifying access for third-party apps and add more inventory through things like Fire TV apps and IMDb TV. So I think some interesting areas that we're continuing to put a lot of focus into. 
On the first part of your question in terms of geographical mix, I mean it's fair to assume that like a lot of our business advertising in the North America segment is the bigger piece of that. But I think we're really excited about the international opportunity. A lot of the tools that we've rolled out, introduced in places like the United States are available in many of the international regions. And so it's a matter of continuing to work with advertisers and brands and kind of build up not only awareness but just how those ad things like Sponsored Products interact with customers, how they receive, building up the things we talk about many times here around improving relevancy on each of those geographic websites is an important thing that we're measuring. So expect to continue to see us look for new ways to be able to roll that out.

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 24, 2019, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet; online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things, the e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or tailwind perspective as we dig through some of the moving pieces in Q4.",97

Let me make clear. We are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our one-day shipping. The ops team has done a great job getting us in a position where we're in, and I think it's going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4.
On the guidance front, here's what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Souq, which obscured this a bit in the last couple years. There's been a noticeable drop in run rate between Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3 and Q4 generally along the lines about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year. That's just something we're expecting. It's a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth in the holiday season, that very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year, but -- so we factored that in.
And then there's also 2 other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year, and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. Also, the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1. And what we saw was a prebuy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter. And based on our history with the last time that consumption tax went up many years ago, we've expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan. So if you wrap those together, we expect it's going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it's -- has made -- have helped us by 150 basis points in Q3 and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.
For the company, it's not as large an issue at -- it's about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it's expected to be about an 80 basis point headwind in Q4. So that's a little bit more on our guidance, but again, we're looking -- really looking forward to Q4. I think we're well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think 1 day should help with holiday shipping. We've got a great new device line up you may have seen announced in September. And on the AWS side, we're looking forward to our re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.",441

And can you also just help us understand how that's playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q?",69

Let me start with the second part of that. So we're -- back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense in -- tied to one-day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2.
In Q3, we expected that to grow. We've put it into our guidance, and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance. So as we head into Q4, we've added what's just nearly $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation cost, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional pulls in shifts in our warehouses, the cost of forward deploying inventory closer to customers. There's a lot of tangential costs. But by and away, the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.
So we've built that into our Q4 guidance estimate. But we're very pleased with the customer response to one-day. You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again, the ops team has really done yeoman's work here to create this capacity for us, and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily. We're expecting that it will be, again, a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.",237

Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus one-day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other because, obviously going into Q4, you're only going to have the latter.
And then on a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the site, can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx for Q4 also driven, at least in part, by the higher investment to combat that?",118
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1801.0,1840684.0,72054350.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,10,"Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say, the -- we're certainly very diligent on the -- trying to catch counterfeit products. I would put a lot of effort into that. We put a lot of human effort. We put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well. But I would say the bigger investments in Q4 are certainly twofold, one, around the AWS -- excuse me, the one-day shipping that I just mentioned. The other would be on AWS. We have -- we continue to invest in AWS. If you look at the progression of our operating margin in that business, we've reached a high of 31% last Q4 -- or excuse me, Q3. That was a time when we were -- as we mentioned at that time, it was very efficient. We had been banking some savings from forward investments in infrastructure in 2017. We continue to feel really good about not only the top line but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel mainly to handle a wider group of customers, a increasingly wide group of products. We continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically.
So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also, to secondary extent, infrastructure, which, if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year, and that was 9% last year. So there's been a step-up in infrastructure cost to support the higher usage demand. So we see those trends continuing into Q4, and that's essentially probably the other element of operating income year-over-year that's shorter than in prior quarters.",318

Just to go back to the one-day cost, appreciate the color. Be curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structural. It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there. Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps you have to take over the next 1 to 2 years to get the 1-day shipping cost closer to what they used to be for 2-day? And how do you think about how long it's going to take? Then secondly on one-day, I think it's mostly U.S. to date. Is that right? And then if not, how do we think about sort of timing and pushing more internationally?",123

Yes, most of the expense has been in international -- or excuse me, in the U.S., but we have also increased our one-day selection internationally. We're starting to see some benefits from that. But I would say, the biggest impact so far both on the top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S.
We're still learning here on the one-day cost as we go about what the long-term cost structure will be. We have -- we know we have temporary cost in the short run as we do things like forward deploy inventory, get greater inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL capacity staff, multiple shifts so that we can have later pull times to hit 1-day cutoffs, things like that, adding sort centers.
So it's a drastic change to the whole network topology that we're glad to do and working through it. And we've been down this road before obviously in a number of different incarnations in Amazon's history. So we will keep you posted on a quarterly basis as best we can, but right now really forward guiding is for Q4.",192

As it scales and you get to higher levels of efficiency and utilization, does that become margin accretive or profitability accretive relative to using third parties almost exclusively in the way that you have in the past? And then this was also a very big hiring quarter for you, 100,000 people. Can you give us a sense of where those people are going relative to AWS fulfillment, retail, kind of understanding sort of where they've been prioritized?",118

Thank you for your questions, Heath. On the first question, I think it boils down to whether we'll be competitive long term with other options out there. Yes, we will be. We believe that in many cases we already are and places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance. There, in some cases, there's -- we're lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we're doing. But in the long run, we're going to have a combination both of our own capacity certainly fueled by -- helped with third-party carriers, large carriers that we've used in the past.
So we see a role for all carriers. In fact, including the delivery service partner program that we've developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well. So -- but on the cost side, yes, it's going to be the route density, and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down. But for now there's certainly some start-up pain in adding new capacity.
On the headcount question, yes, we increased, as you said, close to 100,000 people in Q3, and we're up 22% year-over-year. In the past, I've pointed to investments in technology teams, and that's certainly part of it. But by and away, the biggest driver this time is the people that we're adding for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and add this additional transportation capacity to service one-day.",247

I would say the margins -- our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will, in effect, cannibalize the old ones. And we're -- we also see a point out that in -- increasingly, what we're doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who didn't commit to us long term. And if you look in our disclosure on our 10-Q, it shows that we have $27 billion in future commitments for AWS -- from AWS customers, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So that's another thing to watch. It's not only the short-term commitment but also the long-term commitment that we see.

We're continually driving up efficiency and lowering down -- lowering costs, and we see that in our bottom line. The sales and marketing investment, we're chasing a large opportunity here, and that will be, as we say, bumpy as we go along. But we're fully confident that, that will be a very leveraged cost as we get to scale. So -- and then on technology side, as you said, yes, we will continue to invest in tech, SDEs and software engineers to build these products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that'll push our -- inform our product portfolio.",261

And related to that, the press release mentions, I think, you now have 37 million Fire Stick users worldwide. So can you talk about maybe how much ad inventory you've been able to get inside of networks within that? And how meaningful is this to the overall kind of advertising strategy?",69

Let me start with the first question on advertising. So other revenue, which is principally advertising, grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter. And the biggest thing in there is advertising, and advertising grew at rate higher than that, 45%. So we're very happy with the progress in the advertising business, continue to focus on inventing advertising experiences that are helpful for customers, helping them to see new products. We want to empower our businesses to find, attract and engage these customers. And it's increasingly popular with vendors, sellers and third-party advertisers. So it's still early, and what we're focused on really at this point is relevancy, making sure that the ads are relevant to our customers, helpful to our customers. And to do that, we use machine learning, and that's helping us to drive better and better relevancy.",143

Just quickly on Fire TV, I mean I have to start with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products. That includes the new -- the first Fire TV Edition soundbar, Fire TV Cube. So a number of things have come out recently we're really excited to get into customers' hands. So more to come there.
I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. One of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands. It's still early in the space, but we've done a few things with IMDb TV, live sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps and as I said, IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third-party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results. So as I said, early days, but I think with the engagements of the device community, the fact that we're really excited with the progress and improvements of these devices, I think, yes, we gain a lot of opportunity there.",211

Or is the response fairly broad based across the product categories where one-day has been expanded?,58

And actually, the Amazon fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. So we do attribute it to one-day. We're seeing broad sales across all categories. So yes, there's been some reduction in the threshold for some low ASP items that we've been doing separately over the last 6 months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items. But we think that is, again, the right decision for customers, especially over the long term.",97

When asked about the margins, you referred to -- Brian, you first referred to bringing down prices. Have you seen anything different in terms of the level of price competition? Could you talk about what kind of traction you've had building out into the enterprise? And I know it's a broad question, but take a shot at it. And the third part of this is your interest and your success in going in and generating more app -- going up the stack and getting more into the application software space, all that AWS related.",101
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1801.0,1840684.0,72054369.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,29,"Sure. So yes, I would say my comments around pricing were as much mix as absolute price decreases or competitive price pressures. It's certainly a competitive market that we see and we've seen for really a number of years. So everyone is very sharp on their pricing, is very eager to lock up long-term commitments from AWS customers. We do it with a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched. So the bigger element of that really is around us creating new products and services that are cheaper and less expensive than the old ones. So there's a certain bit of mix issue that we're always up against.
But again, on the -- and your question on enterprise penetration. I think the enterprise, we're making great progress there. It's going to be hard to -- on revenue growth, it's going to fluctuate quarter to quarter. It's hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate. So there's a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business. But we are having great success, and we're adding a lot of the sales force -- or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market.",224

And Mark, hey, this is Dave. Just really quickly just in terms of your question on the stack. I mean I think for really since as long as AWS has been around, we really pride ourselves in getting really top, high-caliber people, both the technical side but also salespeople, that are plugged in and listening to customers, understanding issues that are emerging, having open lines of communication. And that's really allowed us to innovate quickly and really faster than anyone else. And we see that in terms of the services and feature breadth and depth that we have. So a lot of the focus for us is really making sure that, that flywheel keeps spinning and that we continue to roll out a lot of great services that customers are looking for. So I think that's largely what dictates our road map and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether it's kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved.",184

Wondering if you'd give us some sense for the portion of SKUs in the U.S. or orders in the U.S. that are now delivered through your own network of drivers and partners. And then secondly, there have been some reports that Amazon is or, on occasion, is delivering products for other merchants or suppliers not specifically tied to an Amazon order. So just wondering if you view this as another potential opportunity down the road as you get excess capacity on the logistics side.",96

Hey, it's Dave. Thanks for the question. On that second point in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think I'd start with we've got a great relationship with third-party carriers across the countries where we operate. Over time, I think we'll look and expect to be able to grow our internal volumes using AMZL or Amazon Logistics but also continue to grow our 3P volumes with carriers and transporters around the world. But our focus is really on ensuring that we've got capacity from available resources, whether it's our own or our great -- our carrier partners to be able to serve the small- and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm but also the first-party items that we're receiving orders from customers, making sure we're able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.",144

Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season. Do you think that's going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter? Anything specific to Amazon? And then secondly, just thinking about the regulatory environment. I wonder if you can just comment on the opportunities and the competitiveness for third-party sellers. Are there other platforms that you see for them? And how do you think about their profitability on Amazon if you can comment on that at all?",87
18749.0,"Amazon.com, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2019",2019-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Amazon.com, Inc.",1801.0,1840684.0,72054376.0,Answer,Brian Olsavsky,,Executives,36,"Sure. Yes. On third party, I would say we only succeed if the third-party seller succeeds. So we're heavily invested in them as they are in us. So we are constantly investing on their behalf, adding new projects -- products and features, and we're cognizant of their economics as well, and we want a business that works for both of us, and we set our fees accordingly.
So I think that we've -- and I'll also point out that with the one-day, the increase in one-day, sellers have participated in that as much as anyone else -- I mean as much as our 1P offering. So it's been a great boon for sellers as well as particularly our FBA program.
On the holiday season question, we are not anticipating that the move of the shorter time period between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day is going to be that impactful. What we've found in the past is that there's generally a holiday budget that is spent somewhere between November 15 and -- or November 1 maybe and December 25. And while certainly Black Friday and Cyber Monday are important dates in that holiday period, there's -- the purchases tend to move around. Some have been moving early in the quarter. Some have been moving later in the quarter as customers count on and receive very quick shipments at the end and have higher faith in delivery just before the holidays. So that's all the color. That's what's anticipated in our guidance that we've given.",252
