I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. 
We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
First, you likely saw last week, we announced that Haviv Ilan will become President and CEO on April 1, and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you want to join me in congratulating both of them. 
Secondly, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. Next week on Thursday, February 2 at 10 a.m. Central Time, we'll have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insights into our business and our approach to capital allocation. This will include an update of our 300-millimeter capacity expansion plant to support the increasing confidence that we have in our long-term growth. 
Moving on today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I'll then provide an annual summary of our revenue breakdown by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2023. 
Starting with a quick overview. Revenue was $4.7 billion, a decrease of 11% sequentially and 3% from the same quarter a year ago. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. A component of the weaker demand was customers working to reduce their inventories. In the first quarter, we expect a weaker than seasonal decline with the exception of automotive as we believe customers will continue to reduce inventory levels. 
Turning to our segments. Fourth quarter Analog revenue declined 5% year-over-year and Embedded Processing grew 10%. Our Other segment declined 11% from the year ago quarter. 
Now I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. I'll focus on sequential performance again this quarter as it's more informative at this time.  
First, the industrial market was down about 10%. The automotive market was up mid-single digits with strength in most sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-teens with broad-based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down about 20%. And finally, enterprise systems was also down about 20%. Lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2022. We break our end markets into 6 categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. 
The 6 end markets are industrial, automotive, personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for 2022, industrial was 40%; automotive about 25%; personal electronics, 20%; communications equipment, 7%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other was 2%. 
In 2022, industrial and automotive combined made up 65% of TI's revenue, up about 3 percentage points from 2021 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to Analog and Embedded technologies to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",696

As Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion or 66% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 320 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $863 million, up 9% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion or 17% of revenue. 
Restructuring charges were $48 million in the fourth quarter and were associated with the LFAB factory preproduction costs. As production started at the beginning of December, this cost then transitioned to cost of revenue, where they will be reflected moving forward. In addition, depreciation has begun on these assets. 
Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter or 47% of revenue. Operating profit was down 13% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $2 billion or $2.13 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.11 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion, down 6% from a year ago. 
In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $848 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. We also increased our dividend per share by 8% in the fourth quarter, marking our 19th year of dividend increases. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we issued $800 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.93%. Inventory was up $353 million from the prior quarter to $2.8 billion, and days were 157, up 24 days sequentially. 
Next to summarize the benefits of the CHIPS Act, we accrued about $350 million on our balance sheet under long-term assets in fourth quarter, in addition to the $50 million accrued in the third quarter. These accruals are due to 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. 
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2022, cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion or 14% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2022 was $5.9 billion or 30% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.90. We now expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. 
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",635

Is that also broadly based in terms of the decline as you've seen in Q4? And I know you don't guide by segment, but any kind of color you could provide by segment as to what you're seeing and the extent to which customers are burning inventory as you know into the first quarter?",80

I'd say that the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter will continue in the first, meaning that we expect our end markets to decline with the exception of automotive. So automotive is continuing to be resilient. And we do believe, as you just said, that the customers are continuing to work to get their inventories lower. So you have a follow-on?",69
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2023",2023-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2193.0,2720916.0,102033113.0,Question,Christopher Caso,,Analysts,6,"I do. I wonder if you could speak about the pace of depreciation expenses as you go through next year. You spoke about RFAB and I know it started production and it's hitting depreciation now. Is there additional incremental depreciation coming from RFAB as go through the year? What happens to LFAB as you, I guess, maybe the timing of when that starts production and start hitting depreciation? 
And then how should we think about some of the benefits that come from CHIPS Act that tend to decrease depreciation over time. I'm sure you're going to speak about that on the capital day coming up as well.",107
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2023",2023-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2193.0,2720916.0,102033114.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,7,"Yes. Let me take that, and we're going to go through all of that, both the CapEx, depreciation and ITC and the CHIPS Act in great detail next week. For now, what I would tell you is, as you said, RFAB2 is in production, Lehi is in production. So both of those are running. That cost now is in cost of revenue and they're both depreciated -- they're both depreciating and that is a function of the -- when the equipment is placed in service it starts appreciating, right? So as both of those ramps, the quilting service starts appreciating. 
But big picture, what we told you last year, on depreciation was that it would ramp roughly linearly to about $2.5 billion in 2025. And again, we'll give you an update on that next week. But I do want to say, just as I said 90 days ago, that since we talked about this last year, our confidence surrounding our long-term growth prospects have only grown. And as you alluded to, we've had the CHIPS Act also since last year, that legislation passed in August, so we'll -- next week, we'll give you all the puts and takes between those trends and we'll paint a clear picture at that point.",210

And maybe just to add a small piece. That linear ramp will go from about $1 billion of depreciation that we had this year at about $0.5 billion a year until we get to $2.5 billion. So just kind of doing the math for you. So thanks, Chris. Now we will go to the next caller, please.",58

So Dave, I believe you said that your confidence in the long-term growth rate has only increased. Maybe just share with us what you've seen in the last 3 to 6 months that's giving you that confidence? Do you expect the, I guess, non-auto markets to bounce back this year? And conversely, would you expect auto to cool offer to remain strong all year?",69

And again, that's -- thanks for the question, Chris. The longer-term growth rates are really -- we're speaking to how things are going to grow over the next 3 and 5 and 10 years. And that higher confidence comes from the higher semiconductor content growth that we're seeing, particularly in industrial and automotive. 
And the fact that those 2 markets now make up 2/3 of our revenue. So just as that structurally grows faster than the rest of the market, we're convinced more than ever that, that will continue to drive our top line and also the products that we have inside of those markets. And I'd say also the strong customer response we're getting to our geopolitically dependable capacity. So since we've shared publicly our plans last February in capital management call, I'd just say that the response has been very, very strong. So those are really the 3 things that are adding to our confidence. Do you have a follow-up?",163
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2023",2023-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2193.0,2720916.0,102033119.0,Question,Christopher Danely,,Analysts,12,"Yes. One on inventory. So it's bouncing up towards your long-term target. Can you talk about when you would start to ease back utilization rates to maintain that inventory? And then maybe spend a little bit of time on the mix. I know there's still shortages out there. How do you think -- how long do you think it will take to, I guess, balance out your inventory this year to achieve some sort of ideal mix?",77
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2023",2023-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2193.0,2720916.0,102033120.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,13,"Yes. So let me take that. And first, big picture, let me point you to our scorecard. The one that we use for capital management, we talked about the objectives in -- when it comes to inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, keeping stable lead times while minimizing inventory obsolescence. You know our strategy and our portfolio is such that it's long lived. We have very diverse customer base. So the risk of obsolescence is very low. So that's part of the equation. 
And the other part is the upside that we get by having that inventory, both short term and long term to support customers. So that's why we're comfortable holding higher levels of inventory. I've been talking about from current levels, we could add $1 billion to $2 billion of additional inventory. And the timing -- that all depends on revenue trends. 
So if they are higher, then it will take longer. If the service trends are a little weaker, it will be a little faster to get there. On the mix, there's a number of angles on that. Chip stock versus finished goods, we have a mix of both of those. And in some cases, it makes sense to have more of one than the other, but they're both very low risk. So that's how we think about it.",225

And more importantly, how you're thinking about Q1 and beyond? I guess there's hope out there that China as an economy bounces back in '23, are you guys seeing any early signs of a recovery in terms of end consumption of your products?",72

I'd say some of the disruptions that we saw earlier in the year, we didn't see any of that here in the fourth quarter. And so nothing exceptional to report with China as a region versus the other regions. And we long held the practice that we call it out if there's something going on. So really, nothing exceptional. And certainly, as that economy comes back and consumption increases in China, obviously, helping the world GDP, but that would obviously help us as well. It is what we would expect. So -- do you have a follow-on?",98

Your Analog business in the quarter was down 5% year-to-year and obviously, you guys are the first to report, so it's hard for us to compare and contrast how you guys did relative to your competition or your peer group. But it feels like you may have underperformed in the quarter, and I realize it's only 1 quarter. What's the competitive landscape like today? What kind of pricing trends are you seeing as demand patterns start to soften?",81

Yes. I'll take that question, and Rafael, if you like to add. But I think certainly looking at any particular quarter, as we've talked about before, that our performance is just best measured over time. And I think that, that's the way the markets behave. And even looking at 1 year or even longer, you've got to look at 3 and 5 and 10 years of performance, especially when you go through choppy times like we've been through in the last 18 months or so. 
And so pricing, just to comment on that. I'd say that there's nothing unusual going on with pricing -- as you know, pricing doesn't move quickly in our markets, our practices in pricing, though I know that they've changed with many of our peers, our practices have not changed. We just continue to price aggressively in the marketplace, but that pricing isn't the reason why customers choose our products. That's usually not the top few reasons why they choose our products. So really no changes on that front. So thank you for those questions. 
And we'll go to the next caller.",187

Did cancellations continue to increase through Q4? Did they level off? And then for your consignment-based business, what are the aggregate trends that you're seeing within your customers 6- to 9-month sort of rolling forecast.",45

Harlan, so the first question is, in a weakening environment, not too surprising. The cancellations were up in the quarter. So we did see an increase there. And not -- and from a consignment versus classic backlog customers, really not much difference there. Their visibility, even though we'll get visibility out 6 months, their visibility to their demand can change as we know, very rapidly within the 90 days or certainly even within 30 days as that -- those windows move a long time. 
So I would say that there's not much change in that. And oftentimes, if customers aren't canceling orders, what they're doing is rescheduling them back out in time. So we're certainly seeing that happen as well. 
Do you have a follow-on?",126

So Embedded drove 10% year-over-year growth in the second half of last year. It also drove a slight sequential growth in the fourth quarter. So the business is holding up relatively well versus Analog. And I know that the team seems to have moved past some of the headwinds in this segment as you've sort of focused investments on selective markets and opportunities, right? Is that refocusing like helping the near-term trends in Embedded? And with all of the restructuring, how do you think about the forward opportunities and growth outlook for Embedded over the next few years?",99

Thanks -- great question. Thank you for it. Yes, first, I would just say that our efforts having an impact they are. And I would just say that we're pleased with the progress that we're making there with Embedded, and we believe that progress in those results just need to be measured again over time. 
So we continue to work on that business and we'll continue to do that. When we think about the market opportunity for Embedded and Analog, we think that both of those markets have about the same growth opportunities. So in time, they'll -- the growth rates will converge though they could be -- you could see differences in any given quarter. But longer term, we believe that they can grow at the same rates.

The margins are quite a bit lower than in early '21 on quite a bit more revenue. 
I guess, is that all just still supply chain-related costs? And do we get that back at some point? And then on share, just in that same point, the share, we don't know what the -- all of the calendar fourth quarter looks like, but it's pretty clear that the share is going to be down about 150 basis points this year and you're kind of back to 2012 levels. So I just wonder kind of what's going on there? Is there some -- is there some pricing issues that might explain why that share would be down so much next, Dave? And then I have a follow-up.",143

And yes, let me address first on your margin question. Analog is a huge portion of the company. So anything you're seeing in Analog is what you're seeing at the company level. And when it comes to gross profit, we're very pleased with the results. We came in about as expected. And it decreased, as we said in the prepared remarks, it decreased primarily due to lower revenue. 
The transition of LFAB-related cost to cost of revenue as well as the cost related to increased investments over the last several quarters that are now flowing through the P&L. Those are long-term investments that are going to position us very well for top line growth for many years to come. 
And on the second part of the question, I think Dave already answered, you got to look at this over a long time, not only 1 quarter. And particularly during choppy times. So stay tuned on that.",162

And I'll just add that I think our approach to building closer relationships with customers has served us well. As you know, we've moved and taken more of our revenue direct as well as providing services through ti.com. So it's provided a lot of advantages, including us being better able to see and respond to changes in demand. 
And as customers are reducing their inventories now, we haven't employed any long-term sales agreements or noncancelable non-reschedulable contracts, really just focused on customers and trying to meet their needs and service them well for the long term. 
I think all those things has us in a position where we do believe that we're able to grow the top line faster over the next few years. And as we talked about, we'll give you some insight into that next week and how that's going to change some of our plans. So -- was that Tim's follow-up or you have a follow-up, Tim?",161

So year-on-year, automotive was up about 30%. And just to put that in context from fourth quarter '19, I just picked that because it's pre-pandemic levels, our revenues in auto are up in the mid-70s. So we continue to see strong growth there. 
So that's the year-on-year -- the comment that we made before that it was up mid-single digits was a sequential comment; Tim.

I'll just stay with autos. It's interesting data point versus the pre-pandemic. But I'm just looking at the auto business and the rest of the business, everything is decelerating, as you would expect, and auto seems to be, if not accelerating, kind of in that high 20%, 30% range. I just wanted your perspective on what's your sense? Usually, all these things are pretty interconnected and maybe it's a quarter or 2 quarters before everything kind of follows the same cadence. So I would just love to get some perspective from you guys on the disparity between autos and the rest of the broader businesses?",106

Ambrish, thanks. I'd say that as we you almost have to go back to the beginning of the pandemic and how revenues behaved as we went through first quarter and into second and third. And if you remember, as the pandemic spread in third quarter, we saw a wide and very deep cancellations across all of the markets, including automotive, but as we all went home to set up our home offices, we either bought a new monitor or a printer or PC. 
So very quickly, our personal electronics customers came back and came back very strong, if you remember. The other markets began to follow, but automotive was the last to respond. And people early in the pandemic weren't shopping for cars, they weren't going out of the house. So they had that issue and as manufacturers tried to reopen, they had more issues with COVID protocols and working to bring their plants back online. 
So it's not too surprising that as it asynchronously came out, it's asynchronously going down. So -- but all these markets, we believe, over the long term, will behave the same. 
And at some point, we believe that we will see a correction in automotive. It may not, but we don't -- we just don't know. And we'll continue to ship product to customer demand. It's obviously very strong. There's lots of reasons why besides us gaining share, there's more content, there's mix and other factors inside of that. But clearly, there's inventory built across all markets is inclusive of automotive. 
So do you have a follow-on?",264

So the CHIPS Act has both an ITC, investment tax credit and grants. So you're asking about the grants. We're still working through those details. We do not have an update to share right now. Though the applications open in February. So we are actively -- we're going to actively seek funding on those in whatever we could qualify. So we're going to submit our application in February. But right now, we don't have any information to share on that.

In fact, let me take a second and kind of walk through how it flows through the financials. So you can actually look at our balance sheet on the Page 4 of our release, the other long-term assets that is up to $1.1 billion. You can see the increase year-on-year. That's where a $400 million receivable is for that ITC. 
If we had not taken the ITC, that $400 million would have gone to property, plant and equipment. So you can see property, plant and equipment $6.9 billion, that would have been $7.3 billion. So instead on a long-term asset, a receivable Therefore, it's not going to depreciate that $400 million doesn't appreciate because it's not part of PP&E. 
And eventually, we'll get the cash. Now to your question right now, based on our interpretation of the law, we're not going to get that cash until late '24. And then every year, it will be like 1 year in [ arrears ], right? You get a kind of 1 year late, but that could change. Clearly, that's something that companies are advocating forward to get that cash early. 
But right now, we're not planning to get that until '24. So again, that's how you see it on the balance sheet, lower PP&E. You see a receivable instead then because of lower PP&E, you have lower depreciation over the life of the asset and then the receivable because the receivable eventually, you get the cash, so it goes from a receivable to the cash line. right? And then eventually, we return it to the owners of the company or use it for other corporate purposes. Hopefully, that answers your question.",280

So yes, so not to add more confusion, but we get the cash through filing the taxes. However, this will not affect the tax rate because the accounting will put that, as I just described, through lower PP&E and you actually see the cash in the cash flow statement in the investing section. But the actual receiving of the cash happens at tax filing time in October or so of September of every year, and we just paid less taxes to that.

Joshua, maybe just quickly, obviously, when customers begin reducing inventory, it's number 1 quarter phenomenon. It usually takes several quarters for that to happen. We won't have insight.

A lot of attention gets paid to your CapEx for obvious reasons, but R&D grew, I think, 7%, 8% in 2022, after being flat for a few years. And I think you guys fair unfair get [ deemed ] for under investing on the R&D line. So I was wondering, could you walk through some of your priorities for that spending? And how should we think about R&D into 2023 recognized? It might be a question for next week.",80

No, I'm happy to address that. So first, these are long-term investments in nature. The R&D clearly -- that's where we get the -- continue to build in the broad portfolio. That's where we have process technology, and that we get results over many, many years into the future, and we're going to protect those investments. 
But it's not just R&D. Even in SG&A, we have areas that are tied to capabilities, ti.com is the best example. That's another place where we're investing, and that's tied to long-term top line growth of the company to be strengthening the reach of channel advantage. 
You could add CapEx to that picture, that's also obviously a long-term investment to strengthen our manufacturing and technology advantage. If you look at the -- over the last 4 or 5 years, our OpEx or R&D and SG&A, they've been at a very steady $3.2 billion for -- like 4 or 5 years. This year, for the first time, we ticked that up to $3.4 billion. So we went up a little bit as we increased the investments [ and actually there ] was an impact on -- due to inflation, which we're not immune to that. 
You can expect that to continue increasing a little bit over the -- in '23 and over the next several years as we continue to increase investment. There's also the inflation component. And -- but big picture, those are great long-term investments that will fuel the growth for the company over the next 10 to 15 years.",258

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide some insight into first quarter's revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the second quarter of 2023. 
Starting with a quick overview of the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.4 billion, a decrease of 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 14%, Embedded Processing grew 6% and our Other segment declined 16% from the year ago quarter. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. 
As mentioned last quarter, a component of the weaker demand was inventory reductions by our customers, which we expect to continue in the second quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by market. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. 
First, the industrial market was about flat. The automotive market was up mid-single digits. Personal electronics declined about 30% as we continued to see broad-based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down mid-teens. And finally, enterprise systems was down about 30%. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",353

As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, down 11% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin decreased 480 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $929 million, up 14% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.5 billion or 18% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter or 44% of revenue and was down 25% from a year ago quarter. 
Net income in the first quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guide. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $7.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenses were $982 million in the quarter and $3.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $4.4 billion. 
In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $100 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.5 billion in the past 12 months. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.4 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $10.2 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.2%. Inventory dollars were up $531 million from the prior quarter to $3.3 billion. And days were 195, up 38 days sequentially. 
For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.88. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. 
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",412

So you did CapEx of $982 million in the quarter. I just -- first, can you just clarify, that's the gross number without any of the tax credits? And I guess, assuming that's true, both the CapEx and the depreciation number in the quarter are running well below the run rate there or the annualized number that you have given at the capital management, CapEx should have been about $5 billion for the year, depreciation, maybe $1.5 million. So am I right in assuming that it implies fairly substantial ramp into the back half and the end of the year for both those metrics, CapEx and depreciation?",120

Good question there. So it gives us a chance to clarify those. So first, on CapEx, we're pleased with the progress that we've made both in 2022, but also year-to-date first quarter of this year, everything is in line with expectations. As we shared on the call a couple of months ago, we expect CapEx to average $5 billion per year for the next 4 years. That's just an average, so some years will be lower, especially at the beginning and other years will be higher. But our expectation continues to be $5 billion per year. Those numbers -- that $5 billion is gross and the $982 million, the one -- close to $1 billion that you just quoted for the quarter that's also gross. 
We are continuing to accrue for the CHIPS Act benefit. I can tell you about that in a follow-up question, if you like. But the CapEx numbers have been and will continue to be gross numbers. 
On the second part of your question on depreciation, so we told you that -- at the capital management call that depreciation will increase to about $2.5 billion on or around 2025. We expect this year to be below that linear trend, okay? And that's just the CapEx is coming in as expected, but it's a function of other things essentially when you place the equipment in service and when it starts depreciation, the assumptions that we had on that versus exactly how it's playing out. Do you have a follow-up?",258

I'm going to let somebody else ask about the CHIPS Act accrual. I'm going to ask about inventories. So you're -- you're at almost 200 days of inventory. And I think the top end of your target was 190, you said you'd be comfortable above that. So we're kind of there. Are you done building inventory now? I guess, and if that's the case, what happens to fab loadings? I guess, as we go into the end of the year, assuming you're running pretty full right now. Do those fab loadings need to come down, especially given the revenue trajectory and given inventories are sitting pretty close to 200 days?",112

You look at the objective there, if you maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence, we have a range there. It's just meant to be informative and it's 130 to greater than 200. I just want to clarify that versus the number that you mentioned. 
The more important thing is I refer you to Slide 13 in that deck, and anybody who hasn't seen that, you can download it from our website, go to Slide 13. That shows you how we think about planning for the long term. So through semiconductor, the ups and downs of the semiconductor cycle. And that informs how we manage inventory, also informs that we are investing in CapEx. So we're thinking through the cycles over the long term. But certainly, inventory is one of those things that we take that trend into account. In the near term, we expect to have an upward bias on inventory as we prepare for long-term growth.",184

If I heard you, Dave, I think you said industrial was flattish in Q1. I think it was down 10% in the last quarter. So it seems like it's starting to flatten out, but I just wanted to check if that's the right conclusion. I think auto was up mid-single in both Q4, and I said -- and I thought you said in Q1 as well. So that also seems to be in the right direction. 
So the specific question is, as we look into Q2, how should we think about industrial and auto? Can they say at least kind of flattish? Or do you think that they are also exposed to the macro weakness?",124

So first, confirm that you heard correctly, industrial market was about flat in the first quarter and automotive was up mid-single digits. And as you know, our practice -- when we think about guidance by end market, we only provide color if there's something that we need to highlight to explain what's going on. You've seen us do that multiple times, whether it's end markets or it's regions or something specific that's going on. So as you said, at the midpoint of our guidance, revenue was flat. And -- so when we look strategically at both of those markets, we're very confident that they will continue to add semiconductor content per unit and be great growers for us. So you have a follow-on to that?",126

And when I look at what your competitors or -- right, peers are seeing in Analog and microcontroller market, they are noticing a level of stability and strength, and that's what I want to confirm with TI. That are you seeing the same thing as you go into Q2? Because, yes, consumer is weak, right, enterprise is weak, that is well known. 
But specifically auto and industrial, do you think they are now trending in the right direction in Q2? Or do you think that you are in front of some weakness and inventory adjustment in those markets also?",130

Because you have less exposure than many of your peers. So in theory, you should be farther along the inventory correction and you're more connected in real-time to demand. So when you sort of look at your customer inventory levels, where do you think we are? Do you think that we're sort of in the late innings of the correction for you because you are a bit more connected to demand in real time?",91
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2090.0,2785447.0,103949301.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,15,"Yes. I think, Tim, as you know, this is the first time that our markets, not only for us but the industry have behaved differently as we've gone into this cycle. So if you look at personal electronics, we began seeing weakness in personal electronics back second quarter a year ago, right? So we're now into our fourth quarter of weaker demand. The other markets, with the exception of automotive, began weakening the quarter before last. So we're a couple of quarters in on that. So -- and of course, automotive has remained strong through last quarter. 
So you put all that together, I think it depends on which market you're looking at. If you're in PE, you're obviously closer to the bottom than you are to the top. So I think our practice, we don't try to predict where the bottom or the top is. It really draws -- draw your attention back to Slide 13 that we talked about that longer-term trend is what we're planning on and what we believe we can look at to inform our decisions. Do you have a follow-on?",186

Yes. So I know the SIA data can be noisy and you always say to look at things on kind of a TTM basis. And if you sort of roll it back, it looks like your share has gone down in Analog roughly 200 basis points versus where it peaked in the early part of COVID.
So as you sort of forensically go back and try to figure out what's happened, do you think that's entirely based on supply? So in other words, if you didn't have the shortages that you did you think that you wouldn't have lost that share? I'm just kind of wondering, as you look back at the numbers, how you forensically try to explain that share loss relative to the industry data?",130
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2090.0,2785447.0,103949303.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,17,"Yes. As we talked about, that's something we think you have to look at over time, if you go back to the prior year is with the pandemic started, you remember, we made some decisions to continue to run our factories and build long-lived inventory and those decisions served us very well. So as we went through each quarter as customers really expedited across the board, we could respond to that and ship them product. And in the short term, that probably helped us with the numbers when you compare it against what the industry was doing. 
So as we go into the following year, of course, those are tougher compares. But we have a lot of practices that I think are different than many of our peers. As an example, through that period, we've moved to more closer direct relationships with customers. We believe that, that's giving us much better insight. We can see their demand more clearly. We can see what they need, both short term and long term, much better. 
Also I'd say that as we were moving through a period where most of our customers were reducing their inventory to align with their needs, we haven't employed things like long-term sales agreements or non-cancelable, non-reschedulable contracts. So customers aren't taking product that they don't need. So that isn't share gains, it's just -- I think for us, we want to be as easy to do business with as we can. And those -- I think all those practices are setting us up well to continue to gain share. So thank you, Tim.",266

It did go down sequentially, but not even as much as it would have if you just took the LFAB expense out of OpEx and put it into COGS. So were there any unique offsets to that? And probably more importantly, any unique offsets we need to consider as we think going forward? And I know, Rafael, you don't guide to gross margin specifically.",90

No. I would tell you, it was similar to Ambrish's question, high level, think of the model we've given you is 70% to 75% fall-through. But that in any one quarter, even if it's on a year-on-year basis, but especially sequentially on relatively small changes in revenue, that's not going to work very precisely, right? 
So -- but over a long enough time, that works well. As we just talked about, you had the depreciation. And then in this particular quarter, you have to adjust for the costs that were in restructuring that were for Lehi that now go to -- primarily to cost of revenue. 
Now there are other factors that are going to play, for example, and I mentioned it to Ambrish a second ago, but mix is a factor. So you get a quarter with a lot more industrial, automotive and less personal electronics, that plays into it. And the final one, depreciation doesn't necessarily immediately flow through the P&L because it needs to be matched to inventory. 
So that generally flows through inventory first and then -- so that sometimes delays the impact of -- the true impact of depreciation to the gross margin. But clearly, depreciation, as I mentioned earlier, is increasing, so it's coming. So over a long enough time, multiple quarters, certain years, you need to factor it as we have talked about, right, the fall-through and the increase in depreciation.",239

I'll just pivot to round up that CHIPS Act question from earlier. Rafael, could you give us an update on what the cumulative accruals are for that? And probably equally importantly, when does that likely flow through the income statement?",43
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2090.0,2785447.0,103949314.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,28,"Yes. So stepping back, CHIPS Act has an investment tax credit, ITC, and a grant. There's 2 components that have the potential to benefit us. If you go to our capital management document, we talked about those, and we said we are planning on the benefits from the ITC, and we're accruing those benefits. On the grant, we're not because the grants are highly discretionary. It's up to the Department of Commerce. So on those -- we're not counting on those, but we're applying to those grants, and we're in the process of submitting those applications and we're asking for everything we can get there. But right now counting on nothing. 
Now let me just focus on the ITC, which is the one that we are booking on the balance sheet. This last quarter, we accrued another $200 million benefit. So that's on top of the roughly $400 million last year. So now we have a total benefit that we have accrued of $600 million. That number will continue increasing for the rest of the year, and that's a 25% of qualifying assets in the United States. So we'll continue to increase that number over the year. 
And then what happens is we benefit in a couple of ways. One, the P&L, that accrual comes out of the PP&E, property, plant and equipment basis. So now you have a lower basis to depreciate. So their depreciation is going to be lower going forward. We're already getting a small benefit of that this year, but it's in a couple of million dollars, but that will grow over time as those -- that equipment goes into -- is placed in service and now depreciated at a lower rate. 
More importantly, the cash benefit associated with that will get the following year. So anything that we accrue this year and -- in '22 and is placed in service in 2023, we will get that cash at the end of 2024, okay? And we're -- that's what we're planning on. I think that answers your question fairly well.",344

I think, Chris, this is one of the previous questions, somewhat similar, right? I think you have to look at it by market. Certainly, in personal electronics, being in the fourth quarter of the weakness would indicate you're probably closer to the bottom. There's no guarantee of that, but you're probably closer than in other markets, right? So that just isn't something that we try to predict.

So our linearity was stronger in the last month of the quarter. And in backlog, I would say, as you know, we've got sales flowing through ti.com. We've got sales that are on consignment where we get direct feeds and we don't actually carry a backlog. So we just don't put a lot of emphasis on the backlog, overall, I think compared to many of our peers. But we've got really good visibility because of our close relationships with customers. The fact that we're carrying, we're owning and controlling that inventory more directly and so actually, we've got -- we believe that gives us really great visibility on demand.",110

So your gross margins came a little better than what we thought for March. And so just curious, are you still on track for that $1.5 billion depreciation for the year? And were there any changes in kind of the timing of installation of equipment? Are you still seeing kind of a tight supply there?",68

So let me address that. First, CapEx. We're very pleased with our CapEx has come in. We did about $1 billion in the quarter. We talked a couple of months ago that we expect about $5 billion per year for the next 4 years, that's an average. So some years will be less, some years will be more. So $1 billion per quarter. That's obviously a $4 billion run rate for the year. So somewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion for this year would be about right on the CapEx. And that's coming in just as expected. 
Depreciation, we -- what we talked about a couple of months ago at the call was we expect it to increase to $2.5 billion at some point in the future in 2025 -- on or about 2025. We -- but this year, we expect that trend to be below linear. So instead of $500 million increase per year from the starting point of '22, it will be less than that in 2023. I think Ambrish had the specific number on that. We're not disclosing that at this point, but I would just tell you look at -- we just did $265 million for the quarter. So you can do your own math of -- that was $249 million in the previous quarter. So you can think of that and come up with a decent approximation of where that may end up, and we'll give you more details, obviously, in subsequent quarters. Do you have a follow-up?",255

But actually, I shouldn't discount the 28-nanometer plus part of the world. 
So as you think about regionalization and as you think about perhaps a rising kind of competitor in the China landscape looking out over the next 5-plus years, how are you thinking about the pros and cons and how you'll compete kind of in that environment?",98
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2023",2023-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2090.0,2785447.0,103949329.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,43,"Yes, C.J., thanks for that question. I'd say that when you look at our products and markets, we've got 4 competitive advantages that we continue to invest in, I think that make us stronger and different than our competitors. And we've talked about them before, right? The first is the manufacturing and technology. Owning and controlling those assets we think will be of growing importance and where they are in the world, also, we believe, will be a benefit to us as well. 
Second is the broad -- our broad product portfolio. So competitors that we have around the world, but especially in China, usually only compete with us in a very, very narrow slice of our product portfolio. That said, we've competed with those companies, in some cases, for a couple of decades now. So competition there isn't new. And -- so they're good competitors. We can learn from them. We're not dismissive of them, and we close -- we very closely track and I believe the number somewhere around 75 different competitors around the world that we'll compete with. 
The third competitive advantage is the reach of our market channels. And especially when you look at some of the smaller competitors in China, they just don't have the reach. They don't have the breadth of portfolio that attracts customers for engagement and that just gives us better insight. 
And then the last is diversity and longevity. So there's not one market or technology that we're dependent on to provide market share lift. Now we'll be dependent on all of them. And sometimes in the short term, that may favor one competitor versus another. But longer term, as we compete broadly in all the markets, we think that, that will translate into long-term and sticky share gains. So overall, we're pleased and excited about where we are from a position standpoint, whether we're looking at our traditional competitors here in the U.S. or Europe and as well as those in China. So thank you very much. And I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap this up.",348

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the third quarter of 2023.
Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially and a decrease of 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 18%, Embedded Processing grew 9%, and our Other segment declined 10% from the year-ago quarter.
Now, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, we experienced continued weakness across all markets, except automotive. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. 
First, the industrial market was about flat. Next, the automotive market was up low single digits. Personal Electronics was up low single digits after several quarters of sequential declines. And next, Communications Equipment was down mid-teens. And finally, Enterprise Systems was down mid-single digits.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",330

As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion, or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 540 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $938 million, up 12% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.6 billion, or 19% of revenue. Operating profit was $2 billion in the quarter, or 44% of revenue, and was down 28% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.87 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.
Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter and $7.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $3.2 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $80 million of our own stock. In total, we have returned $6.5 billion in the past 12 months.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt and issued $1.6 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory dollars were up $441 million from the prior quarter to $3.7 billion, and days were 207, up 12 days sequentially. 
For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.36 billion to $4.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.92. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%.
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",423

Versus peers, it's significantly below. And when I look at your trailing 12-month free cash flow of sub-17%, if my model is right, that is the lowest since 2010. At what point will TI say that something needs to change in the strategy to help close the gap on the growth side and to help free cash flow margins get back to the trend line? So I understand that, obviously, you're not optimizing the model for just one year. But now, we have seen just consistent decline in free cash flow per share, which is your preferred metric. So at what point should we start to see free cash flow get back to historical trends?",141

So thanks, Vivek. Let me start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But big picture, a step back to what we told you during capital management, and the investments that we're making are long term in nature, as you alluded to in your question, and we are going to enable revenue growth for the company for the next 10 to 15 years, okay? So that's how we're thinking about it. And that's why we're making these investments on CapEx, in particular, about $5 billion per year for the next 4 years. And we are committed to those investments. We're excited to making those investments regardless of the short-term fluctuations of revenue. And of course, lower revenue means lower operating cash, which now, with the CapEx, that's what you're seeing on the free cash flow, it's not unexpected.",140

And maybe I'll just add that, Vivek, as you know and have followed us for some time, one of our competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology. So these CapEx investments really are strengthening that advantage over time. It's fairly obvious that, that -- those investments will allow us to produce products at significantly lower cost when -- to service demand. And controlling those assets in today's world is increasingly important so customers can see the investments that we're making, not only with that, the other systems that we've got to make it easier to do business with us, combined with the inventory we're putting in place to support their growth. And customer reaction is extremely positive to that. So we believe these will be great investments for all of us long term.
Do you have a follow-on?",138

I guess maybe, to say -- ask the same question but in a different way, right? And with respect -- I mean, TI had the same strategy 2 or 3 years ago also, but we saw sales grow worse than peers last year. And sales are again growing worse than peers this year. So it's not a one quarter or 2 quarter phenomena. Sales have been undergrowing your peer group for almost 2 years now. And CapEx is growing while sales are declining. So that's why I'm questioning whether the strategy is still right, whether the results are actually justifying the strategy?",103

Again, we've talked about is share doesn't move quickly inside of our markets. I think that depending on the peer you're comparing to, oftentimes, the market exposure can explain a good portion of it. There's other factors like how much distribution is someone using. As you know, we've transitioned from mostly using distribution to mostly having revenue come direct. So there was inventory that needed to be burned out of the channel as we made that transition. 
So there's multiple factors. I think going forward, our confidence in being able to continue to gain share is extremely high. Customer reaction to the capacity that they know they need to have, wanting to know that they've got capacity runway, not from someone's manufacturing supplier, but directly from someone that makes their products, is -- really resonates with customers.",147

You're guiding revenue up 1% sequentially. Dave, you called out automotive as the one end market that continues to be healthy.

I'll just point out that this last quarter, we saw weakness across the board in our markets with the exception of automotive, like you've called out. And just to point out that, that continued asynchronous behavior, we had PE weaken back in second quarter a year ago. And the other markets followed, but obviously, the exception of that with automotive continued to be strong. And it's up over 20% year-on-year. So definitely very strong growth there. And as we look into third quarter, we're not expecting to see any significant change in our end markets compared to this last quarter.

So inventory on your balance sheet was up, I think, 13% sequentially. Days grew to 207. I know on your capital management call, you revised up the upper range of your target to more than 200.

Are you still comfortable with where things are today?",79

No, thanks for the question, Toshiya. Yes, we are comfortable where we are. As a reminder, our objective for inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service and minimize obsolescence. I would point you to Slide 13 at our capital management call. That shows the semiconductor cycle over many years, over about 30-some years, in what that informs us on what could happen in the future. And we're planning for the long-term growth through those cycles, not in any one quarter or even any one year.
And of course, inventory levels always depend on demand expectations. And for the time being in the near term, they will likely have an upward bias.",114

So there's very likely that the dollars will go up in Q3.

And we forecast one quarter at a time. Just know that our thinking, it's long term in nature, as I talked -- as I mentioned to Toshiya in the previous call. And we're managing through the cycles, right? So not what's going to happen in one quarter or even two quarters. Well, we think it's going to happen over longer than that on inventory. On capacity, we're adding capacity that's going to support us for many years, right? So it's going to give us plenty of headroom.
One more comment on inventory, just for those who maybe have not listened to us very often, but you know there's -- our inventory has very low obsolescence. The bulk of it is for catalog parts that -- the inventory itself last year is, in fact, up to 10 years on the shelf, but the product life cycles are very long with our customers, and we have, in many cases, tens or dozens of customers that buy the product. So the risk of obsolescence is very low under the inventory.",197

It's unique in semis and much appreciated. My first question is just on lead times and shortages. Given all the capacity you're adding in the inventory, can we pretty much say that TI lead times are the lowest, at least among peers, and the shortages are all gone? Are we pretty much, I guess, ""back to normal""? And I mean, are there any metrics that you could share with us sort of now versus 3 or 6 months ago on the improvement there?",94

Chris, what I would -- how I would frame it today is we've got -- the vast majority of our products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. And as Rafael talked about, whenever the upturn does come, we'll have product available as well as capacity behind that to be able to support that demand.
Now if a customer wants to give us an order at lead time, those lead times over the cycle haven't changed that much. So they can place that order. If they need it inside of that, they can, for the vast majority of the products, have it available. Now we do have hotspots. We'll probably always have a place where we have a demand and supply imbalance. But those hotspots are closing and closing pretty quickly. As Rafael talked about, we're bringing on capacity every quarter. So that just gives us more flexibility to be able to meet the customer demand. But it does vary beyond what we've got on hand.

And of course, we regularly monitor what the pricing of all of our products, and we may maintain the goal to continue to gain share over time. But there's nothing unusual going on with pricing today. And I'll point out the fact that when we opened up our Fab 1, we had 75% of the tools needed inside of that factory, and there was handwringing back then if you remember that we were going to do something unnatural. And what we talked about was putting in place that capacity to support growth, and that's what it did.

Thanks for that. So your Embedded business continues to hold up very well, right? I think trailing 12 months, it's up 9% year-over-year versus your Analog business, which is down 7%. I know part of it is due to the strategy, the refocusing of the MCU businesses over the past few years. More general purpose, catalog-focused, right? But it also seems to be reflecting this broader trend in the industry, if I look at the SIA data, if I look at you and your other MCU competitors, where industry MCU trends year-over-year are holding up much, much better versus the Analog.

Yes, thanks for that question, Harlan, and how you framed it. I would say at a top level, the changes that we have made to our product portfolio, the design-in, that, then the customer response to those products as we've put them out in the marketplace continues to be very strong. Our confidence that, that business will grow and gain market share over the long term is extremely high based on that. And as we've talked about before, we're putting in place to be able to support that growth for Embedded internally, and that is a position that we haven't been in quite some time.
Near term, I would say, besides things stabilizing, we've experienced greater supply constraints over the last 2 years as Embedded has previously had to rely on foundries to supply that demand. And so those constraints are alleviating. And I think that, that's just something that you see across the industry.
So thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller.",167

I mean, I understand the inventory is not going to be obsolete, but it's eventually going to kind of steal from your future ability to scale gross margins. So I mean, at the current run rate, you're kind of building at like a $23 billion run rate, and it's going to only increase next year. So what's the harm in pulling it back a bit? I'm just trying to understand the interim here, just pulling back utilizations and not building so much inventory.",92

It's not, frankly, to optimize short-term fluctuations in gross margins. Those are not irrelevant, of course, but it's just the focus is supporting revenue growth in the short term, midterm and long term. And inventory supports short-term to midterm fluctuations, right, that we can mitigate. We're having plenty of inventory. And the incremental cost of inventory is really low. As we talked about, on the obsolescence side, also on the variable cost nature of what goes into inventory. So it's just sort of things that we keep in mind when -- in trying to make those decisions.",111

I just wanted to ask on gross margins. I mean, I know you don't give perfect color, but it seems like it's down at least 150 basis points sequentially. Maybe consumers are mixed.

So yes, our guidance, and as you pointed out, we only give top line and EPS. But our guidance is the best estimate that we have and our gross margins -- or I'm sorry, that guidance embeds -- the revenue is flat in that particular case, and it embeds the result in depreciation and other related costs from added capacity over time.
On a year-on-year basis, I know you asked sequentially, but just a reminder, on a year-on-year basis, keep in mind that last year, we had the Lehi acquisition fab cost in restructuring, and now it is in COR, in cost of revenue, as of December of last year is when it moved.",123

But can you maybe talk through some of the near- to medium-term milestones, when the 300-millimeter increased output could start to benefit gross margin and sort of help offset the depreciation headwinds?",58

Just -- what I would tell you is depreciation, the way we depreciate equipment is over 5 years. Buildings is much longer, usually they average about 30 years or so. But consider that, that equipment lasts a lot longer than 5 years, right? We have factories today that are running on 50 years-plus. And some of that has upgraded equipment. But broadly speaking, that equipment lasts for decades, not the 5 years where we depreciate it. So it's probably an unfair comparison to try to put the 300-millimeter benefit next to the depreciation and expect an offset in the short term.
I would suggest you think of it from a cash standpoint. We're investing. That CapEx, it's cash. Forget about the depreciation, is -- CapEx is what we invest in. That's going to enable growth by adding that internal capacity, which, as Dave alluded to earlier, that is geopolitically dependable capacity. We're putting as many as 4 fabs in Sherman, 2 in Richardson, 2 in Lehi in Utah. And then assembly test facilities in Asia, primarily Malaysia and Philippines, for example.
So that's going to put us in a really great position to grow the top line for a long time. And then what happens there is that, that yields a lot of operating cash for the company that then we can either redeploy or return to the owners of the company after those investments.",236

Perhaps you could differentiate a little bit about where you think your customers are still burning through inventory as compared to end demand. And as you noted, the PE segment started to see weakness earlier. We heard from some others that it's no longer an inventory issue, it's more of a demand issue.

Yes. Chris, I think if you look across the end markets broadly, you could say that all of them showed weakness and reflective of customers reducing inventories, with the exception of automotive.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for our fourth quarter 2023.
Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, flat sequentially and a decrease of 14% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 16%. Embedded Processing grew 8%, and our Other segment declined 32% from the year ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by market.
During the quarter, automotive growth continued and industrial weakness broadened. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on a sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-single digits, with weakness broadening across nearly all sectors. The automotive market continued to grow and was up mid-single digits. Personal Electronics was up about 20% off a low base. And next, communications equipment was down upper teens. And finally, enterprise systems grew upper single digits. Given where the market is now, it's a good time to remind everyone of our plan and areas of strategic investments.
First, our confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content per system, especially in industrial and automotive, remains high, and we're well positioned in these markets. Second, our long-term 300-millimeter manufacturing road map provides our customers with geopolitically dependable capacity. To support these build-outs and enable future growth, we continue to expect associated capital expenditures to be about $5 billion per year through 2026. In addition, we made good progress on our inventory replenishment, consistent with our long-term objectives to support growth and provide high levels of customer service.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",451

Third quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 62% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings.
As a reminder, LFAB-related charges transitioned to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit margin decreased 690 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $923 million up 7% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 20% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter or 42% of revenue and was down 29% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $6.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.6 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $50 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 5%, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. This action reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time.
In total, we have returned $5.6 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.9 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion, and days were 205, down 2 days sequentially. Inventory was up $179 million in the third quarter, less than half the increase versus the prior quarter as we near our desired inventory levels.
Therefore, we began to lower factory starts in the third quarter, which results in additional charges to the income statement. This impact is comprehended in our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.93 billion to $4.27 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.57 as we continue to operate in a weak environment.
Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2024, based on current tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about what it is in 2023. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",563

So I mean, depending on what I assume for OpEx mix, where I'm getting something like 250 basis points of compression, maybe more. I know you talked a little bit about how some of that is the impact of utilization. Can you give us some feeling for, I guess, like the magnitude of the different drivers, utilization, lower revenue, depreciation, pricing? And how we ought to be thinking about that trajectory as we get into the next year? Like is there more to go, I guess, is what I'm asking?",101

So thanks, Stacy. Let me try to help you with that. Of course, we -- for the forecast, we give a range on revenue and a range on EPS, not the pieces. But let me -- let me go through some of what I said for third quarter, which applies for fourth quarter and beyond. So for third quarter, like I said in the prepared remarks, in third quarter gross profit decreased primarily due to revenues as the first driver and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion, namely -- depreciation is the main one there and reduced factory loadings and that's the underutilization component.
Then as I also said in the prepared remarks, inventory, which is the other side of the coin, as we near desired levels of inventory, we began lowering factories starting in the third quarter. So there was an impact in third quarter due to that on the income statement, there will be a bigger impact in fourth quarter due to that. Beyond that, we're not forecasting, but of course, that will depend on revenue expectations well into next year. Do you have a follow-up?",195

Yes. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was up -- auto was up mid-single digits sequentially, and it was up 20% when you look year-on-year. So obviously, that growth had continued. In general, I would say that a market like Automotive and Personal Electronics will have larger customers, those larger customers tend to be biased to more consignment. So we would have that probably more in automotive than if I contrast it to a market perhaps like industrial.
But overall, as you know, we've moved to having closer direct relationships with customers, which would include the customers that we have in automotive. And I think we service pretty close to 1,000 or so different automotive OEMs. So there is quite a bit of broadness in who we serve there. Do you have a follow-on, Tim?",139

Yes. So what would it take to for you to think about cutting CapEx. And I asked because the plan was put into place when revenue was quite a bit higher than where it is today. Is there kind of a line in the sand for revenue where you would reconsider the plan? I know you've actually increased the plan while revenues continue to weaken. But is there some like tree around -- is there some -- if it weakens to this point, you would consider cutting CapEx? Just wondering any comments there.",96

We're very pleased with the progress on our manufacturing expansion they will provide geopolitically dependable capacity for -- to support customer growth for the coming decade. And as you know, semiconductor content continues to increase and to provide us the ability to grow at that 10% growth rate that we talked about at the last capital management call, if the market requires that, we'll continue to make those investments. So we continue to expect $5 billion of CapEx per year in '23, '24, '25 and '26. So you should count on that.
Let me also give everyone, as a reminder, these CapEx numbers are gross, meaning they do not include benefits from the ITC or grants from the CHIPS Act. So we're actively working through the grant application process with the CHIPS program office which we believe will be meaningful to our manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah and will help support semiconductor growth for decades to come.

I think many of us have been picking up evidence of the pricing environment, particularly in Asia. Intensifying over the past couple of months or a couple of quarters. You don't really give pricing as a reason for gross margins to be down sequentially and year-over-year. But what kind of role is pricing playing? Has your strategy changed at all, whether it be on the Analog side or the MCU side?",85

So thanks for that question. Always helpful to be able to clarify that. And first, I'll just start with pricing doesn't move quickly in our markets, nor is it a primary reason that customers choose our products. So we're typically agreeing to pricing that's out to 6 months or on an annual basis for the following year. And so we're continuing to move through that. Our pricing strategy, as we mentioned before, hasn't changed. So we're regularly monitoring what's going on with pricing. We always have a goal to remain competitive.
And certainly, supply and demand has come into balance, or more closer to balance. We've said for some time that we would expect that pricing to behave like it has over the last couple of decades, meaning low single-digit decline. So as we move out in time, that's what we're beginning to see. So really no changes other than going back to what we've seen over the last couple of decades. Do you have a follow-on?",168

So I guess over the past 12 months, OpEx is up about 10%. And revenue is down about 10%. So as we think about calendar '24, I was hoping you could give us a hint as to how to think about OpEx. And Dave, I think you used to give or you had given multiyear guidance on depreciation. How should we -- to the extent there are any updates, how should we think about '24 and '25 depreciation?",82
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2724.0,2925219.0,107818549.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,22,"Yes. No. Thanks for the question. I'll address both OpEx and depreciation. So on OpEx, we've held a steady hand on OpEx for many years, and we'll continue to do so. So as an example, to illustrate the point from 2017 to 2021, we ran at about $3.2 billion of OpEx. And then in '22, it ticked up to $3.4 billion. And now we're running at about $3.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. So you can see the steady hand and just a bit of an increase over the last few years. And that's, as we have held a steady hand with our hires, new college hires and as we make investments to continue to strengthen the company in the case of R&D, the broad portfolio in the case with sales and ti.com on the reach of our channels.
Then on depreciation, so our CapEx expansions are unchanged. We've talked about that, addressed it with the previous caller. So $5 billion of CapEx per year for the next '23 and 3 years beyond that, that we have been talking about. Now when it comes to depreciation, as time has passed, we have more clarity on what to expect on depreciation. So for fourth quarter, let me start fourth quarter of '23, we expect depreciation to increase on a quarterly basis at about the same rate as what we have been seeing throughout 2023. So essentially, we're going to end the year just shy of $1.2 billion, maybe [ 11-9, 11-8, 11-70 ] somewhere in that range for the year.
As an update for 2024, we expect depreciation to be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion and for 2025 to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. We'll go to the next caller, please.",294

So correct me if I'm wrong. I thought the thinking up until now has been, we got to be ready for the upturn. And so we're building inventory for that. And you have highlighted that over several quarters, look, we're not -- we don't have a target, but you did raise the target in terms of how much inventory you want to carry. So this change, which I want to make sure I'm reading it right, that you're taking an underutilization charge because you've reached a desired level of inventory. Is that a reflection that your expectation for the recovery is changing, i.e., you're expecting slower ramp in revenues than what you perhaps were thinking a couple of quarters ago?",129
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2724.0,2925219.0,107818552.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,25,"Let me start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But we have targets for where we want inventory levels to be and that goes by product and by state of finish of those products. So for example, of the 80,000 different products that we have, more than -- the vast majority of those are catalog, meaning they sell to many, many customers. They last for a long, long time. So we can have so many years of inventory at the chip level or finished goods level, in many cases, at both levels, and that's based on our internal process to set those.
So those are the -- and in aggregate, that's added up to $4 billion to $4.5 billion, and that's what we've been kind of guiding to and we've been talking about. But what really matters is what happens at the very specific level on a part-by-part number. So as we have near those levels, and you see our inventory level -- inventory levels have increased about $500 million per quarter for 2 quarters, and then this last quarter, $179 million. So clearly, there is a deceleration of that growth, and that's on purpose because as we near those levels, then we have slowed down the factory starts, that goes primarily with the fab, but also with the assembly test operations.
And then we -- that slowdown will continue into fourth quarter. So they reversed the other side of slowing your factory loading is the underutilization charges. So we -- as we near those levels, we are ready to be on the other side of this cycle for the upturn. And of course, it's not just inventory. Capacity is really the bigger driver, but you know what we've been doing on that now for a number of years and we're investing, but inventory really bridges that gap as an upturn happens until you get your factories really cranking at a higher level.",325

And I'll just add and bring back to our capital management that we've been saying for, I think, over a decade now, our objective with inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, keep our lead times stable, keep product availability really high. So as we talked about earlier, ti.com, really essentially all of our catalog products are available for immediate shipment. Lead times are stable. And so we are prepared for that next upturn what it does come. You have a follow-on, Ambrish?",86

Quick one, Dave. Just looking at the year-over-year in the fourth quarter, double-digit year-over-year decline, and I looked back many years. They have been other cycles where we've had multiple quarters of negative but not that many times, we have seen a double-digit kind of 4, 5 quarters. I just wanted your perspective on what you folks are seeing this cycle versus -- and I know no cycle is the same, but just kind of give -- just help investors think about how to think about that double-digit 4 quarters and could be potentially longer year-over-year decline?",98

Yes. And I think we all know as being students of studying the cycles over the years. They're all the same and they're all different at the same time and they're unique. The one thing that is unique, of course, with the cycle is how the markets have behaved differently. We've seen bifurcation, and really lined up very well with -- when markets recovered. So PE was the first to recover and was very strong early on. The other markets followed very shortly after that and Automotive was last. As you remember, many automotive manufacturers struggle to restart their factories and people weren't going to showrooms when were are in the midst of the pandemic.
So really, as we've seen things begin to roll over, Personal Electronics was first. It was then followed by the other markets, and yet we still have automotive that's hanging in there. So I think that's the one thing that's unique and I think as we've learned and studied the cycles, our product portfolio has changed as well over time. But the best time to be preparing for the upturn is before it shows up. So that's what we've been busy doing and we think we're in a great position to support the next upturn and to continue to gain share.",217

On depreciation, what is driving the revision? Because your CapEx doesn't seem to be changing. And then kind of part B of that is, if I take that year-on-year delta, Rafael, I think it's about $400 million, $500 million or so incremental in '24. So at the current revenue run rate, that's a 2 to 3-point headwind to gross margin. I just wanted to make sure that I got those 2 points right.",74
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2724.0,2925219.0,107818562.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,35,"Yes. So the -- for '24, I said $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, and that is down from what you probably heard before $2 billion. And for 2025, I said $2 billion to $2.5 billion, so that is down from $2.5 which we had said before. And the reason, as you pointed out, CapEx is not changing, so that's not the reason. It's just as time has said, we have more clarity on what to expect.
So for example, depreciation on tools that doesn't start until the tool. It's not only received but installed and then qualified and therefore depreciation starts. So that doesn't happen immediately. But we have learned more as to how that process works with all the number of tools that we're receiving for the various factories, then we're providing an update on depreciation.",137

So let me remind everybody what that is. First is revenue. So if you pick the revenue that you believe is going to happen for the next several years, and this works on a quarterly basis, but of course, in any quarter, there are a lot of puts and takes, but better to do it over longer horizons.
So you start with revenue, then you fall that through at 70% to 75% which, by the way, that is reflective of the great not only geopolitical dependable capacity that we're putting in place, but it is all that new fab capacity is 300 millimeters. So is the -- has a structural cost advantage. Not to mention that we're getting ITC and grant benefits as that is installed in the United States. So but -- so then you fall that through at 70% to 75% then you need to account for the added depreciation. So this year is probably going to be close to $1.2 billion. And then next year, I just give you $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. So if you want to take a point between that, then you get your added depreciation for 2024.
And then at a high level, that's it. But of course, in any given quarter, even in any given year, but especially in a given quarter, you have puts and takes. And one of them that we're seeing right now is the underutilization. But that right now is a headwind, but that can also be a tailwind when we're on the other side, and we're increasing loading and what does that -- what that does is that then it comes back the other way, right? So -- but that's more of a tactical comment that happens in some quarters. Hopefully, that answers your question.",310

I mean I think it seems like with the [ opportunities ] in inventory, you would see the cost impact of that in 6 months, but you're pulling it forward. Can you just talk about how you determine how much to pull forward?",57
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2023",2023-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2724.0,2925219.0,107818567.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,40,"Yes. Well, so it's an accounting process and it's essentially when you're below what's considered normal utilization that percent that you're below that -- and that is generally determined by wafer and the [ fabri ] wafer starts and out in the assembly test operation as your -- the number of units that you're producing and you -- you divide that by the capacity that you can get, the maximum capacity. You establish a normal, which is where you normally expect to be. That could be 85%, 90%, 95%, depending the situation. And whenever you're below that, then you take that percent that you're below and then you take those fixed costs and go straight to the P&L instead of going into inventory.
So some of those costs that will come in fixed costs, some of them are depreciation, but it's not only depreciation. You have electricity, for example, is largely fixed. You used about the similar electricity whether a tool is running production or not as long as it's plugged in. So you take that into account. And then at the end of the day, you're not creating money when you do that, you just essentially put it on the balance sheet or the P&L. And in this case, it's going directly into the P&L as a linked quarter charge because that portion of the capacity is not producing.
Now one more comment, that gives us tremendous operating leverage on the other side of that, right? Because think about fixed costs on the way down, they heard of it. But on the way up, they're fixed, right? So from a cash standpoint, on the way up, you don't spend any more and then you get just tremendous cash fall-throughs on the revenue, particularly when it's 300-millimeter capacity at very low cost. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?",308

So we can find great opportunities in Comms Equipment. We continue to invest, we just don't think it has the secular growth that other markets like industrial, automotive fab. So we continue to make investments there. And as we've talked about that market over the years, it's one that just tends to be choppy. We believe that they're continuing to adjust their inventory levels as we work our way through this quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it's down 50%. So that's a pretty significant drop. So yes, so again, long term, we think it's a great market and we're positioned well there, but it will have these types of moves overall.",125

So as I mentioned, I think as part of another question on revenue order linearity, there was nothing unusual inside of that. Secondly, we obviously, we're describing the environment as being weak. And we don't have a system that tells us, are we shipping above or below demand. The strongest signal that we get is orders from customers. Now as we talked about earlier, comms, or a market like Personal Electronics was the first market to go into the downturn. We've had a couple of quarters of growth inside of that market. Now it's off of a very weak base. But we are seeing that as a trend. If you compare that to the industrial market, we had seen that, let's say, let's call it, about half of the sectors begin to weaken a couple of quarters ago, it was really this quarter that we saw that, that weakness is broadening.
So customers, we believe, inside of markets like that inside of markets like comms equipment that we said they're adjusting their inventories as such. So again, that provides us the opportunity both strategically with building the capacity and more tactically, building, putting in place the inventory to be able to support the next upturn because it will certainly come.

The ITC is -- the expectation is similar, which is about a 20% to 25% credit on everything that is spent on CapEx in the U.S. for fabs. So what we said back in February is that that's going to be roughly $4 billion of the $20 billion or so that for CapEx, the $5 billion [ turns ] more. So roughly about $4 billion of that we're going to get back on ITC about 1-year offset.
Of that, we have already accrued $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. So you'll see that on our balance sheet on the long-term assets. A portion of that, we will get some time next year, probably by fourth quarter next year is when we expect to get that cash, so that's when the cash will start flowing in. As I mentioned in an earlier call, on an earlier question, we are actively applying for the grain.
So that's going to be in addition to the ITC. We're not counting on that. We don't have any numbers on that because you have to apply, you have to wait until the Department of Commerce makes that decision. But we are we're planning on receiving then the funding from the CHIPS Act grant was comprehended in our decision, and we firmly believe we are very well positioned to receive those funds, and we're a great candidate for that, and we believe there will be meaningful to manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah to support semiconductor growth and the objectives of the CHIPS program office.",262

This geography has experienced the most significant decline. I think it was down like 33%, 35% year-over-year in the first half of this year. Much of your China business is focused on industrial. Is this geography continuing to contribute to the weakness here in Q4? And what other geographies are you seeing that is contributing to this broadening out of sort of the weak industrial trends?",80

So let me -- I'll speak to what we saw in the third quarter. And just in general, including industrial and China continue to remain weak. So I think if we're having this call a year ago or so, as China came out of COVID I think most of us would have expected there to be a more significant rebound, which just hasn't materialized.
So yes, I think when you look at on a regional basis compared with the year ago, the only region that was up was Japan. So the other regions were down. And so again, just described that weakness as being very broad in nature. Do you have a follow-on, Harlan?",115

So your embedded business continues to hold up relatively well, right? Trailing 12 months, it's up 8% year-over-year. You've talked about the positive strategy changes and embedded. Last quarter, you also cited some constraints. I assume that those constraints have fully normalized. So do you anticipate embedded continuing to hold up? Or do you anticipate this segment starting to weaken from here with some of the capacity constraints potentially easing?",71

As we talked about before, we had focused on changing the product strategy that we had inside of embedded. I'd say we're very pleased with the results that we have so far. Our first objective was to stabilize that business. And we continue to invest in it because we believe it has long-term growth potential and contribution to free cash flow. So we're very pleased with where we're going. I think more tactically, as we talked about last quarter, we saw that business does rely more heavily on foundry suppliers. We began to see those -- that capacity begin to free up for us.
And I think that it was different because we had capacity in place to service analog, our own capacity there overall. So Yes. So again, we think that business long term is going to be a great driver for us in the future. So thank you. And I think we've got time for one more caller.",161

I know it's very seasonal from calculators, but there was a big drop year-over-year.",40

So besides calculators, we have our DLP or Digital Light Processor products that are in there. So those products are continuing to make their way through inventory correction overall. And calculators had a weaker back-to-school this season. Do you have a follow-on?",43

I'm guessing that, that's mostly resolved and lead times are like sort of stock to 4 weeks for most things at this point. But if you could level set me on that, the degree to which there are still extended lead times, that would be really helpful.",106

Yes. So and I may have mentioned this earlier, but almost all of our catalog products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. And so as we approach our desired level of inventory, we've got a product that is positioned both in finished goods as well as in wafer form to be able to restock that. Of course, lead times, therefore, are what I described normal levels and continue to be consistent. And there's probably no time that we don't -- with so many different products and so many different customers. We'll have hotspots, but they are very few and far between and our ability to close those is very -- we've got flexible manufacturing as most of our production is fungible.
So with that, I'll ask Rafael to wrap up the call for us.",136

Let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is a long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our 3 ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades, we will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit.
Thank you, and have a good evening.",130
