140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3532.0,569781.0,25910697.0,Presenter Speech,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,1,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. 
The fourth quarter was a good one and wrapped up a good year. We're entering the first quarter of 2014 feeling better than we did entering the first quarter of 2013. Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that is important to your calendars. 
Starting this quarter, we will not be providing a mid-quarter update to our outlook. Our business is now sufficiently diverse across markets and customers that we believe a mid-quarter update is no longer necessary. The diversity in our business means that TI's results should mostly reflect broader industry trends as opposed to TI-specific considerations, such as adjustments in demand from a large customer. In fact, in our last 8 updates, we've narrowed to the middle of the range 6x on a revenue basis. 
We do plan to hold a call on March 13 to update you on our capital management strategy. This will be a follow-on to the call we did a year ago on this topic. In this call, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequent questions that we are asked about the strategy. More details will be forthcoming. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter within the upper half of our range of expectations. Once again, cash generation and returns remained strong. Free cash flow is $3 billion or 24% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period or, in this case, the full year of 2013. Over that same period, we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. This return was 136% of free cash flow for the year. Again, our strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to our shareholders, except what is needed to repay debt. 
EPS was at the midpoint of our range. However, it also included $0.03 of charges for a restructuring action that was not previously included in our guidance; so overall, a good quarter. The restructuring that is under way is the result of our ongoing assessment of our investments and the market opportunities that we are addressing with those investments. First, we are reducing costs in certain Embedded Processing product lines that either have matured or do not offer the return opportunities we are looking for. These changes will accelerate the profit margin improvement in the Embedded business while still maintaining its pace of growth. I'll note that we are not exiting any markets or discontinuing any existing products but are aligning resources consistent with our updated use of the market opportunities. 
We are also lowering cost in Japan by reducing resources in that country to levels that are appropriate to the opportunity. Combined, these actions are expected to result in annualized savings of about $130 million by the end of 2014. As a result of these actions, we will eliminate about 1,100 jobs. Total charges are estimated to be about $80 million with $49 million included in the fourth quarter results and the remaining charges of about $30 million to be included in the first quarter. These charges are recognized in the Other segment. 
In the fourth quarter results, TI revenue grew 2% from a year ago. Excluding legacy wireless, revenue grew 10% with double-digit growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. Sequentially, revenue declined 7% with half of the decline due to seasonally lower calculator revenue. 
Analog revenue grew 12% from a year ago and declined 3% sequentially. From a year ago, all 4 major product lines were up, with Power Management leading the growth. Sequentially, all major product lines were down with High Performance Analog declining the most. Embedded Processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago and declined 10% sequentially. From a year ago, the growth was due to strength in Microcontrollers. Connectivity revenue grew a single-digit percentage rate and Processors were about even. Sequentially, all areas were down with the biggest decline in Processors. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined $209 million or 27% from a year ago. The decline was due to legacy wireless dropping $216 million. Sequentially, Other revenue was down $90 million due to the seasonal decline in calculators. Legacy wireless revenue was $54 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to be essentially gone in the first quarter. 
Turning to distribution. Resales declined 3% sequentially, trending about the same as our semiconductor product revenue. Distributors' inventory levels were about even with the prior quarter. Let me make a couple of observations about the year overall. 
For 2013, Analog and Embedded Processing revenue grew a combined 4%, with Analog up 3% and Embedded up 9%. These 2 key areas were 79% of TI revenue for the year, up from 72% in 2012. Operating margin for Analog was 25.8% and it exceeded 30% during the second half. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 7.6%, a level that should increase as we continue to grow and as we execute our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. 
Finally, we are refining the descriptions of our end market mix to more closely match our perspective of our markets and investments. Traditionally, we and many other companies have described the markets as communications, computing, industrial, consumer, automotive and education. The real world didn't always align so cleanly and some of the categorizations became blurred. For example, consumer smartphones were included with infrastructure equipment and the communications market, and consumer tablets were included with servers in the computing market. In both of these examples, high-volume consumer products were grouped together with enterprise equipment that have very different life cycles and market characteristics. We believe our revised segmentation is more descriptive and reflective of the markets we fell into and therefore, more helpful for our understanding of our business. 
Starting now, we will provide an annual snapshot of our product mix along the following market descriptions: industrial, which was 24% of revenue in 2013; automotive, which was 13% of revenue; personal electronics, which was 37% of revenue and includes subsets, which we call sectors, such as notebooks, tablets, mobile phones and consumer products; communications equipment, which was 16% of revenue; enterprise systems, which include sectors such as servers and projectors, was 6% of revenue; and calculators, which was 4% of revenue. We have mapped our product revenue into these markets, as well as the sectors and even end-equipment levels below that. We find this especially beneficial for the industrial market, where the market definition has historically not been very clear and where we have a strong strategic focus. We now have a reasonably precise profile of where our revenue is shipping that is more accurate than we've had in the past. We've included on our website this 2013 product revenue breakout by market, along with the 2011 and 2012 historical breakouts. We've also identified the sectors below the markets to provide you a clear understanding of how we're mapping the revenue. We will not be disclosing our revenue breakout below the market level. We plan to update this for you annually. 
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.",1306
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3532.0,569781.0,25910698.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.64 billion or 54.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 8% sequentially, about the same as the 7% decline in revenue. Gross margin held up very well, slipping only 60 basis points from last quarter's record high. From a year ago, gross profit was up 13%, well above the 2% increase in revenue. The result was a 570-basis-point expansion in gross margin. There are a couple of major reasons for gross profit expanding significantly faster than revenue. First, the quality of our portfolio has improved, as a higher proportion of our revenue is from Analog and Embedded Processing products. Second, our factory utilization has improved, as we have increased loadings in our most advanced factories, and we have shut down older, less efficient manufacturing assets, such as our Houston and Hiji 6-inch factories. 
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $807 million was down $26 million sequentially and down $48 million from a year ago. The sequential decline is mostly due to seasonality, as employees typically take more vacation and holiday time in the fourth quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the wind-down of our legacy wireless products. 
Acquisition charges were $84 million, almost all of which is on the -- is the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense. Restructuring and other charges were $62 million. This included a $49 million charge for the restructuring action that Ron discussed. This was not included in our prior guidance and negatively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share. 
Operating profit was $687 million or 22.7% of revenue. Our tax rate in the quarter was 25%, a point above the 24% that we had guided. The effective tax rate remains 24%, but we had several small discrete items that pulled the rate up in the quarter. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $511 million or $0.46 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.20 billion in the quarter. We increased our inventory by $5 million, compared with the prior quarter. Inventories days increased by 6 days to 112 days, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $107 million in the quarter. I should note this includes our purchase of a 358,000-square-foot assembly and test facility in Chengdu, China that is adjacent to our existing wafer fab. We expect to have this facility equipped and in production by the fourth quarter of this year. 
On a trailing 12-months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.38 billion. Trailing 12-months' capital expenditures were $412 million or 3% of revenue. As a result, free cash flow was $2.97 billion or 24% of revenue. This is within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue. 
I'll note that depreciation expense for the full year was $879 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $467 million or 3.8% of revenue. Over the next few years, as we continue to hold capital spending to low levels, depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross net margin will directly benefit. And as we've said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. 
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $326 million in dividends and repurchased $734 million of our stock for a total return of $1.06 billion. Our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what we need to repay debt. In the full year 2013, free cash flow was $2.97 billion, and we reduced our debt level by $500 million. We returned a total of $4.04 billion to shareholders or 136% of free cash flow. This return was 54% higher than in 2012. We returned more than our full free cash flow in the year because proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, totaling $1.31 billion in the year, have also been an additional source of cash for the company, all of which was used to repurchase stock. There was an abnormally high level of exercises in the year due to the stock price performance. Although the exercises were somewhat of a headwind for the share count reduction, we more than offset this with stock repurchases. In the end, we reduced our shares outstanding by 25 million shares or 2.3% in 2013, similar to the last couple of years. In total, we have reduced our share count by 37% since the beginning of 2005 with our repurchases. 
Fundamental to our cash return strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.83 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders declined to 10% sequentially and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.94. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 3% sequentially with most of the decline coming from the final step-down on legacy wireless revenue, which is now essentially gone and should not be a factor in sequential trends after the first quarter. Therefore, if you exclude the legacy wireless revenue from the fourth quarter of 2013, revenue at the middle of this range will be almost even sequentially. If you exclude it from the first quarter of 2013, growth would be 10%. 
We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.44, which includes a $0.02 EPS impact from the $30 million of restructuring charges discussed earlier. We expect our effective tax rate in 2014 to increase to 27%, and this is the rate you should use in your models for the first quarter. This is about 3 percentage points higher than our 2013 effective tax rate, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.02 in the first quarter. This rate is higher due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2013 and our forecast for higher profits in the year. Historically, the R&D tax credit has expired and was later reinstated retroactively to its expiration date. 
In summary, we're encouraged that a lot of hard work at TI over the past few years is producing results. Today, we're a company firmly rooted in Analog and Embedded Processing, areas that have strong potential for growth and good profits that require low capital investments and, therefore, can generate a lot of cash. Although much of the heavy lifting associated with the structural improvement of TI is now behind us, our work is not done. The restructuring action we discussed today is a result of an ongoing process at TI of review and continuous improvement. This process helps ensure that we focus our investments on opportunities that have the best potential for sustainable growth and returns. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ron.",1193

But clearly, the Embedded Processing, overall, runs -- I think last year was just about 20% of our revenue. The processor piece of that, I think, we've probably communicated, I can update it even for 2013, was 50% of our revenue last year. And again, that's where I would say most of the actions in Embedded Processing are taking place. And again, it's primarily in Processors. I would say secondarily, we're taking some action inside of microcontrollers as well. But Processors was about half the revenue and, of course, not all of Processors is being affected but certain product lines within that. And then separately, the action in Japan; last year, Japan was about 9% of our total revenue. And again, this is just more or less an action, too. On the one hand, we'll be consolidating some of the business activity that was previously in Japan just to other regions of the world where we can do it more efficiently but then also we'll be affecting some of the sales and marketing activities in Japan, kind of to align those resources with that opportunity that we see in Japan going forward. So do you have a follow-on, John?",213

Just relative to the new segmentation with personal electronics being 37%, I'm just kind of curious, should that be an area where we see future realignment?

That's sort of the handset and tablet spaces coming down. We will continue to be engaged in personal electronics. Make no mistake about it. The biggest difference is that we'll be driving a lot more aggressively with our catalog products as opposed to custom products, and on the historical basis that catalog products tend to have a much longer life to them and a much better margin profile to them than custom products do. So there won't be any overt change to our approach to personal electronics. It will just wind down on some of them because of the wind-down of the legacy wireless, as the biggest driver of that.",152

And we pretty much wound up the, if you will, the synergistic opportunities of that consolidation about a year ago now. So there's not really much in the way of synergy as it relates to acquisitions going forward. What we're doing on this restructuring is just part of an ongoing exercise that we've actually done for a long time. They're usually of a smaller level and, in this case, a little bit larger. But that's really looking at where we're spending our research dollars and looking at the market opportunity that those products from that research spend would go into. In this case, we've got some of the markets have matured or about to mature, which means we don't need to have as many teams designing new parts for it. Or in other cases, we may have invested in certain markets where we had anticipated better growth and return opportunities. But those initial expectations have since been changed for a variety of reasons. So there's really no acquisition synergies that I can think of to suggest to you. This is just really an ongoing process of dealing with the reality of market changes over time.",210

I can say that at TI, we have not reset our expectations downward as you might be suggesting there from a growth standpoint. I think over the last few years, global GDP has been certainly below a normalized run rate and that certainly has affected our industry as well. But our view is that the markets that we serve, being Analog and Embedded Processing, will likely grow on a unit basis and frankly, from a revenue basis, about 2x global GDP. We've believed that for some time and again, we're looking at longer-term trends, not what happened over the last 3 years or even 5 years. And again, our view on that is unchanged.",120

I can do part of that, which is the historical view. I don't think we want to try to extrapolate into a forecast for 2014. But let me just -- and let me just start with the fourth quarter of '13. And again, this information really is coming out of the database that I described we've put together for our new market framing. But again, fourth quarter, most end markets were down sequentially. The biggest driver of our revenue decline, though, was the seasonal decline in calculators. And I think as we said before, that was half of the sequential dollar decline in the fourth quarter. Outside of that, personal electronics declined the most, followed by enterprise systems and industrial; and all 3 of those areas declined at single-digit percentage rates. Automotive and communications equipment were each about even sequentially. Just a little more color on some of those areas. Industrial, we saw strength in appliances and industrial displays, but that strength was offset -- more than offset actually by broad-based declines elsewhere. In enterprise systems, really, we saw weakness or declines there due to servers. And in personal electronics, we saw declines in TVs, gaming and printers. And we saw strength sequentially in tablets. Moving to the full year 2013. Industrial for TI, this is based for our revenue, was up 7%. That was driven by factory automation, building automation, appliances, medical and motor drive. Automotive was up 14% for TI in the year, driven by infotainment systems, as well as advanced driver-assist systems and safety. Personal electronics revenue was down 18% due to mobile phones and tablets, as we wound down our legacy Wireless business, followed by much smaller declines in other areas of personal electronics. Communications infrastructure for the year was up 4%, driven by both wireless infrastructure and enterprise switching. Enterprise systems for the year was down 8%, driven by servers and projectors. And then calculators declined 3% for the year.",326

Based off of the strong 14% growth that you just mentioned for last year, just wondering if you have any color from downstream customers on the inventory levels and supply chain?

Steve, I don't -- I probably don't have anything more that we would have from a -- that would be a unique perspective that TI provides. When you have somebody talk, like AutoNation talking about inventory of automobiles, you have that data. We don't have any unique perspective. That's several layers below where we're selling into that supply chain. I'll speak more broadly that we believe inventory seems to be pretty well managed currently, if not lean. You heard my comments on distribution. Distribution inventories remain below 5.5 weeks, which, again, are lean. But anything in terms of a particular supply chain like automotive, we really don't have that granularity. But again, our general sense is inventory is not at all an issue more broadly into the markets that we're serving. Do you have a follow-on, Stephen?",139

And specifically, if you look at our balance sheet, you'll notice that during the fourth quarter we drained our work in process, and our finished goods increased somewhat. That's just reloading the factories to meet the lowered outlook that we had in the first -- in the fourth quarter. We do expect the first quarter to begin to reload the factories as we go forward. Inside that 112 days is the strategic inventory that you were talking about, which is parts that have long shelf lives. And we've been building that up for a couple years now, and we'll continue to manage that at about its current levels.",139

The first thing to remember about OpEx is it will seasonally go up in the first quarter. If you look over the last 3 or 4 years and just compute an average, you can see that, on average, you probably got about 4%, fourth quarter to first quarter. And you can expect an increase again in this first quarter as we start out 2014. As we flow through the year, the cost savings that we talked about as a result of the restructuring actions will begin to show up in the second half of the year. And by the time we leave the year, we'll have -- we'll be at about $130 million annualized savings right at that breakout that I mentioned earlier across R&D, SG&A and cost revenue.",140

So if I look at Analog share, you've been talking about SVA gaining share this year. And if you just take seasonal December for the SIA, it looks like your share in Analog basically was flat in '13 versus '12. So is there something that maybe -- might start to kick in, in 2014 that is going to cause Analog to gain share year-over-year?",67
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3532.0,569781.0,25910734.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,38,"Well, we'll see how our 2014 rolls out. I guess, for starters, based on the WSTS data that's been released through November, we believe we actually gained a small amount of share in Analog. And by the way, I should note, if we just look over last few years, I guess I have data since 2009 in front of me, on average we've gained Analog share at probably 30 to 40 basis points on average per year. We've gained in every one of those years, and the range has been for pretty broad. I mean, there are some years where we may be, I'll say, 10 basis points of gain; and other years during that time period, where we've gained over 100 basis points. So I would say it's not necessarily a smooth curve in terms of market share gains but, at least, it's consistent from the standpoint of -- we believe we've gained share every year. And it's our expectation and our intention to continue doing that, including 2014. And by the way, everything I think I just said there, I could also apply to Embedded Processing. Although I would also say that Embedded Processing probably in 2013, our shares stepped up a little more strongly in Embedded Processing than it did in Analog last year. But again, market share is important to us. Everything I've also described about our market share gains was on an organic basis so it's not comprehending acquisitions and the impact of national or anything like that. But again, we -- we've been gaining share consistently and we expect to continue that. And I guess that's your -- that was your follow-on, Tim.",279

That is, when we take a look at potential acquisitions, we look real hard at the numbers and we've got to be able to make sense of the numbers. And mainly, we've got to be able to get a return on that investment that exceeds our weighted-average cost of capital in a reasonable time frame, which we define as 3 to 4 years.

I'll make some comments, then Kevin probably has some things as to how he's feeling as well. But I'd say first of all, the strength and position of where we are today in Analog and Embedded is a big factor. Having those 2 product lines now making up 82% of our revenue going out of the year in the fourth quarter, frankly, is a great feeling and positions us -- you know as well as any, Ambrish, how long the wind-down of that wireless revenue was, having that wind-down behind us, such that the top line growth for the company can reflect a lot of the good things that we're doing. A lot of the potential that Analog and Embedded have embedded in them is just great. I think also, more specifically, the overall environment in terms of the markets that we're selling those products into and, frankly, just areas of strategic focus such as we've said, industrial is really important to us. Automotive is really important to us. The strength of those markets and, frankly, our position in those markets -- not that our position is so strong that it's saturated. We like the fact that we have lots of headroom for growth and market share gains, but we also like the design position we have there. And then maybe just a little more tactically, coming out of fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was stronger exiting the year than it was a year ago and we also have good backlog coverage coming into first quarter as well. So those are the kinds of things that I know we look at. Kevin, do you have anything else you would add?",287

Ambrish, I'd probably just say on a macro level, looking at the total economy, the U.S. economy clearly seems to be stepping up its growth. Europe appears to have stopped declining and it appears that China has stabilized. And those are 3 big economic regions of the world. So you got to feel better about that at this stage, starting 2014, than we did 12 months ago starting in 2013, with the uncertainty we're all staring at in those 3 economies. And then, again, a bit more tactically to what Ron was talking about, if you look back a year ago, the sum of Analog and Embedded Processing was 74% of TI. Today, it's 82%. A year ago, Analog and Embedded Processing were down quarter-over-quarter, 9% on revenue in the fourth quarter and flat year-over-year. If you fast-forward to this year and not only is Analog and Embedded Processing bigger in percent and -- but it's also bigger in dollar terms, it was only down 5% quarter-over-quarter and it's up 12% year-over-year. So we've got real momentum going as we move into 2014. So you take the macro look, you take a TI-specific as the portfolio is finished in its restructuring and you got to feel pretty good about how we're going to start 2014 and what the year may hold for us.",224

Tore, I do wish I had a crystal ball to help out with that particular question. But like you, I'm lacking in that right now. I would say that we would expect that the exercises are going to be lower next year than they were this past year, but I would also just put aside any concern about that. Because frankly, we just used the cash proceeds from those exercises to buy back shares. So it doesn't really impact what we've been able to do to share count for our stockholders. I believe, in early March, we're going to have a -- as Ron mentioned, we're going to have a capital management strategy update and that will be a really good time to ask some of these questions.

I'd say, going forward, you're not going to be getting that from us anymore, Tore. The CapEx guidance that we'll give you is simply -- is a band that we talk about around our revenue, meaning that our target is 4% to 7% of revenue on any 1 year. And we expect that, given the size of our manufacturing footprint today, we don't expect to be pushing above the lower end of that range, in other words, probably more around the 4% of that range of revenue, until we hit about $18 billion of revenue. So from a CapEx guidance, that's how I'd suggest you'll hear the modeling from us going forward, not a specific number. And on R&D, frankly, we're reaching a point now where it's pretty stable and it should probably just kind of grow with pay and benefit increases over time and with the top line revenue growth over time. So based upon that, we're not going to be providing R&D guidance going forward. You'll be able to just take a look at our results, and it'll be pretty straightforward for you to model that going forward.",191

But again, given that depreciation is so gapped these days from CapEx, and frankly, it's a multiyear lagging indicator versus our CapEx trend. So it just doesn't seem to us to be a especially useful number and -- from a guidance standpoint.

Vivek, I would say that, first of all, we don't believe anything that we are doing here is going to impact our ability to benefit from LTE deployments. And again, a lot of those -- and that does not mean that the base station area is not an area where we're seeing some resource reductions. It is. But just, in general, LTE, we are already very well positioned across those various customers. Our system-on-a-chip products have been out in the market for some time. And so we just have a great position as LTE continues to deploy. As to the comment, let me just talk maybe more broadly, and I'll start at the Embedded Processing level and then drill down into some of your comms infrastructure question. But let me say, again, just -- you heard us give the numbers but Embedded Processing has really delivered strong growth this year. That came out of areas like catalog microcontrollers, specifically product lines like the MSP430, the C2000. It came out of areas like connectivity, processors for automotive markets, processors for industrial markets. So those areas that have been driving and producing growth, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we have in the past. The reductions that we're making are, as I said before, primarily processors and then secondarily, in some of the product areas in MCU. So within processors, I would identify areas like IPCameras and certain areas of communications infrastructure where, frankly, the future growth just doesn't merit our current levels of investment. Now to specifically, kind of your question about LTE and base stations more broadly. I guess I don't want to go into a lot of specifics there except to say, again, comms infrastructure is an area that will receive fewer resources, and it's based on our view that parts of the macro base station market are maturing. On the flip side, small cell is an emerging opportunity for us and we'll continue to invest accordingly there. But even in the maturing areas of the base station, as I started off here, we believe our revenue will continue for a very long time, given the breadth of our position and the long life of the equipment that we're already engaged with there. So hopefully, that provides you some color as to what we're doing in comms infrastructure. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?",398

Actually, I have thought about asking about the PC market. But instead, what I'll ask you is, in the market it's always about what have you done for me lately. And last year, the TI story was about the benefits you got from exiting wireless, the really strong capital returns. And now, I think for this year, what they're hitting is sort of the same. So what is really the next catalyst that can help you either outgrow the market or provide much superior returns than what we are seeing from the peer groups already? What is the value proposition for outside investor overrating TI this year?",109

You've seen some pretty strong growth rates that we just talked about in areas we've been focusing our attention on for a number of years now, Analog and Embedded Processing. We talked about the fact that we're returning 100% of our free cash flow and that's what we use for debt. But we also have plenty of room to grow with very little need to spend that much more to grow, and I'm talking specifically about our manufacturing footprint. If you take a look at the very cost-effective factories that we put into play over the last couple of years and the low level of CapEx it takes for us now to keep those factories going, the incremental margin and cash flow opportunity from those factories is extremely attractive. In addition to that, we've just got the overall growing space in industrial and automotive, which tend to be not only quite long-lived revenue profiles, but also quite attractive margin profiles. And again, those products run across those inexpensive factories and just help generate ample amounts of cash. So I think from an investor standpoint, there are quite a few things to continue to look forward to, which is really our ability to continue to grow at the kind of rates that we're doing now inside Analog and Embedded Processing, and leveraging the very inexpensive factories we put in place to generate a lot of cash.",255

I think a lot of our long-term-oriented investors clearly look through the wireless transition, frankly even over last few years, into what TI was becoming. And that was the value proposition for them, a company focused on very diverse markets of Analog and Embedded Processing, that didn't require a lot of capital, that generated a lot of cash. And then as you pointed out, they liked management's commitment to return that cash to them. I would kind of take a different view from what you described with some of the other investors. Because investors -- a lot of investors I've talked to last year, the year before, the year before, the response was, ""Give me a -- we like what you're doing in wireless. Give me a call when you're out of it and that no longer represents a headwind for your growth."" So for investors that have been sitting on the sideline because of the concern that wireless represented such a significant headwind to growth, I think the value proposition for them is clear. It's no longer there, and the growth that we've been producing in Analog and Embedded is no longer going to be an obstacle for top line growth. And for a lot of those investors that, frankly, our growth hasn't streamed very well in the past. That's not going to be an issue going forward. So just my two cents' worth on that topic.",247

I would just say, first of all, in terms of growth rate target, absolutely no change. And again, I think Embedded did a good job on growth last year. Frankly, we would've liked to have seen that growth come through at a higher level of profitability overall for the business, but growth has not been an issue. And to the extent that we've tried to describe for you our investments in the areas that are growing in Embedded will continue unabated. So our expectations for growth Embedded -- for growth in Embedded are absolutely unchanged, and I think you'll continue to see good results there. In terms of profitability and margin objectives, I guess what I would say, Ross, is I know we've provided some numbers in the past. But in fact, I'll say what we've said in the past because you've -- I'm sure you are -- you have them in your notes there. I think in a September 2012 Investor Meeting, our manager there described that his Embedded -- his gross margin targets were 55% to 60%, operating margin target was about 30%. What I would say is, in general, a well-run company focused on the Embedded Processing market opportunity, we think has potential for a financial profile consistent with those types of numbers. That being said, I don't think -- what we're going to do with this segment is very similar to what we've done for Analog and not the communicating specific gross margin and operating margin targets and progress going forward. But again, clearly, our objectives are much higher than where that business ran last year and ran fourth quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?",281

Ross, you're right. I won't give you specific guidance but I'll give you some high-level things to think about. Clearly, as we came through the fourth quarter, we were taking our factory starts down through the quarter. As we go into the first quarter, we're taking our factory starts up. That's on the expectation of a normally stronger second quarter for us. The result of that is going to be that while starts will be higher in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter, the average utilization won't really change that much. And so just based upon that and the timing of moving the wafers through the factories and through the assembly test sites, we will probably see a little bit of gross margin headwind as we bring those factories back up but not a large amount.",141

As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
The first quarter was a good start to the year for TI. Our positions in Analog and Embedded Processing contributed strongly with combined revenue for these products up 13% from a year ago. As important markets, such as industrial and automotive, continue to embrace electronics technology, Analog and Embedded Processing products are critical, and TI should benefit accordingly. 
Revenue of $2.98 billion was in the upper half of our expected range that we communicated in January. Earnings per share of $0.44 was at the top of our expected range. EPS included $0.02 that was not in our prior guidance from sales of a site and other assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions. 
Free cash flow was $3.1 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period, right in line with the 20% to 30% range where we expect to operate over time. For those of you who missed our capital management call in March, we raised our expected range for free cash flow margin from 20% to 25% to 20% to 30% in that call. 
Also over the past 12 months, we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In the March call, Kevin explained that our updated model for cash returns to shareholders was to return all of our free cash flow, less the net debt amount that is retired, plus proceeds that we received from exercises of equity compensation. Inclusion of the exercise proceeds was a new addition to the model from what we had previously communicated. Against this targeted return level, we returned 99% over the past 12 months. 
In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 3% from a year ago. Excluding legacy wireless, revenue grew 11%, with double-digit growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. 
Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago with all 4 major product lines up. Power Management and High Performance Analog led this growth and were each up about the same amount. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% from a year ago with Microcontrollers leading the way. Our increased investments in this growth area over the past few years are yielding favorable results. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined $186 million or 28% from a year ago due to legacy wireless, which has now declined to the single-digit millions of dollars. 
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 10% from year ago, while distributors' inventory remains about the same and is just under 5.5 weeks. From an end market perspective, the most growth from a year ago came from communications equipment, followed by industrial and automotive. Enterprise systems was about even, while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that previously used legacy wireless products from TI. 
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",590

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.61 billion or 53.9% of revenue. Gross profit increased 17% from the year-ago quarter. This was a solid increase in profitability considering the 3% growth in total revenue. The 630 basis point expansion in gross margin as a percent of revenue reflects an improved product portfolio, higher utilization of our manufacturing assets and the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. 
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $845 million was down $33 million from a year ago. The decline reflects restructuring associated with the wind down of our legacy Wireless products. As a reminder, we will begin to see the benefit of the previously announced restructuring in Embedded Processing and Japan in the second half of this year. 
While we are discontinuing R&D spending in the areas that are no longer able to provide differentiated growth, we continue to invest aggressively in those areas that are providing growth, such as Analog where we've increased our R&D investments by 77% since 2006, resulting in steady increases in market share or, as Ron mentioned, more recently with our stepped-up investments in Embedded Processing, which is now resulting in multiple quarters of year-over-year revenue growth. 
Moving on, acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which is the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense.
Restructuring and other charges included a charge of $32 million for the previously announced restructuring, about as we expected. There was also a gain of $37 million for sales of a site and other assets associated with earlier restructuring actions. As Ron mentioned, this gain contributed $0.02 to EPS in the quarter and was not included in our prior guidance. 
Operating profit was $690 million or 23.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 75% from the year ago. Again, this was a solid increase considering total revenue was up 3% over this period. 
Net income in the first quarter was $487 million or $0.44 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $462 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 112, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $77 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.49 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $405 million or 3% of revenue. Capital spending for the year-ago trailing 12-month period was $476 million or 4% of revenue.
Consequently, free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.08 billion or 25% of revenue, in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. This is 8% higher than the free cash flow was a year ago when it was 23% of revenue. 
Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $864 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $459 million or 3.7% of revenue. Our strategy to opportunistically time our purchases of manufacturing equipment has provided us a manufacturing capability today that has sufficient headroom to support growth for years ahead. Our current level of capital expenditures provide us with important new manufacturing technologies, while also continuing to expand our capacity. 
Over the next few years, as a result of this strategy, we expect to continue to hold capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. Therefore, depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margin will directly benefit. 
As we have said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the first quarter, TI paid $325 million in dividends and repurchased $720 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion.
Historically, we have described our capital management strategy was to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders, except for what we need to repay debt. In March, we updated this model to also include the return of proceeds that we receive from the exercise of equity compensation. In the past 12 months, free cash flow was $3.08 billion, our debt level was essentially unchanged and we received $1.14 billion of proceeds from exercises. So our targeted return model would be about $4.22 billion. We actually returned $4.18 billion to shareholders or 99% of the model, so our recent practice has been well aligned with the updated model. 
This percentage will likely move up in the second quarter as we retire debt that is due in May. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was 38% higher than a year ago. Dividends were up 48% as stock repurchases were up 34%. 
Fundamental to our cash strategy and our cash management are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $4.03 billion of cash and short-term investments with 84% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. 
As a reminder, we issued $500 million of debt in the first quarter at an average coupon rate of 1.8% for 3 and 7-year terms, and we plan to retire $1 billion when it comes due in May.
TI's orders in the quarter were at $3.07 billion, up 4% from a year ago, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.14 billion to $3.40 billion in the second quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. If you exclude the $148 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year-ago quarter, revenue would increase 13%.
We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.63. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil and acquisition charges will remain about even, which is the noncash amortization charge that will be at this level for the next 5 years.
We have revised our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 to 28%, up a point from our prior estimate, reflecting our higher expectations for profitability in the year. This is the tax rate that you should use for the second quarter.
In summary, I think the first quarter provided a glimpse into the potential financial performance that TI should be capable of going forward. Our Analog and Embedded Processing product lines will benefit as the industrial and automotive markets continue to increasingly embrace technology. These are markets where we are investing and that offer the promise of sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The low capital requirements for Analog and Embedded Processing, combined with our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets, also means that we can deliver strong free cash flows, which should allow us to continue to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",1171

I'm just kind of curious, as we think about gross margin and OpEx, how does the OpEx saving kind of linearly fold into the model between now and December?

As you look into next quarter, in particular, recall that in the -- just to step back for a moment, on an annual basis, we typically have our paying benefit increases occur in the first quarter. And typically, 2 of the 3 months for the first quarter will incur that increase. So clearly, as we go into second quarter we'll have a full 3 months of that increase. But to the point that you were bringing up on some of the savings that we'll see from the restructuring and Embedded Processing actions, we'll see a little bit of that savings begin to materialize in second quarter. So OpEx will probably be fairly flat. The majority of that savings will occur in the second half of the year. And just to remind everyone else, we're expecting about $130 million in annualized savings as a result of that announced restructuring. On the gross profit, it's exactly as I said, John. You should be thinking that, over the course of the cycle, our fall through average is about 75% on the way up and on the way down. So that's a good long-term model to be using as you build your model.",207

Well, even though your question was end market, let me, first of all, address it more by product line. So the biggest mix change has been as we've gotten out of legacy wireless. And even though that's essentially 0 as of first quarter, you'll still see the impact on that -- on the year-on-year comparisons through the course of 2014. And in general, the legacy wireless gross margins were lower than corporate average. So getting out of that, those product areas, was beneficial to gross margin. From an end market standpoint, I probably -- the way to think about it is that gross margins tend to be highest -- and this is not unique to TI. You can just look across a broader range of companies. But gross margins tend to be highest where volumes tend to be lowest, meaning where -- maybe the better way to say it is where the revenue is most diversified across customers and application areas. So for example, industrial, you can see other companies that are highly focused on industrial and we see it in our own results, where you're selling catalog products into lots and lots of different customers and different applications within the industrial space. And that tends to be at pretty nice gross margins. Other areas like automotive where there are a lot of special requirements from the standpoint of quality, the design-in cycles tend to be long, the product life cycles, both in automotive and industrial tend to be long. And that tends to be beneficial for gross margins also. They probably tend to be lowest in the short cycle, high volume end market areas. And that's partly the nature of the competitiveness of those opportunities, combined with you don't really have time in terms of the life cycle of the products to engineer in cost reductions to get gross margins where you would really like to see them over time. And so, there's lots of examples of that. And again, you see it in our own results and you would see it probably more broadly with other companies. So if you say where you would expect to see highest growth over time, I would say just make a couple of observations. I think both industrial and automotive, from an application area, from their embracement of electronics technology, they're kind of at a tipping point where those very likely will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets going forward just by nature of their -- the probation [ph] of semiconductor technology inside those applications. Now I would also say that we have a good position in those markets. And we believe Analog and Embedded are important. And we also believe, frankly, our sales force, and the breadth of our sales force, is an important competitive advantage for TI in reaching, especially in the industrial markets, a broad base of customers there. So probably not surprisingly, you've heard us say for some time now, they are priority areas for TI in terms of investment and in terms of our expected penetration into those markets and applications. And that doesn't necessarily mean that their revenue will grow faster as a percentage of TI's total because you never know what will happen in a particular high-volume market. But over time, I think you would expect that our position in those markets gets stronger.

But could you help -- could you just walk through the mechanics of the capital return for this quarter? You have the debt that you're going to pay down, but you issued some. So I understand that the free cash flow plus the proceeds from the options, minus the debt service is what you expect to return. Is that -- so if you have $1 billion, do we just subtract that $1 billion or do we also factor in the $500 million in debt that you issued this quarter as part of that pay down?",110

Again, at the high level, I'll repeat what you said there, our cash return strategy is to return 100% of the free cash flow, less any amount used for net debt retirement, plus proceeds that we get from stock option exercises. During this past quarter or during this past 12 months, there was no -- virtually no net debt requirement -- retirement. So it was really the proceeds from the free cash flow, plus the stock option exercises which are virtually all -- we returned all of that to the shareholders the last 12 months, 99% of that to the shareholders. As you move in the second quarter, we do have $1 billion of debt that is coming due in May that we will go ahead and pay off. And so when you rerun that math, you'll see some usage over that trailing 12 months of cash for debt retirement. And just mathematically, that says the percentage we return by the time we get to the end of the second quarter will probably be in excess of 100%, probably in excess of 110%. But that's just timing as you go through the course of the year and that will net itself as we move on through the year.",223

In trying to model the cash flow through the year, normally you have -- Q1 you have accounts payable and accounts receivable are a big use of cash, which they were this quarter. And then in Q4 account receivable becomes a nice source of cash. Is it fair to assume that, that typical pattern is what we would expect to see, and is there any other working capital that shifts this that might happen this year that's different than what you've historically have had?",87

Typically our first and second quarters are our lowest for cash flow and operating cash flow and free cash flow generation. First quarter, we have paying benefit increases, as I mentioned earlier, we also pay out our profit sharing and our performance bonuses during the first quarter. And in the second quarter, we, of course, have estimated tax payments that we have to make for the year that uses some cash. But as we travel through the year, our operating cash and our free cash flow have a tendency to increase, first, to second, to third, to fourth and then decline again. And I don't see anything in 2014 that would suggest that would be any different than what we've seen for a number of years now.",135

I -- in terms of ASPs, Mark -- or Doug -- excuse me, I'm really not aware that there's been any significant shift one way or the other. And again, that just tends to shift that take place on ASPs when you have differentiated products such as we do, tend to be more driven by mix than they would general pricing environments, you might say, or a competitive pricing environment. So again, no substantial shift there other than when you look over time the longer-term impact of moving out of legacy wireless. Lead times are generally stable. At any point in time, you always have some mix differences that might cause lead times to move in or out for 1 product area versus another. But generally, lead times are stable. And for TI, what that means is the majority of our products are shipping with lead times of less than 6 weeks. And...",163

We came into last quarter with a book to bill of 0.94. And we've come into this quarter with a book to bill of 1.03. So clearly, we've got a little bit more visibility than we had last quarter or even the quarter before that. Just to put that in perspective, orders in the quarter, I think we mentioned earlier, were up about 4% year-over-year. That works out to be up about 7% quarter-over-quarter. So with those combined elements from a backlog standpoint, that leaves us to expect that we will have a pretty reasonable growth in total revenues as we go into second quarter, as indicated by the guidance that we've included with this release.",129

And so, for that revenue, book to bill is always 1.0. So the 1.03 is a blend of really, only the revenue that's non-JIT or non-consignment, which is 55% of our revenue. So if I just round and call that half of our revenue, the book to bill on those products that would be shipping on traditional backlog and order entry type process would be more like a 1.06. The total being a 1.03 because that 1.06 then gets blended with the JIT consignment products at a 1.0 book to bill. Okay, hopefully that helped and did not further confuse.

No, that was excellent color. I really do appreciate it. My follow-on is really about sort of the cost of running the business. I know that you guys have executed your restructuring plan to lower some of the cost. But how should I think about the cost in OpEx going forward in relation to, say, revenue growth? If revenue growth continues at, say, a double-digit pace, does the core OpEx grow at that same double-digit pace or is there some leverage there?",83

And that is the restructuring that we announced in Embedded Processing and Japan that mostly will kick in during the second half. So again, just to remind you that's $130 million of annualized savings that we expect to capture by the end of the year. So as it rolls in the next year, we'll see on an annual basis. That $130 million will spread roughly 65% in R&D, 20% in SG&A and the balance of 15% in cost of revenue and cost of goods sold. So it's kind of spread that way. Beyond 2014, again, I think we've commented a couple of times on prior calls, our basic model for OpEx is to operate between 20% and 30% of revenue. So it will not go up or down necessarily at the same pace that revenue goes up or down. It will be more of a steady change over time with some of these one-off anomalies like I just described with the restructuring going on in Embedded Processing and Japan.",182

But it's the year here already. So I think the reality is it will be what it will be. And you'll see certain times when Analog grows faster than Embedded. You'll see periods where Embedded grows faster than Analog. I think Kevin, even in his opening remarks, mentioned that I think it was back in 2010 where we stepped up investments in Embedded because we believed there was a great growth opportunity for TI in microcontrollers. We've answered questions from you guys for a long time about where is the growth that goes along with that stepped up investment. And frankly, I think we're starting to see it now. And it makes sense because it takes time, first of all, for that R&D to translate to products and then for products to get designed into customers and them to get their products to the market. So I think what we're seeing now in Embedded, very specifically in the Microcontroller area, has to do with the stepped up investments that we made a few years ago in Microcontrollers. Certainly, also what's helping Embedded is, I think, we mentioned that from an end-market standpoint, we're seeing strength in communications equipment as well. And clearly, the DSP position or processor position we have in Embedded across pretty much all of the various OEMs that ship into that wireless base station market are benefiting now in terms of that market starting to look for us. In terms of Analog, same thing. You'll see, over time, periods where Power grows faster. In fact, probably that would be a trend that would -- you'd say, if you look over a -- an extended period of time, meaning 5 years or so, Power has pretty consistently led growth in Analog. And we think that's an opportunity that will just continue in the years ahead. And that has to do with the world wanting to get greener in terms of power efficiency and it has to do with a lot more products in the end market becoming battery-powered, and that's a great Power Management opportunity for TI. Our leadership in that market means that as that market lifts, we probably tend to lift more than most other players. Outside of that, what we're doing at Silicon Valley Analog, what we're doing at High Performance Analog, both those areas in the industrial market are very clear beneficiaries of the industrial market continuing to lift. So I'll stop there. Those are some general comments. But again, we don't really try to manage it, Chris. We have certain areas like industrial that are -- in automotive that are important to us. But frankly, pretty much every product area whether it's application-specific products or processors or catalog analog devices can reach into industrial and can reach into automotive and be beneficiaries of that strategy going forward. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?",515

But can you just go over what utilization rates were during the quarter? What you expect them to be this quarter? And then given all the restructuring and fabs, et cetera, maybe just to refresh us on what your sort of peak revenue level is and where you would need to start adding equipment in terms of utilization rate level?",77

We tend to do that when it's really dramatic change, it's informative. I will just say that our factory utilization from a starts basis was higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. But the average wafers that moved through the factories was about the same in both quarters. So consequently, the underutilization charge was the same in both quarters, both fourth quarter and first quarter, about $105 million. With the outlook that we have for the second quarter, with the guidance that we've offered, clearly, we have been and we'll continue to increase the loadings in the factories to support that increased expected outlook revenue growth in the second quarter. And then, just to your -- the last part of your question there, the installed capacity that we have today is equipped to the point to support, we believe, about $18 billion of revenue. As we go forward, we'll continue to look for opportunities to increase capacity at the lowest possible cost as we have done for a number of years now, so that we can remain focused on maximizing continuous free cash flow over time, as opposed to trying to maximize factory utilization numbers over time.",217

You will see some improvement on utilization. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are increasing the loadings in the factories, but you'll also see a similar improvement as you go next quarter just on lower manufacturing cost. Recall a couple of years ago that we had announced that we were closing 2 older 6-inch factories, one in Houston and one in Hiji, Japan. And those basically are behind us now.

And the reality is seasonality, the number you come up with for, call it an average growth for any particular quarter will vary so widely based upon the time period that you used to collect that. And so, what we've decided is instead of us giving you our view, we've historically provided what's called a 3-year or 5 average -- 5-year, whatever, The reality is when we threw that number out, it was being perceived as an endorsement of that level of growth for TI. And that was never our intention. So I think what we decided to do going forward is just let you guys go through that analysis and provide your own estimates on seasonality. If you need help with the math on whether it's a 3-year or a 5-year average, I probably could help on that. But I won't -- I'm not going to do it for you. The other thing is -- and I've noted even just looking at reports coming into the current report, I mean, I think sell-side analysts I saw had anywhere from call it a 4% average for a second quarter sequential to up to 9%. And again, that just reinforces that the range is so wide that from our perspective, internally we really just don't put much emphasis on seasonal average given how wide that range is. So if you think it's important, then we're going to let you go through that on your own. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?",273

And so good luck on that channel check, but they're very much so in industrial applications. Certainly, automotive is a factor there. The other piece that I would mention for Embedded Processing that I already mentioned was communications equipment base stations clearly was a lift for TI. The only thing I would caution against is the view that, that would drove some significant upside because the reality is, I think for the most part, Analog and Embedded Processing came in about as expected, and in fact, our revenue overall, I think we were 1% or so above our -- the midpoint of our guidance range. So again, the quarter generally came in about as we expected. But what drove the strength there would probably be a mix of industrial, automotive microcontroller applications as well as communications equipment. But pretty much everything was broadly up in the quarter. I guess that was your follow-up, Ross. Thank you, and we'll move to our next caller.",189

But I think what I would be safe in saying is that it's a pretty broad-based traction that is taking place in second quarter and it's driving that growth. That doesn't mean everything's up uniformly the same, but it is -- we believe, the strength will be pretty broad-based for us. And as you pointed out, calculators probably is the one outlier where it just tends to have a good back-to-school strength in the second quarter and we do expect that as well this second quarter.

And that was really to resize the -- our presence in Japan principally from of sports standpoint to be more commensurate with the size of the market opportunity there. As it relates to Embedded Processing, we did discuss that we were, in some cases, reduced investments or discontinuing on some areas that were no longer showing growth opportunities, in other cases, reallocating. And that affected our processor side as well as our microcontroller side to a lesser degree in Embedded Processing. Beyond those, there's no other actions that we've taken or intend to take that we discussed right now.",153

I think if you look at our capability and market position, it probably is second to none. If you look across processors, microcontrollers, that are just inherent in connecting the world, combine that with our connectivity capability, whether WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, those types of capabilities that we have in our Embedded business as well, that potential to then go pursue that opportunity of connecting lots of different things, I think, is probably second to none. But that being said, as soon as the world goes and puts a big label on it and tries to calculate how much everybody has and this and that, that's really not what we're interested in. We love the diversity of what you're calling Internet of Things, meaning it's lots of different applications. They have different requirements that are across different customers. The idea somehow is circling it up into a common end market or whatever, we think is probably the wrong approach just because there's not that much in common there from a technology standpoint or from a customer or an end market standpoint. But again, we'll just try to stay away from the hype. We'll keep our heads down and go attack that opportunity. Do you have a follow-on, Tim?",226

We did hit on some of those things. I'll say channel inventory for TI we described as less than 5.5 weeks, really unchanged from where it's been for some time now. And I would just say if you look more broadly, we think inventory -- that we would characterize that as lean, we would characterize customer inventory as lean. Maybe one of the best data points is cancellations from customers are incredibly low right now. And we think that reflects combination of lean inventories as well as the growing demand environment that we're in. But I think both the other pieces there, we did address already.

You guys had broken out, as you usually do, your segments at the beginning of the year in terms of end market exposure. And I think it was 37% was consumer. Kind of longer-term question, is that a number you're comfortable with, or is that a number that you'd like to see decline over time through market share growth in other segments? Obviously, consumer, I don't think, has grown as fast on a revenue basis, as some of the other markets over time because of pricing pressure and such there. So just a little perspective on where you'd like to see that number 3 years from now?",127
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2014",2014-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3725.0,615728.0,27772351.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,65,"Okay, thanks, Jim, and that's a good question. So let me do a couple of things. I'll also give a little bit of color what happened in the quarter by end market because nobody's asked that question. But very clearly, we do talk about the one end market being personal electronics. And in 2013, that was 37% of our revenue. That is not what you would historically or typically think of as consumer, though. It does have products like gaming products in there, it has television in there, set-top box. But it also includes mobile phones, notebook computers, printers and also things like tablets. And so it will go down between 2013 and 2014, largely because of our exit from legacy wireless. So most of that revenue would have been shipping into the personal electronics space. But again, don't -- and I've had a number of questions from analysts over the last few months that imply that a lot of people think of personal electronics as consumer. It's not. It's, again, mobile phones, notebooks and that space as well. They do tend to be consumer-buying decisions as opposed to enterprise, but they're not what you typically thought of in the past as consumer electronics. So I think in the prepared remarks we gave a top-level overview of what drove revenue from a year ago. Maybe I can give a little more granularity on that. So I think we talked about communications equipment being the highest contributor of growth from a year ago. That, very clearly, tied to Wireless infrastructure. Next, we said industrial. Interestingly, industrial, if you go out to our website, we break that down into multiple sectors, something like 12, 15 different sectors below that industrial level. Pretty much all of them were up in that year-on-year comparison with most of them up at a double-digit growth level. So good strength and broad strength in industrial. Automotive, similarly, if you go look at the sectors on our website, all of them were up. Infotainment products were the strongest, but all of the sectors inside automotive were up. Enterprise systems, we said were about even for TI. And that really is a combination of growth in projector revenue, which again is primarily DLP for TI, offset by declines in servers. And then the last area which we started off with on personal electronics, it was down but it was down pretty much only due to legacy wireless. If you would have excluded the legacy wireless revenue out of that comparison, then personal electronics would have been about even from a year ago. So again, that's just a little more color of what happened inside there. Jim, thank you for your questions. And let's move to our next caller.",459

I -- Vivek, we're not seeing, at this point, signs of that kind of overheated market. Typically, that comes along with crazy expedites and things like that, that frankly, we just didn't see in the quarter. We saw customers giving us good visibility into their needs. We've been shipping at the lead times that we've been quoting them, and our lead times have been stable. So in that environment, typically, there's no need for customers to start that double ordering process that you mentioned. So again, we see -- we really see no signs of that taking place. And in terms of visibility in the second half, again, we've got customers for the most part trying to give us visibility into their needs. But I would really not say we have -- I would not want to try to provide any specific comments about second half visibility at this point. Kevin, do you have any other comments?",175

I would, just -- looking over the numbers here, back to your point, we did have 13% year-over-year growth in the first quarter when you combined Analog and Embedded Processing. That's up just a bit from last quarter when it was 12% year-over-year and up a little bit from the prior quarter when it was up 7% year-over-year. What we're actually seeing is a slight acceleration in that to it looks like the low teens. And that's probably consistent with what we talked about at the last earnings release when we said that we felt 2014 was shaping up to be a better year than 2013. And I think this is just reinforcing that. And the big differences that we see is that in 2014, it appears the U.S. economy was attempting to grow at a faster pace than it has in the last few years. In 2014 for the first time on a number of years, you're seeing Europe beginning to grow rather than shrink. And you continue to see growth broadly across Asia, albeit at a slightly slower rate, still growing quite strongly. So I think what we're really seeing here is the results of an improving broader economy and our efforts at trying to gain market share inside those spaces combined our result in a nice growth for TI. And as Ron said, for the second half, we'll give you that forecast or at least the first part of that forecast in about 90 days.",256

You guys are the largest in the space. It's very encouraging to see the kind of trends that you are reporting. As my follow-up question, just probably more a math question, but at what revenue level would underutilization charges be behind you? Or asked in a different way, if you're saying you have installed capacity of $18 billion and your current sales are about, I don't know, say $13 billion, will we continue to see underutilization charges until you use all of your installed capacity? Or how should we think about that underutilization charge number that you report every quarter in relation to the amount of installed capacity that you have? And then obviously, the implications on how we should model your gross margins going forward?",127
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2014",2014-04-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3725.0,615728.0,27772358.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,72,"Yes, Vivek, I would suggest you think about it the way we do and the way most of our investors that we speak with seem to think about it. And that is not what does the underutilization capacity or the current period gross profit margin or next period gross profit margin but what's the total free cash flow that we can generate with that available capacity? And what's the cheapest way to bring that capacity in-house so that we can maximize cash flow going forward. And that's exactly how we think about it. So frankly, we do not focus on trying to figure out how to get the utilization charge down to 0. In fact, by definition, with our stated strategy of buying capacity opportunistically, when we don't need it and prices are relatively low, that by definition means that we will always have open capacity and therefore, we'll always be underutilized in a classic sense. But from a cash flow standpoint, when we do the math and the trade-off on that, and the last few years have certainly proven it out, we generate a heck of a lot more cash flow with that kind of behavior than we would if we focused purely on maximizing utilization, which puts us at the risk of buying capacity at too expensive a price. So that's really the way we look at it and I'd offer that you maybe think about it on the longer term view like that as opposed to trying to model in near term GPM percent swings and utilization swings.",261

I hopped in a little late, but when I'm looking at our guidance for next quarter and I'm backing into sort of the implication for gross margin, I'm getting something that's reasonably close to 57%. It's almost 300 basis point increase. I think you'd mentioned higher revenue. I think you'd also talked about the 6-inch fab closures. My understanding was those fab closures they were already in the numbers. Is this something that happens like as a lump improvement this quarter, or any color you can give us on I guess the relative impact of drivers revenue cost savings and mix would be very helpful. And I guess, just some indication of whether that 57% number is something that you guys actually are thinking for next quarter.",134

If you go to a year ago and take a look, you would have seen our gross margins from 1Q to 2Q increased in a similar manner. And in part, that's just a natural effect of stepping up manufacturing production for a typically stronger second quarter versus 1 quarter. So if you take a look today on a year-over-year basis, your best way to think about it is that we continue to have improved product mix. A year ago, we still had wireless. Now we have virtually none. So it's mostly Analog and Embedded Processing. We have lower manufacturing costs versus a year ago. And again, this is the Houston and Hiji factory is now completely out of the mix. And to a lesser extent, we had some lower utilization charges because, in fact, we are expecting revenue levels this quarter -- this 2Q to be higher than they were 2Q a year ago. And so, that will take on a little bit more of our capacity. So there's a combination of things going on there. And the bottom line is that when you do the math, your gross margins are going to be stepping up rather nicely, as you just suggested.",233

And I guess to follow up on that same trend, presumably you'll continue to have higher revenues year-over-year than you had last year and you're sitting now I think it's close to 600 basis points higher than your last year. Does this mean that you could actually maybe even have visibility into the ballpark of 60% exiting the year and going into 2015? Is that something that you guys -- I don't know if you guys think internally about gross margin targets anymore, but that's something that -- is this something that could actually be possible at this point?",101

We don't really spend time thinking or looking at it in that context. We spend, again, more time thinking in context of are we taking steps that are going to maximize our free cash flow on a continuous basis? And in doing that, then GPM just tends to fall out. So from that standpoint, there's nothing structural that stops us from getting higher GPMs as we move forward. In fact, if we continue to be successful as we have been at increasing our Analog and Embedded Processing mix at the same time of keeping the variable cost manufacturing underneath that mix, then clearly, our margins not only are benefiting as you're computing now but will continue to benefit as we look into the future.",136

I think if I recall, 6 quarters of year-over-year growth going on in that business. So we're beginning to see the payoff of prior investments resulting to real revenue growth. And that growth is in the right area. I mean, it's where we can -- we've got sustainable product revenue streams and very attractive margins. Consequently, we're seeing profit margins beginning to improve rather nicely, and that's even before we see the benefit of the restructuring actions that we talked about for Embedded Processing. That's not to say that we're done. There's still quite a bit more work to be done. But most importantly, what that business is focusing on is growing into its inherent cost base. And so, more growth is what's going to be really important there. And clearly, at this current operating profit levels, it's not anywhere near where we think it can take us to. I won't go beyond that on forecasting what margins might be, but I think you know from how we operate the business here, we're focused on free cash flow, which means you got to have some attractive margins in there, and this business still has quite a bit of work to do to get to where we expect the entitlement is.",234

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. In addition, Dave Pahl has joined us.
As many of you know, I will retire in August, and Dave will replace me as Head of Investor Relations. Dave has worked at TI for 25 years and has worked directly with me in Investor Relations for 10 years. With that consideration, you probably should allow him some time to come up to speed. Dave has also been recently elected by TI's board to the position of company Vice President. Dave will moderate today's call.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.",118

It's good to join you today for the call, and now down to business. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and any relevant non-GAAP reconciliation on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web, and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
The second quarter was another solid quarter. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew strongly, with combined revenue up 14% from a year ago. We continue to benefit from our investments in industrial and automotive, as these important markets continue to grow as a percentage of our revenue.
Revenue of $3.29 billion came in slightly higher than the middle of the expected range we communicated to you in April. Earnings per share of $0.62 were near the top of our expected range as profitability was stronger in the quarter.
Free cash flow of $3.2 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period was right in line with the 20% to 30% range in which we expect to operate over time. Also, over the past 12 months, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. As a reminder, our model for cash returns to shareholders is to return all of our free cash flow, less the net debt amount that is retired, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation. This model demonstrates our confidence in TI's business and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
In the second quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with double-digit growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by Power Management. High Performance Analog, High Volume Analog & Logic and Silicon Valley Analog also grew.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily due to processors and microcontrollers, both of which grew about the same amount. Connectivity grew at a faster rate, although it was coming from a much smaller base. Embedded Processing delivered its seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year growth, as our investments over the past few years in strategic areas are yielding favorable results.
In our Other segment, revenue declined $90 million or 13% from a year ago due to legacy wireless, which is essentially gone.
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 15% from a year ago, while distributors' inventories were about even. Weeks of inventories fell by several days to just over 4.5 weeks. This reduction was driven by higher percentage of resales being supported by TI's consignment inventory programs.
From an end market perspective, most growth from the year ago came in communications equipment, followed by automotive and industrial. Enterprise systems was also up, while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that use legacy wireless products from TI.
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",550
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2014",2014-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3584.0,660131.0,29374536.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 57.1% of revenue. Gross profit increased 20% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin hit another new record.
When compared with the previous record in the third quarter of 2013, revenue was $48 million higher and gross profit was $102 million higher. This reflects an improved product portfolio focus on Analog and Embedded Processing, as well as increased efficiency in our manufacturing operations.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $821 million was down $39 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the reductions in legacy wireless as well as continued cost discipline across TI.
Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $4 million benefit. As a reminder, the year-ago quarter included a gain of $315 million associated with the transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer.
Operating profit was $982 million or 29.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter.
Net income in the second quarter was $683 million or $0.62 per share.
Let me comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $775 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $80 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.59 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $388 million or 3% of revenue, even lower than our long-term expectation of 4%.
Although we've been able to keep capital expenditures at this low level, we continue to invest to expand both our capabilities and our capacity. As examples, capital expenditures in second quarter included the cost to prepare the site and install the first tools into our new assembly and test facility in Chengdu, China. We completed manufacturing our first units there for qualification purposes. In addition, we brought on additional tools to expand capacity in our 300-millimeter facility in Richardson, Texas. We are able to make these investments and keep our capital spending at low levels because of our strategy to invest in capacity opportunistically and ahead of demand.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.20 billion or 25% of revenue, in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. Free cash flow was 10% higher than a year ago.
Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $856 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $468 million or 3.7% of revenue. We continue to expect to hold capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. As a result, the depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margins will directly benefit.
As we've said, we believe strong cash flow growth, particularly free cash flow growth, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. To that end, in the second quarter, TI paid $323 million in dividends and repurchased $743 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.07 billion.
The shareholder return part of our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow, minus debt retirement, plus any proceeds that we receive from exercises of equity compensation.
Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.2 billion, which was 18% higher than a year ago. Dividends were up 32% and stock repurchases were up 13%. Fundamental to our cash return strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, down from $4.03 billion at the beginning of the quarter. The decline mostly reflects the use of $1 billion to retire debt in the quarter.
TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 7% from a year ago, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.01, which would have been higher but was impacted by the conversion of consignment of some products that are sold through distribution.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.31 billion to $3.59 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 6% from a year ago. If you exclude the $57 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year-ago quarter, revenue would increase 8%.
We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.76. Restructuring charges will continue to be essentially 0. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at this level for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter.
In summary, the second quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model focused on Analog and Embedded Processing, which we believe are the best opportunities inside of the semiconductor market. We continue to invest in areas that offer sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The percentage of our business from industrial and automotive markets continues to grow as customers increasingly embrace technology that makes end products smarter and more connected. At the same time, we continue to invest in our manufacturing capabilities, and our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets means that we can deliver strong free cash flows. We continue to demonstrate, as we did again in the second quarter, our commitment to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",996

I think for the June quarter, going into June, you kind of guided the OpEx would be flattish Q-on-Q, and you did better than that. I'm kind of curious, is that a pull-in of the $130 million of annualized savings you expected from the restructuring? Or is that just a bigger number than $130 million? And how do we think about OpEx trending in September, in the back half of the year?",81

The OpEx we had expected to be roughly even from first quarter to the second quarter, that came in a bit lower than we had expected. And part of that was some pull-in with the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter for both Embedded Processing and resizing of our operation in Japan. And part of it was just continued discipline on the part of all the business units in TI when it came to spending. As you look into 3Q, we continue to expect the second half to see the primary benefit of the cost savings that we talked about for those restructuring actions. Recall that we expect about $130 million of annualized savings with about 85% of that in OpEx and the balance in cost of revenue. So as we go into the third quarter, we'll see probably about half of that come out -- come into our results in OpEx, with the balance in fourth quarter. So by the time we leave the year, we should be at an annualized $130 million cost savings in that action.",186

As a follow-up, I know this is somewhat of an unfair question, but if you look at the proceeds from equity compensation last year, it was almost about 1/3 of the cash returns to investors. And I know that's been a volatile number and probably a number that's impossible to predict. But I'm kind of curious, how do you think we should think about that number going forward from here? How do we try to model that number in the future?",85

We saw -- gosh, I guess it was probably 2 to 3x our normal rate stock option exercises and cash proceeds in 2013 than we'd seen in prior years. So we talked about that going forward, that would probably come back down to a more normalized level. And I would suspect that what we saw last quarter, what we saw this quarter, probably is more reflective of what you should model going forward. Figure about -- I think we saw about 4% or 5% of stock options exercised last year, and that will probably drop back down to 1.5%, 2% kind of level.",132

I think that we don't have any unique insight into what's going on from a cyclical standpoint. I think that the quarter that we just delivered, we feel good about. If you look at the middle of our range into third quarter, 8%, if you're excluding legacy wireless, is another good quarter on a year-on-year basis. If you look at a lot of the signals that one would pay attention to, such as inventory inside of the channel, we took several days out of inventory in the quarter as we had a higher percentage of revenue supported by our consignment programs inside of distribution. And if you look at cancellations, they continue to remain at very, very low levels. We think inventory at customers remains in check as well. So -- and then if you look at our lead times, they continue to remain stable. We'll always have some pockets where they may move out temporarily. But with our capacity and the position of our inventory, we feel really good to be able to continue to support that. So do you have a follow-on question?",187

So very broad-based from that standpoint, led by areas like factory automation. Automotive, we had double-digit growth in all of our sectors, led by ADAS or Advanced Driver Assistance System. Personal electronics was down, but it would have been up had it not been for legacy wireless. In our enterprise systems, we saw growth, driven by projectors and servers. And comms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure. So really broad-based growth on that standpoint. Okay, thanks.",101

Your incremental operating margins for Analog and Embedded Processing both exceeded 100% sequentially in the quarter. Your Analog business also has about 100% incremental operating margins year-over-year. I guess a strong performance particularly in Analog surprises me a little bit. I thought most of the cuts you did were in Embedded Processing. So I'm wondering if you could give us some sort of view on what's driving that strong incremental margin. How much of that is sort of gross margin expansion within the businesses versus OpEx? And what do you sort of see as sort of sustainable levels of incremental operating margin going forward as the revenues in the businesses continue to grow?",127
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2014",2014-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3584.0,660131.0,29374551.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,18,"Stacy, the fall-through is very good both on a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis. Certainly, at the company level and at the segment level. Yes, I'd mentioned, I guess, on the first call from John that from an OpEx standpoint, spending remained disciplined across the company. So while the restructuring action that you referred to will disproportionally benefit Embedded Processing versus other areas of the company, some of that will also -- some of that restructuring will benefit other areas of the company as well. For example, we mentioned resizing our sales team in Japan. And that's not just the sales team in support of the Embedded Processing, but also goes in support of some of the other business units. So you get a little bit of benefit there. But then really, you got just disciplined spending across the company, as frankly, people are spending only what they need to support the growth of the business. On a go-forward basis, again, we expect OpEx to be down a little bit sequentially, primarily for the benefit of Embedded Processing. And that will be true for both the third and fourth quarter. Beyond that, I don't know that I'd give you any more specific forecast on OpEx other than by the time we reach the end of the year, we will enter next year with OpEx about -- total cost savings from the restructuring about $130 million, about 85% of that coming off OpEx.",242

Yes. For my follow-on, I want to dig in to gross margins just a little bit. So if I take that -- half of the $130 million kind of hitting you -- or 85% hitting you by next quarter, sounds to me like you're guiding OpEx down about 2%, which will give me an implied gross margin guidance at the corporate level call it into the upper 57%. So up maybe 500 basis points, maybe even a little more from Q2. So wondering if you could give us just some view of what's driving that gross margin expansion. Is this just further efficiencies, manufacturing efficiencies? Is this just depreciation coming down? Is this something that has to do with mix or pricing or just overall revenue leverage as the revenues grow?",135
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2014",2014-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3584.0,660131.0,29374553.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,20,"I think it's a little bit of all of that, to be quite frank, Stacy. The -- if you take a look at -- as we go forward on gross margin, there's multiple drivers inside the portfolio, not the least of which is being able to load or fill up our very cost-effective factories. We also get improved product mix, especially as we see industrial and automotive becoming a larger portion of our total revenue mix. And finally, we get the benefit from depreciation as it begins to roll off, being that CapEx has run substantially below depreciation now for quite some time. Again, just as a reminder, depreciation was about 7% of revenue over the last 12 months and CapEx is expected to be around 4%. So we get some closure that will start happening over the next couple of years. Depreciation this year is expected to be down a bit versus last year, but it will start declining more rapidly next year. So you got a number of different things going on, not just next quarter, that will move gross margins up again, as you indicated, but should also continue to benefit us as we look out into the balance of the year and going into 2015.",210

And just a few things to consider as you go through that. Obviously, calculator revenue is usually strongest in second quarter and third quarter with the back-to-school buying period. And you saw that in our results this quarter. And our semiconductor growth is typically relatively stronger in the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth. So outside of that, we don't put much credence on a specific sequential growth number just because the numbers around that have been so unpredictable.

When we look at sort of what's going on with your balance sheet, you're getting pretty close to getting a debt level that might be good to carry that debt and stop retiring it or maybe just start rolling it forward. Can you maybe talk a little bit, Kevin, about your strategy there?",75

It's really about being sure that we're thoughtful on how we spend our research and development dollars and that we spend them on products that we expect to have very long revenue life streams off of them. And then in correlation with that is to continue to be opportunistic and to expand our manufacturing capacity at times when you may least expect us to do that because we can get it for costs that are very low. Those are our 2 biggest levers for expanding cash flow. As it relates to debt going forward, as you observed, we just paid off a net of $500 million this year. We raised $500 million in the first quarter and repaid $1 billion in the second quarter. So a net reduction of $500 million. We still have on the balance sheet total debt of about $4.625 billion. And those actually have lives that extend all the way out to 2023. So I don't see balance vanishing from -- or debt vanishing from our balance sheet any time soon. On a go-forward basis, of course, our buyback, and I think that was one of the things you were asking about under free cash flow, is really a function of what our calculation of net present value of the company is. And so long as we see that the intrinsic value of the company exceeds the market value, we'll continue to be buyers of the stock.",263

Our bias is likely to be -- to find an opportunity that would be attractive to us. Our bias would probably be in the Analog space as opposed to Embedded Processing. And frankly, aside from the technology that we acquire or the product opportunity that we acquire being attractive, meaning long revenue streams, we would also have to work, of course, mathematically. Meaning that the price at which we could acquire it, would have to be such that we could get a return on our invested capital inside a 3 to 4-year period. And we're pretty disciplined about that. Some of the opportunities that some have speculated on here in recent months are such that if we do the math, it's very difficult to overcome that hurdle of making sure it's ROIC accretive.

In any one quarter, I'm sure it's going to be off. But it'll be okay for -- on a rough annual period. Anything that might cause us to go above that could possibly be if we had a sudden opportunity present itself, where we could add capacity at a significant cost savings. We wouldn't let that 4% artificially restrain us from taking advantage of very inexpensive manufacturing capacity which would benefit our future free cash flow. But right now, I don't see that on the horizon. So again, for your model, I'd probably just use 4%.",134

Clearly, we had the strategy in place now for a number of years where we're acquiring as inexpensively as we can manage to in advance of our needs. The most recent example was the acquisition of an assembly test operation in Chengdu, China, that I commented on earlier in the call that we're now bringing online. And so that has certainly been a benefit to us to allow us to have very stable lead times on behalf of our customers and to be able to meet any short-term spikes or inside lead time requests that customers have had. Broadly speaking, across the industry, it does strike us that many people perhaps have chosen not to invest in as much capacity as they might have in the past. It's unclear to us just what that may mean going forward. But at least from our standpoint, for our customers, they can have confidence in that we have ample capacity to meet their need.",163

And so one thing that we've done, and you can see it on the balance sheet, is that in periods of weaker demand, we'll actually build finished goods inventory as well as staging wafers to support future demand on low volume products. And so it may take 20 minutes, 30 minutes to set up a piece of assembly test equipment. And you may run only 10,000 units on that part. And it may take you 0.5 hour or 1 hour. It doesn't take much longer to build either 6 months of demand or full year demand or 1.5 years of demand and put that on the shelf. So when demand actually get stronger, we've got the capacity open and available to support that stronger demand. So we feel good to be able to support really any demand environment that we see in the future. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?",167

That's down from the prior quarter, which is about $105 million. And that's a bit of a theoretical question, as to what revenue would it take to get to 0, because clearly, the mix of products flowing across the various manufacturing flows are going to have a direct bearing on that. So if we had a much higher demand, but it was on a flow where we didn't have a lot of excess capacity, it wouldn't help much on the end utilization. So our job on that is to make sure that all of our flows maintain open capacity. And I'll remind everybody again that the underutilization, we don't let that distract us, it's an accounting adjustment. It affects -- nothing happened to the free cash flow. We are completely focused on free cash flow as the way to return value to our shareholders.",153

So I guess that means the open capacity you have is more a source of keeping CapEx low and free cash flow rather than being a big source of expanding gross margins per se. But maybe onto my second question. On the demand environment, can you give us a sense -- I think you mentioned end markets, but what about the geographies? Are there certain geos that are better or worse than what you thought 3 months ago?",79

So let me follow up on the last one, just to make a clarifying point. So as Kevin talked about, there are certain factories that -- and you've seen some competitors, some of the manufacturers in Taiwan run above 100% capacity. So when we've got factories or flows that run above 100% or above the theoretical level that we've got from a utilization standpoint, we'll continue to get a benefit, and we still may have an underutilization charge. So don't think that all you have left is revenue growth, that small number that's an underutilization charge. So just wanted to make that clear. So from a regional standpoint, year-over-year, Vivek, we saw Asia, Europe and Japan were up. The U.S., we saw it was roughly even from a year-ago standpoint. So with that, we'll go to the next caller.",140

From an OpEx standpoint, I think that it would probably grow at least with the change of paying benefits that you'd expect on a year-over-year basis. So you'd certainly start there. And then to the extent that we see additional opportunities that we may want to invest in from an R&D standpoint or additional sales opportunities we may want to expand that may grow a bit beyond that. But typically, you're going to see -- I think it was last year, paying benefits increased average around 3%, maybe 4%, depending upon the average from around the world.

And so that's what we believe all those indicators are showing us. As I talked about before, things like where we're building demand in the channel or downstream, they actually took inventory out of the channel as more of our distributors moved to consignment and as the products that were on consignment actually grew faster than the other products. So we really -- 4, a little over 4.5 weeks of inventory that's in the channel. We consider that to be lean. But probably, we'll be running in what is more of a new normal range. So those changes in inventory downstream because of the consignments that we've got is going to have less of an impact on our revenues as what they've had in the past.",134

From an acquisition standpoint, again, we'll look at, first, the strategic bit, to make sure it makes sense, and then second, to make sure the numbers actually work from a return on the invested capital that we put into it. Beyond that, the way we'd pay for it is probably very similar to what we did this last time. When we bought National Semiconductor, we used some cash on hand, but we actually released the strength of the balance sheet and went out to the bond market and issued quite a bit of debt, which supported that acquisition. As we slowly retire debt as we had been and continue to over the next foreseeable future, that just opens the balance sheet back up and makes it available again to take on debt if there's an attractive ROIC accretive acquisition out there.

It seems to have progressed a bit better. And it looks to us as though perhaps the restructuring benefits that you're targeting are coming in a bit earlier than you previously expected.,46

It has started to come in a bit earlier than we planned. But we still have a long way to go. We will see additional benefit as we move into the second and third quarter, as we talked about earlier -- excuse me, third and fourth quarter, as we talked about earlier, as we see more of the cost beginning to come out of there. But frankly, while that is certainly helpful in moving the profit performance of that segment forward, it is not going to be done when that's over with. There's a lot more work to be done there, and the work is really on the revenue growth side. The operating profit clearly is below what we think the potential for that segment is. And that management team is very focused on driving results to get that profit up to where it should be. And really, after the restructuring actions that are complete by the end of this year, it's really going to be all about revenue growth. It actually has been a lot about revenue growth, as evidenced by the fact that, that business has excessively grown for 7 quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis. And we expect to see more of that as we go forward, so that business can grow its way into the cost structure we'll have remaining.",232

If I can follow up just a bit in that. I think there's one area of that business where you're kind of under-hitting relative to your weight in the industry, and that's microcontrollers. I know that you've invested in this area in the last year or 2. I'm wondering if you can talk about the strategy in terms of products, end markets, features that might lead to accelerating share gain in that category?",76

Maybe I'll make a comment, and if you'd like to add in, Kevin. Yes, Will, as you know, that's an area that we decided to step up investments going back several years ago now, back 2010, 2011, in that period. And the expansion of investments included both development teams to produce more products and begin to broaden the portfolio. And second is in application support, basically supporting customers and design-ins. So we feel really good about the progress that we've got. We've had several years that we have gained share inside of microcontrollers. I think that we still -- I think we're -- some industry analysts will have us at like a #6 position inside of the market. So we've got plenty of room to grow. And those are the types of markets that take a while to begin to get traction. And it's somewhat like a flywheel that you keep investing, keep making progress, and that progress begins to snowball. From a product standpoint, we're really building out a broad portfolio. We're focused on catalog products, primarily going into industrial application. You'll note, inside of Embedded Processing, we also have connectivity products. So there, we support about a dozen different wireless standards. So we're getting very good traction. And you can go to our website today and be able to find reference designs with microcontrollers ranging from $0.25 up to a couple of dollars using all of those different combinations of the connectivity products. So we feel really good about the progress. As I said in the opening remarks, Embedded Processing has had 7 quarters of year-on-year growth. And a big part of that is driven from microcontrollers. Okay. Thank you very much, Will.",286

So that's the start there. In the second quarter, we took the charge for the Japan restructuring. So it's a bit of a mixed start, if you will.

I can say that we've had changes to our business arrangement with distributors on a periodic basis over the years. And for example, if we just go back a few years ago, as an example, we implemented the consignment program with distribution. So now, we've got more than half of our overall revenues supported by distribution. So they're going to continue to be a very important part of our business. We're focused on growing our revenues overall, which will mean growing our revenues with them. As we invest in catalog products and in industrial markets, we want to work with the distributors to be able to broaden our reach with customers.

I think aside from the increase in calculators, communications and personal electronics actually grew the most. And we did see a benefit in personal electronics led by a strong quarter in PC and notebooks. We did see industrial, enterprise systems and automotive all contribute to the growth sequentially. So if you look underneath that, in industrial as an example, we had -- we've got over a dozen sectors inside of industrial. So with that, we saw areas like factory automation and control, smart grid, motor drives, drive that. In automotive, on a sequential basis, we had growth in all sectors overall, and that was led by ADAS. So those are the things that drove the revenue in the quarter, sequentially.",122

If we see bottlenecks popping up someplace and we're able to go ahead and pick up equipment inexpensively or if we anticipate that a flow is going to become a bigger, more important revenue source in the future, we can go ahead and pick up for that. Or just outright new factory, for example. And that's what we did when we bought the assembly test site in Chengdu, China. It was an entire factory that we bought in that case.

If you look at our-- the product portfolio, we actually support a dozen or so different wireless technologies. So whether you need Bluetooth low energy or WiFi, we've got GPS, we have multiple sub gigahertz standards and including things like ZigBee. So whether -- whatever label that you want to put on to that, essentially, as things are getting smarter and more connected, we've got a broad range of catalog products in which to show to customers. And we can be fairly agnostic on how to solve their problem and bring, really, the best bit of the technology to whatever market they're trying to enter. And oftentimes, we'll find manufacturers that have never had any wireless experience. So they'll want to go to the web, they'll want to contact our local apps people and get support for that product.

So what that really means is that book-to-bill for that consignment revenue is, by definition, one. And so the book-to-bill that we report at the company level really just applies to the other half of the revenue. So that 1.01 that we just reported in very simple terms would be 1.02 because it really applies to the non-consignment portion of the business. And again, that was suppressed somewhat as a result of a conversion from a previously direct sale to a consigned arrangement.",92

For my follow-on, I guess I'll ask a little bit of a bigger picture question. TI over the years has always been a cyclical company, just a function of the industry. But as you guys are operating the business a little bit differently now, your focus is on some different end markets. I'm just interested in your view of, going forward, what does that do to the cyclicality of TI as we go over the next couple of years?",81
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2014",2014-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3584.0,660131.0,29374637.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,104,"Yes, I think you're spot-on, Chris. As you look at the mix of what's going on inside our portfolio, in years past, as you observed, we had some big verticals, certain end markets you might be able to take a look at, and our business would cycle with that end market, in addition to any so-called semiconductor cycle itself. Now, as we have industrial and automotive becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue and the markets to which our products are being shipped into, arguably, we would see -- likely see less impact as a result of big vertical fluctuations and begin to see a little bit more correlation between TI's growth going forward and the global GDP as a whole. So we'll probably track more to the economy as opposed to a particular single end market. That's not to say that we escaped the semi cycle, if there still is one. It's simply to say that our fortunes are more tied much more broadly than they have been ever in the past and therefore will be much more reflective of how does the overall global GDP tend to expand over time.",195

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
The third quarter was another quarter that marked strong progress. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew again with combined revenue up 10% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.5 billion came in solidly in the upper half of our expected range we had communicated to you in July. Earnings per share of $0.76 was at the top of our range as profitability was strong in the quarter.
Our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We continue to believe that free cash flow growth is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, especially on a per-share basis. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was almost $3.5 billion or 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 300-basis-point improvement from a year-ago period. We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and purchasing assets ahead of demand at distressed prices.
We also continue to believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends paid.
In the third quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago, led by Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew.
Embedded Processing grew 6% from a year ago due to microcontrollers, connectivity and processors, each of which grew by about the same amount. Embedded Processing delivered its eighth quarter in a row of year-on-year growth.
In our Other segment, revenue was about even from a year ago, as the decline in legacy Wireless products was mostly offset by growth in DLP products.
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 10% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth in Analog and Embedded Processing. Weeks of inventory were unchanged at a historically low level of just over 4.5 weeks. This level is low because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter, we continue to convert more of our distribution sales to consignment and now support about 55% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 10 percentage points from a year ago. With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet, and revenue is recognized when distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that is stored at distributors' locations. This program minimizes changes in demand due to distribution inventory -- channel inventory and, most importantly, allows us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
From an end-market perspective, TI revenue growth from a year ago was due to communications equipment, Industrial and Automotive, each of which grew by about the same amount. Enterprise systems was also up, while revenue in personal electronics declined due to legacy Wireless products.
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin?",643

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.04 billion or 58.4% of revenue. Gross profit increased 15% from the year-ago quarter, and gross profit margin hit another new record. This gross profit reflects higher revenue and an improved product portfolio, focused on Analog and Embedded Processing, that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $795 million was down $38 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously announced, as well as continued cost discipline across TI.
Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense. Restructuring and Other charges were a $9 million benefit, primarily due to gains from sales of assets.
Operating profit was $1.18 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $826 million or $0.76 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.38 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 108, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $103 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.82 billion, up 17% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $367 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.
Besides inexpensively adding capacity ahead of demand, we have focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. By combining this capacity with continued improvements in how we manage inventory, we're able to keep our lead times consistently low while continuing to deliver on time.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.45 billion or 27% of revenue. As we said, we believe strong cash flow growth, particularly free cash flow growth, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business.
In the third quarter, TI paid $319 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock, for a total return of $989 million. As we've noted, our intent is to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds that we received from the exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.16 billion, which was 9% higher than a year ago. In the quarter, we announced a 13% dividend increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.30 to $0.34 per share or $1.36 annualized. This marked our 11th consecutive year of increasing dividends and our 52nd year of continuous dividend payments. Outstanding share count has reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.19 billion of cash and short-term investments, up from $2.80 billion at the beginning of the quarter. TI's U.S. entities own 81% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.34 billion, up 6% from a year ago, and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.95. This ratio would have been a bit higher, except for the impact of the conversion to consignment of some products sold to distribution. While book-to-bill still would have been below 1, this is consistent with the pattern we have seen for the past 4 years.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.13 billion to $3.39 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 8% from a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Restructuring charges will be essentially 0. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter.
In summary, the third quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in Analog and Embedded Processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, discipline in allocating our capital and firm believers that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",835

Clearly, you're well ahead of sort of your expected annualized savings of $130 million with the restructuring actions. How do you think OpEx will trend sequentially into the December quarter? And if you look at R&D as a percent of rev, now below 10%, is that just a structural change in the model? And how worried should I be at what scale level you should be investing on R&D for future growth? I understand that you're still spending absolutely a lot more money than most of your peers, but tough to see someone with your gross margins and R&D as a percent of revenue below 10%.",116
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889603.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,6,"Okay, John, I think there were a couple of in there, so let me see if I can remember them all. Starting with OpEx and trends. Clearly, OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter, largely as a result of some of the restructuring actions we've previously announced, as well as just the ongoing cost discipline in all the various businesses across TI.
As you look into the fourth quarter, if you just go back and take a look at 1 year ago, that's probably your best gauge to take a look at, fourth quarter and even the first quarter for that matter. We typically see that OpEx is lower in the fourth quarter due to holidays and vacations. In addition, this fourth quarter, we expect a further benefit of another $15 million of cost to come out as a result of the restructuring that we announced in Embedded Processing. That's part of that $130 million of annualized savings that you were mentioning, John. And in fact, we're probably running ahead of the $130 million of annualized savings right now. We'll probably come out beyond that. From the total R&D spend, as a percent of revenue, again, I think what's more important is not how much you spend but how well you spend it. And I think the best indicator of how well you're spending is what's happening to your market share as a result of the products you're introducing into the market. In our case, if you take a look at '06 through '13, the last -- our full year periods that we've reported on, our total R&D spend is up 77% over that period. But most importantly, that R&D has resulted in products where we have continually gained share. So again, I think, John, it's less a question of how much you spend it and a lot more how well you spend and spend it on things that customers really care about.",320

Quickly, just I know you don't give segment guidance for revenue. But when I look at the Embedded business in September quarter, it was up only about 1.1% sequentially, which is a little bit weaker than I had been modeling. And I'm kind of curious as to what you think might have driven that. And given that some of your peers have talked about sort of a slowdown in the second half of September from a macro perspective, did any of that play into the Embedded business in the September quarter?",93

So let me take that, John. I think if you look at the growth rates between Analog and Embedded Processing, you can see a lot of quarters they won't grow the same. And I think if you look at both of those businesses, they have different end-market exposures. And really, it's those end-market exposures that will explain most of the differences in those numbers. And the second part of your question was, yes, just did -- basically, the overall environment impacting the growth that we've seen there. And I'd just say no, that really isn't in those numbers. Basically, that forecast is given off of the orders that we received from our customers. So thank you, John.",118

But it seems like things have slowed down. So just wanted your perspective. In the past, you guys have given us certain things that you look at, such as cancellations and so on and so forth. And also within that frame of reference, Dave, if you could please just walk us through your distri consignment versus non-consignment. And then how would you compare it to somebody who claims that they are sell-through so they see a slowdown before -- a quarter or so before others? And then I had a very quick follow-up.",106
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889609.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,12,"Okay. So a couple of points in there, Ambrish. The first is that I'd just point out that all of our distributors provide us with a point-of-sale reporting, and we get that information on a very regular basis. So regardless of how the revenue is recognized, we see what's going on from a distributor resale standpoint. The second thing is, you touched on the current environment. And we really want to be guarded on trying to take a position for the industry on where that's going, but we can really point to just what we see. So if I kind of step through those, our inventory on our books is -- at 108 days is within our target model. If you look at our channel inventories, those were essentially unchanged from last quarter. They're at a very lean level at just over 4.5 weeks. Our lead times have been consistent and I'd say low. Our cancellations and reschedules remain very low, so nothing changing on that front. And then probably as we have grown over these last few quarters, we've been able to support that growth and keep delivering our products on time at very, very high service levels. So our operations continue to execute at that high level. And then, I'll get to -- the last part of your question was what percentage of our revenue goes through distribution and what percentage is supported by consignment. So the first one is about 55% of our revenues go through the distribution channel and about 55% of that is supported on consignment. And as we've pointed out in our prepared remarks, that has increased by about 10% from a year ago, as we've had a couple of conversions go on this year. And I would say that we're not done with that. We actually expect that additional conversions will happen in -- over the next year or so. So we expect that percentage will actually increase. So Ambrish, you have a follow-up?",331

On the Embedded operating margins, you guys have had a steady increase. What's the right way to think about how do you get to north of 20%? Is it just a matter of focusing on the right product mix and getting that ramped up? Or is it something beyond that?",55

Yes, Ambrish, I'll take that one. On Embedded Processing, clearly their margins have been continuously improving over these last few quarters, and we'd expect further improvement. Recall I just mentioned earlier in the call that we expect another $15 million or so of cost to come out of the fourth quarter, and most of that will come out of Embedded Processing. I would add that from this point going forward, and we talked about this in the last couple of quarters, the amount of spend inside Embedded Processing is sufficient. It doesn't need to increase anymore. What really the focus is, is there's revenue growth, and that's what it's really all about. And that entire team has been very focused on that. I believe they just recorded their eighth quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue growth. So they clearly are working on the right metrics to really make that business start to deliver profitability at the levels we expect it to at TI.",165

You had about $26 million in OpEx come out from Q2 to Q3. You had revenue in the group up a little bit, mostly flat. Margins were only up little bit. Given all of that cost, in theory, I would've expected to come out of Embedded Processing, why weren't the Embedded Processing margins up more? It doesn't seem like all of those cost savings actually flow through to margins this quarter.",86

Recall those actions incorporated both Embedded Processing as well as actions in Japan, which [indiscernible] as well. Even with that, at the EP level, you did see about a 72% fall-through on that delta revenue. So you're seeing it come through, but do keep in mind that the Japan stuff spreads around some of the other business as well.",73

That's helpful, that's helpful. For my follow-up, if I can dig into the gross margins a little bit, I think both for this quarter and next quarter. So for this quarter, you came in a little bit high. I guess was that only the revenue upside or was there something else in terms of mix or other cost savings that pushed it up? And then for next quarter, depending on how far you're guiding OpEx down, it feels to me like you're guiding gross margins implicitly flat to up in Q4, in a quarter where revenues are down, and typically your gross margins would be down in Q4 as well. So if you could give us any sort of feeling for what the gross margin drivers for next quarter ought to be in terms of mix offsetting revenue declines, that would be very helpful.",148

I think that clearly, the extra revenue came through and it was quite rich. We also had a slightly better mix of overall products that were shipped in the quarter. So that combined gave us that new record gross profit margin of 58.4%. As we look in the fourth quarter, I would not characterize our guidance as suggesting that margins go up. We will be reducing loading some of the fourth quarter on a seasonal basis, and so you can expect that margins will be down a bit, not very much, but down just a little bit. So depending on how you're building your model there, I wouldn't assume margins increasing in the fourth quarter.",117

Your best way to analyze that, just go and take a look at what happened from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of the most recent year, coming out of 2013, 2012. We do have seasonal increases in OpEx as we go from fourth to first, typically because of an absence of vacations that we have in fourth and the partial implementation of our annual pay and benefit increases that occur in first. So they will -- you should expect those to be up, and you can take a look at, again, this past year to get a rough idea as to about how much that increases by in percentage terms.",131

The company has done a very good job of looking forward and being proactive, taking action to either prune lower-margin revenue streams such as Wireless, or identifying opportunities for cost savings such as the optimization program this year. As you look ahead, how much further room is there for similar such optimization efforts? Are we really at a point where the TI model is getting very close to being optimized?",80

I think perhaps one of the areas least appreciated as people look at TI on a go-forward basis is the impact that continued delta revenue on 300-millimeter Analog is going to have for us. The cost structure to build on 300-millimeter is very attractive. And so incremental revenue going forward on 300-millimeter, we expect to produce not only higher margins but also higher levels of total cash on that delta revenue.",115

We do that on an ongoing basis. That's one of the ways that we're able to keep the lead time for the overwhelming majority of our parts to 6 weeks or less, because, that in fact, we build to stock, not necessarily build to order, meaning we maintain a stock of inventory such that we can always have short lead times for our customers. So from a strategic standpoint, that is done. It does have a little bit of ebb and flow. As you pointed out, we will have lower modems [ph] in certain quarters to give us a chance to build up on a few extra parts on that. But I don't think there's a whole lot of opportunity to do that just to impact the gross margins. I think we're really doing that to impact customer service.",141

And I'd also add, Stephen, that if you take the combined way that we're managing inventory now -- and we're being very intentional with specific targeted programs, depending on how quickly that inventory turns -- but you take that plus the open capacity that we've got and the combination of those 2 things, and we've really been able to execute at very high levels and deliver our products on time to customers. And so we think not only having low lead times but also delivering product when you make a commitment to a customer, a combination of those things are what customers would like to have.

But we're not really talking about those anymore. And the reason is really kind of straightforward. We found that analysts and some investors were drawing the conclusion that because we had underutilization, that increasing our utilization will be the maximum amount by which we can increase our overall profitability if we put revenue into those factories, and that's really an incomplete answer. I'll remind you that our stated strategy is to invest in our capacity ahead of demand, by definition. That means we will have open capacity and underutilization costs. Our purpose, though, for buying ahead of demand is to purchase that capacity with as little cash as possible. So the underutilization charge is mostly a noncash charge, and it tends to miss the point that our objective is to be maximizing free cash flow. So for that reason, you haven't really heard us commenting on or quantifying underutilization charges these past few quarters, and unlikely to in the future unless there's some material change that causes a better understanding of what's going on.",186

And I was wondering if you could give us some more color around what percentage of your starts are moving to that fab. And more importantly, what that implies for gross margins? For example, in the past, you have mentioned about 75% fall-through on gross margin. So as you increase the loading on 300-millimeter, what does that do to that number over the next several quarters or years?",82
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889644.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,47,"Yes, Vivek. I don't know if I'm prepared to give you a detailed quantification of that nature. What I would just say is that we talked in the past about, just from the geometries alone, that the chip cost itself was about 30% lower on 300-millimeter than it is on 200-millimeter. Not to mention that you also get better yield results and so on, so you get a number of different benefits. So what we're seeing happening is proportionately more and more new products that we're releasing are being released on to 300-millimeter, which means as we look out over the next year, 2, 3 or 4 years, more and more of our revenue will be sourced off of 300-millimeter, which inherently means it's got lower cost, which should allow us to incrementally increase our gross margins as well as importantly, our free cash flow. Beyond that, I don't have any specifics I'll give you at this point in time, but I do want to introduce that concept to people because I think it's being underestimated as to how important that is to TI's continued progress.",186

The question is on the end-market mix. I believe you mentioned comps was stronger on year-on-year basis. I was wondering if you could just give us your end-market mix overall for Q3. And how do you see those trends playing out in Q4?",45
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889647.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,50,"Sure. Yes. So on a year-on-year basis, our revenue growth was due to comms equipment, Industrial and Automotive, as I mentioned before, each of which grew and contributed to that growth by about the same amount. Our enterprise systems was also up, while revenue in personal electronics declined due to legacy Wireless products. So if you can kind of go down one step in each side -- inside of each one of those, Industrial, we've got about a dozen sectors inside of Industrial. And as we've talked to different investors over the last few months and as we're traveling around, it becomes clear to us that our definition of Industrial probably isn't as well understood. And we've got -- years ago, we used to define it as what it wasn't, meaning it wasn't comms equipment or it wasn't Automotive or it wasn't other things. But now we've got very intentional definitions. So we've got about a dozen different sectors that make that up, so things like appliances and building automation and displays and point-of-sale products, factory automation, industrial transportation, medical and health care fitness, lighting, motor drives, power infrastructure, things like that. So very, very broad, but very specific. So when you look on a year-on-year basis, we had growth in nearly all of those sectors, with most of the sectors actually providing double-digit growth. It was actually led by medical and health care fitness and factory automation. But again, we saw that growth very broad-based. Automotive, we've got 5 sectors inside of that. And I'll also just point that those sectors are actually out on our website if people are interested. But we've got double-digit growth in all the sectors, but led by passive safety and infotainment. Comms equipment, as I mentioned, was up due to wireless infrastructure. Personal electronics was down due to legacy Wireless products. And if you take that out, we did see growth in PC and notebooks and mobile phones, and that was partially offset by some weakness that we saw in gaming. And then the enterprise systems, that's -- part of that is where our DLP products will sit. And that was up due to projectors. So I'll stop there. So thank you, Vivek.",370

I don't know if I'll speak for the industry, but I'll speak for TI and kind of go back to the comments I made earlier. As a result of us taking an approach whereby we intentionally invest in capacity before we need it, and therefore, always have more capacity than was needed for that quarter's business, it allows us to be able to build inventory in a much more thoughtful fashion than we had in the past. The consequence of that has been that not only have we been able to maintain lead times for the preponderance of our products at 6 weeks or less for several years now, we've also been able to maintain a very high level of on-time delivery to our customers against those lead times. So when you put that together, what you've really got for TI is just a different way whereby we are managing our manufacturing footprint and how we utilize that manufacturing footprint for purposes of managing the inventory. As it relates to double ordering, again, one of the biggest things that tends to be evident when double ordering begins to pop up is you start seeing cancellations or reschedulings beginning to ramp up. We do not see that and we have not seen that for some time now. So I think the strategy whereby we have capacity ahead of demand, and we use that thoughtfully to make sure that we can maintain relatively low lead times, is serving well to satisfy our customers, at least as it relates to demand for our products.",263

And the follow-up is actually on that topic about the lead times. I think earlier in the script, you said you're delivering -- you're focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. And then I think you said -- you followed that up with saying we're keeping lead times consistently low. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile when you say delivering higher levels of customer service, are you -- do you think that you have -- your lead times over maybe a longer period time have come in, that they're just structurally shorter? Or are you just delivering them more consistently at a shorter time? So I just had to reconcile when you said what is the higher level of customer service, what is the improvement then?",136

I think it's a really good question. So when we refer to that, we look at what -- we look at a bunch of different customer service metrics. One is just how many line items are we shipping on time. And we've had some very intentional initiatives that have been set up to be able to ensure that, that is a good solid number. And we're taking advantage of both the capacity and our inventory to ensure that we're consistently delivering on time. And so that's one of the metrics that we look at, and that's what we mean by customer service. It's not really changing those lead times, but keeping them stable and then delivering products when we say that we'll deliver them. So it's really the combination of those 2 things.

The guidance actually -- we're up a little bit from guidance, not a huge amount. But really, what we had was a little bit more revenue come through. But importantly, we also have a slightly better mix of product that we ship to our customer. And so combined, that gave us a slightly higher gross margin than previously expected. And then on a go-forward basis, again, that mix continues to be in our favor as we go forward. And so consequently, as we look in the fourth quarter, our margins will continue to be quite strong. And importantly, because of the rather unique situation that we have with 300-millimeter Analog manufacturing capacity, we have significant opportunity to continue to drive not just improved margins, but importantly, improved cash flow. Again, I'll remind you some of the things that we're doing. We've got 300-millimeter Analog. I do want to make that point, if I haven't yet. We've got a lot more of our revenue coming from catalog parts, which inherently tend to have more attractive margin characteristics. We have increasing portions of our revenue coming from Industrial and Automotive spaces, and those 3 concepts are pretty important. Catalog parts, Industrial, Automotive tend to have very nice, long revenue streams, which means we have plenty of time to figure out and maximize our cost efficiency from a production standpoint and maximize our revenue and cash flow off that. Now we've got increasing customer diversity, so our dependence on any one customer and, therefore, the risk to our loadings or our cash flow generation are diminished. And perhaps also very importantly, we have a sales force that we estimate to be 3 to 4x larger than our nearest competitors, and those folks have become increasingly productive. And so we're beginning to get a lot more revenue per sales person, which means we can grow revenue without having to grow OpEx as fast as revenue is growing. So those things combined not only will help our margins, but will also definitely help our cash flow.",343

I think it's always hard to tell in any one particular quarter that you're picking up share. But I think when you look back over a year, you can see that trend. So we believe in our numbers.

On a sequential basis -- well, let me just finish year-on-year. If you look beyond that, calculators as well as the custom ASIC business were up, and royalties were down just slightly. So sequentially, revenue was up due to growth in calculators and DLPs. Royalties were flat and custom ASIC was down a little bit. So I'd say that all those businesses are performing well. And if you look at DLP, they're typically stronger in the back half of the year, in the third quarter, but I would say that, that business is just executing well. When we look at that business longer term, I'd describe that it's got several wildcard growth opportunities. If you look at most of the business today, it will be centered up in the front projectors that you'll typically see in offices and schools and government buildings. And it also has a solid cinema business. But from a broader standpoint, it's got some opportunities inside of Automotive as well as some embedded opportunities there as well.",204

Kevin, you were helpful in giving us some bounds around the OpEx and looking at prior years and how things have dropped seasonally due to vacations, et cetera, in both the fourth and then the first quarter going the other direction. Can you give us a little bit of a harder number on what that typical percentage change is quarter-to-quarter? Looking back in the past, you guys have had a number of restructuring programs that make it a little bit difficult to parse out what's seasonality and what is restructuring driven in both the fourth and the first quarter.",101

So we hadn't even begun the activities yet inside the first quarter. So the underlying cost in there is fairly clean from a comparative standpoint between fourth and first, so I'd use that as your figure of merit for trying to figure out where we'll go in 2015.",99

You guys have been, in the past, very acquisitive, so much so that you really rebuilt your whole business model through acquisitions. Can you maybe talk about your appetite to maybe add some debt onto your already leveraged balance sheet? And what it would take for you to look at another significant deal?",63
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889670.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,73,"Okay, Doug. It sounds like maybe there's 2 ideas in your question there, one on M&A and one on debt. Clearly, on the M&A front, as you pointed out, we have been quite willing to take on M&A activities when it makes sense. And our definition of what makes sense is, first, it has to be a strategic fit, meaning that it really has to make sense for where we want to take the company. As we look at potential M&A in the future, it's mostly likely to be biased towards Analog and probably towards items with catalog parts or that service the Industrial or Automotive spaces. There may be others, but those are the most likely areas that we would look at. If it turns out that it checks off that strategic fit standpoint, then of course, we have to a look at the numbers and make sure that the price that we would pay -- what I mean by that is not necessarily what its market cap is but the market we probably have to pay on top of that, that, that total cost would be accretive to our WACC, or weighted average cost of capital, in a 3- to 4-year time frame. So there's several tests that we go through when we make a determination on acquisition. As it relates to debt, as you know, we have taken on debt to support acquisitions in the past. We think having the balance sheet available to support those kind of strategic initiatives are important and a worthwhile thing for us to maintain for maximum flexibility as we move forward. And so as we look out in time, I know even if you look at the last couple of years, while we have been issuing new debt, we've also been retiring older debt and retiring a little bit faster than what we've been issuing so that we're taking our total debt levels down. And that's having the result of generally slowly opening the balance sheet back up to make itself available for any other opportunity that might present itself at some point in the future. So that's how we're looking at M&A and that's how debt kind of rolls inside that look.",372

I guess if I could, can you guys -- pretty much along the same ideas on the balance sheet and how you look at cash returned. I might have missed it. Did you happen to give out the share price at which you bought back shares this quarter? And would you moderate going forward? Given the share price pullback that we just saw, how we should think about share count going forward?",73
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889673.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,76,"Let's see. We bought back $670 million worth of shares this quarter, total of 14.1 million shares. So that's an average price of about $47.62. I would point out that over the last -- since the end of 2004, beginning of 2005, we've reduced our total share count by 39%. The average price of those shares that we bought over that time, I believe, are about $30.62, give or take. When we look to buy back shares, as we've talked about in the past, when the intrinsic value, we believe, is higher than what the market value is, then it makes sense to buy back on a steady, if you will, dollar cost averaging kind of basis. That's what we've done for many years, and that's what you've seen us do here recently. In fact, the recent pullback in price is just allowing us to buy back a few more of shares with the same number of dollars. So that's kind of a round-the-world look at the share repurchase, if you will. I hope that answers your question on that, Doug.",182

Kevin, can talk a little bit about where that number is now and where you see it going over the next couple of years?",51

In each period that goes by, it's proportionately more. But I think that we'll hold a while longer till we can give a more comprehensive look and a better understanding for everybody on how to think about that 300 going forward. I just do think that it's, again, at the highest level, it's a fairly straightforward computation. 30% lower die cost, which means about 15% lower total chip -- total IC cost. And as we get proportionally more revenue going on there, that will just incrementally benefit our margins and our cash flows as we go forward in time. And that is something I've become aware of when talking to investors in the last couple of quarters that is underappreciated on what's going on inside the portfolio itself.",150

I appreciate it. And as my follow-up, another comment that was made earlier was about, I think, the relative strength of Analog versus the Embedded segment this quarter. And I think there was a comment about end markets, the end-market mix helping. I'm wondering if you can clarify that. Maybe help us understand a little bit better. I know Analog is very diversified relative to Embedded, but maybe talk about if there were maybe some end markets that were a little bit challenging that affected the Embedded segment a bit more.",94
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889679.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,82,"Yes. I think if I look at embedded, it'll have a high exposure to really 3 different markets: it's communications equipment, Industrial and Automotive. And like you said, our Analog business has a much broader exposure, including exposure to personal electronics. It has, obviously, good exposure to industrial and automotive as well. But it's really those types of differences that will explain that performance. If you look at Embedded Processing and you look back at the growth rates between the 2 businesses, you'll note that oftentimes they will grow at different rates. But if you look over an 8 -- that 8-quarter period that Embedded Processing has been growing year-over-year, the growth rate for both of those businesses are essentially exactly the same. So it kind of works out that way over a longer period of time. So thank you, Will.",141

Q4 is obviously a seasonally down quarter anyway, so it's hard to get a read on what's going on. But as we sort of -- or as you talk to your customers and we compare now, let's say, versus 12 months ago, would you classify the forecasting environment as better, weaker or about the same?",65

I wouldn't classify it as better or weaker. I'd say it's about the same in that, again, we have had the same lead times for several years, and customers are ordering consistent with that, generally speaking. We get some of these expedited from time to time because they've under-ordered or have a surprise event on their end, but that was true a year ago and probably true today. And we continue to see customers manage their inventories of our products, I'd say, very lean. As was mentioned earlier, in the distribution channel we're at all-time lows of 4.5 weeks of inventory. That's the same last quarter and this quarter. That's very low. From a customer standpoint, we see them, again, order in lead time and consistent ordering patterns, so that tells us they're order -- they're keeping their inventories very low. So I think overall, I'd probably characterize it as relatively the same kind of customer demeanor today as what we saw a year ago.",176

My follow-up question, Dave, if I have one. So your Analog growth, 10% year-over-year, is that sort of the goal internally to continue to grow the Analog business 10% every year? Or was there anything unusual here in the last 12 months that kept that growth rate so high?",53
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2014",2014-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3635.0,1759210.0,68889684.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,87,"Well, I would say that internally, we have very aggressive goals to grow the businesses. And I've just described that as we want to outgrow the market significantly in Analog. So we've got all the business units that are focused up on that. We do look at the performance of the product lines every quarter. And we really look at a 3-year compounded annual growth rate and stack that up against all the other businesses, both inside of TI as well as our competitors externally. And that's how we measure it. So again, as I said earlier, that 10% we believe would represent some share gains, but I'd be really cautious to look at any 1 quarter and draw the conclusion or try to dice out what percentage of that growth would be from share gains. So, okay. Thank you, Tore.",141

Our inventories, really from a day standpoint, had remained unchanged at, what I would just describe, historically low levels at just a little over 4, 4.5 weeks. Again, that number is low because of the consignment programs that we've put in place. Beyond our distributors and then to our customers, we do have a good percentage of our revenues on consignment overall. And in fact, if you combine what we ship through distribution as well as what we ship to OEMs on consignment, that represents about 50% or about half of our revenues where we actually -- there is no inventory sitting in front of us in that manufacturing line for those inventories. So we know that inventory number and it's 0. So we have very good visibility into that portion. And we do have a balance of the business. It's kind of the classic -- I'll describe it as a book-ship-type business, where they give us an order, it goes onto a backlog and we ship it at lead time.
And there, we haven't seen any reports of large inventory pockets from customers. We're going through and racking up this quarter's results, and we'll see what happens on that front. But we're not aware of any big pockets that are downstream. 
So, okay, well thank you very much, C.J., for your question. Thank you all for joining us today. And a replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.",245
