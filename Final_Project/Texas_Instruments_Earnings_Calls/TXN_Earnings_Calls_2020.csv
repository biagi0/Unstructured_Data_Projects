140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2020",2020-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2240.0,1893310.0,74139788.0,Presenter Speech,Dave Pahl,,Executives,1,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management strategy on February 4 at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter; second, I'll provide some comments about what we're seeing with added insight by segment and end market and explain why we would characterize the market as showing signs of stabilizing; and finally, since this is the end of the calendar year, I'll provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2019. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook, after which we'll open the call for Q&A.
Starting with a high-level summary of the fourth quarter financial results. Revenue was $3.35 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago, and EPS was $1.12 per share, including a $0.01 benefit not in our original guidance. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance with the relative strength across all markets.
At the company level, our year-on-year decline abated slightly from 11% in the third quarter to 10% in the fourth quarter. While this is only a marginal improvement, all end markets reduced the rate of decline substantially with the exception of communications equipment where the year-over-year decline increased about as expected given the strength in this end market in the year ago quarter.
In fourth quarter 2019, Analog revenue declined 5% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Analog's year-on-year rate of decline went from 8% in the third quarter to 5% in the fourth quarter, and Embedded's decline slightly increased from 19% to 20% over the same period.
When we look at the market, since 90 days ago, we moved from the third quarter where customers were increasingly cautious to the fourth quarter where results and behavior throughout the quarter reflected what we believe is best described as demand stabilizing. Based on history, this would imply that customer and channel inventory that built up during 2017 and '18 would now mostly be depleted. This suggests that demand this year will be more a function of our customers' end demand and, therefore, the macro economy, which may continue to be uncertain.
Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the fourth quarter by segment and end market. From the year ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 5% due to declines in Signal Chain, High Volume and Power. Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% from the year ago quarter primarily due to Processors, Connected Microcontrollers also declined. Our Other segment declined 24% from the year ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog declined 5% and Embedded declined 17%. Analog and Embedded combined were 92% of revenue.
From an end market perspective, in the fourth quarter, all markets declined year-on-year 3% to 4%, with the exception of communications equipment. Communications equipment declined about 50% from the year ago quarter, about as expected as all major customers, geographies and technologies declined.
Next, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2019. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 36%; automotive, 21%; personal electronics, 23%; communications equipment, 11%; enterprise systems 6%; and other was 3%.
Looking at the changes versus 2018, automotive increased by 1 percentage point, enterprise systems decreased by 1 percentage point and the remaining markets were unchanged. In 2019, industrial and automotive combined made up 57% of TI's revenue, up 1 percentage point from last year and up from 42% in 2013. We've established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead.
Next, one of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity, which can be measured in multiple dimensions. From a diversity perspective, we have over 100,000 customers and tens of thousands of devices. In 2019, almost 2/3 of our revenue came from customers who bought $100 million or less of our products. In 2019, our top 10 devices represented about 5% of our revenue, and the top 100th device was less than 0.1% of our revenue. From a longevity perspective, over 40% of our revenue came from devices that we've been producing for at least 10 years. Our investments are directed to continue to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage.
Next, we are announcing today that we will be closing our last 2 6-inch or 150-millimeter wafer fabs, which are both more than 50 years old. This will be a multiyear plan and is expected to be completed no earlier than 2023 and no later than 2025. There are no charges in this quarter's results, and we'll keep you updated as needed in the future.
Separately, our plans to build our next 300-millimeter factory in Richardson, Texas, are underway with dirt moving and cranes on site. We expect the building shell to be complete by the end of 2021 and ready to install tools when needed to meet market demand, which will allow us to continue to support growth and strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage.
So to wrap up, we remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products. We remain focused on the industrial and automotive markets, the best markets since they'll be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",1109
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2020",2020-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2240.0,1893310.0,74139789.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 220 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $798 million, down 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue.
For the year, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We're pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term.
Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $50 million. Acquisition charges will remain at about $50 million through the third quarter of 2021.
Operating profit was $1.2 billion or 37% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42%, down from 47% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing was 25%, down from 30% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.
Other income and -- net income in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.12 per share, which included a $0.01 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $163 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.8 billion, down 4% from a year ago.
In the quarter, we paid $841 million in dividends, an increase of 17% per share, marking our 16th year of dividend increases. We repurchased $489 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.3 billion. In total, we have returned $6 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the same period, our dividends represented 52% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%.
Inventory days were 144, down 8 days from a year ago and up 5 days sequentially. We are pleased with our inventory, and it is positioned to support growth.
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2019, cash flow from operations was $6.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $847 million or 6% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2019 was $5.8 billion or 40% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to owners.
Over the last 12 months, we paid $3 billion in dividends and purchased $3 billion of our own shares, reducing outstanding share count by 1.4% in 2019 and by 46% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.14, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our 2020 annual operating tax rate to be above 15%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages with our manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",754

I guess, Dave and Rafael, just relative to the March quarter guidance, at the midpoint, you're guiding down about 3% sequentially, which is in line with kind of historic seasonality for the March quarter. But typically, off the bottom of the cycle, you can get some above seasonal. And at the midpoint, the year-over-year is just modestly getting better from December to March. So I'm just wondering what -- if there's anything specific in the March quarter as to why it's not a little bit better than seasonal, and specifically, anything around distribution strategy that might be a headwind in Q1. And then I have a follow-up.",112

I think -- so to answer the last part of that question, there's nothing in the sequential guidance that would suggest there's any headwinds from distribution. We've talked about before that we would expect as we make the transition in distribution, it will look similar from a revenue headwind as we've seen with consignment. So there will be some there, but we've already got some of the headwinds from the transitions that we've made in consignment.
And I think the second part is as we're seeing those signs of stabilization, and we talked about that history would suggest that the growth is going to reflect the end demand of the customers and, therefore, the macro economy. So as we go through the year, that's what will be the driving force overall.",143

The only other thing I would add is, as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks, our comms equipment was down year-on-year significantly as there was a tough compare a year ago. Well, 1Q '20 is going to have an even tougher compare on comms equipment, if you recall what was going on in 1Q '19 on that front.",59

And then my second question is just around the Embedded business. I know that the SIA MCU data is not necessarily the best proxy for that business. But when you kind of compare your results to that data, up until this most recent correction, you guys were sort of consistently outgrowing the SIA MCU data. Your Embedded business has now gone through 5 or 6 quarters of kind of undergrowing. And I'm just wondering if you could help us talk through maybe a potential share loss. And I know you talked about CPU specifically being weak within Embedded. Is that specific to an end market like comms? Or how do we think about that?",115

So first, John, I think you're putting in a good context. And as you've stated, we believe share changes just need to be judged over long periods of time. And so if you look at the revenue performance of Embedded over the last several years, we've had that significant outperformance, as you pointed out, in '17 and '18. Last year, we probably gave some of that back. So I'd just point out that in the most recent quarter, at the TI level, so Analog and Embedded, we saw that -- those signs of stabilization but -- in every market, so behaving similarly except communications equipment. So thank you, John.",110

Dave, I know you said it was pretty broad-based on how you upsided the fourth quarter of last year. But can you give us what the sequential changes were by the end markets? I know you give the year-over-years typically, but if you could give that for the fourth quarter, that would be helpful.",66

So these are all sequential compares. Industrial declined mid-single digits. Automotive was about even. Personal electronics declined high single digits. Comms equipment declined about 20%.

I just wanted to think about the -- you talked about shutting down the 2 6-inch fabs. You told us about starting up the 300-millimeter. So maybe a 2-parter, if I may. Can you talk about the utilization plans in the first quarter? And how do we think about CapEx? I know you said you're moving dirt and you have cranes there, but out of that $600 million or $700 million cost that you said for the new 300-millimeter fab, how does that fold in, in 2020?",88

So Ross, you asked a bunch of questions there. Let me try. I'll answer the ones I remember. So first, let me emphasize, yes, we're closing 2 -- our 2 fabs that still have some 150-millimeter equipment. And they're over 50 years old, and they'll be closed by as early as 2023 or as late as 2025, somewhere in that time frame. We have about $1.5 billion of revenue that run through those factories. And of course, we're moving most of that revenue, virtually all, to 300-millimeter, saw a significant cost advantage, as we have talked about over the years.
The new factory, so let me talk about the new factory. Yes, we've got dirt moving, cranes are there, plans are underway. We should have the building finished by the end of 2021. And at that point, we can put equipment as needed to support demand. From a CapEx standpoint, you want to model that at 6% of revenue. We just finished 2019 with CapEx at 6% of revenue, and you should model that going forward at about that same level.",182

So now that we've kind of gone through this dip and recovery, maybe just talk about why you think your sales and bookings fell off so sharply in late summer. And then what's -- why are the customers a little more, I guess, a little more optimistic right now? And then do you feel better about your business now versus, let's call it, 6 months ago over the summer?",83

Well, I'll start off, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. I think as we go through any cycle, they're all similar in a lot of ways and different in others. And to put it in context, you'd have to go back to third quarter of '18. Running up to that, we had 10 quarters of year-on-year growth. So you never know as you're going through that are -- you're going to have 10 or 12 or 14 quarters of year-on-year growth, but you expect at some point that the industry would run below. And so as we started that, we thought we were -- what we were seeing was mostly an inventory -- industry, rather, correction as we're working through that. Certainly, trade tensions probably elongated that cycle and part of the reasons why we saw that other leg down later last year.
And so -- and can you remind me the second part -- or do we feel better about the business. I think that strategically, we felt that we continue to stay focused on improving our 4 competitive advantages. We haven't slowed down investments, and we talk about our fabs underway. If you look at the OpEx investments that we have made, those have stayed steady, focused on areas of diversifying our growth in industrial and automotive. So I think we feel just as good today as we did about the business. The cycles will come and go.",243

I'd just add, as Dave mentioned, strategically, we are well positioned, have been, that doesn't -- hasn't changed. So we continue to feel as good as ever on that front. And then operationally, we just -- we've got to be ready for whatever the market throws at us. So if this was -- is going to last longer, we've got to be ready for that, if things are going to head south, but we also got to be ready if things turn around, and then we're going to start seeing year-on-year growth.

So what are you guys thinking about? What should we be thinking about sort of the long-term goals or aspirations for the Embedded business just in terms of relative revenue growth or profits?

Yes. So Huawei last year was 3% to 4% of our revenue. That's really unchanged from what it was the prior year. And I think if you look at comms equipment overall, if you'll just look at the shape of the growth curve, you had the year kind of balanced with strong growth in the first part and followed by very weak growth in the second half. So the way that it's behaving, I don't think is -- well, it isn't a surprise to us. As we were going through that very strong growth, we tried to remind everyone at the time that, that market is a market that's just choppy. And it's that way primarily in early phases of technology deployment. I think longer term, as we've talked about on our capital management presentation, we don't believe that, that will be a growth driver for us or for the industry, and that's just based on the number of subscribers that are out in the market and what the capital spending by operators will be longer term. So we really think that growth in our industry will be driven by industrial and automotive, and hence, why we've biased our investments into those areas.
Do you have a follow-on?",209

And sort of related to that, Dave, it was encouraging to see R&D intensity or R&D as a percentage of sales pick up in 2019 versus 2018. And we had felt like R&D was in decline for a number of years, so it was good to see that pick up. Can you remind us which product areas, technologies, end markets that you guys are focused on? I realize it's going to be industrial and automotive, but if you can give a little bit more color within those 2 end markets, that would be helpful.",96

From a product standpoint is -- it's Embedded and Analog. But of course, inside of that, there's a bunch of pieces. So I'll mention a few. But I mean, at the highest level is -- in the case of Analog is Signal Chain and Power. Those are by far the biggest areas. But -- and underneath that, there's just a bunch of things. There's the -- within Power, there's all kinds of power categories and then within Signal Chain. But Dave, do you want to add something?",105

I'll just say when we think of allocating capital to R&D, there's really 3 major buckets. And the largest bucket is -- goes directly to product -- creation of new products. We release 300 to 400 new products a year. The other 2 is kind of a shared, centralized R&D function that develops our process technologies, packaging, tools that our engineers use like SPICE models and those types of things. And then the third category is the Kilby Labs where longer term, higher risk investments are made, new materials, new markets and those types of things. So that's where the R&D has been directed.
I described R&D last year as steady and stable. And I think that even in a down market, keeping those investments stable, keeping focused on -- in investing in our 4 competitive advantages is really important overall. So thank you, Toshi.",146

Both these businesses, industrials and autos and specifically, industrials, I forget, but I think there's 12, 13 subsegments. So when you talk about stabilization, I'm assuming -- well, you never had any channel inventory buildup. Your channel inventory was pretty normal through the cycle and your lead times never extended out. So can you just help us understand a little bit what's the source of stabilization? Is it -- it can't be the channel. So it's the end customer, but then you have thousands of end customers. So what's the right way to think to get comfort that you are seeing stabilization in that business specifically?",116
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2020",2020-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2240.0,1893310.0,74139826.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,39,"Well, Ambrish, yes, so it's reflected in the -- stabilization is reflected in the order patterns, the demands that we see through consignment and actually the results themselves. So we went from third quarter where those markets were declining high single digits, 8%, 9%, some of them at 10%, to where all those markets were declining at 3%, 4%. So in those numbers, it suggests that there's a bottoming process.
And even though we're holding -- in consignment programs, we're holding that inventory on our balance sheet, certainly, our customers have inventory of their products and then they have inventories that are down their channels. So just as the bullwhip effect would suggest that you have a small change in end demand as that moves its way back, that magnifies. So we can see the results of that beginning to abate. Do you have a follow-on?",146

Free cash flow margins. So you guys have powered through the 25%, 35% range you had given a couple of years ago. And you just had 40% in revenues down, not getting the math right, but somewhere in the high single digit, and free cash flow is down 4%. So would it be fair to assume that the targets should be moved up when we hear you talk about capital allocation in a couple of weeks from now?",80

So thanks for the Q on that. So we do have the capital management call coming on February 4. So I expect all of you to sign up for that and join us there. And we will talk about the various objectives there. But I'll give you a preview. We're not changing those objectives and specifically, that one that you talked about, we're not. And the reason for that, yes, we just finished a 40% free cash flow as a percent of revenue, but the focus is not that percent, right? The way we maximize value for the owners of the company is growing their free cash flow per share for a long time to come. So we focus on that, and that's how we drive value.",132

Now just for those that aren't as familiar with us, I'll just remind everyone or just point out that 2/3 of our revenues are supported by consignment where we actually don't carry backlog but we do get demand forecast. And most of the time, that's at least 6 months of demand that we can see. So -- and then there's no inventory. As Ambrish was pointing out in his earlier call, there's no inventory between us and those manufacturing lines for those customers.
So that's actually the strongest signal that we will get when we're looking at future demand. But certainly, the backlog pays -- plays a part of that. So I'd just say that, in general, that is consistent with the outlook that we have. And our lead times haven't changed -- it hasn't really changed at all. So they have remained stable. So that allows customers to have confidence that they can get product when they need it. So do you have a follow-on?",168

Given the likelihood of a significant economic recession due to COVID-19, we're changing the format for this quarter's earnings call. In addition to Rafael Lizardi, our CFO, we will be joined by Rich Templeton, our Chairman and CEO. Rich will be covering a broader frame of how we're approaching the current environment. I will then provide the summary of first quarter, and Rafael will wrap up with the financial details of first quarter and our outlook for second quarter. Our prepared remarks will be longer than usual as we hope to cover a range of anticipated questions.

At the highest level, to understand how we will approach the likely significant recession resulting from COVID-19, I remind you of the 3 ambitions that, for decades, have driven all decisions inside of TI. These ambitions are: First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades; we -- second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever-changing; and third, we will be a company that you are proud to be part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. When we pursue these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. These guiding ambitions have served us well for decades, but they are enormously valuable at these times because they help simplify many decisions in an uncertain environment.  
Like many companies in the COVID-19 crisis, we have acted aggressively, keeping our people safe and able to support their families. We have kept our operations running to support our customers with special emphasis on our medical customers. And in the communities where we operate around the world, we have provided direct financial support and medical supplies to provide some relief. The list of actions is lengthy.
So starting with the economic framework. No two economic recessions are identical, but the 2008 financial crisis provides us the most recent significant recession, and therefore, is the best example to study and inform decisions on operating plans, revenue forecasts and investment and spending plans. As a reminder, if you look back to 2008, and specifically to September of 2008, our new orders turned off overnight. This led to a 26% sequential drop of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008, an additional 16% sequential decline in the first quarter of 2009 and then a rapid snapback for the next 6 quarters. By the second quarter of 2010, or within 2 years of the start of the sharp decline, revenue moved back above the level of the third quarter of 2008.
With the benefit of hindsight, our customers overcorrected for the downside, and we then spent 1.5 years chasing backup to support demand. With this in mind, we are not trying to predict this economic recession and recovery. But instead, we want to ensure that we have the highest degree of optionality so that we can deal successfully with any outcome.  
Therefore, regarding our operating plan. Looking at the pattern from pre- and post-2008 in the second quarter of 2020 and quite likely the third quarter of 2020, we will be running our factories at about the level they ran in the first quarter 2020. This will likely result in an increase in inventory during the second quarter, but this will be important to support our customers during a time when they have limited ability to forecast. Our product portfolio of primarily long-lived products, makes this an easy decision and maximizes our optionality.
Regarding second quarter revenue guidance, Rafael will elaborate in a minute, but with reduced visibility of customer demand, we have used the historical transitions that I mentioned from 2008 and adjusted for seasonality. We are not implying precision, but explaining the assumptions. We are using an expanded range to account for the current uncertainty.  
Regarding spending and investments. First, research and development spending will be essentially unchanged as these are 5- to 10-year time horizon decisions. We will continue to make ongoing portfolio adjustments but these are unlikely to make meaningful changes to investment levels.  
On SG&A, we will maintain critical investments in new capabilities, such as strengthening ti.com, because these are important times to gain ground. Where we can minimize expense, we are, and we are -- we will certainly continue to do so. On capital spending, our plans are generally unchanged because the bulk of capital spending is driven by road map capacity needs in the 2022 to 2025 time frame. We will continue with previously announced construction plans that are underway for the next-generation 300-millimeter analog wafer fab in Richardson, Texas.  
Lastly, regarding how we are operating in the current environment, we were fortunately prepared for the unforeseen disruptions that COVID-19 has presented. We updated our customers in late March that our lead times remain short and unchanged and that we could respond to short-term demand. This is because we invested in inventory, had a robust business continuity plan and invested in a geographically diverse internal manufacturing footprint. 
Our manufacturing teams are operating throughout the world, including countries like Malaysia and the Philippines, where local restrictions have resulted in partial operations.
We've adopted protocols quickly to keep our people safe and minimize any disruptions.  
Our team was prepared and is comfortable getting our work done remotely. We continue to actively work new design wins with customers via virtual selling processes that we instituted several years ago. On most days across TI, we are averaging a peak of 10,000 VPN connections and 2 million meeting minutes per day, about 4x higher than normal. We all look forward to things getting back to normal, but in the meantime, we are focused on execution.
Let me hand things back to Dave.",852

I'll provide a standard comment of first quarter revenue by end market and then I'll add some additional insight about the quarter in light of COVID-19.  
First, for highlights on first quarter revenue by end market versus a year ago. Industrial increased mid-single digits from a year-on-year ago quarter and improved compared to fourth quarter. Automotive declined mid-single digits and decelerated in the quarter as our customers' factory shutdowns impacted demand. Personal electronics declined mid-single digits, but by sector was a mixed bag. Mobile phones declined low double digits, while by contrast, PCs increased low double digits.  
Communications equipment declined about 50% as expected, due to a comparison against a very strong first quarter 2019. Communications was up sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems increased double digits on strong data center demand.  
For additional insight, the first quarter ran as expected into Chinese New Year, but was slow coming out of the holiday as Chinese factories struggled to come back due to COVID-19. In early March, we saw a pickup in orders from most markets as supply chain disruptions led to increased customer concerns about being able to secure supply. This increase in demand that we experienced in March had continued into early April, with the exception of Automotive, as manufacturers' plant closures reduced consumption. 
This increase in orders has steadily abated in April, but returned to levels we saw in early March. The midpoint of our range assumes that this decline continues through the quarter as customers have reduced visibility to end demand.  
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",265
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",2020-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3666.0,2015182.0,78838744.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue was $3.3 billion, down 7% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion, or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 20 basis points.  
Operating expenses in the quarter were $794 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D.  
Operating profit was $1.2 billion or 37% of revenue. Operating profit was down 10% from the year ago quarter.  
Net income in the first quarter was $1.2 billion or $1.24 per share, which included a $0.10 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook as we have discussed.  
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $851 million in the quarter. As a reminder, first quarter is typically the seasonally low point for cash flow from operations due to payout of profit sharing and bonuses.
Capital expenditures were $161 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.6 billion. In the quarter, we paid $841 million in dividends and repurchased $1.6 billion of our stock for a total return to owners of $2.5 billion. In total, we have returned $6.6 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 55% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $4.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In the quarter, we issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 1.375% due in 5 years. This resulted in total debt of $6.6 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.81%. Since then, we have repaid $500 million of debt during second quarter and we have no further debt due this year. We have $550 million of debt due in 2021.  
Regarding inventory. TI inventory dollars were flat to fourth quarter and days were 145. Distribution-owned inventory declined again in first quarter by about $50 million, the sixth consecutive quarter of planned reductions, as we continue the transition of our channel to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. We had about 4 weeks of distribution inventory, the lowest since third quarter of 2017. Tactically and strategically, we're very pleased. We have steadily decreased total inventory dollars while increasing the percent of inventory concentrated inside TI and, therefore, in fewer places. 
This enables us to maintain short lead times and high availability, which is critically important in an environment where end demand visibility for our customers will be limited.  
With a recession likely upon us, as Rich mentioned earlier, we're using the 2008 financial crisis to inform our second quarter outlook. To reflect the increased uncertainty, we have also expanded the range.
For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.61 billion to $3.19 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $1.04.
Regarding our operating plan for running our factories, we expect that customers in this recession, similar to past recessions, will overcorrect in the short term as their visibility of their end demand drops. We believe it will be an important advantage to maintain consistent lead times and to offer customers high levels of product availability. 
Our product portfolio of mostly long-lived parts affords us to have a steady hand. Therefore, we will be running our factories in second quarter at approximately the same level we ran them in first quarter of 2020. TI inventory will likely grow during the second quarter, while distributor-owned inventory will likely drain.
In closing, we continue to invest in our competitive advantages and making our business stronger. History has shown us that this is -- that in times like this is when we can make the most strategic progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",684

But just a few weeks into Q2, have your orders or bookings played out the same way as they did during the financial crisis?

I'm just curious what you have actually seen so far in the quarter, so that we can get a better handle on the outlook that you're giving.",81

So let me -- I'll start, and Dave, you want to chime in on that. But as we said in the prepared remarks, April has, in fact, behaved very differently than 2008 in the comparison. March was -- not only April, but March. March was strong. 
Coming out of Chinese New Year, as we said in the prepared remarks, we came out a little slowly. But then things strengthened. And into April, although things have abated in the second half of April. But we think that is due to the concern that many customers have on supply disruption. So we -- our range, and particularly the midpoint of our range, implies an expectation that demand will drop as customers internalize better their -- the end demand, and frankly, they're going to have very low visibility. We expect them to have very low visibility of demand. That's why the important point here is that we're keeping high optionality throughout this process, so that if things snap back, we can support that. We can support it on the other side of this.

You mentioned that you're continuing to run your factory loadings in Q2 at the same level as Q1. I'm curious if you can give us some color around what youre modeling days of inventory to be exiting Q2. Is there a certain maximum limit to the amount of inventory or in terms of days or dollars that you're willing to build before you have to start taking actions?,69

Thanks for that question. So Vivek, just as you framed them, I'm glad you framed it that way. It is a capital allocation decision. So we are allocating capital in the form of inventory. Capital is going to go into inventory instead of going to other places. And the inventory will increase. We expect very likely to increase into second quarter. 
But that is -- that's what gives us the optionality that I mentioned earlier, having that inventory on hand. The key thing to remember, and you know it very well, we -- the vast majority of our products are long lived. They're highly diverse. They sell to many, many customers. They live a long time on the shelf and the customers' product life cycles are very long. So that inventory will not go bad. So it's an option. We are [ fairly low-cost ] upfront to have that option.",151

But if I look from Q3 '08 peak to Q1 '09 trough, revenues fell about 40%. This cycle's been longer, but I think maybe the peak was Q3 '18 to your guide in Q2 '20, you'd be down about 30%. Does that suggest that maybe there's still a little more to go for following the same kind of trajectory? And I guess also if the decline from peak to trough is longer, does that suggest that you might be thinking about the increase off the peak then also being longer?

Given the recollection of 2008, I'd be careful of too much precision in where you're trying to draw that to. I do think the valid comparison that -- and I think you know this very well from the history, is that 2008 was a reasonably -- 2007 and first half of 2008 were reasonably hot semiconductor markets. Not overheated, but pretty hot. And clearly, 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 were cooler compared to the heat of 2017 and '18. So when you try to get peak trough, that's a little more complex. We just tried to basically look through whatever we think demand was doing for a couple of years prior, and that was what helped inform and help set where we would put the operating plans.",133

For my follow-up, I know you generally don't have tons of visibility into what true end demand is doing. But do you have any way to gauge, just given the -- any way to gauge the amount of pull forward that we might be seeing right now, whether it's gauging the pace of rush orders or anything like that?

Stacy, as you imagine, I don't think we have any precision on that. I think that as we saw after Chinese New Year's, as we saw strength, we believe that, that was due to the customer concerns.

I agree. The only thing I would add is that we know is, the channel is clean, the discrete channel. Because as we said, we're 4 weeks, we drain about $50 million on that channel, and we plan to continue draining for the next 3 quarters or so, about another $200 million or so [ plan ] drain as we convert more and more customers to go indirect. So the channel, we know, is clean and will continue to be clean.

And I might add, too, that, as you know, Stacy,  65%, 70% of our revenue is on consignment. So we're not curing backlog, but we see plans that are in our customer's factories.

So as we said in the prepared remarks, in general, OpEx will be relatively unchanged. So R&D, those are long-term investments. SG&A, we also have some investments areas there with ti.com. In other places, we, quite frankly run the company pretty tight to begin with, but wherever we can tighten up more, we do.  
On your specific question on variable compensation, that tends to be profit sharing and bonus profit sharing moves according to our formula, so it's very formulaic. So depending on what happens, that adjusts. And bonuses is determined by the Board depending on relative performance on 1 to 3 years on several metrics.",107

You also laid out about how the pattern was a steep fall then a steep rise back. Given that you're behaving -- your actions are very different this time where you're keeping the utilization flat, et cetera, is that because you view this cycle as being any different, short duration matching the same one as a decade ago?

I think Rafael covered this in some ways. If you think back to 2008, and you know and a bunch of folks know, we were very much different. We had a large wireless business. We had portfolio reprofiling we had to do. We had a high percentage of our product that wasn't exactly custom, but it behaved a lot like custom. So building inventory was a much more difficult game. 
And the beauty about where we are today, as Rafael pointed out, is that high percentage of the portfolio is a long-lived product. We've got our R&D and our resources well deployed in the areas that we want to be long term. And that's what really puts us into the wonderful position, where the cost to have maximum optionality is actually pretty low in our particular case in 2020 versus where it was back in October of 2008.",154

And I guess as my follow-up, just switching over to the cash return side of the equation. It looks like you guys had the -- pretty much the second biggest buyback in a single quarter you've had in a decade. Can you just remind us on how you guys are thinking about the ability to return cash? I know your long-term policy of returning 100% of your free cash flow, and it's not just dictated by any single quarter. I appreciate that as well. But this was significantly above what you guys generated in a single quarter and maybe even in a couple of quarters of free cash flow. So just talk about how much leverage you're willing to put on the balance sheet to take advantage opportunistically of a pullback in your stock when it's below what, I guess, you view to be your intrinsic value?",148

So let me -- first, you alluded to it, but let me just remind everybody on the call that our objective, when it comes to cash return, is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company, and we do that through buybacks and dividends. So for example, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $5.6 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $6.6 billion. So obviously, all free cash flow there have been returned. 
And then you mentioned debt, and we have debt on the balance sheet. As we said on the call, $6.6 billion, we finished. On a net basis, it's $1.8 billion because we have $4.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. But we use debt to increase the rate of return with some leverage when it makes sense. So that's how we view the returns and the debt for many, many years, as we have talked about it on capital management.",161

John, if you think about it, and you can't even -- you've watched this for a long time. You can go back to 2008 and then look at what we did through 2009, '10, '11 and such. And clearly, if you think about capital allocation, the things that I stepped through, keeping on the right R&D investments, keeping on the right capital expenditures, making the right capability investments on things like ti.com, that's where you get just very excited about. We will be getting stronger during this period. And those strengths will help us, even as these secular trends of more semiconductors in your life are growing. 
To the degree that we have an opportunity to buy used equipment or used factories or potentially M&A, as with anything on capital allocation, I think that one just goes down to the, ""it depends"" type comment. Meaning it would have to be probably a more prolonged downturn. If you think about what the mood was in 2010 and '11 -- well, 2009, '10 and '11, that mood had to be there for a while before opportunities became available.

I think -- I know your world tries to get ahead on trying to guess what will happen. I, in general, think that the secular trends that we've seen with semiconductors and more semiconductors coming into people's lives, are going to continue, okay? And I think somewhat, as John alluded to in his question, it's obvious in the near term, that server sales and PCs are going to do well as working from home continues. But I just think longer term, you look at industrial products, industrial equipment and even automotive. Even though in the near term, people will see SAR numbers come down, this secular trend on semiconductor growth inside of automotive is going to make it a great market to be in for the long term. 
So no, I don't think from that point, there'll be a big structural change. I do think we've got a great advantage of having structural channel advantage. So the changes that we've been working towards for a number of years of building closer direct relationship with customers, things that you now see playing out with a higher and higher percentage of inventory being in our hands to where we can be more efficient, it's -- that's going to be a fantastic trend.

You saw them rise up. You've seen them start to trend down. They're still at that level we saw, approximately ending February and in early March. 
I think that's starting to filter through. For us, especially, Dave will have the number where we're 60%, 70% consignment, it takes a while for those consignment feeds to really get updated because companies have got to start getting better numbers on that front. So I think customers are just still processing through what their customers are telling them and we will see that play through.

I'll give you my take. Frankly, there's no signs on that. As we talked about earlier, we're using 2008 as the model for that. Again, it doesn't imply precision, not even similarity. It's just that the most recent exogenous event that we can use. So we're using that. And the midpoint is the closest thing to that, kind of adjusted for seasonality, what you normally would see in the first, second quarter, transition, [ you're ] seeing a negative 13% at that midpoint. 
But the entire range, and the other reason we widened -- or the reason we widen the range is to reflect the great level of uncertainty that we have going on. As Rich mentioned, many customers right now, they're still processing what's happening. And we've actually heard some of them haven't been able to update their feeds to us, right? So they got to go through all that process. And so that's embedded in that wide range. 
The biggest point I want to make, and we made it a couple of times already, is the optionality that we're going to get based on how we're running the factories, right? So this thing can go multiple ways for second quarter and third quarter and beyond. But we have just great optionality, the way we're running the business, both strategically, the type of parts we build and the end products and so forth. But tactically, the way we're running the factories and the inventory in second quarter.",249

So I'm sure your customers are probably thinking about this, too, and maybe they are perhaps building some inventory too, to be able to respond to eventual demand. If that's indeed the case, how long would you be willing to have this in optionality or perhaps run the inventories a little bit longer than normal?",67

Right? And I think we and the world and the industry will learn, over the coming weeks and months, and then we will adjust as necessary. I think the advantage we have with the way we're set up strategically with the type of parts we build and the type of customers we have and the type of end markets, is that we can afford to have this optionality, right? These parts are not going to go bad. It was very different in a custom centric -- custom far centric world, in personal electronics type of centric world, that's not the case with the way we structure the company. So we have great optionality to go through this beyond second quarter.",135

I'm sure nobody really wanted to hear you in this kind of forum. I had a question back on capital allocation. And going back to the 2008, 2009 template or playbook, you raised your dividend in the fourth quarter back then. It was a small portion, but it was, I think, on a percentage basis, was pretty meaningful. So as we compare what -- where we are heading now versus, I'm sure nobody has any idea what next quarter is going to be, what's the right way to think about capital allocation, based on the comments you and Dave and Rafael are making? It sounds like no change in 100% free cash flow back, divi plus buyback, no change to that. So just -- kind of just help us understand the thinking or scenarios that you're playing out -- that you're thinking through, which might lead to a near-term modification on that, Rich?

So just to comment and Ambrish, as you said, and Rich just confirmed that, yes, there's no change in our -- in the way we think about capital management and our long-term objective. So as I said earlier, cash return, return of free cash flow on dividends, specifically as you alluded to, the objective is provide a sustainable and growing dividend to appeal to a broader set of owners. 
And as a reminder, on a trailing 12-month basis, our dividend was 55% of our free cash flow now. Of course, that's a backwards-looking metric, I understand it. But it's a great place to start, frankly, few companies are at that level in our industry and in the S&P 500. So it's a great place to start. But that objective of providing a sustainable and growing dividend, it has been and continues to be very important for us.",148

And this is more to do with -- I think Chris asked a good question on structural changes. Given that we're all working from home, at least those of us who can afford to work from home, how is it impacting the design activity that TI engages in multiple geos, multiple customers, so many end markets? What's the right way to think about the changes that you're seeing there? And does it portend poorly for when we ultimately get to a more ""normal world""?",87

And basically, I'd had a bunch of people telling me, gosh, we got lucky on some things, and I explain there's this great quote that ""luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity"". And we put in place this mass market selling, really virtual selling technique starting 3 years ago. It's an instituted standard process. Our sales teams work it, applications people work it, comfortable with customers. 
And so it's almost been like nothing has changed in terms of where we spend our time working between ourselves and the customers. They all want to do it on the phone anyhow, our products group connecting in on that. So the readiness that we had to operate in this world is actually enormously high. Having ti.com, more capable to support customers' decisions, to be able to support online commerce as we're bringing more customers direct, the comfort of our product groups, design engineers and people to work collaboratively because we've always had to do that, is really, very unchanged. 
I do think people are working more hours just because the days and hours tend to blend into one another, as I'm sure everybody on this call is experiencing. But it's very impressive to watch the team performing and watching while it's getting done. 
We're even at the point where all the set of customer visits even next week -- where those customer visits will be virtual as well. So we're just well under the way of operating this way.",276

I know you guys don't like to talk about sort of specific geographies. But fact of the matter is, China is coming out of this pandemic and starting to open up their economy and throwing quite a bit of stimulus at it. Are you seeing this being reflected in your order rates or consignment forecast for your domestic China customers?

I'll start. And please chime in, Rafael, if you'd like. So we -- again, I'll give the numbers of products of where we actually ship the product but always offer the caution that it's where the box ships from. So we've got 50% of our product ships from -- into China. 
But again, like cellular phones as an example, may be built there, may be designed in California and end up in Europe, as an example. So -- and yes, we are seeing those factories coming back online as we talked about in our prepared remarks. But I think the uncertainty is how much demand will actually be there as those factories come back online. And I think that's what's creating that uncertainty. So do you have a follow-on?",130

I think, Harlan, I'll make a couple of comments. And Rich, if you want to jump in afterwards, feel free to. I think that what's important for us is the -- just the longer term, opportunity in automotive remains unchanged. And we continue to invest in 5 different sectors inside of automotive. There will be more content per vehicle, as you know, Harlan, and as you're pointing to. We will respond tactically to those changes in demand. And we know how to do that and take care of that operationally. That's not something that we'll be able to control, but we will keep our investments steady and be prepared to support that growing opportunity as it arrives.

I would just -- Harlan amplify as I suggested earlier, that the secular growth themes that are embedded in things like automotive or embedded in industrial are alive and well, okay? They're going to be with us. They are not going to offset a 20% SAR drop in any one year. And we know that, I think everybody does.

I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape that you're seeing today, both in Embedded Processing as well as Analog. You guys have been a pretty consistent share gainer over the past 5, 10, 15 years. I wanted to get your thoughts on share growth potential going forward. Obviously, you guys are going through this recession, which all else equal, I would think would be positive for industry leaders like yourself. You're also going through the go-to-market strategy change. You've also got the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

I think you described a couple of secular tailwinds, if we do our job well with a secular headwind depending on trade tensions. But even there, if we do our job well, I think we can mitigate some of that. I think you also, and I'm sure Dave is smiling, you got to the right context, which is, you've got to look at this over 2, 3 and 4 years, so I think it reminds everybody all the time. And so you look at the share we gained going kind of into and then the position we were coming out of the '09 downturn, and we gained momentum in that. And that's certainly what our plans are right now, and that's about both Analog and Embedded. And it's about the markets that we focus on. It's the customers, the products, the technology, the capability by ti.com that we put in place. And it's where all our energy is going on a weekly and daily basis, is to get better at that.",180

Okay. So the first question really is around how the cycle evolves and how to think about it. And I guess, I understand that the magnitude, the peak to trough magnitude, it's hard to look back at '08 and to sort of look at that. But it seems like the near-term supply chain boost that -- or the concerns that customers have about that, that's boosting near-term demand, it seems like for you, that effect is sort of beginning to wane, maybe a little earlier than others because of your consignment model. So practically you're seeing it first. And I wonder if you'd agree with that, as it relates to the consignment model? And I guess the question is, does that agree that -- or does that argue that you would maybe see it out the other side first as well?",143

So I don't know -- so first of all, we haven't seen what others have reported yet or what they've seen. So it's probably too early to do that. And we've had theories of us seeing it early and seeing late, just rather not weigh in on that debate and just report the facts that we have and let others debate it, right? We do believe that by pulling and controlling that inventory, we'll get much cleaner signals. But as we've talked about before, our customers, right now, they're not sure what their demand is going to look like. And so what they're telling us, hasn't been updated yet. So even what they're telling us isn't completely clear. So it's going to take a little bit of time before all that stuff is updated. So you have a follow-on?",141

I do. Yes, it's for Rafael. So I guess on inventory, so if I assume that it's sort of flat to up in dollar terms, obviously, days are going to go way up in June, maybe they're 170, 180 days, something like that, and possibly even up during September. I guess, I was just wondering like can you give us some sense of what the pain point is, where you might cut utilization? Is it an inventory [indiscernible] thing? Is it [ day thing ] ? Or is it a sort of just a duration of recovery thing?",100
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2020",2020-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3666.0,2015182.0,78838814.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,74,"Yes. No, good question. First, let me step back and remind you that for us, the objective of inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence while we improve our manufacturing asset utilization. The target of $115 million to $145 million, frankly, is kind of incidental, right? It's just a calculation. 
At the end of the day, this is a capital allocation decision. We're going to -- we have 2 -- 2-point some billion dollars of inventory. That's real money. That's on the balance sheet that if it wasn't there, it'd be back in the owner's bucket. So we're very thoughtful in how we're going to -- how we make those decisions to put potentially more inventory on that balance sheet, right? 
That's less cash than we have. But we just think it's going to give us great optionality throughout this thing, right? 
And like any decision when it comes to capital management, it's going to depend, right? So that's the decision we're making now. We have to see how things develop in the coming months. And based on that, we'll adjust. The important thing, the inventory lasts a long time. This is inventory that the scrap levels on this inventory is very, very low. So the others that -- well, there's working capital and an opportunity cost to it. But it's very low given that it's highly unlikely that it's going to be scrapped, and it gives us just tremendous optionality on the other side.",249

Just to follow-up, Rafael, and Tim, Rafael said this before, so it's just me repeating his comment. The other thing to keep in mind and he spelled this out is, while our inventory would be growing in the second quarter, we will drain yet again distribution inventory. So we just got to keep these multiple variables in mind, and it just keeps putting us in a better and better position when we're doing that. So if our balance sheet may show higher inventory, but we love the fact that that channel inventory will be getting leaner and leaner, and the inventory will be in one place where we can get the most effective use out of it.",118

Well, 6 days at 5%, 2/3 of our revenue goes to consignment, whether it's through distribution or directly with the end customer. 
So that puts upwards pressure on that inventory level that we have. We also have our own manufacturing too including assembly test operation, whereas to a very high degree, about 80% of our output goes through our fabs and maybe 60% or 70% through our assembly test operations. So that's also very different than our competitors. So that's why it's not apples-to-apples when you compare our inventory levels to those of our competitors. 
But let me make the point, though, that we think owning and controlling that inventory is a strategic asset. So we're very pleased we've -- we having those consignment arrangement. Clearly, very pleased with owning our own manufacturing and what that has enabled us to do any time, but particularly in times of disruption, like what we just experienced and continue to experience, where it just really puts us in a much better position to support our customers.",217

Our own field work in the supply chain downstream from you guys indicate that inventories are indeed like normal, if not lean levels. And as the virus spreads around the world to places like Malaysia and Philippines that there's shortages of components, understanding that your inventories are higher than -- at the high end of the range and not hearing anything about TI shortages. But basically, supply is being disrupted, and there's a reticence to give up any excess inventories downstream for you. I'm wondering if you could describe what you're seeing on your own supplier base that you want to run your factories at consistent levels here. Are you seeing any of these supply chain disruptions that your customers are seeing at other components. Are you seeing that? And how are you managing that? And there's a risk that you're not going to be able to run your capacities consistently because of your own supply disruptions? That's all I had.",165

Sure. Yes. No, no problem. The short answer to that is we're not seeing anything worth mentioning on this call, little things here and there, but nothing that we cannot manage. 
Remember, I referred to our business continuity program. And we've been -- in this call, we've been talking mainly about inventory, finished goods inventory that we carry, but that also applies on multiple other angles. So for example, we also carry raw material inventory buffer. We have many dual and triple and quadruple sourcing of key raw materials. And we also have, as I talked about earlier geographically, the diverse manufacturing footprint in Malaysia, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, in Mexico, in China. So that just really puts us in a very good position. Also gives us leverage to work with those suppliers, which, by the way, we pay them in 30 days. 
We make -- that's part of our thinking, to be fair to those suppliers, and we don't play games on that. So that -- that's also from a long-term relationship standpoint, I think we are in very good shape with all of those suppliers.",189

We will also continue to pursue the 3 ambitions Rich mentioned: We will act like owners who will own the company for decades; we will adapt in a world that's ever changing; and we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. 
When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. It is these ambitions that will guide our decisions in weeks and months ahead as we navigate in these uncertain times. Our best to you and your families.",154

And good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a reminder of the framework we described during the April earnings call for how we'll navigate the COVID-19 economy. Next, I'll provide insight into the second quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end market, including sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. And lastly, Rafael will cover financial results, some insight into onetime items and our guidance for the third quarter.
During the April call, we explained that we will use our 3 ambitions to drive our decisions as they are particularly helpful in uncertain times like we faced with COVID-19. For decades, these ambitions have driven all decisions inside TI. They are: to act like owners who own the company for decades; secondly, to adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing; and third, to be a company that you're proud to be a part of and will be proud to have as a neighbor. When we pursue these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit.
While second quarter did not experience the depth of the decline we saw in the 2008 financial crisis, nonetheless, we remain cautious on how the economy might behave over the next few years. As a reminder, in April, we provided a broader framework to help you understand how we'll operate through this environment. First, we will maintain high optionality with our operating plan so we can support customers, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast will be limited. Next, we'll maintain investments in R&D and in new capabilities like those for ti.com since they're 5- to 10-year time horizon decisions and critical to building TI stronger. And finally, we will invest to ensure long-term manufacturing capacity, particularly for the 2022 to '25 time frame. Making decisions with our ambitions in mind will continue to serve us well. And that, coupled with the framework I just mentioned, should help you understand our actions.
We are particularly pleased with our decision to maintain an operating plan that allowed us to maximize our optionality. During the second quarter, we were able to respond to unforecasted demand. We will continue to maintain this posture in the third quarter.
Moving on, I will now provide some insight into our second quarter revenue. There are several key points to summarize what we're seeing in the market. First, overall, the weakness was primarily from the automotive market. Automotive was down about 40% sequentially and down over 40% compared to a year ago. To help appreciate this impact, excluding automotive, TI was up 8% sequentially and down 3% versus a year ago. The automotive market appears to have bottomed in May as North American and European assembly plants resumed operations.
Next, the industrial market was up about 2% sequentially and also up 2% from a year ago. There are end markets that are weak and others that are understandably strong, like medical. We do believe that some customers are trying to maintain strong inventory positions to limit exposure to any supply chain disruptions. Personal Electronics was up over 20% sequentially and up about 10% compared to a year ago. This can best be explained by work-from-home trends and TI being in a position to support unforecasted demand in the second quarter.
Next, communications equipment was up 20% sequentially, but down 15% compared to a year ago. Within this market, it's important to note that Analog achieved sequential and year-over-year growth, while Embedded was down in both comparisons, following our planned decline in this portion of the business.
Enterprise systems was up sequentially and year-over-year. This strength, similar to Personal Electronics, is best explained by work-from-home trends and TI being positioned to support unforecasted demand.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",755
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507767.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, down 12% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue, and gross profit margin was even.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $780 million, down 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue.
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D.
Operating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year-ago quarter.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.48 per share, which included a $0.33 benefit primarily for tax-related items that were not in our prior outlook. The benefit included $0.02 of restructuring charges to strengthen our Embedded business by focusing investments on the best opportunities for long-term growth.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $130 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.7 billion.
In the quarter, we paid $823 million in dividends and repurchased $882 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.7 billion. In total, we have returned $6.7 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 56% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 1.75% due in 10 years. This resulted in total debt of $6.8 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. We have repaid $500 million of debt due in the second quarter, and we have no further debt due this year. We have $550 million of debt due in 2021.
Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were up $133 million from first quarter, and days were 166, about as expected. Distribution-owned inventory declined again in second quarter by about $150 million, the seventh consecutive quarter of planned reductions as we continue the transition to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. Tactically and strategically, we are pleased. We have held total inventory dollars steady while increasing the percent of inventory held inside TI and therefore in fewer places. This enables us to continue to maintain short lead times and high availability to meet unforecasted customer demand.
For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.26 billion to $3.54 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34.
Regarding our factory operating plan, as we have stated, we will maintain high optionality so we can continue to support customers' demand, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast may continue to be limited. We have informed our customers that lead times on our products remain short, and more than 40,000 products are available for immediate shipment on ti.com. Short lead times and high availability are important capabilities that allow us to continue to support our customers' near-term and unforecasted demand. Our product portfolio of mostly long-lived parts afford us to have a steady hand, and therefore, we will take a similar approach to our factory operating plan again in third quarter.
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. History has shown us that it is in times like these when we can make the most strategic progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",633

But if your lead times are short and you're building -- you have 40,000 products that are ready to ship, why would any of your customers actually have any need to prebuy anything? And if so, do you think what you're seeing right now is maybe just more indicative of what the actual end demand state might look like? Like how do we square that circle?",98

I think as we've talked about last quarter, we saw some unusual order patterns as we talked about revenue running up really strong into March and things abating. They certainly didn't abate as we thought that they would. We saw supply constraints across the industry. And sometimes, as customers' orders -- as they look at building inventory, our visibility ends at their dock when we ship them products. So they may decide to build some finished good inventory, so we don't have visibility into that. So that's really not a number that we can look into a system to provide us that. It's really just more instinct and experience and also just talking to our field teams and getting input from that standpoint. So that's -- when we look at the numbers, that's what it's telling us.",143

One, out of our 100,000 or so customers, I would guess 70,000 to 80,000 of those are in industrial, right? So it's frankly just difficult to draw conclusions with such a huge number of customers that have different idiosyncrasies in the way they behave. The other thing I would tell you is that if I'm a purchasing manager of one of these customers and I'm ordering 200 different parts for our board, are they really going to treat certain suppliers a little differently than others if they decided to build inventory to stock up and feel safer? Probably not, right? So that's another dynamic that maybe you should take into account.",121

I guess just to follow up on that a little bit, so if I look at kind of the trajectory you've had over the last few quarters, Q1, you were above seasonal; Q2 ex auto, you were above seasonal; your Q3 guide is kind of at the low end of the seasonal but kind of roughly. I mean so far, like at least outside of auto, it doesn't seem like the pandemic is having any real impact on you at all. I just find it a little surprising. I mean what are you hearing from your customers, if anything, as to that effect in terms of what they're seeing and the impact that the pandemic is having on the supply chain because as far as I can tell, it's not having much impact on you at all? I guess it's good.",142

Yes. And unfortunately, we have to report the numbers with auto in, so that is the reality. Auto was down 40%, so that is real. And the auto manufacturers closed down because of COVID, so I wouldn't quite go so far to say that it didn't have an impact.
And if you look inside of that, you saw strength in some areas like the work-from-home trends, like PCs and tablets and servers from the inside of enterprise, right? So we're seeing some strength that's due to that, which is also driving that. So there's some things that are moving around that we saw. And the other thing that I'd -- if you look longer term, when we -- as we entered the year, as you know, I think we described back in January that we were seeing signs of stabilization with the fourth quarter results. As we had worked our way through the bottom of the cycle, we're starting to see those signs of stabilization. Now with those signs of stabilization, again, we just turned in a down 12% overall.
So those are the results, and we do have to report the numbers all in. But I think it is important we wanted to give the color of auto because that was the driver of the weakness from a year ago. So thanks, Stacy.",225

I'm curious, Rafael or Dave, what you are expecting your automotive business to do in Q3 because when I look at your auto sales, I think you mentioned down over 40%. They are kind of in line with units. And I know just picking on 1 quarter is not representative of the trend, but some of your auto peers have said they benefited from content growth and so forth. So my question is what do you think about just the broader automotive market heading into for Q3? And do you think you can start to get back to a point where you get some content growth on top of whatever unit recovery that we might see?",127
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507782.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,17,"Yes. Yes, Vivek. I think that's a great clarification. So obviously, what we're reporting is just our shipments. When factories close, they stop taking product. You know that for our revenues overall, a large portion of our revenues overall are on consignment. So there's not inventory sitting between us and those manufacturing lines. In general, I described the automotive market as being a more mature supply chain. So those supply chains will react faster than, let's say, an industrial supply chain would perhaps. And so when those factories open back on, they begin to pull those units.
So we won't try to predict what the overall market is going to do. We can measure when customers are pulling that demand. Our confidence in content growth 3 and 5 years from now in automobiles remains very high. And -- but just try to draw the dots of a cyclical recovery, we just won't spend time trying to do that. So do you have a follow-on?",164

So on the factory plan, I recall, Rafael, you mentioned that you expect your factory plan in Q3 to be the same as Q2. And we saw inventory go up in Q2. What do you think your inventory levels will do in Q3? And what I'm trying to do is try to align -- your Q3 guidance seems to be seasonal as was asked before. Even the range of outlook seems to be very in line with normal guidance. But your commentary seems to be more conservative. Certainly, visibility on the macro side seems to be a little more difficult. So I'm just trying to get a better sense for what does your plan for production in Q3 tell us about your visibility onto your end customers and the level of demand?",133
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507784.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,19,"Yes. No, sure. First, a couple of things. First, the environment continues to be uncertain. So I want to make sure that's clear. And we remain cautious how this economy will behave for the next several years, okay? So that is very, very important. That is part of the way we're looking at this.
At the same time, we want to keep our optionality, maximize our optionality. And what that means is be able to meet unforecasted demand from our customers, like we just did in second quarter. And we plan to continue that in third quarter and beyond. The reason we can do that, strategically, we're just very well-positioned. The parts that we sell are -- tend to be -- the majority of them catalog parts, they sell to many, many customers, that last a long, long time. So if we end up building inventory, that inventory is not going to go bad. We don't have to scrap it. So that plays very well in our favor. Essentially, it's a very asymmetrical bet that we're making, where the upside is really high, the downside is limited. So we're going to continue operating that way.",195

Automotive, obviously, when things shut down, they shut down. And that was -- had turned off pretty much like a light switch as the numbers would show. And I think that inside of industrial, you've got the numbers of down -- or the 2% or so from a transition standpoint. So yes, definitely the strength that we saw we had in the work-from-home areas.

As you guys know, M&A is clearly topical in the group right now. And Rafael, I was just hoping you can remind us what sort of the criteria is when it comes to M&A for you guys at TI. And sort of a 2-part question, is it fair to say that your posture is a little bit more conservative or cautious, given the current macro and geopolitical backdrop as well as where evaluations lie? Or is it pretty much business as usual for you guys on the M&A front?",91
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507789.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,24,"Yes. No, that's a good question. And it's interesting the way you framed it. So let me first remind everybody our framework, and any acquisition that we consider needs to meet 2 criteria. The first, it needs to be a good strategic fit. So that means an analog company with catalog parts, differentiated parts that then go into auto and industrial because that's where we focus, that's where the content growth is happening and that would align well with our strategy.
But the next piece is that the price needs to make sense. And that is after -- once you make the purchase, in 3, 4, 5 years, are you meeting the cost of capital? Are you beating the cost of capital? And think of it on a cash-on-cash standpoint. I invest $100 and my cost of capital is 10%. When am I going to get $10 after-tax on that investment? Can I beat that $10 and get $15 or $20 over time? So that's our criteria. That's the one we've had for many years, and we continue to have it.
On your second part of your question, are we more -- are we conservative? Frankly, in an environment like we're going through today, it's a great time to make the most of opportunities. So we're not conservative. We're following the same framework that we have followed. And based on that framework, we evaluate M&A opportunities. But more importantly, we're continuing to invest internally. We're making our competitive advantages stronger. We continue to invest in R&D. We haven't scaled back that at all. We continue to invest in things like ti.com and our reach of market channels. And of course, our manufacturing and technology, where we are -- we broke ground on the new facility, the new -- the second RFAB in Richardson. And we're going to be investing to have that building ready over the next 18 to 24 months.
So we continue to do that to strengthen the company, and now is a great time to do it. We're very well-positioned from a balance sheet standpoint, from a P&L, a free cash flow standpoint, a lot better than our competitors. So that's -- it's a good time to take advantage of that.",374

I wanted to go into the source of the upside that Dave and Rafael, you guys talked about. The work-from-home side, I think everybody understands why that was better. But the big question that's still outstanding to me is the sustainability of that. So can you just talk about the upside surprise? Do you think it's sustainable? I know you're not guiding by end markets, you never do. But how do you envision the second half of the year in those same areas that upsided?",91
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507792.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,27,"Yes. Ross, I think that when we look at our business longer term, we look at where we're investing for growth. Industrial and automotive is where the investments go, especially industrial. That's where we expect growth to be when we look at 3- and 5- and 10-year growth, perhaps for the next couple of decades. So we believe that growth is very sustainable, and that's really where we're focused. I'll say that some of the growth that we're seeing is due because of the optionality that Rafael talked about. We've recently updated our customers. We've got 40,000 products that we have immediate availability on today. So if that demand is sustainable in the second half, we've got the products available to ship into any of those, any of our markets overall in the short term. But our long-term prospects, I think, are really what's more important. Do you have a follow-on?",151

I wanted to switch over to the 2 product segments, 2 main ones, Analog and Embedded. I just wanted to see if there's any update on your views on the Embedded side. I know you said there was a little bit of a restructuring built into that $0.33 gain, I guess, as a little bit of an offset. But the big picture question is you're now down to the lowest percentage of sales Embedded has been since, at least in my model, like 2012. And the year-over-year decline is so much larger than the Analog side. So can you just talk a little bit about when do you think that business bottoms out? What sort of restructuring needs to be done? And then do you think that business is a growth driver over time for the company? Or is it something that we should just envision as remaining a much smaller part of the company than it once was?",161
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507794.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,29,"Yes. I think when we look at the Embedded business, the embedded market, as we've talked about before, it shares many of the attributes that the analog market does. And we believe that it will be -- it has been and will continue to be a contributor to free cash flow growth. When you look at that business and look at the share gains that it's had, look at '16, '17 and really the better part of '18, it has had -- it's had share gains. It gave some of that back in '19, of course.
So -- but here, more recently, we talked about last quarter, you saw some sequential growth out of that business all in. We talked about the fact that without auto, you would have seen sequential growth in that business this quarter. So I think we're seeing the signs of stabilization inside of that business. So we have taken actions to strengthen that business. Once you dive into that, we've got, across Microcontrollers and Processors, there's 8 businesses. 3 of them, actually we've increased resources. Two of them, we've actually decreased the resources. And 3 of them have stayed about the same. So that's portfolio management that you've seen us take across our businesses over the years. So we do believe that, that business will be a contributor to free cash flow. So there's a lot of work going on to ensure that it is. So okay. Thank you very much, Ross.",247

I believe you said it was just in industrial. Can you give us a sense of how much you think that helped? And what gives you confidence it's not occurring in any other product lines? And did you guys notice anything, any kind of strength by certain geographies out there?",64

You know that you've heard us talk, you've heard me say multiple times in the past that I've joked that I've never once taken a double order in order to -- for an inventory build. And obviously, customers don't mark it that way when they send an order in. So that is something that we can't see. As I've talked about before, with 60%, 65% of our revenue on consignment, we don't have inventory of our product sitting in front of the manufacturing line, so our visibility ends right there. So we don't have a system that tells us if customers are building inventory. But just when you look at the numbers and you look at the strength and you add things up, that's what our intuition tells us. So we're just mindful of that. We think it's important just to point that out. So could it be in other areas? It could be, but our belief is it's not significant, but we think it's important to point it out.",172
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507798.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,33,"Yes. And let me just add to that, on your -- your question was on the customer side. Let me remind you on the distribution side where we do have visibility. We drain $150 million of distributor-owned inventory. That's on top of the $50 million we drained last quarter. So, so far year-to-date, it's $200 million. And we think we'll be able to drain another $150 million or so for the rest of the year. So we'll probably end up draining $350 million or so of inventory. And that makes a lot of sense just given the changes in distribution that we're making. We're bringing more customers direct. So then we can control -- that inventory will be on, essentially, on our balance sheet as we build more inventory on our balance sheet, so we can support those customers direct. 
The other comment I'll make regarding that, that given that drain, now we only have about 3 weeks of inventory in the distri channel, down about a week from the prior quarter. But I will tell you that, that metric is already less meaningful than it was before. And it will continue to be less meaningful as we make that distribution channel smaller over time. So -- but I just wanted to give the data points so you have it. Do you have a follow-up, Chris?",226
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507799.0,Question,Christopher Danely,,Analysts,34,"So it's on that last statement. So you said that you've got 3 weeks of inventory in the distri channel. I guess if we look at your days of inventory right now, it's 170. It's, I mean, your balance looks like the Fed's from a first glance. Should we expect this to be the new normal going forward, like right around 170 days? Or should this be the same sort of dollar level? Or I guess, what should we sort of calibrate our models to for inventory going forward at TI?",92
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507800.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,35,"Yes. Well, a few comments. One is, as I just said, the distribution-owned inventory, we've been draining for 7 quarters in a row. So if you look at the entire ecosystem, right, including the distribution inventory, plus our inventory, over the last couple of years, probably 7, 8 quarters, is relatively flat, right? So you have to -- I think it makes sense. We think it makes sense to think about it that way.
And then the other angle, as I mentioned earlier and we talked about in our prepared remarks, is the great optionality that having that inventory gives us. And we just showed that in second quarter. And we'll continue to do it because it is an asymmetric bet that having that inventory, there's a working capital cost associated with that, but the scrap risk from that is really, really low. Yet the potential upside of serving our customers well with very low lead times, in many cases, as we said, immediate availability, we think that, longer term, is something the customers do and will continue to appreciate.",180

Economic activities humming around where I live. Gross margin, the quarter margin was much higher than what a normal fall-through model would suggest.

Or is there something else going on because your utilization was flat quarter-to-quarter end?",72

What I would tell you, it's -- as we have guided for many years, you should think of revenue coming in and out at 70% to 75%. That's a good guide to use over the entire cycle. Of course, any 1 quarter could be a little more or a little less. And then over the longer term, of course, 300-millimeter and continuing to add revenue on 300-millimeter has a structural cost advantage that helps our margin just continue to be a tailwind on margins, has been and will continue to be.",92

I did. Back to Microcontrollers, Embedded, now that you have been looking at the data, and I'm sure you've been looking at it before, but is there a -- and it's good to see that stabilizing and you're seeing some signs of stabilization, especially how low it is. Is there some insight you could provide us between the Connected and the Processors side that would help explain the divergence that we have seen from the overall Analog over the last -- not 3 years as you were just pointing out first? If we look back at 3 years, only in the last 6 or 7 quarters has it really been diverging from the industry.",115
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507806.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,41,"Yes. There's not that much difference in the trend between Microcontrollers and the Processors business. And really, if you look at the longer trend line, and that's really what -- share doesn't move around quickly inside of those businesses, whether it's Analog or Embedded overall and then if you drop down into Microcontrollers or Processors. So again, if you look at kind of '16 or '17 and the 3 quarters of '18, those businesses really did have a real strong track record of share gains. And the deterioration began to happen in '19, where it gave some of that back. So again, we're taking the actions to strengthen that business. We believe that what we're doing will get that business performing and having it be a strong contributor to free cash flow. So thank you, Ambrish.",136

Some might argue that given the current state of affairs, both economically and politically, that perhaps there could be some acceleration in that regard recently. And I'm hoping you might update us as to what you are seeing from this competitive threat.",67
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507809.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,44,"Yes. So just to give you some thoughts on that. We think of that in a way similar as we think of our competitors, meaning that our competitive advantages put us in a good place to compete against our American or European competitors just as well as the Chinese. And having, one, our own manufacturing with 300-millimeter, that puts us -- gives us a structural cost advantage. The other one is the broadest portfolio in the industry, close to 100,000 different parts. And that's particularly relevant with industrial and automotive, where in the case of industrial, for example, there are probably 80,000 different customers, right? So you want to be able to have the entire suite of parts in the Analog space and Embedded space. It makes it more likely that they will buy from you. It makes the investment on the sales side more worthwhile and then with the diversity, diverse long-lived positions that, that results into. And partially, because of those advantages and the way that is structured, it's just difficult to go after that space, right?
So what we have seen, where companies in China, or really anywhere, where they first go after is the kind of vertical markets in places like memory or digital spaces that is frankly just easier to go after, easier to get revenue growing quickly, and then you can reinvest that and go from there. In the Analog space, with average prices in the $0.30 to $0.40. Embedded is higher than that, but not that much higher. It's just hard. And then the 80,000 different customers that you go after, the 100,000 different parts, is a daunting task, right? It's not impossible, so we're very respectful of that. And our job is to stay ahead of all our competitors no matter where they are, American, European, Asian. So we want to -- we continue to invest in that -- those advantages, in manufacturing, in the broad portfolio and a reach of channels to make that climb even harder every year. Do you have a follow-up?",343

I appreciate that answer. It sounds like there's no meaningful change recently in this threat relative to any others. I wanted to follow up on the distribution commentary around, I think, another $150 million of inventory to go. When we think about the $50 million, the $150 million done in the quarter, and I think you said $150 million left in the back half, should we think about that as proportional to the amount or to the percentage of distribution business that's going to transition this year? And is that still on track to finish by the end of the year?",102
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2020",2020-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2667.0,2077091.0,81507811.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,46,"Yes. So it is on track to finish by the end of the year. And what happens there is by the end of the year, we're just going to have a much smaller distribution footprint, the number of distributors that we engage with. And at the same time, we have -- we will have transitioned a fair amount of customers to shipping direct. So then fewer distributors -- what's left of distribution will be with fewer distributors, the more of our revenue going direct, and that is, yes, I guess it is proportional to that drain of inventory that you're referring to.",102

So yes. So part of what that reduction is, is that the distributors that are going to -- that we're going to stay with, for the most part, they will be on full consignment. So anything that we sell with them, and there's a few exceptions in Japan, for example, but other than that, it will -- they will be in full consignment. So really, they're going to have 0 owned inventory for the most part. So that is also reflected in the $350 million.
So I think that was the last question. So let me just wrap up by summarizing what we have said previously. We will continue to invest in and strengthen our 4 competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will also continue to pursue our 3 ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt in a world that's ever changing.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.  
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.  
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.  
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and will provide the following updates: First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter; next, I'll provide insight into the third quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time; and then lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, capital management and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Let me start with a quick overview with 3 key points. Revenue was higher than expected and grew 18% sequentially, with notable strength from the rebound of automotive and growing demand from personal electronics. Revenue increased 1% from the same quarter a year ago.  
In April and again in July, we explained we would maintain high optionality with our operating plan so we could support customers, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast will be limited. This approach has served us and our customers well and we'll continue this posture in the fourth quarter.  
Finally, while visibility for the near-term demand has improved, we remain cautious as the broader economic impact of the global pandemic could continue for several years. Our approach in an environment like this is to maintain high optionality with our operating plan in the short term, to continue critical investments in R&D and in new capabilities like those for ti.com, and finally, to invest to ensure long-term manufacturing capacity, particularly for the 2022 to 2025 time frame.  
We've made these decisions with our overall ambitions in mind, which include running the company with the mindset of a long-term owner. These decisions have continued to serve us well.  
Looking at our segments. Analog grew 18% and Embedded Processing grew 19% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 7% and Embedded Processing declined 10%. Our Other segment declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to lower calculator sales or COVID-19 impacted back-to-school sales.  
Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end market. First, the automotive market rebounded with about 75% sequential growth and returned to levels similar to a year ago. Revenue has grown from the bottom we saw in May as North American and European automotive assembly plants resumed operations. 
Next, the industrial market was down low single digits sequentially, roughly a sequential decline and about even from a year ago. Not surprisingly, there were areas of strength and there were areas of weakness. The diversity within industrial results in relative stability, reinforcing the attractiveness of this highly diverse market.  
Personal electronics was up more than 20% sequentially and up about 15% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across personal electronics, combined with TI being in a position to support unforecasted demand in the third quarter. 
Next, comms equipment was down about mid-single digits sequentially and up mid-single digits from a year ago. And enterprise systems was down both comparisons.  
Lastly, I'll note a housekeeping item. We've simplified our Analog business structure into our power business and our signal chain business. Starting this quarter, our reporting will reflect these changes.  
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",639

Third quarter revenue was $3.8 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.5 billion or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin decreased 60 basis points.  
Operating expenses in the quarter were $793 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D.
 
Operating profit was $1.6 billion in the quarter or 42% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year-ago quarter. 
Net income in the third quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.45 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $146 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.2 billion. 
In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 13%, marking our 17th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $825 million in dividends and repurchased $15 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $6.4 billion in the past 12 months or 123% of free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 64% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.5 billion cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were down $64 million from the prior quarter, and days were 137. Distribution-owned inventory declined in the third quarter by about $100 million, the eighth consecutive quarter of planned reductions as we have continued the transition to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. 
As a reminder, as we build closer, direct relationships with our customers, we further strengthen one of our competitive advantages: the reach of our market channels. Tactically and strategically, we are pleased with the progress of the transition and the impact for our customers. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.41 billion to $3.69 billion, and earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.40. Our annual operating tax rate has not changed much, but now ramps up to 14% from the year, and that's what you should use for your models in the fourth quarter. For next year, we expect our annual operating tax rate to remain at about 14%. 
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",440

You guys saw very strong results in the September quarter. I think you spoke to a 75% sequential increase in revenue in the automotive end market. 
What's your view on December as it relates to automotive? And how are you thinking about sustainability into the early part of 2021? And then I've got a quick follow-up.",64
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2020",2020-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2545.0,2146731.0,84483240.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,6,"Sure, Toshi. Yes, I think that, that 75% sequential obviously was very strong, but it's probably best explained at looking at the previous quarter. And as we talked about last quarter, the majority of the automotive revenue is on consignment. So as the North American and European manufacturers had closed plants, that revenue reacted very quickly and we were down 40% sequentially and year-on-year. And so as those factories opened up, we saw the bottom in May and we expected revenue to grow. And as they opened up, obviously that revenue reacted very quickly in the other direction. 
So that's really the story that we saw in third quarter. Again, as we've given color last quarter on the automotive market and talked about how that was moving pretty significantly in the fourth quarter, we're not breaking out any particular end market or specific color on that front. So there's not a reason to as we look into the fourth quarter. You have a follow-on?",164

My follow-up question is on gross margins in Q3. Rafael, you mentioned that gross margins were down 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And I was just trying to better understand what the puts and takes were. Overall revenue, I think, was up 1%. Your mix of businesses improved with Analog up 7% year-over-year, embedded processing down 10%. And 12-inch versus 8, and so I'm guessing, 12-inch was up year-over-year. 
So I'm just trying to understand what the negatives were on a year-over-year basis that drove gross margins down a little bit. But I appreciate you guys don't run your business for gross margin, but just curious.",110

So yes, on a year-on-year basis, revenue was up 1%. Gross margin dollars were up, but a little less than that, maybe 0.5% or so. So -- but when you're looking at such a big number that then the delta is so small, it's difficult to look at the pull-through like we normally look at it, right? 
So in the big scheme of things, revenue was up a little bit and gross margin dollars were up a little bit. But having said that, I would also point out that the mix of personal electronics revenue was higher in third quarter than it's been what it was the same quarter last year or even second quarter.",121

Really, as you look out to Q4, Dave, how do you feel about kind of inventory versus end demand sell-through? And then as part of that and perhaps other segments as well, how you think about Huawei in terms of perhaps kind of last shipments there and how you're seeing that as you go forward?",70
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2020",2020-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2545.0,2146731.0,84483245.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,11,"Let me go ahead and start, and then Dave can address the Huawei question or anything else. But at the highest level, we are very well positioned to handle whatever comes at us, whether it's personal electronics or any other market. But personal electronics is one that by having the inventory strategy that we have followed, having that optionality that we have talked about for now, 180 days or so, the last 2 quarterly releases, has put us in a really, really good position. 
Now that is not just having that kind of tactical strategy, it's also -- or tactical position. It's also having the strategic position of being the supplier of catalog parts that are highly diversified, that sell to many, many customers. We have over 100,000 different customers, sell 80,000 different parts. So it put us in a position where we can build the inventory, have the asymmetric bet, so that if our revenue's strong, we can support it. If it's not, then we hold inventory a little longer than usual. But that's okay, it's just a little working capital. 
With that, I also want to make the point that inventory, we think, very -- it's a strategic asset. As we have talked about earlier, we're comfortable holding high levels of inventory. And in fact, we're going to update, we're going to give you an update on our range on inventory at the next capital management call in February. Dave?",242

Yes, I'll make the comment on Huawei. So Huawei was about 2% of our revenue in the third quarter. That was a little higher than what they were in the first half of 2020.

So do you have a follow-on, Craig?",70

In Opex, of course R&D is a big part of that. It's about $1.5 billion a year. That's a big component of our competitive advantage of having the broadest portfolio in the industry. We continue to put out some of the best products, catalog products that go into automotive, industrial, personal electronics, communication market. So we'll continue to strengthen that advantage. 
Another one that goes in OpEx in the G&A portion -- in the SG&A portion is the investment that we're making in ti.com to strengthen the reach of our channels. So we continue to strengthen that tool, that ability to reach channels, reach customers better and keeping them engaged longer and selling more and more products to those customers. 
So at the highest level, OpEx has been running $3.1 billion, $3.2 billion a year on a trailing 12-month basis. I would expect for that to run at above that level, maybe over time up 1% or 2% year-on-year, but in that neighborhood.",170

I wanted to know if you can give us a little more color on how much of that would be PCs versus smartphones? I know that you had talked about some of that strength coming from your ability to satisfy unexpected demand. I assume that was maybe more a PC statement, but any color you could give us on sort of the relative mix and growth of those 2 sub-end markets would be helpful.",87

But we have seen that strength broaden, so even to TVs and smart speakers and other things that are used in the home. So our best estimate or guesstimate of what's going on is that as people are spending more time at home, they're upgrading the things that they're using more. So that spend is broadening beyond just the PC. And as Rafael was talking about, our portfolio of products serves us well and puts us in a position to be able to support that demand. Do you have a follow-on?",121

So I know you're talking about continuing to hold high inventory levels and maintaining high service into Q4 and beyond, and I get that. I just want to know if you could give us any color on what that implies for your utilization and loading going forward? I'm assuming your utilization was up sequentially in Q2 -- in Q3, I mean. Please let us know if that was the case? And what are your plans for utilization, factory loadings as we go into Q4 and the end of the year?",92

So Stacy, as you know, we only talk about utilization when there's a big inflection point or something unusual. So we did talk about it in April going into second quarter because most people -- most other vertical competitors decreased their loading. And instead, we kept them flat at that point to first quarter to maintain that option, to have that optionality that frankly has served us tremendously well during these last 6 months. 
Since second quarter, we have biased up our loadings, so did that from second to third, a little higher. And third and going to fourth, we'll probably bias that up -- we are biasing that up higher. It's nothing significant. But it is biased up so that we maintain that optionality and we can maximize revenue and support our customers with any potential upsides that they have that are -- also, that would be unsupported otherwise.",151

No, first, let me step back and remind everybody how we think about cash returns. And we talk about this during capital management every year in February and when we meet with investors. 
But when we think about cash returns, the objective there is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company via buybacks and dividends. We use both. 
And if you look at in the last -- on a trailing 12-month basis, which is the best way to look at that, we have generated $5.2 billion of free cash flow and have returned $6.4 billion. So $1.2 billion more than the generation, so well ahead of the generation, the return has been. Do you have a follow-up?",123

So I wanted to double-click just a little bit on the drop-through in Analog. It seemed like the drop-through in embedded was fine, but you're still a little below where the op margin was back in sort of the late 2018 time frame at sort of similar levels. 
Is there something going on with mix? Is that maybe the PE mix that you were talking about before within Analog?",73

Clearly, Analog is the biggest segment that we have. So anything that we would comment at the company level applies -- likely came from Analog.

And Harlan, I think our comments last quarter were one, just more of an observation of history in our industry, that basically it's taught us that whenever we've seen supply constraints, that customers react by building some inventory. So it's just our belief that it would be naive that this would be the first time that, that wouldn't happen, right? So I think that those supply constraints in our industry still exist. So to that extent, that could still be the case. 
And now our lead times have remained stable. Our product availability is still very high. I think today, you can go to ti.com and get immediate availability of over 40,000 different devices. So -- and that doesn't mean that we don't have pockets of delivery problems. We'll always have that at any time. But overall, our lead times are very solid. And availability is high, but that's not true for the industry. So yes, I think it just would be naive to believe that, that wouldn't be the case.  So thank you, Harlan.",176

David, if you look at kind of your guidance over the last 2 quarters, it looks like you sort of rightfully discounted kind of what the bottoms-up bookings was telling us. You said as much when you guided for the June quarter. And just given the magnitude of [ be it ] in September, it kind of feels the same way. And that to me seems to make sense in the midst of a global pandemic. 
I'm just kind of curious, you're guiding the December quarter to plus or minus about seasonal, inclusive of what sounds like a 200 basis point headwind from Huawei. But I guess I could argue maybe phone builds started a little bit later this year that should help December. 
I guess as you forecast the December quarter, was seasonal kind of the metric you were going for? And are you discounting kind of your bottoms-up in the December quarter as much in hindsight as you did in June and September?",170

No, I think you've covered a lot of good points, John. And like you point out, in any quarter there's puts and takes. You've got the headwind of Huawei. We've got the unwind of the distributor program, which in fact we've actually wound that up this past quarter, and just with the growing demand and the inventory needs and positions that we've essentially completed that. So we depleted about, as Rafael, I think mentioned, about $100 million worth of inventory in that quarter. 
So you've always got puts and takes. But I'll tell you that the most important thing that we see and the most important input that we get is the demand that our customers tell us they want. And we get that from the orders in the backlog that our customers provide us as well as demand fees that we get through consignment. And so that is really what drives and informs the outlook that we provide. So you have a follow-on, John?",166

I think that certainly, the Embedded business isn't performing the way that we would want it to over the last multiple quarters.

But we've been working very hard on turning that business around and getting it performing like we would like it to be performing. And we're making investments there because we believe that it will be a great contributor in the coming years. So -- and so we're busy building that business stronger, and -- but it will take time.

Dave, last quarter where Embedded was sequentially weak and year-over-year weak, you talked about the over-indexing to automotive and industrial. But given that automotive was up 75% sequentially, I'm a little surprised Embedded was basically the same as Analog from a sequential perspective.

I guess my follow-up, if I can pivot over to the industrial side, just a higher-level question. You guys seem to be flat to up year-to-date in your industrial segment.
How do you explain the actual growth in that segment versus the global GDP and the general economic activity dropping? It doesn't seem like the inventory concerns are as high as what you had last quarter, where you first said it would be naive to think otherwise. It seems like some of those concerns have gone by the wayside, but you're still nonetheless outperforming the global economy. If it's not inventory, I guess, what is it?",107

And I think if you look below, we talked about there's areas of strength and there's areas of weakness. So if you look at certain markets like aerospace and defense that is obviously weak, people aren't taking deliveries of planes, as an example. 
There's other areas of strength like appliances. If anyone that's listening on the call that is doing any home renovations like my wife is, you have to wait multiple months to, just to get home appliances. And so we're seeing very, very strong strength in those types of areas. 
But I think the diversity of that market, coupled with the content expansion, I think just proves out why it's such an attractive market for us. And our products are really tailormade and well positioned to take advantage of that market.",148

And the other thing I would add is listen, we have 100,000 different customers, 80,000 different products. The vast majority of those sell in to industrial. That is the most diverse end market. So it'd be impossible for us to know what those customers are doing and what that adds up to. 
The important part is the way we run the company to give ourselves the highest possible optionality, so that if it is driven by secular trends or asset is driven by the secular trends over the long haul, maybe any one quarter it could, or 2 quarters it could oscillate. And it could be inventory building. But over the long term, those secular trends are there, and we put ourselves in a good position tactically to have that inventory available to support our customers. And if we have a correction, inventory correction or something of that sort, we'll go through that. And that inventory will not go back. It will not go back. We'll have it in storage for years, and then we'll sell it at the other end of that, of whatever correction we may have.",190

Does it feel like bookings are not going to back to reflecting true end demand? Obviously, this year everything has been abnormal, right? But as I think about your fourth quarter guidance, is it safe to say that bookings are now running very much aligned with end demand?",58

We don't have a system that tells us that. I think you have to even go back to third quarter '18 where the market had turned. We're going through a classic inventory cycle. We worked our way through that through '19. And just as we bottomed out and saw signs of inflection, COVID-19 hit. 
So that kind of changed things, but certainly we started this year with inventories at lower levels. And so that -- certainly, that's where we started the year, right? So -- but inventories and demand are certainly tied together. And -- so I don't believe that they were ever largely disconnected over time.",121

Yes. So it's almost what inventory our customers have that's downstream. And so that's why I think that we, from an optionality standpoint, try to ensure that we've got product available that if things want to continue to strengthen from here, we're in a position to support it. And that's the posture that we're taking. If it doesn't, we certainly know what to do in the other direction as well. You have a follow-on, Tore?",78

So I know communications is smaller for you and it may even be less of a strategic end market for you, but it did take a sequential breather. It was still up year-over-year.

140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2020",2020-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2545.0,2146731.0,84483284.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,50,"Well, it -- I think that our longer-term thesis is, is that it's not a structural grower, just there's not new subscribers being added to the network overall. We've made investments in 5G, and we'll benefit from it. But as you say, it's just not a very large portion of our revenues. Certainly, there's noise in this quarter's numbers with Huawei, but growth will resume. 
And as it always does, I think everyone in the industry describes it as a choppy market. And that doesn't make it a bad market, it just makes it choppy. 
And so we'll continue investments there. It's a good market for us. And we'll continue to make investments in it, and we continue to like it.",121

So clearly it's seemingly very resilient if I look back at the past cycles. But is it also because -- and I know you guys look at it very long term as well. 
2019, for 4 consecutive quarters and for the full year, it was down. So is this because as we -- and I think Dave, you mentioned that in an answer to an earlier question, is that when we entered the year, the -- really, it was -- the supply chain was drained out of any excesses because of what you have seen. And so now we are, despite all the problems we've seen and the demand collapsing in certain end markets and industrials, it's held in also because of that factor, that the supply chain inventory was pretty lean?",145

I think we've just completed 7 quarters of year-on-year declines. This is the first quarter of year-on-year growth that we've had. So industrial's been a piece of that. I think those year-on-year declines, a good part of that was just our industry cyclicality, as you pointed out. 
So I -- that -- but structurally, industrial, with its breadth, and if you look, we've got 13 sectors that we're investing in. All of them are -- have content that's growing. And so we're -- I think we're very positioned -- positioned very well to be able to support that growth. 
So what we can't call and what we don't know is in the short term, how the economy is going to behave. And even in a weak environment, that market has done reasonably well compared to some of the other markets. You have a follow-on?",145

I think last earnings call also, you mentioned that you're encouraged by the signs of stabilization. I just wanted to -- just help us understand what are some of the steps you have taken to ride the business. And as you've said, it doesn't happen overnight. 
And you talked about investments. And I know several years ago, you said that you were going to de-emphasize comms infrastructure, because that's longer term, you didn't see growth there, at least on the comms on the Embedded side. 
So is the investment profile in this business looking a little bit different as you look forward? And what are some of the other steps that you guys have taken to, ""ride"" the business and get it back on track?",134
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2020",2020-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2545.0,2146731.0,84483289.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,55,"Yes. The -- yes, so you've highlighted a couple of steps that we have taken in the past. I think none of those have been secrets. The decisions on the comms side was something that we had talked about.
I think, going back 6, 7 years ago now, as we didn't believe that comms equipment was going to be a structural grower. And specifically on the Embedded side, we did believe that there was some opportunities on the Analog side, so we took up investments there. And we're enjoying the benefits of those investments on the Analog side today, but that did provide a headwind. 
We talked about, I think, it was a couple of quarters ago now the -- some of the restructuring that you mentioned inside of the Embedded business. And we've got, I think, 8 different product groups, and we took down some of the resources in some and took up some of the resources in others. And really just getting resources on to the best opportunities overall and making sure that we have resources into the places that we believe will be the best growth opportunities. 
And I'd just say in general, what we're trying to do is leverage our competitive advantages, ensure that the products that we are investing in have a broad-based appeal in a customer base standpoint, and they'll be products that will generate cash flow for a long time to come. And just taking a step back, again, I'd say that we're investing in that business because we believe it'll be a great contributor when we look at the years ahead, so. 
And so again, there's a lot of effort going into building that business stronger, but it will take time. So that's success would be measured over years, not just in a quarter or 2. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap us up for the night.",320

Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for our owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has 3 elements: A great business model focused on Analog and Embedded Products and built around 4 sustainable competitive advantages; two, discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities; and lastly, efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. 
While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our 3 ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers and communities and owners all benefit.
Thank you, and have a good evening.",185
