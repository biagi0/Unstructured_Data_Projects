140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2015",2015-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2827.0,748986.0,32826316.0,Presenter Speech,Dave Pahl,,Executives,1,"Thank you, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our web at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call on February 4 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the -- for the last 2 years on this topic, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.
Turning to our earnings update. The fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew again, with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27 billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were $0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a $0.02 benefit from gains on sales of assets. Without these 2 items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 3-percentage-point increase -- improvement from a year ago period. We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business.
In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing.
Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, led by Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year growth for Analog. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago due to growth in processors, microcontrollers and connectivity, each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to legacy Wireless and custom ASIC products.
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of Analog and Embedded Processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week from a year ago to a historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks. This level has decreased over the past 2 years because we've structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter, we continue to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about 60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago. 
With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that's stored at the distributors' locations. We carry higher levels of inventory on TI's balance sheet with this program, which has several benefits such as minimizing impact due to changes in distribution channel inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
Turning to our end markets. In 2014, industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 13%; personal electronics, 29%; communications equipment, 17%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other, 4%. We continue to refine our understanding of our customers' end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last 2 years of updated market estimates, and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your reference.
Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, Analog and Embedded Processing revenue grew a combined 12%, with Analog up 13% and Embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again in 2014. These 2 key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 79% in 2013. Because they now make up more of our revenue, they're driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014.
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",926
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2015",2015-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2827.0,748986.0,32826317.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.
Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion or 58% of revenue. Gross profit increased 16% from the year ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings and an improved product portfolio focused on Analog and Embedded Processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan that were previously announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete, and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized savings.
Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a noncash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit due to gains on sales of assets. 
Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter. 
Operating margin for Analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 17.0%, more than doubling from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. While this is solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect Embedded operating margins to continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these expenses flat.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of assets.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range but a number that we are quite comfortable with. It is consistent with the growing portion of our product demands being supported with consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory. We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end-market demand, allowing us to better manage our factories and maintain short lead times. We'll expect consignment inventory to continue to increase over the coming years as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness of our current model of 105 to 115 days of inventory and possibly update this model in the next year or so.
Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion, which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash and (sic) [are] our cash management and our tax practices. We need the fourth -- ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion, up 11% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Restructuring charges will be essentially 0. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than last year because of an expected increase in profits and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in Analog and Embedded Processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, being disciplined in allocating our capital, and our firm belief that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",953

It probably hasn't really changed all that much. There was a slight change in our book-to-bill on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, it was about 0.97. The year ago quarter was 0.94. But frankly, because more and more of our orders are coming in on consignment, I think book-to-bill means less and less about a predictor of where our revenue is going. So I think that summarizes our sense. It's more steady as she goes, just like we've seen for the last few years of an economy just kind of growing along on a steady basis, and we're trying to take advantage and grow a little bit faster than that.",118

And Chris, let me add just the other things that we see. If you look at our inventory, it's at a healthy level. Our channel inventories are actually down a week, as I said earlier, from a year ago, just to under 4.5 weeks. Our lead times remain consistent. Our cancellations and reschedules remain very, very low. And in addition, we continue to deliver products on time for customers. So those types of things are always a good indication for the overall environment, too. Do you have a follow-up?",90

But we do get, I'd say, a much more improved or real-time feedback from what's actually going on with true end demand for our products. And the real benefit of that is that we can adjust our factories on a real-time basis, whereas, as you pointed out, if you went back a number of years, we carried far fewer days of inventory. But the signal as to how fast our products were actually being consumed in the end market also took a lot longer to get to us, and so we'd respond later. Now we can respond much more quickly. So it's less a question of improved visibility as it is a question of much more real-time feedback as to just how fast our products are being consumed.",141

So going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the best way to model that is to take a look -- really, last year is a good starting point. We typically are up in the mid-single digits from fourth to first on OpEx, and that's because of the absence of the holiday periods that we have in fourth quarter and the annual startup of pay and benefit increases that we have in first quarter. This year, we might be up just a little bit more than that versus a year ago simply because on higher profitability that we're expecting for the year, we also expect higher variable compensation accruals. And so that may take our first up a little bit higher than what you saw about a year ago.",135

So I'm just kind of curious, to what extent do you think your market share gains could be accelerating around your consignment efforts? Or if you can just help me understand a little bit better. I know you talked about Power kind of leading the way this quarter. Can you help me understand a little bit more why the growth seems to be doing much better than some of your peers?",115

I think when you look year-over-year -- first of all, it's good to have all 4 of those businesses contributing to the growth. But certainly, Power is benefiting from just a secular trend of things wanting to run more off of batteries and things that do get plugged in becoming more efficient. We also have a very strong product line there, too. So I think that those things are helping us to gain share. And we've talked about for some time that it's not one thing inside of a business like Analog or Embedded Processing that allows you to gain share. There's a lot of things that you have to do to be a good Analog company, and we've got a lot of competitors that fit that category. But we've got other things like the scale of our -- and reach of our salesforce, our presence on the web, our manufacturing footprint, the technology that we bring to bear and the breadth of the product portfolio. So I think it's just all of those things kind of working together.",181

So like in a weak market, it might be at the 30% level. In stronger markets, it would be in the 20% level. We're in a pretty good -- we're performing quite well on our markets right now, and so you're seeing that OpEx come down. In fact, most recently, in the second half of 2014, we were running around 23% of revenue. And so I would say that you would want to model us in the lower half of that range as you try to think about how much our OpEx spend will be in 2015.",133

But that aside, because of manufacturing cycle times, the material that we're starting in the first quarter, especially as we move into the second month of the first quarter, really is destined for second quarter shipments. And so your utilization tends to precede the quarter you're moving into as to what your expectations are.

It's down a little bit. Our revenues are down slightly, with inventories a little higher. Can you just, I guess, give us some feeling of, if you don't want to give numbers, at least some of the drivers for gross margins into Q1? And in particular, what are you planning to do with the inventory on your own balance sheet? How will that trend?",94

Let me just talk a little bit more about what our inventory levels might look like and how that might drive us. We don't have an inventory forecast per se. But given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong 2Q, we expect our factory loadings to increase as we move through the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago. One of the things to keep in mind when you adjust your factory loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the following quarter's expectations, then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter, if you take your loadings coming into the fourth quarter, our loadings will be dropping coming into the quarter. And going into the first quarter, our loadings start to increase during the quarter. And so you're always going to have a bit of a lag when you try to track the GPM that follows with that, which I think is what you're asking for there, Stacy. I think more importantly, what we see going forward is that our margins we expect to continue to improve, along with our free cash flow, by virtue of the fact that Analog and Embedded Processing continue to become a larger portion of our total revenues and by virtue of the fact that 300-millimeter manufacturing continues to be a larger portion of our total production as we go forward. And both of those result in both higher margins and higher free cash flow.",265

For my follow-up, just a touch on the tax rate. So your guide for next year, 30%, a little higher than your guidance for 2014, which I think was 28%.

I think you had told us before to sort of tax every incremental dollar of profit around the -- at the incremental tax rate, 35%?",74

In fact, our tax rate in 2014, our guidance was, as you said, say, rounded down to 28%. It actually came in just a little bit higher than that if it weren't for the R&D credit. And so we're looking at it rounding up to 30% as we move into 2015. So you're exactly right. As you model what you would expect our earnings and fall-through to be, you should tax that at approximately 35% delta profit as it comes through during the year.",88

But there were some shortfall in the Other sales, which are actually down 6% year-on-year. I think they were down almost 11% last year. And I believe you mentioned some loss of ASIC business. I'm wondering, what is the right way, Kevin or Dave, to model this segment? Because it is a very profitable segment for you. It is still a decent-sized segment. And I think in the past, you have mentioned that it could be sort of flattish, plus minus 2% or so. So just conceptually, what is the right way to model this segment?",117

If you look, Vivek, at the Other segment, the first thing I would point out is it has our calculator revenue. And the seasonally strong back-to-school season happens in the second and third quarter. So those tend to be the seasonally strongest quarters. Third to fourth, that biggest transition sequentially, of course, is due to the change in -- the change of that business. If you look overall, you can look at the components that sit inside of Other. The first is DLP. And I'd described that as a more steady business and one that may have some we'd describe as wild cards of new opportunities. The vast majority of that business is in front projectors today as well as in cinema. And we've got some what we call pico projectors or small form-factor projectors that make up the revenue. But there are some opportunities inside of automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future. The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators. And that business has been, I'd say, flat to maybe slightly down over time. And then royalties have run steady, about $40 million to $50 million a quarter. And that's probably a good thing to look. And then we will have ASIC business that will transition over to EP over time. That is some business that's in communications infrastructure. And we believe that, that will move over. So you kind of net all that stuff together and we kind of think that the Other segment will be flat, maybe up or down a percentage point, as we've described in the past.",270

So as my follow-on, back to your core business, do think you have the right scale in your Embedded business to take op margins into the 20s? So when I look at the 3 areas within that business, processors, connectivity, microcontrollers, how would you rank TI against the best competitor in that segment? And really, I'm trying to understand how you can grow that segment, gain share, improve margins while keeping investments flattish, while all your competitors are all investing in their respective businesses?",85
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2015",2015-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2827.0,748986.0,32826360.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,45,"Well, Vivek, I'll leave it to you to analyze the competitors. I'll speak to how TI is doing. You may recall that back in late '10 or early '11 time frame, we significantly stepped up our investments in that particular segment in order to accelerate our product introductions and therefore, begin to accelerate our revenue growth. And if you take a look at what happened over the last, as Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, 9 quarters of sequential -- or continuous year-over-year growth, that strategy has paid off. So those products are really beginning to take. And as you know, those kinds of products tend to have very long shelf lives. So we expect to see more of the same on that. While we took spending down this past year as a result of the restructuring actions we announced this time a year ago, we didn't eliminate them. The amount that we're investing is still quite high, and that's why the operating profit is still not quite where we think entitlement would take us to. So we continue to invest at quite a healthy level, just not at the level that you saw us invest in, in the prior few years. So those combined, high levels of investment, an expanding product portfolio from heavier levels of investment in the prior few years, have all given us very strong growth in that segment and will continue to give us growth. And quite frankly, based upon some of the best-in-class performers that you can look at out there, we have, shall we say, expectations similar to at least as well as those companies are operating.",274

And I'd also add, Vivek, if you look at our product portfolio like inside the microcontrollers, we've got 2 architectures there where we'll introduce new products with new interfaces and -- that meet new standards inside of that. A lot of our competitors will have half a dozen or a dozen different architectures where they've got to spread their R&D investment over. So we can be very efficient with that. And in addition, if you remember, as part of the Wireless restructuring, we brought over those connectivity products that really already had a pretty significant investment in those Wireless technologies. So we're supporting nearly a dozen different Wireless standards today. And that group is really focused on growing the top line rather than having to develop baseline technologies. So that will -- thanks for that question, Vivek.",138

I would say that if you look inside of personal electronics as an example, we'll look for places where we can find sustainable revenue with a differentiated position. And if you look at some of our largest customers that we sell products into, we'll sell several hundred devices into those customers. And those products could be anywhere from $0.75 down to $0.05. And oftentimes, they may have lives that live from one generation of a product to another. So those are the types of opportunities that we try to look for in a space like comms equipment. Now certainly from an investment -- incremental investment profile, if we had an extra dollar to spend and we had an opportunity to spend that in either industrial or automotive, those products in general just tend to have longer life cycles and better characteristics. So that may see an increase in investment. And then lastly, I'll just add that those 2 markets, I think, have the secular trends that you're well aware of. So we'll benefit from that, as the rest of the industry will. And of course, we hope to benefit disproportionately from those investments. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?",217

At least in my model, calendar '14 was the first year in the last 4 or 5 where Embedded Processing and Analog had similar growth rates, and they were both double-digits. Just philosophically, as you look at those 2 businesses, which have had very different histories, are there reasons why they should have materially different growth rates going forward?

We have held the position that we think that the semiconductor market roughly grows at twice the rate of GDP. There are some that will violently agree with this and some that will violently disagree with that basic assumption. But whatever that assumption is, we think both Analog and Embedded Processing are big enough portions of the market that they will grow in line with that. If you look at those businesses, certainly over the last 5 years, they both have continued to gain share. And we believe that we're continuing to invest, and we've got a lot of room to gain share. In fact, in Analog, we've got 18.3% market share. And inside of Embedded Processing, we've got around 15 percentage points. So lots of headroom to do that. So -- and we've gained probably 30, 40, sometimes more than that, in market share on a given year. We still have to have everyone report before all the final numbers are in, but we're confident that we'll gain share again this year. So Kevin, do you have anything to add to that?",217

Craig, one thing I'm recommending you maybe take a look at, if you do look at those 2 segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, their quarterly growth rates, I think that was the point you were making, they can vary quite markedly from one another. If you look at the 2 of them on a year-over-year basis, they actually are much more correlated than you might expect. They're both gaining share, as Dave was mentioning, and they're both growing quite nicely on a year-over-year basis. So if you do some measurements for those 2 segments on year-over-year growth rates and compare that back over the last half dozen quarters or so, I think you might be pleasantly surprised to see they grow pretty similar to each other.",127

It will be there until 2023 because that's when the last of the current outstanding bonds matures. And our attitude towards debt is that it will continue to be part of the balance sheet when the economics makes sense. And for us, that economics making sense means that if we can borrow at interest rates that we perceive to be below what we expect our inflation rates to be, or correspondingly at less than our dividend yield, then we think that's probably a pretty good deal on behalf our shareholders. And so that will be the kind of parameters that we look at as we continue to decide how much debt to carry on the balance sheet and as bonds mature going forward.

Right now, we're focused on first quarter. So the inventory that we've got staged today is designed to support our first quarter needs.

Well, I can -- let me share some end-market trends that we see. And I think that, that may address some of those issues, maybe not down at the level that you're quite asking. So I think you were talking about PCs, and those would fall into our personal electronics products. Those were -- on a year-on-year basis, they were up despite the declines that Kevin had mentioned earlier in legacy Wireless. And that growth rate was led by mobile phones. If you look at industrial -- and I want to point out, when we talk about industrial, we've been very intentional about how to measure that. And it's different than when investors talk about the industrial market. And the sectors, we've got a dozen sectors that make up industrial. And they include things like factory automation and control, medical, health care/fitness, building automation, smart grid, motor drives, displays, those types of things. The full list is out on our website. And we've seen that, that was up, led by medical and health care/fitness. Appliance, factory automation and smart grid were also up from a year ago. Comms equipment was up due to Wireless infrastructure. And then enterprise systems were up primarily due to projectors. So with that, do you have a follow-on?",215

In addition, we have thousands of customers buying thousands of parts, and consequently, we're becoming a very important supplier to a large number of Chinese companies across a very diverse set of markets. So we see China continuing to be a great opportunity for TI regardless of any of the competitive environment out there. Our goal is to operate in China just like we do in the rest of the world, which is to make ourselves an integral part of their success and an indispensable supplier.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and industrial markets were strong, as we expected they would be. However, revenue was in the bottom half of the range for 2 reasons. First was weak demand in the last month of the quarter in our personal electronics market, particularly PCs, and in our communications equipment market, particularly wireless infrastructure equipment. We believe these market-specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers in capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure equipment and a weaker-than-expected refresh cycle for Windows XP.
The second reason was a steep decline in the currency exchange rate for the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The euro dropped about 10% during the quarter, and even though only about 5% of TI's revenue is transacted in euros, it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively impacted our revenue by about $20 million more than we had anticipated.
Even with these pockets of weaknesses, our core business of Analog and Embedded Processing turned in their seventh and 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, respectively. Combined, these businesses grew 9% and were 86% of our total revenue.
Earnings per share were $0.61, reflecting our continued attention to cost controls. Although the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U.S. dollars, ROE negatively impacted revenue by $20 million, which translated to only about $5 million of impact to earnings and, therefore, cash flow. This is due to a partial natural hedge against negative currency fluctuations due to our non-U.S.-based operations. It's nice to have a position -- to be in this when you have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S.
With that as backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $609 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from a year ago.
Free cash flow was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 2-percentage-point improvement from a year-ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing. 
Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago, primarily due to Power Management and High Volume Analog & Logic. Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog also grew. As we mentioned earlier, this is the seventh quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago due to Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processor revenue declined, which was impacted by the weakness in wireless infrastructure. And again, as I mentioned earlier, this is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products, which also are heavy in wireless infrastructure, as well as DLP products.
In distribution, resales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low levels of just under 4.5 weeks, which is a decrease by more than 1 week from 1 year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program.
From an end-market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew, with most sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates; industrial had broad-based growth; personal electronics grew, although growth in PCs was lower than we expected; communications equipment declined due to wireless infrastructure; and enterprise systems grew.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",852

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion or 57.7% of revenue. Gross profit increased 13% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin was up almost 4 points. Gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we build more Analog chips on 300-millimeter wafers.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $777 million were down $68 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously announced. As we said, that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year.
Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $958 million or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 18.3%, more than doubling from a year ago as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing as we benefit from our investments for growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $656 million or $0.61 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. 
Cash flow from operations was $609 million in the quarter. 
Inventory days were 124, about 3 days more than planned due to revenue coming in at the bottom half of our expectations. 
Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $431 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed our recent capital mentioned call.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year ago. 
As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of $1.03 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.14 billion.
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.30 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 80% -- 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets, particularly for wireless infrastructure equipment and PCs, respectively. We also do not expect a near-term rebound in foreign currency exchange rates.
We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next 5 years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model. While we are not immune to demand and currency changes, their effects are softened by the diversity of our portfolio and our markets.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",737

I look at your year-over-year growth rates. The June quarter represents the first time you've had a year-over-year decline, at the midpoint of your guidance, in a long time. How do you think about that in the context of an industry where many are arguing that we're not cyclical anymore?",75

We're -- as you know, we've been pretty guarded at trying to predict the cycle. It's not something, obviously, that we can control. We really just go to what we can look at and what we can measure. So as you kind of tick through the things that you typically look at from a cyclical standpoint, we look at channel inventories are down a week from a year ago, they're lean at just under 4.5 weeks. Lead times are remaining consistent. Our cancellations and reschedules are very low. In addition, we're continuing to deliver on time and very consistently with that. So we've got a couple of pockets of weaker-than-expected demand, as we talked about specifically in wireless infrastructure and PCs. At the same time, we're seeing automotive and industrial continuing to be strong as we expect. So that's what we know. That's what we can see. The debates will continue on, on how cyclical our industry will be or won't be.",164

And those advantages include that we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry, which really means engineers start their design work by looking at us first. We enjoy a very low cost manufacturing for all the reasons that you've heard us talk about for the last few years, including our 300-millimeter wafer fabs. We have the broadest sales channel, in fact, probably 3x to 4x larger than our nearest competitor. And we play in an extremely diverse set of markets with long-lived products that enjoy a significant cash return for our shareholders for a long time. So we think that's what's really important to deal with whatever may be happening in market cycles and just really make sure that we're a lot more competitively advantaged than everybody else.",166

That was helpful. Obviously, you're talking about some weakness in PCs and comps. In the industrial segment, we're starting to see some negative news flow from the customers.

I'll just say that like you were hinting to, it's very broad-based. So we service over 100,000 customers, most of those will reside in industrial. And again, I think, it's probably helpful for me to just go through, and when we say industrial, it means something different than I think the investment definition of industrial. So it'll include things like factory automation and control and medical, health care, fitness products, building automation, smart grid, energy test equipment, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliances, and other segments. So again, very, very broad. Of course, we'll always see pockets of strength and weaknesses. But overall, that industrial is doing well. We've seen growth in almost all those sectors that I've described. Okay, thank you.",124

So the one that's pretty straightforward to identify, because it's really just math, walking through the numbers, is that on a year-on-year basis we'll probably see about a $50 million headwind due to currency exchange rates. And obviously, we're not assuming that we see a rebound in those rates. We'll still see and expect to see the weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure. And kind of the balance of the business is, as you know, there's always puts and takes. As an example, second quarter a year ago, DLP was very strong. If you remember, it was benefiting from several world events, one of them like the World Cup. Well, that won't repeat, so that'll be weaker than it was a year ago and will continue for the rest of the year. But inside of that bucket, we'll continue to have puts and takes. Do you have a -- the other comment that I'd just made on that, although we see those pockets of weakness, if you look at the core businesses of Analog and Embedded, we do believe that those will continue to perform well. So do you have a follow-up, Chris?",194

So would you expect the PC or the wireless infrastructure to have a bigger drag on your revenue in Q2? And then, it almost seems like -- do we need the dollar to weaken again for that to -- for that impact to go away, i.e., if the dollar remains strong, is that going to be like a negative impact for you guys every quarter?",72

We just don't expect them to be recovering in the second quarter. As it relates to ROE, certainly with -- if we take a look at just the euro alone versus a year ago, it's down 23%. The yen is down 14%. We roughly average about 5% of our revenue in euros and around 3% in yen. So clearly with that kind of weakness, on a year-over-year compare, that's going to continue to be an issue that's going to just affect that kind of math. It doesn't affect our ability to sell in those markets. We continue to remain very competitive in those spaces as we enjoy a lot of design wins. But unless the ROE moves back and the dollar weakens, then certainly with that kind of dramatic decline in those 2 major currencies, that will be, at least on the fringes, a year-over-year compare headwind for us.",178

I guess, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but just on the outlook. I mean, when I look at the Q1, it looks like you guys are only missing the midpoint of your guide by about $50 million and you explained $20 million of that on currency. As I go to Q2, if I just anchor against seasonality, you're kind of missing it by $150 million to $200 million. And I guess, sequentially, are you expecting any more kind of headwinds from currency? I understand the year-over-year compare, I'm kind of trying to figure out the sequential compare. And when I look at PCs plus comm infrastructure, help me understand the percent of the business that represents. I'm thinking around 15%, maybe I'm wrong with that. And I guess I'm trying to get a sense as to why you think that the miss in Q2 is going to be so much larger in those 2 buckets than the miss in Q1?",164

The first, if you look at our PC revenues as a percentage of our total, is around 5%. If you were to include hard drives into that, that'll add a few points. So you'll be just under 10% in upper single digits. If you look at wireless infrastructure, last year, it was about 10% of our revenues. So obviously, combined there, you're in the mid-teens. So that will give you an idea of what that impact is. Again, as Kevin kind of walked through the math of like the euro as an example, last year, 18% of our revenue was done in Europe. About 1/3 of that, so 5%, 6% is transacted in euro, and again, sequentially. I don't know if you have any additional comments on the impact to the euro.",154

I think, just 1Q to 2Q, I think, is what you're trying to ask for there, John. The average ROE that we experienced on our billings in 1Q is about, for the euro, was about 1.13. And for planning purposes, we're using 1.06 going into 2Q. So there's going to be a little bit of a just a quarter-over-quarter ROE impact just from that standpoint as it relates to the euro.

OpEx was up about as expected fourth quarter to first quarter. And recall that in the fourth quarter, we typically are down a bit on the OpEx because of seasonality for holidays and so on. And the absence of those seasonality -- those holidays in the first quarter, along with our annual pay and benefit increases, traditionally drives our OpEx up quarter-over-quarter. Those pay and benefit increases kick in, in February. So it's really only 2 months' worth inside the OpEx right now in first quarter. So we'll have the full 3 months. So you'll see just a very slight increase going into the second quarter.",108

So clearly, we're seeing a lot of the bookings coming through the disty [ph] channel. The inventory levels they're carrying are about 4.5 weeks, which is down about a week from a year ago, so they continue to carry lean levels of inventory. And I think largely that's because they know that we carry inventory and consignment, we also maintain very short lead times, as we have for a number of years now. And so their ability to get inventory quickly is pretty reliable for them when they order with us. So I don't -- from those kinds of elements inside that space, there's no real, again, signs that we can look at that says, ""Gee, there's demand destruction going on because of ROE.""

So there's usually a significant build as OEMs are planning to bid for the operators' spend. And then, it typically surprises us and there's an overbuild that occurs. So one kind of begets the other. We think that the wireless infrastructure market, obviously, long term, is a good market for us and we've got a good position in. And just as the numbers come down, they'll come up again one day. On the PC side, that's only a couple of percent of our revenue, so I don't think we really have any unique insight on that. We believe that, that weakness is due to the inventory that's created because there wasn't as much demand in the XP refresh cycle. But really nothing beyond that. And we'll see how the rest of this quarter goes before we start making predictions on the back half. We'll just take it one quarter at a time. So you have a follow-on?",186

Again, I think that when we look at those markets, they're very long-tailed in product cycles. We continue to make investments, they're just not at the same rates that we were making 5 and 10 years ago. And that's not unlike what we've done in other markets as they've begun to mature. So there's other areas of wireless infrastructure that looks like it will be very promising growth, like small cells, and we continue to invest very -- at very high levels there while we have very little revenue today. So we just believe that we've got to throttle that investment based on the opportunity overall. So thanks for that question.",112

We are going to use 2015 to really kind of monitor the effect of all the changes we've been doing with the portfolio and with our operations to model what we think is a more appropriate overall level of average inventories to carry. What we did conclude was that the prior model, which has worked for us quite well, of 105 to 115 days was appropriate given the mix that we had. But clearly, as we move to more and more consignment, as we move to keeping lead times very short across the vast abundance of our portfolio, that dictates that we've got to carry more inventory than we have in the past. And so what we use in 2015 to run various tests on what the appropriate level of inventories are to meet the service metrics that our customers have come to expect from us. And then probably by the time we get to early next year when we do our capital management update, we'll go ahead and articulate a new model at that point in time.",180

I'll give it a try. There are several moving parts going on there. When you look at 2Q and it best compares on a year-over-year basis. So just the ROE alone impacts us about $50 million from a year-over-year compare for growth rate. Then you go beyond that and you've got continuing weakness in wireless infrastructure and PCs and then you've also got the absence of the benefit the DLP had a year ago, which was meaningful due to the World Cup and other -- and large sporting events. In fact, we saw some of that impact to DLP already begin to occur in first quarter. As we mentioned, DLP was down quite a bit in the first quarter. So you got those kinds of headwinds, ROE, wireless infrastructure, PC and DLP, and then we've got the rest of the portfolio basically doing fine, consistent with what we've been seeing in the economy for the last few quarters.",172

Contrast that to when we bought National back in 2011 at a time when all semiconductor stock prices were considerably lower, you can certainly see in retrospect that was a very good return for our shareholders. So we tend to be very disciplined on that. We'll continue to be very disciplined on that. Buying back our own shares right now, especially as long as they trade below the intrinsic value of the company, is -- it also continues to be a good return for shareholders, especially from a free cash flow perspective.",192

If you go back to history and look at such a sharp deceleration -- such a sharp destruction, let's use that word, on the exchange rate, when do you expect that to manifest itself in other parts of the business? So for instance, the distributors in Europe and other pieces, widgets that semis go into, for instance, in industrials and autos. What does past currency issues tell us on that front? And then I have a quick follow-up.",102

I wish I had some clever insight on that, but I'm afraid I don't just from an experience standpoint. I actually do not recall in my experience in this capacity, and I've been in this role for a very long time now, seeing currencies drop this sharply in this short a period of time. So I have no history from which to try to get a reference point to answer a question like that. I think we're just all going to have to wait and see where this takes us. I think the encouraging part is, especially in industrial and automotive, is that the silicon content going into those spaces continues to increase year-over-year. And so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that's going to slow down the silicon content increases in those spaces. And frankly, if you look at the pricing of those end equipments, the cost of a $0.50 Analog chip going to $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer, I think. So if -- if you look at the more macro effects and especially where we see growth for semiconductors and auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we would see a sharp impact in demand caused just because of ROE. There may be other factors that may lead to that kind of difference.",220

And this is a clarification in response to Ross' question. Kevin, did you say gross margin will be flat?

On the utilization, we typically will just talk about that if something drastic has occurred. So I won't go into that right now. I will remind you though on the Capital Management call, I did discuss for our fab in particular, that we have the majority of equipment necessary to support the buildout of that factory to a $5 billion revenue level. And that, in 2014, we had achieved about $2 billion worth of build for revenue in support of that. So call that roughly 40% utilized. But at the same time, we're also converting DMOS6 from its exclusive use by Embedded Processing to also be able to be used by Analog. And that'll add another $3 billion of 300-millimeter Analog capacity in DMOS6. So you could say in a sense that our utilization of 300-millimeter may actually decline, but that's not because of loadings, that's because of increasing our capacity.",153

Factory consolidation isn't in our radar. What we're really interested in is very inexpensive factory acquisition with extremely low carrying cost that allows us to grow into it in a very efficient manner. As we've been talking about Analog and Embedded Processing for -- combined, for an extended period of time now, having grown at about a 9% compound annual growth rate. And in fact, even combined for this 1Q that we just closed out, they grew another 9% year-over-year. So they continue to grow quite healthy. I would expect that as we move forward in time, we'll look at those factories that provide us the best cost efficiency and cash flow delivery and keep those operating and loading those. That's probably going to be biased on loadings towards 300-millimeter.",132

And I'd just add, too, that if you look at the growth rates in time and just look at what's happened in the second quarter, the overall numbers are very strong. I mean, if you look at our gross margins, you look at where our OpEx levels are, our operating margins. With that 9% Analog and Embedded Processing growth, this quarter we turned in 27% free cash flow, right? So our financial performance isn't predicated on having to hit a certain growth level. We can do very well in a low growth environment. Or if things pick up, we can -- we're in a good position to be able to support that as well. So okay, thank you, Doug.",120

If so, it would be down probably double digits. Is that the right way to look at it? And then, as you look to June, Intel was up. PC channel starting to turn around.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, inclusive of notably weak demand in communications equipment and continued strong demand in automotive. In the quarter, we also had about a $45 million negative impact year-over-year from currency exchange rates, as expected. Even in this environment, our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing together grew slightly year-over-year and comprised 85% of second quarter revenue. 
Analog delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.65, up $0.03 from a year ago. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $820 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 2 percentage point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy. The latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
Analog revenue grew 3% from a year ago due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Power Management also grew. Silicon Valley Analog was even and High Performance Analog declined. As mentioned earlier, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog. Embedded Processing revenue declined 2% from a year ago, after 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. This decline was due to the weakness in wireless infrastructure equipment for the Processor product line. In contrast, the Connectivity and Microcontroller product lines grew. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 17% from a year ago due to custom ASIC products, which are highly concentrated in wireless infrastructure equipment. DLP products also declined while calculators grew. In distribution, resales increased 8% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week to just above 3.5 weeks, which is a historically low level. We believe this inventory level reflects an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. It's also important to note that inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed with our consignment program. 
Now I'll provide some insight into our revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago, which in total, resulted in the revenue in the bottom half of our range due to more significant softness in communications equipment and incremental softness in industrial. Specifically, by end market, automotive had strong growth with almost all sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was about flat in contrast to last quarter's year-over-year growth and was incrementally weaker than we expected. More specifically, there was growth in about half the sectors inside of industrial, but these were offset by declines in others. 
Personal electronics grew, in total, due to 1 large customer. Outside of this customer, almost every sector inside of personal electronics declined, including PCs, as we expected. Communications equipment declined, primarily due to the wireless infrastructure sector, which was down about 50% from a year ago, even weaker than we had expected going into the quarter. And enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. 
In general, as we look to the third quarter, the strength in demand varies by end markets, but our market in total is expected to be weaker year-over-year and our outlook for TI revenue and earnings is consistent with this environment. While we don't control the near-term environment of our markets, we do control the focus on making TI stronger through our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what makes TI unique and capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",887
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2015",2015-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3002.0,836203.0,36115546.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from the year ago quarter despite lower revenue, as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basis points. 
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $790 million, were down $31 million from a year ago. The decline reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, which have been completed. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.01 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit margin was 31.3% of revenue, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Operating profit margin for Analog was 35.5%. Operating profit margin for Embedded Processing was 19.6%, almost 5 percentage points higher from a year ago, as we focused our investments for growth and now see the benefit from our plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. Net income in the second quarter was $696 million or $0.65 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $820 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, as we had expected. As our business model has evolved, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. 
As a reminder, in April, we retired $250 million of debt. In addition, we issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. Including the $750 million of debt due in August of this year, we'll have retired $1 billion, while having issued $500 million in debt this year. This is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This will leave total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.1 billion, up 14% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $476 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes a 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed in our February capital management call. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 13% higher than a year ago. 
As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. And as we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement. 
In the second quarter, we paid $354 million in dividends and repurchased $654 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.08 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.1% over the past 12 months and by 40% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.31 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, down 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.41 billion in the third quarter. As we said, while strength in demand varies by end markets, our market in total is expected to be weaker year-over-year in the third quarter than it was in the second. This includes a negative impact of about $40 million due to the changes in currency exchange rates. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. 
Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charge, will remain even and hold at about $80 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. 
In summary, even in a weaker market environment such as we saw in the second quarter and expect in the third, our business model, which is built upon the 4 attributes that Dave mentioned earlier, delivered strong free cash flow. As a reminder, these attributes are our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. We believe these attributes in combination are unique to TI and they are sustainable, giving us the ability to provide continuing returns to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave",879

I think that what we're seeing right now is basically customers adjusting their expectations as to the growth rates for the remainder of the year and just toning down a little bit on where they're at. We actually believe that what we're seeing is more a symptom of like a macro-based kind of events. Markets getting a bit more cautious, especially with all the news flow in the financial markets, things you heard in Europe, things you heard in China. But the fact is the signs that we're seeing suggest to us that we're in a traditional kind of market macro-driven, not necessarily a semi-cycle per se. We continue to see lead times that are quite short, cancellations remain low, distributor inventory is at historically low levels, as Dave mentioned. So all things put together, I think, what we're just seeing is a growth rate on a macro level that's probably slower going into the second half than what people thought coming into the first half. As to comparisons to 2011, 2012, there were too many things going on back then. We had earthquake events in Japan that I can recall. We had flooding in Thailand. I don't think there's really comparable events that we can talk about on that front, Chris.",224

And then, in terms of the end markets, you talked about softness in communication and the new softness in industrial. Maybe just go down your end markets as far as which is stable, which is getting better, which is getting worse?",61

So I'll just make a comment on both revenue and order linearity in the quarter. In both cases, revenue and orders increased each month during the quarter. I think, as you look at the end market detail as I just had walked through, in general, we saw automotive was strong with all the sectors inside of that growing, or all but one growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was flat. Just contrasting that to last quarter's year-over-year growth, we didn't see growth there and it was incrementally weaker than we had expected. And as we had talked about inside of there, we really saw about half of the sectors increase. And that, of course, was offset by declines in the other sectors. Personal electronics, as we talked about, grew in total, due to specifically 1 large customer. And outside of that customer, we actually saw almost every sector decline, including PCs, as were expected. Comms infrastructure, as we mentioned, was impacted by -- or comms equipment was impacted by wireless infrastructure, and that was down 50% from a year ago. So -- and that actually was weaker than what we had expected when we started the quarter. And then, the last, enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. So that's kind of a summary of what we saw by end market. So thanks, Chris.",229

So let me just tell you what happened with the revenue in the quarter. So year-over-year, revenue was down. As we've mentioned before, 2%. Europe was down the most, and Japan was also down. Asia was flat, while the U.S. was up. From a sequential standpoint, revenue was up, led by the U.S., Asia and Europe were both about even sequentially, while Japan was down. So we're always cautious. We'll give you that information and walk through it, but we're always cautious because that's reflective of where we ship products versus where it's actually consumed. So -- and it's really hard for us to see regional weakness unless it is extremely pronounced in a market like in industrial just because of the tens of thousands of customers that make up that market. So do you have a follow-on, Harlan?",141

So I think, last quarter, you said that -- the team said that they were going to bring down utilizations. Did you, in fact, bring them down?

In fact, we did reduce utilization in the factories in the second quarter. And inventory actually came in right about where we expected that at 126 days. And given the outlook that we have just described to you, we do intend to further reduce factory utilization in the third quarter and we expect the result of that is that our inventories will probably come down somewhat in the third quarter as a result of the reductions that we're planning for 3Q as well as 2Q.

And you guys have been very clear in your articulation of what you look for and what the parameters are over time. But I have a couple of specific questions about consolidation in the current environment. Does the current environment where revenues for the industry are in some pretty sharp declines, does that change the view on near-term consolidation potential in the sense that you're worried about paying a multiple for a cash flow stream that's going to wind up being much lower over the next 12, 18, 24 months than what it currently is? Or does that create more of an incremental opportunity? I'd love your perspective on that.",115

The timing doesn't enter into our thinking, so some of the points that you just brought up, although they'd make for an interesting discussion, they don't actually alter the way we tend to think about M&A. As we've discussed in the past, the first and most important thing is that any potential M&A consideration has to be consistent with our strategy. And in our mind, that's going to be something that's going to be focused on helping drive our success in the Analog space. And then, beyond that, as you were alluding to in your comments there, we have been and expect to continue to be quite disciplined on making sure that we can get a return on what we spent. Clearly, at some of the prices today that you might see at certain companies out there, and you factor in a premium, I'm looking at -- what I've seen in some other companies, getting the 3% return, 4% return doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy for maximizing shareholder value. And so our inclination is to make sure returns can see their way past our cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe, and we'll stay disciplined on that front.",202

And for the follow-up, how do you think about what the company's long-term growth rate is in this environment? I mean, it was good last year. We're in a tougher environment now, we're kind of down on a year-over-year basis for revenues this quarter and maybe flattish for the year if we look at normal seasonality for the back half. This might be overly negative to kind of take this snapshot in time for long-term growth, maybe last year was overly positive. Do you think something kind of in between what you'll achieve this year and what you achieved last year is a reasonable view on what long-term normalized revenue growth could be?",117

You should look at over periods of time like that, not start from the wrong quarter. At a high level, we take a look and we make the assumption that some [indiscernible] market will continue to grow. Let's call it 2x the global GDP. And that's on increased content into industrial and automotive that will continue to drive demand. It's then a question of what do you think GDP is going to do over the long-term, the global GDP? And clearly, it does appear that in, certainly, in the last 3 or 4 years and probably the next few years, it has been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before that. So the overall industry, again, in our view, will probably grow at about 2x global GDP, and the global GDP is the real wildcard here just trying to figure out how fast that will grow. And we're preparing ourselves for the fact that it probably doesn't see any real robust growth to help us. And therefore, we have to focus on execution to making ourselves stronger internally.",192

And we've got the capacity to support much stronger rates of growth if that were to show up. So it'll be a lot more fun if we get into an environment where GDP growth is stronger and everyone can argue what the multiplier on semiconductor growth rates overall are, but we can still operate and produce lots of cash even in these weaker markets and we'll look forward to having more fun when it's stronger.

Clearly, as we see more of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive, that has an attractive profit mix and so you saw some of that in the second quarter. You heard Dave's prepared remarks talking about strength in automotive that we saw in the quarter. So that's clearly having a benefit to our gross margins, even in the light of lightening up on our utilization a little bit. You are correct in that utilization changes don't have an immediate impact, they tend to -- it takes a few months for it to roll through the system, so some of that was in the second quarter. More of it will be in third quarter. We also have lower overall manufacturing cost. As we begin to see depreciation starting to slowly trickle off, we're becoming much more efficient in our factories, we're getting more and more of our revenue off of much lower cost 300-millimeter. So you've got a number of things combined that are keeping those margins in a pretty healthy state. As we look into next quarter, I wouldn't expect a significant, any kind of material change in that particular metric in the third quarter.",208

And then, as my follow up, guys, you guys are constantly kind of pruning the portfolio. One of the things that's been talked about is whether or not you're going to plan to do sort of power on the new skylight platform. I'm just kind of curious as to how kind of the PC business and your desire to want to participate there is impacting either the June quarter results or, more importantly, the guide in September? Is there sort of a hit coming because you're not going to participate there? Again, if there is, can you help us quantify the size of the PC business today and kind of where it goes over time?",118

So John, what you're seeing in our results is -- has nothing to do with the investments on a V-Core product line. And I'll just say that we continually look at our investments and we want to obviously invest in places where we think that, that will lead to sustainable revenue, a differentiated position and solid return. So there's portions within V-Core that are more attractive and less commoditized than others. So we're continuing to make those investments. So we know that there have been rumors out there that we're exiting the space in total, and that's not true. But again, these are fairly small tweaks to where we direct our R&D resources, and those teams are off investing in other areas and producing products that we believe will just give us longer-term better results. So I'll contrast that to a market where we may have exited like wireless where we're actually reducing and exiting a market, and we're not doing that here. So I hope that helps.",169

We've already taken action on the OpEx side. We have announced, I think, 1.5 years ago now, actions that we were taking in better processing in Japan. And those are pretty much complete now. You're seeing those benefit, OpEx in the results that we turned in the last couple of quarters. These short-term fluctuations in revenue, we don't let those lead us to rash decisions that could have a negative impact on us. We make longer-term decisions based upon strategy.

Yes. So Vivek, our communications equipment market is, at the end of last year, was about 17%, the largest sector inside of that was wireless infrastructure at about 10%. So we've given you the color on half the size. We haven't gone through all the end equipment percentages, but that'll get you into the ZIP code of the impact to our business. And it's interesting that you bring it up. It continues to actually be a very good market for us. It's one that we're continuing to make investments. We have dialed back some of the investments a year or so ago inside of Embedded Processing, but that's really a view that, that market over time, that carrier CapEx won't -- isn't going to go up, that it probably will decline slightly as we look over the next 5 and 10 years, and perhaps longer. But carrier CapEx isn't going to 0, and that revenue will return. It has been notoriously just a choppy market and it's just the dynamics of the market, the way that the tenders go out, the way that the OEMs have to prepare to deliver that product. Oftentimes, it's in a 30 or 60-day window. So this isn't new to us. We're used to it. We can still make a lot of money and generate a lot of cash from this market. So we'll continue to do that. But it is just choppy. So that's just a characteristic.

Clearly, you'll get good product margin fall through as we go into next quarter. But as I mentioned, we're also dialing back some of the factory starts, we have moving parts inside there.

Keep in mind, what we talked back in the February capital call, that in addition to our Richardson fab, which is capable of about $5 billion of total 300-millimeter Analog revenue, we have also begun the conversion of our DMOS6 factory, which will provide an additional $3 billion of Analog revenue capability.

The only thing I'd remind you of is that industrial is about 31% of our revenue in 2014, and our recollection is that no single sector in that market is bigger than 4%. So we're talking about a lot of really small customers. So it's not anything really 1 customer that can give us a signal on what's going on. It seems to be a broad-based reconsideration on the part of participants in that space as to their outlook for growth in the second half.",86

Just as following on to that, perhaps you could talk about what you think customers are doing with inventory now? And I know you had talked about your distributors taking some inventory out of the channel, again, as they likely reconsider what's going on in the second half. Do you expect that the end customers are doing similar? And on top of that, what do you expect the distributors do with inventory as they go forward? Do you think the inventory levels can get leaner than where they are right now?",92

So in general, we believe that customer inventories are lean. As we work our way through the reports and some of the anecdotal from last quarter's reports as well as the anecdotal information that we get from our sales teams, and of course, there's always the exceptions like within wireless infrastructure as that market goes through its adjustments. So it is -- with inventory in our distributors at 3.5 weeks, that is a historically low period in my tenure as well as Kevin's, so -- and we really think that's reflective, Chris, of confidence from distributors that they believe that they can get the product that they need from us. Obviously, it's driven overall because of the consignment programs that allow them just operationally to run at those levels. And I think there is a belief that, that confidence and stable lead times and the availability of product is probably working its way out into the customer base as well. Harder for us to actually have that direct visibility. As Kevin talked about, we're talking 100,000 customers, so it's hard to have that collectively. So thanks, Chris.",188

We did have a book-to-bill in second quarter of 1.01, so we did build a little bit of backlog, but I wouldn't call it a dramatic amount. It's consistent though, I think, with the outlook that we have offered before in the third quarter.",83

And I'll just remind you, Ian, I'm sure you probably know that we've got 60% of our revenues that go through distribution, 60% of that is supported by consignment and about 55% of TI's revenues overall is by consignment. So just be careful with the book-to-bill.

I think, you've done a really good job of highlighting your competitive advantages, broad portfolio, growing into your manufacturing assets. I mean, what's the response though to scenarios where there could be some demand in end markets on a permanent secular decline? I mean, if you look at like comms infrastructure, PC, some of the consumer markets, I mean, how do you address the potential for some permanent declines in some of these end markets?",76

So the examples you just offered, if in fact they turn out to be in a secular decline, the offsetting markets for that, the most obvious one is automotive, where we're seeing significant content growth, not just us, but many in the industry seeing significant content growth. And we're still in the very early stages of that content, penetrating automobiles. So that's probably a secular growth market that I would suggest would probably add for a decade or more. So that's a great opportunity for the industry in general, and for us in particular because we've been focused there for a number of years now. And then, there's the broader industrial market where we're seeing an increasing usage of semiconductors and equipment in those markets that simply were never used before. And as people are using semiconductors in those spaces, they're finding new applications and needs for more semiconductors. So while there may be some markets or sectors that could be in secular decline, there are others that are in secular growth. And in general, that leads us to the belief that I commented on earlier in the call, that we think industry overall will grow at about 2x the global GDP because you've got these kind of underlying changes going on in how semiconductor are being used across our economy.",250

One is we'll spend differently today than we would've spent 10 and 15 years ago inside of that market. But we can still find opportunities where products will actually live through 1 product cycle to the next and still have long-lived positions even inside of a market like that. And certainly, PCs aren't going away anytime soon, so there's still quite a bit of money that can be made in those markets. So thank you, Ian.",113

They clearly are the most qualified to do that. I can simply tell you what we saw and that is our orders increased each of the 3 months as we came through -- or 2 of the 3 months. In other words, May was up over April, and June was up over May as we came through 2Q. We certainly are in different markets and that could possibly be an explanation, but I just don't know enough about how their order book works to be able to help you with the contrast between the 2 companies.",107

That's fair, Kevin.

In other words, it's -- we don't have it equipped to full capacity, but to the extent that we have it equipped, we try to keep it quite highly loaded. So the adjustments that we take on loadings generally impact the 200. There may be some impact in 300 as well, but it generally impact the 200-millimeter factories.",91

I guess, first of all, if you look at 2015 as the whole year, usually, you're targeting for the -- to sort of grow roughly 2x GDP. We don't know what GDP is going to be, but if you assume a seasonal fourth calendar quarter, it implies that revenue this year is down like 250 basis points. So it definitely seems to be under-growing whatever GDP comes out to be this year. So I guess my question is, do you think that any of this share, will you end up to have lost any market share this year? I know you usually target up about 40 bps per year? And then, I had a follow-up.",119

So what we're talking about, again, long-term growth rate was how the question was asked earlier and long-term growth rate, we believe, would be about 2x global GDP. Just like you see noise in the quarter, you probably are going to see noise in the year. For example, last year, the industry arguably grew considerably faster than 2x global GDP. This year, it's apt to grow less than global GDP. So I think, you're just going to have that kind of noise to deal with. I don't think that they can be biomechanically imposed into a formula with precision. As we look out for the reasons that we talked about, increasing penetration in certain markets, especially auto and industrial, that will continue to require some magnitude of content and there'll be growth inside that. From a market share standpoint, we'll be able to answer that at the end of the year, but I'd say we're off to a darn good start so far.",165

So the guidance is like 400 basis points below what the 5-year seasonal is, maybe you talked about this and I sort of missed it, but can you sort of try to pinpoint what the primary sort of either geography or end market that can potentially explain that gap? I guess, I'm thinking about China in particular. Can you just sort of help us color that gap?",70

We don't believe that there is something called a seasonal average in our space. When you go and take a look at any of those quarters, the variation is so wide that there's not really anything meaningful in there. I think, if you look at those 2Q to 3Q growth rates, and you see 0s to high single digits, and I don't think you can derive too much out of that. I think, we have to look at it in the context of the current global environment, certainly a lot of negative news flow coming out of Europe and some out of China and so on. We had a slow start to the year in the Americas because of weather and the port issues on the West Coast. So I think, what we're seeing is what we talked about early in the call, which is that on a macro level, our customers are looking and adjusting their expectation for growth in the second half, and they're tweaking that down a little bit versus what they had anticipated coming into the year.",183

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago. While our overall demand remained weak, most areas were stronger than we had expected, especially wireless infrastructure and industrial. In addition, our demand for automotive continued to be strong. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Even in this environment, each of our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew year-over-year. Together, they comprised 85% of third quarter revenue and have delivered 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.76. 
With that, backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28% of revenue, up from 27% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Analog revenue, which achieved a record level in the quarter, increased 2% from a year ago. The growth was due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Silicon Valley Analog also grew. Power Management was about even and High Performance Analog declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 2% from a year ago due to Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processors declined. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is also a record. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products and DLP products. Compared with a year ago, distribution resales increased 6% and inventory decreased by less than 1 week to just below 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. 
As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll move -- I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive remains strong with all sectors growing and 3 of the 5 sectors growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even with about 1/2 of the 14 sectors growing and about 1/2 declining. 
Personal Electronics was up because of demand from 1 customer. Excluding that 1 customer, Personal Electronics was down. Communications equipment was down, driven by Wireless infrastructure, which was down about 30% from a year ago. Although weak, it did grow sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems declined primarily due to DLP projectors. 
We continue to focus on making TI stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies, capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",734

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan. Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.16 billion or 33.9% of revenue. Operating profit was down 1% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.2%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 24.0%, 8 percentage points higher versus a year ago as we focused our investments on the best growth opportunities. Net income in the third quarter was $798 million or $0.76 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, down 15 days, sequentially. This reduction was the combination of lower factory starts as well as higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. 
As our business model evolves we continue to evaluate our inventory model. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model to you in our Capital Management call next February. 
Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we retired $250 million of debt and issued $500 million of 5-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. In August, we retired an additional $750 million of debt. As a result, we have reduced net debt by $500 million this year, which is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This leaves total debt of $4.125 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.11 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $512 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity as discussed in our Capital Management call earlier this year. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.60 billion or 28% of revenue. Free cash flow was 4% higher than a year ago. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt requirement. 
In September, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.04 per share, a 12% increase. This was the 12th consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to our shareholders. We also announced a $7.5 billion increase to our share buyback authorization. In the third quarter, TI paid $348 million in dividends and repurchased $790 million of our stock for a total return of $1.14 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.23 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $2.74 billion of cash and short-term investments with TI's U.S. entities owning 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 3% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes about a $35 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million to $85 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. In summary we believe our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of TI's business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave",812

And then you mentioned that industrial, I think you said, Dave, was even year-on-year but was stronger than we expected. If you could just give us some more color around the demand environment because you have such wide exposure, what is better or worse versus 3 months ago?

Obviously, we described that as a weak demand. That's actually similar to what we saw last quarter. But inside of that, certainly it was stronger than what we had expected. There were a couple of areas that were stronger than we had expected. Wireless infrastructure and industrial were both stronger than what we had expected. So that's really what we're trying to say. We continue to operate in what we would consider to be just a weaker macroeconomic environment and that's where we came in. Do you have a follow-up?",109

On gross margin, I understand that sequentially they were sort of flattish because I assume you took some utilization down. But why are they sort of flat to down versus last year?

So why aren't gross margins up versus last year?",72

And keep in mind that the wafers that we start in fourth quarter, other than for the first few weeks of the quarter are mostly for what we expect in follow-on quarters.

There's been a lot of speculation in the marketplace about more M&A within the semi space. I know you've talked about this in the past but I'm kind of curious about kind of getting some updated thoughts from your perspective about the advantage from here, given your already hefty scale of M&A and how you guys are sort of thinking about that.",90

Of course, we acquired National back into 2011, so we probably got ahead of the game versus where people are at today. But we spent the intervening time period really driving hard to accelerate 4 attributes that we think in combination are pretty unique to TI and differentiate us quite a bit from our competitors, which may in fact be impacting some of their thinking about how they approach their markets. And those 4 attributes are our approach to low cost manufacturing and advanced technology, the sheer breadth of our overall product portfolio, the reach we have to our customers through our market channels especially with arguably the largest sales force of anybody out there and the diversity and long-lived positions that we enjoy in the markets with the products that we have. If we look at what most companies are doing today from an M&A front, it appears that some of them are maybe changing their focus and some of them are maybe trying to build scale. We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the 2 best opportunities that are out there today being Analog and Embedded Processing. So we don't -- those 2 reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A. When we do think about M&A, our approach is really to focus on the right strategic fit, one that can generate long term returns and excess free cash flows. So we really do focus on the numbers that, that acquisition might lead us to. And by strategic fit, I'm talking really our bias is towards Analog. If we ever look at an acquisition it will probably be a company that's going to be broad in catalog, have a diverse customer base and have a large percentage of its revenue coming from industrial and automotive, probably have a very talented R&D team. Those will be the sort of attributes we'd look at from a strategic standpoint. From a return standpoint, we look at several metrics including really making sure that the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost to capital within, say, 4 years or so. And we also want to make sure that whatever we acquire can continue to expand our free cash flow. So with all that said, and we take a look at what's out there, we have been actually buying our favorite semiconductor company. I know you don't like to hear it that way, but through our own stock buybacks. Today, by buying back those shares, we're given a 7% free cash flow yield on those acquisitions of those shares and we don't have any integration risk and no banker fees, just a whole lot easier way to run the business and focus on customers.",485

You said half of your markets were kind of up year-over-year, half of them were down. That's pretty similar to the same as last quarter but you do seem to be seeing upside versus expectations. Within industrial, can you give us some idea of which end markets you're actually seeing relative strength versus weakness versus those expectations, and talk a little bit about how your end markets within industrial are concentrated or not?",87
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2015",2015-10-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2748.0,879250.0,37707831.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,16,"Yes. So great question, Stacy. We've got 14 different sectors that make up our industrial market. And I'll just go through some of those because I think some investors if they focus on industrials, we mean something different than that. So it includes things like factory automation and control, medical and healthcare, building automation, smart grid and energy test and measurement, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliance, power delivery systems, point-of-sale lighting, industrial transportation and then a bucket of just other really small stuff. So last year as you know, Stacy, Industrial was 31% of our revenues. The largest sector inside of there was 4%. So you can see it gets very, very diverse very quickly. And even inside of each of these sectors, we've got multiple end equipments that make each of those up. So it was very similar to last quarter where we did see about half of the sectors up and the other sectors down, together flat, so there weren't really any really huge movements in either of that we would call out to say that it was unusual. So that's what it looked like. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?",194

So we get that benefit year-over-year. As it relates to sequentially even as you say coming in the quarter a little bit better than expected, that's really just cost management continuing. And also in second quarter, there were a few items that didn't recur in second and third quarter, and so that gave us a good benefit in second and third.",115

So I guess, 2 questions there. I'll take the first one. So as you said, Embedded Processing was driven by Microcontrollers and Connectivity and both of those businesses tend to be very broad market exposures, high exposure to industrial. We've also had some exposure inside of Processors to Automotive. And what the -- what drove the weakness in second quarter and the reason why Processors declined year-over-year was the exposure to Wireless infrastructure is probably the simplest way to say that so.",83

We expect utilization to decline -- probably utilization to be about -- excuse me, starts to be about even in fourth quarter versus third quarter. So we don't expect starts to actually change.

If we assume that sort of blah environment continues into 2016 and revenue is sort of whatever around the flattish or something like that, is there any way that gross margins could go up and OpEx go down again?

But under that scenario, I think we would -- I doubt that we'd see a whole lot of change in operating expenditures other than just normal annual pay and benefit increases. But on the margin side, on the gross margin side, we'll probably continue to see benefit as we see more and more of our production moving to 300-millimeter, which as you recall gives us about a 40% chip cost reduction, an overall cost of goods standpoint. So that will certainly benefit our gross margin line. In addition to that, we continue to see an expansion of revenue that's coming out of the industrial and automotive space as a percent of total, and those tend to come through at higher gross margins as well as just overall catalog products versus custom products inside our mix. And then the last item is that as we talked about for a couple of years now, our CapEx has been running under our depreciation by a couple of points, and that is slowly beginning to close. In fact, you can even see that gap close in just in this past 12-month comparison period. So as we look out into 2016, you'll see that gap close a bit more. So those in combination will give us continued tailwind on the gross margin line, it should follow all the way through to the operating margin.",265

But we expect that, that customer, as they've done well this year, that they could come in around 10% of our revenue. And I'd say this as we look at that customer, we sell them hundreds of devices across multiple products. And if I contrasted that to the last time that we had a customer that was more than 10%, most of that revenue was concentrated in just a few parts in a single application and even more specifically than that, it was really 1 function that maybe was that different generation. So we really just had 1 function at that customer. So even inside of this customer, we've got quite a bit of diversity. Do you have a follow-on, Will?",151

I think that's also telling us that as handsets overall grow, it will really becoming the larger piece of the personal electronic space. And so what's important is to have a lot of different chips that you're selling into, a lot of different customers you sell into that space and that's exactly what we have. And so from that standpoint, if it we're going to participate in personal electronics, you're going to be participating in handsets and there are a lot of very attractive chip opportunities inside handsets, unlike what we had a number of years ago, as you remembered, with base band and processors where those parts were basically standardized and then commoditized in and your ability to differentiate was diminished. And therefore, your ability to attract profits from selling those parts was diminished. So consequently, I see this as quite a bit different today, given the diversity of products that we're talking about here than the example of when we were baseband processors 5-plus years ago.",198

And I'd add to that, if you look across Personal Electronics and you add smartphones and tablets and PCs and TVs, and things like that, you're probably -- if you added all those together, you're probably scaring 2.4 billion, 2.5 billion units and even though that unit pool probably isn't going to grow much there's, as Kevin said, there's opportunities to find products that will live through multiple generations that you can sell to multiple customers and places where we'll continue to try to steer our investments overall.

So the upside in the quarter came from Wireless Infrastructure and Industrial, it seems like HVAL is up a lot, was that part of what you're calling Industrial? And then maybe bigger picture from a geographic perspective, there's, obviously, been some negative data point in kind of the U.S. industrial market, just any change over the summer with China, now you're seeing some U.S. issues, just any perspective from a geographic basis.",80

So let me answer your first question, which, if you look at HVAL, HVAL will have a high exposure to automotive, which will help drive those resident revenues and also have exposure to Personal Electronics as well. It does have some industrial exposure. But I think that those are the areas that will drive that revenue. And you have a follow-up?",62

So yes, if I just look at our regional results year-over-year, revenue was down in Asia and Europe and in U.S. In Japan, it was up. If you look at the broader China market, it really wasn't down differently than what the broader Asia was, and that was kind of down, consistent with our overall revenue, so really didn't see much different. The second thing I'll add is that a lot of times we're asked by investors what our exposure to China is or to a particular market, and in our 10-K, we give a very precise number of what we shipped into China, being 44%. But we always like to point out that if you're looking for what exposure to a particular market is, I think most investors are asking how much of our products is actually consumed there. And so it's a very different number than 44%, it's much lower than that because, obviously, some of those products that we ship there end up getting shipped into other regions. I'll also point out that we may ship product into a Tier 2 OEM that gets put into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China, so you can't really look at any of our regional results and understand that. So but overall, probably a good proxy to begin to start an analysis would be to look at what China is as a percentage of GDP and any kind of -- start an analysis from there.",250

You gave us very helpful just the resale and inventory numbers, but just in general, you had a pretty good year in 2014, a weaker year this year, but my perception is that the customer inventory management lead time, days held, hasn't really changed. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing any inflection there in the last few quarters?",73

I'd say that of course, the distribution inventory is as you said, we can see very well. We've got 55% of our revenues that are on consignment. So for those portions, which will include 60% of our distributor revenue. But we know for that portion of our revenue, there is no inventories, it's exactly 0. So obviously, that's in really good shape. And if you look overall, the classic kind of book shift [ph] tiering inventory-type portion of our revenue is really about 20% of our revenue and that's where we'll carry backlog. Customers will have inventory. So we really don't see any signs that customer inventories are significantly out of whack, I'm sure you can always find pockets here and there. But we believe that they're fairly lean with very few exceptions, such as the Wireless infrastructure.",140

So if there's demand in any of the regions, we'll typically participate in that. If you look at by technology, that's often time another cut that people will look at. We've got a strong position in 3G, slightly stronger position in 4G and even in newer areas that we expect growth in the future that we've been investing in, as an example like small cells we've been investing, I believe, we'll have a very strong position there as well. So our numbers aren't so much impacted by a specific region. Of course, we won't escape it either if there's weakness in any particular region.",146

I know in the past, Dave, you gave the year-over-year. I think you mentioned that the Wireless infrastructure sequentially was up. I was hoping you could give the sequential direction by the other markets, and I think from the math you gave earlier for last year by the end markets, it seem to imply that the combination of Industrial and your comm infrastructure, your Wireless Infrastructure must've been up the better part of 15%, sequentially.

So I've got -- I can share with you some color sequentially, the automotive market grew sequentially, led by our ADAS and infotainment sectors. Industrial, again, was about even and Personal Electronics was up with growth in most of the sectors that make up that market. Communications Equipment was up, as we talked about earlier, due to Wireless Infrastructure and Enterprise Systems was about even.

We've talked about their mission over the last couple of years has really been cost containment and growing the revenue and they are achieving very good results on that now. Importantly, they're strong contributor to our free cash flow growth and just as our free cash flow at the company level tends to be weaker in the first of couple of quarters and stronger in the second couple of quarters, I don't think it's any different from when we take a look at how some of the business units underneath will be performing that metric, being as though they're the ones contributing to that free cash flow. We tend to look at these things over a longer period of time because quarter-to-quarter can be pretty noisy. But I think that team has done a very good job of getting those margins up to where we think its entitlement is at, and they should be performing at that level in the foreseeable future, in fact in the long term, is what we would expect on them.",199

We've highlighted that they, as well as Analog, had achieved record levels of revenue as a result of those investments. Together, Analog and Embedded have grown for 9 quarters in a row year-over-year. And I think there was 1 quarter where Embedded actually did well, but didn't grow year-over-year and that was last quarter that it had the big headwind from Wireless Infrastructure.
