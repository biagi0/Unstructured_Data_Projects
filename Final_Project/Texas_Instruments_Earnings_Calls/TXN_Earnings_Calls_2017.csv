Today's conference is being recorded. 
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead.",37
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2017",2017-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2767.0,1126634.0,46725884.0,Presenter Speech,Dave Pahl,,Executives,1,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter '16 and 2016 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's, Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. Also, with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1. Rafael joined TI in 2001 and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Masterâ€™s in Business Administration from Stanford University.
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown an average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We've all benefited and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael. 
I don't want to get too sentimental. But as this is Kevin's final earning call -- final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI's clearly a better company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael over the past decade and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO. 
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8, at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks, and Kevin and I will cover the rest. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continued. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02 and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue grew 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased due to Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year-ago quarter due to processors and Microcontrollers. Connectivity also grew. In our Other segment, revenue declined 9% from a year-ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators were about even. For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI's revenue for the year. 
We recently simplified the product lines inside our 2 business segments, Analog and Embedded, to align by product categories our customers think about, making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial. Analog is now comprised of 3 product lines instead of 4. These are: power, signal chain and High Volume Analog & Logic. 
Embedded goes from 3 product lines to 2. Connected MCU, which merges Connectivity and Microcontrollers, and Processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line level. Nothing changes at the segment level. 
To help you understand the structure, for 2016, within our Analog business, Power would've been about 45% of Analog revenue. Signal chain would have been about 35% and High Volume and Analog & Logic would have been the remaining 20%. Inside our Embedded business, connected MCU would've been about 55% of Embedded revenue, with Processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we'll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments. 
Now let me describe our performance by end market for 2016. Just as a reminder, we annually provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market. We break these into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. 
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6%, respectively, both even to last year, while Other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. 
For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we've been highly focused on a strategy where we've been allocating our capital and we've been driving initiatives to increase our market share in industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide the diversity and longevity of product, which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI's revenue, up from 44% just 2 years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied and are continuing to make improvements such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.",1278
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2017",2017-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2767.0,1126634.0,46725885.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.13 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year-ago, gross profit margin increased 400 basis points. 
Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Restructuring charges and Other was a $20 million net benefit, which included a gain related to an intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with the realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. 
Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had a total benefit of $228 million in the quarter. We recognized $188 million in other income and expense or OI&E, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and Other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included a $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, a $0.01 tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock compensation, and a $0.01 restructuring charge. 
This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report the tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When an employee stock options are exercised or when a restricted stock units vest, either an excess tax benefit or deficiency may be generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in income taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share, and for the year, a benefit of $0.13 per share. I will also note, this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.
I'll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results.",424
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2017",2017-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2767.0,1126634.0,46725886.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. 
Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends and repurchased $475 million of our stock, for a total return of $974 million. Total cash returned to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividends or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter, year-on-year, for 51 consecutive quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone: reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
I will now turn this back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks.",404
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2017",2017-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2767.0,1126634.0,46725887.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Rafael. Our orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue to be in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion in the first quarter. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standard that I mentioned earlier. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse of all new products positions, enabled important milestone for the year. This includes: solid revenue growth in our core business of Analog and Embedded; the expansion of 300-millimeter Analog production; gross margin improvement of 340 basis points; operating improvement of 300 basis points; free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points and continued free cash flow per share growth. 
We will continue to feed our advantages through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a very long time to come. 
Before I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI's performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. 
While you'll continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well, just as I have for all these years. 
With that let me turn it back to Dave.",385

Thanks for that question. And as you noted, automotive did grow over 20%. The great news is that, that wasn't due to one segment. I can say that growth was very diverse. It was diverse across the 5 sectors that we saw. It was diverse across customers and it also was very diverse across different product lines, so we really are excited about the opportunity of both automotive and industrial. And we're just very pleased that the investments that we made are really kind of providing a base from which we can grow upon. Do you have a follow-on?",101

If I look at the recent SIA industry data, total analog is likely to be up about 5% this year, about $47 billion -- I'm sorry, in 2016. Your Analog business was up about 2% last year. But obviously, the growth was impacted by your largest customer that had an inventory correction last year. If you strip this out, does the team think that they gained Analog market share? And if so, in which of the sub segments?",81

I think that when we look at our peers with the publicly reported data, we actually believe that we've performed quite well. So we're probably earlier in the reporting season.

Thanks for being patient, and I think the real reason you're leaving is you got tired of waiting for TI to hit my $12 stock price. But anyway, that's a joke for all of you who are listening. Just if you could just list, I guess the margin drivers, and maybe rank them from here as far as how much room or how much leverage you have in terms of mix versus 300-millimeter, versus utilization rates, versus depreciation?",84
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2017",2017-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2767.0,1126634.0,46725896.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,13,"Sure, Chris. I hope not to revisit that $12 stock price you were talking about. Margin drivers going forward. I think that there'll be several things happening. I think, we've enjoyed the last couple of years, depreciation coming down at the same time that the 300-millimeter starts have been going up. Those have clearly been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flatten out a bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It will still be down next year versus 2016, but not nearly as much as we've seen. What's a lot more important is the continued expansion of 300-millimeter production as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You've heard us, again, talk for a number of years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And so between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300-millimeter capacity, there's still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth. And as before we even talk about revenue growth. Of course, revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we've been investing in for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is underutilization charges are negligible, and so really it's just about follow through from revenue, straight to the bottom line. And that will especially happen to cash flow. Do you have a follow-on?",264

And for my follow-up, a longer term question on OpEx. So if we look at year-over-year, your SG&A trended down a little bit, R&D was up. You guys have said you were going to pile a little more money into R&D. Assuming revenue continues to grow, what can we expect from R&D and SG&A on a yearly basis? Do you feel comfortable with the level of R&D as it is right here? And could we expect SG&A to continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue assuming overall revenue growth?",92
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2017",2017-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2767.0,1126634.0,46725898.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,15,"Yes, Chris. That's actually a really good question. The last couple of years, OpEx is -- on an annual basis, ran about 23% of revenue. And as you noted, we had been internally reallocating resources, putting more efforts into the R&D areas. That'll continue for the next couple of quarters, and then begin to stabilize. And I would expect in 2017, all things being equal, we'll still operate around 23% of OpEx to revenue. Keep in mind that on the long haul, we expect our OpEx to probably fluctuate between 20% and 30%. So in very weak markets, it might be as high as 30%, and in very strong markets, it might be as low as 20%. In kind of stable markets we're in right now, I think the kind of OpEx percent you've seen the last 2 years is what you should expect going forward for the next year or 2.",152

Does that signify anything from a business standpoint in terms of the integration of the old national business? So just, should we think of there being any structural changes that goes along with that?",58

That's simply a question of realigning our products to the way that we have come to understand our customers prefer to look for them when they're trying to find products here at TI. And so if you look at the categories that we've lined up with, we now have power, we have signal chain and we have High Volume Analog & Logic. And that's really how we have learned our customers prefer to try to find products at TI. And so that allows us to give them better and faster support. Silicon Valley Analog products, along with High Performance Analog have been reallocated among those segments -- those new product lines that we just talked about. And so consequently, the best way to think about this is how do we react faster and more thoroughly to customer inquiries and searches for parts inside our portfolio. But a vast portfolio like ours, it's really important for us to be sure that we're aligned as efficiently as possible for customers to get to the parts they need and want. Follow-on?",188

And then, just returning to the growth in autos. I guess, we see the peer group as growing sort of high single digits, maybe a little bit better.

And Joe, this isn't -- as you know, you've been tracking our revenues inside of that market for some time. It's not something that just happened this quarter, right? We've been having very strong growth inside of automotive. And that is a result of how we allocate capital. We have, for some time, been directing investments and increases both in automotive and industrial. And that's because we think that those are the 2 markets that are going to provide growth not just for us, but in our industry. And as you know, these are long-tail type of design wins and revenue streams. And we're very intentionally, as I mentioned earlier, trying to direct our investments.

But there's been I guess, talk more recently about stimulus, better GDP growth under the new administration. And I'm curious how do you think your distributors would react under that scenario?

We look at the talk of stimulus with some anticipation of a positive boost to the economy. But frankly, we think it's probably too early to figure out what that might be and how it might manifest itself. A lot of that stimulus seems to be focused towards infrastructure. And so if in fact, it does wind up there, that'll further benefit our industrial portfolio. More important to us is to watch what's happening on the tax front. And hopefully, we'll finally get some tax relief out of Washington, which will be a significant benefit to our shareholders.",117

And Romit, I'll just add that if you look -- as I said, inventory was even with where we ended last year. It was actually down, sequentially. So reflected in our numbers really has no restocking inside of it. And I would just say that the inventory levels that they have, the inventory levels that we have, just reflect an environment where we've got good product availability. And because of our investments in capacity ahead of demand, if these things do show up and turn into more significant growth going forward, we're ready to be able to support that.",100

And to Rafael too, congrats on the promotion. Looking at Analog business in the fourth quarter, Dave, it was up 10% year-over-year. But you said HVAL was flat.

So I think if you look at year-over-year by end market. Personal electronics was down slightly due to mobile phones. So if you back out mobile phones, actually, personal electronics was up slightly. So that was the main reason that we saw that. You could kind of see that inside of Analog. And that weakness in mobile phones was not just inside of HVAL, but you saw that, to a lesser extent, inside of power. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?",82

The reallocation is mostly coming out of SG&A as we go forward. So it's just a mix inside of that.

Can you talk to about us in terms of where you are on 300-millimeter utilization versus a year ago? Particularly, given the amount of expansion that you're doing. How much, I guess, room do you still have to grow there? And how does that compare to where you were a year ago?",76

Stacy, I think that we have talked about between the Richardson factory, which we call RFAB and DMOS6, the Dallas location. Combined, we have about $8 billion in revenue-generating capacity in those factories combined. We have continued to increase starts meaningfully on 300-millimeter for Analog. And that is really going to be picking up pace. More and more of the new products that we're releasing are being released on 300-millimeter. And the economics, as you are well aware are very compelling. I mean, the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So the total finished product is about 20% less, which adds meaningfully not only to gross margins, but especially to free cash flow, because that just falls straight through unimpeded. So again our starts continue to increase. We continue to have a lot of capacity available to us, but more importantly, we have a lot of new devices in the pipeline being released on the 300-millimeter. And that all coming together will probably continue to accelerate the rate of starts. And therefore, the rate of fall-through that we'll get from that manufacturing line.",192

I want to touch a bit on the accounting changes. And it seems to be included in both the earnings as well as the share count. The diluted share count went up this quarter for the first time in forever, but it sounds like it was boosted by 5 million shares or so as you said by the accounting change. So how should we think about that I guess, going through 2017? Is it still something like a $0.03 or $0.04 per quarter benefit that's going to sort of sustain kind of into perpetuity? And in terms of the share count, was this sort of like a kind of onetime step up? And should we still think about shares declining going forward even given, I guess, the increased dividends that reduced buybacks?",136

So Stacy, just a little bit more background on the -- this GAAP change. It's going to impact all companies, beginning -- who haven't already implemented beginning with first quarter 2017 reported. So we basically early adopted by one quarter. The idea is try to help with better comparability for 2016 and '17. That being said, it does cause reported earnings to increase because of this tax benefit. It also mathematically requires that you compute your diluted [ph] share count differently and to add about 5 million shares to our diluted [ph] share count just compliant to the new calculation rules. In 2016, had we applied the same GAAP at the beginning of the year, it would have added $0.04 to the first quarter, $0.03 to the second quarter, $0.04 in the fourth quarter and added $0.01 -- excuse me, $0.04 in the third quarter and added $0.01 to the fourth quarter for a total of $0.13 for the year. The way that we would recommend that you model this for purposes of analyzing the company going forward, is similar to what we're doing and that is just look at what happened last year and use that same set of assumptions for next year. I'm pretty sure it'll wind up being different when we close the books on those assumptions. But that's the best way to model. So consequently, we had $0.04 that would have occurred in the first quarter of 2016. And the guidance that we've just offered for the first quarter of 2017, we've included $0.04 and we will suggest that you do the same thing.",269

So I think it's a little bit hard for us to be able to characterize what that might do. What I can say is that any form of relief will be beneficial directly to our shareholders because it'll simply expand our free cash flow. And as Rafael just commented, our commitment remains as it has been, and that's to return 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. So any form, whether it's border tax adjustments or actual lowering of the overall tax brackets, clearly, will be beneficial to our shareholders. And I'm looking forward to seeing that happen.",145

So first, Vivek, I'd just point out that when we look at the overall macro environment, we really don't see something that has significantly changed in some time. So we continue to believe that we are operating in a very similar macro environment that we have -- that we have been. If you look at inside of the quarter, demand came in stronger, really across most markets and businesses. The only notable exception as I talked about before was personal electronics came in about as we expected. And to your point, we've seen choppiness in particular markets. And some of that more recently has been driven by one large customer. You can roll back the clock not too long ago into last year. We saw some choppiness in comms equipment. Before that, we had a PC XP refresh cycle that came to an end. And none of those were really tied to the overall economy. They were just very specific things going on within specific markets. So that's really the environment that we think that we're operating in now.",180

Kevin, I guess, my first question is just looking at the op margins on the Embedded business. You did a great job throughout calendar year '16 as you grew that business to drive leverage and upside to the operating margins. But there's still a pretty healthy gap between the op margins and Embedded and those and Analog. Is that still just a matter of getting more scale in the Embedded business? Or how do we think about those op margins closing over time?",92

I think the best way to think about it is, what we have been talking about for a number of years, which means we stepped up investment in that area a number of years back. And then we readjusted the investment, especially for the base station marketplaces. And since then, we think we've got the investment levels about right. So it really is a question of continuing to get leverage from revenue growth falling all the way through to op margins as you point out, but again, what we focus on it falls through unimpeded to free cash flow. And that's the real focus there. So there's nothing inherent that keeps it from continuing to improve. In fact, I would not be surprised to see if the team there continued to improve on that as they completely understand the leverage capability they have on the invested -- investment base they have right now.",155

If you look at your revenue holistically over time, it's become significantly less volatile. But that other bucket has jumped around a lot, quarter-on-quarter.

I think if you look for a -- look at it for the full year, it decreased 3% year-on-year. And as we had talked about before. When you look at the history, it had declined more like in the mid-teens. And that was primarily as the legacy Wireless products had unwound. And we expect kind of going forward that we'd be somewhere in a mid-single-digit decline. There is seasonality inside of the other business. It's driven primarily by calculators. They have a very strong seasonality due to back-to-school. And then, we also have royalties inside of there that could be choppy every once in a while, so those are the types of things. But overall when you look at it much like this year, we saw a 3% decline, it's probably similar to what we would expect to see going forward.",142

Actually, if you look at the actual numbers, I know you're using the rounded numbers that we gave you. It's more like the mid-single digits.

When we look at -- down into the details of the 14 sectors, we actually did see growth in most of those sectors for the year.

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. 
Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with the weak year ago quarter. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses.  Earnings per share were $0.97, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all 3 product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago, due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with the weak year-ago  quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago  and sequential period. And then, lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they will provide diversity and longevity of product, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",600

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.14 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue. And on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.8% of revenue in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.25 billion or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12 months free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for 52 consecutive quarters. 
In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
Before moving to Q&A, there are 3 changes that I want to explain to-- to help to better -- to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adapted a new GAAP standard that impact the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our respective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impacts. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance, just as we did this quarter. 
To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and is what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term models. 
Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates, which include discrete tax items, translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter, as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter-to-quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete task items as well as their retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully, providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard. 
The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in Other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website. 
The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in Other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. There were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as Other income and expense, rather than in revenue, as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results. 
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",1213

Auto, solid market for the team last year, with that end market up 23%. I think, you mentioned that it's up double digits again in March. You've got a very diversified business here as well.

Just wanted to get the team's sense on the health of this market kind of near to midterm.",85

Definitely, as we stated in the opening remarks that we saw our demand for our products and automotive continues to be strong. And so like you said, we've built that business across a very diverse set of sectors and, in fact, we've got 5 sectors inside of automotive. So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive. And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think, most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1% of -- a little more than 1% of the sales price of the car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year time frame have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's why we continue to invest in it and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far.",181

I'll handle that one. On OpEx, everything came in about as expected. What I would tell you, the way you want to think about OpEx high level, we've talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenue; and in stable markets at the lower end of that, the lower half. And that's exactly what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're just below that. So as you think forward, you should model us along those lines. If you're thinking kind of on a tactical level, first and second, I would remind you that second quarter does have 3 months of higher-paying benefit raises versus only 2 months in the first quarter. So you may have some of that played in kind of similar to what happened last year, maybe a little less than that.",157

On your capital management update from a month or 2 ago, you'd given some indicators that were 300-millimeter loading was, but it only went up a little bit in 2016. I think, it went from about $2.2 billion year-over-year to $2.5 billion, so maybe $300 million, suggesting a good amount of headroom left for that transition to continue. How should we expect that trajectory to evolve this year in 2017? Is it just dependent on growth? Is there volume in 200-millimeter that's ramping down as 300-millimeter is ramping up? How should we think about where that might end up exiting this year in a normal demand environment?",111
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2017",2017-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2825.0,1177936.0,48463417.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,14,"Yes, Stacy. In the capital management update, if you remember, we talked about the fact that we've put in place about $8 billion of 300-millimeter capacity. Last year we had, as you stated, about $2.5 billion. So we're in a great position to be able to support growth. And essentially, we've been releasing for some time now, really probably going back to 2010, almost all of our new Analog products to 300-millimeter. So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter. And if you look at last year, that came pretty close to what happened. So we had about $300 million of growth. So it was very consistent with that. So thanks, Stacy.",153

I think the comm equipment was the only market you kind of gave sequential color. I'm just kind of curious if you can talk a little bit about the sequential growth into March. It was well above seasonal. And sort of in the same vein, to your guidance in June, you're sort of guiding below seasonal. So how should we think about that from an end market perspective?",92

So a couple of things. We thought the comms equipment market has been choppy in recent past, so we thought that, that would be helpful and that's why we provided it. If I just kind of comment on the other markets sequentially, automotive market, as we said, continued to be strong and increased with most of the sectors growing. Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we ship into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that sits inside of that. So it's very, very broad-based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even. So when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat. The high end of the guidance suggest that it would be up 9%. But -- and if you look at that, John, on a year-on-year basis, it's -- the low end would be up 4% and the high end would be up 13%. So we think that, that's a fairly robust growth inside of the second quarter. So you have a follow-on, John?",230

And I guess, as my follow-on, I might have missed this and I apologize, but did you give an orders number for the quarter?

So orders were up 14% year-on-year to $3.5 billion. They were up about 2% sequentially. And I think from a lead time standpoint, our lead times have remained stable. And just as important as that, our on-time delivery metrics also remain very high. So our shipping to our commitments that we make to customers remain very high. So with that said, we do have some isolated process and package combinations where lead times have stretched. But we work very aggressively on those.

We looked at -- well, we're considering options in looking at things, but that's to be an opportunity that's focused on industrial, that's focused on automotive, catalog type of parts, Analog catalog.

We talked about that the demand was driven from the strength that we saw in industrial market as well as automotive. That represented about 70% of the growth. And certainly, we did benefit and see growth inside of personal electronics off of the easy compare, as we all remember a year ago that we were working through an inventory correction with -- in that particular end market. So the great news is that's very consistent with what we saw inside of Analog. And so the growth is very, very broad-based. So we've got contributions from the industrial market, contributions from the automotive market and as well as we did see contributions from the personal electronics market. So you have a follow-on?",138

I guess, just from the automotive segment, could you just talk about -- there's a way to think about maybe what percent of your auto revenues today are infotainment-centric versus more mainly driven around fuel efficiency or battery management or safety?

That's a great question, Amit, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on it. I think that the great thing that we've been trying to do or the thing we've been trying to do and why we're happy with the results is that our automotive business isn't just built on just either infotainment or an ADAS business, but really is broad-based. So when we look at kind of the order or the sizes of those businesses, infotainment is the largest, safety systems is the second, followed by advanced driver assistance systems, then PowerTrain, which includes hybrid and electric, and then body electronics and lighting. So -- and if you dive into any one of those areas, it's not dominated by one technology or one product. And we've got more than half of our 60 to 70 product lines that ship products into the automotive business. So we're very diverse from a product standpoint. We're also very diverse from a geography standpoint as well. So we're really seeing the benefit and additional revenue growth from all of the geos.",180

I got on a little bit late, so just have a point of clarification. In terms of the royalty commentary, the $30 million, was that all included for Q1 as well?

As you think of the company on a go-forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth. And that's why we're focused on industrial and automotive. Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the content growth of semiconductors in those spaces. Now beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300-millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage. And that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin, but more importantly, higher free cash flow. And then free cash flow per share that we can return to the owners of the company.",147

So in response to an earlier question on the, I guess, the stronger-than-expected revenue. So are you telling us that your automotive business was responsible for the upside in Q1 on revenue and comm was a little weak? And then on the Q2 guide, you're basically guiding up, like, 4.5%. That's below seasonality and also below what you guided sequentially for last year. So you're not seeing any weakness or no change in the Q2 forecast over the last [ like ] month?",89
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2017",2017-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2825.0,1177936.0,48463441.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,38,"Yes. So the first is that our revenue came inside of our guidance, and so we didn't really have any surprises there. If you look at all of the businesses, and if you look at the end markets, we really saw strength across the board, Chris. So there really wasn't an area that we would point to that singularly drove the revenues in the quarter or from the midpoint of the guidance, if you will. So very broad-based overall. And then, secondly, again, I think, going back to John's question, when we look at our sequential growth rates of kind of low end of flat to up 9%, or on a year-on-year basis of 4% to 13%, we think that, that's a pretty strong second quarter. So do you have a follow-on?",132

I think, you've talked about currently being outfitted for somewhere around $18 billion in revenue capacity. What sort of revenue level would you start to need to order more equipment? I assume you wouldn't wait until you're 100% utilized before you start to put those orders in. Is it 90% utilization, 95%? Maybe give us some color there.",63

But we think of our strategy, as stated out in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand. And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet. This capacity, we can buy. When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment, we can buy pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal. But the upside potential is tremendous for reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall-through that we get to free cash flow. So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions.",115

And I'll just add, Chris. Like you pointed out, we had little over $13 billion in revenue last year. We've got just under about $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity. We have open 200-millimeter capacity inside of that footprint. So we've got plenty of room to grow for some time. But like Rafael said, if we had the opportunity tomorrow to buy another wafer fab or make a large purchase and it was at the right price, we'd make that move because it is an asymmetrical bet.",88

When you look at the guidance -- well, actually, just looking at the overall business, you're not the only ones seeing double-digit year-over-year growth in all of your businesses even if you're taking out personal electronics,  the rest of the business is strong, and the commentary actually would suggest that it remains strong. So I guess, kind of 2 parts here. One, how do you fill the gap between what -- I know there's content gains in semis, but between what some of the end markets are doing, do you think -- what's your perspective as you look out the rest of the year? Do you think the semi market is a little ahead of itself? And then, I guess, as you look at your June guidance, did you guys apply any sort of conservatism to that guidance to account for anything along those lines?",154

So I think, if you walk through the end markets, Blayne, as we've commented, automotive has remained strong. You saw that, that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just 1 OEM or 1 car model or 1 end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning. When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We talked -- already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad-based. Others are seeing it as well. So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double-ordering or seeing inventories build? I'll just make the comment that, overall, the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So we have no indications that inventories are growing or double-ordering. But I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier, our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility in the distribution inventory. And as I commented earlier, that remained steady, about 4 weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's  in real good shape. Our visibility in the customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, it's actually our inventory. They pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that, that would suggest that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course, beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course, is very low. So as we've been doing for a long time, with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focus on keeping lead time steady and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on?",421

We're -- as I mentioned before, we're very intentionally trying to make investments across a very broad number of areas. So they include things that are very popular like ADAS systems and infotainment systems, but also embody electronics and lighting. So those are -- we've commented before that, that includes areas like turn signals. There's a couple of dollars of content in an LED turn signal and our sales teams get pretty excited about things like that. But also, sensors on door handles, and inside of the infotainment system, the touch buttons to control the AC or the audio system, haptics systems that may sit inside of the steering wheel or in driver seats and LED lighting inside of a car. There's a lot of areas. So we're really trying to direct that investment to be very, very broad-based. Do you have a follow-on, David?",147

So I'll resist the temptation to bore you and run you through those. But if I just take one, like, medical as an example, that sits inside of there, there's literally hundreds of end equipments that will fit inside of medical. And if you think at the high end or maybe magnetic resonance imaging machine that may sell for millions of dollars, and then all the way down at the other end, you have a blood glucose meter that will sell for less than $50. So we actually have over 100 different end equipments that will fit inside of a sector like medical. And as we make investments, we look to funnel those investments, not just in one area like -- something like factory automation and control as an example. We really want to funnel those investments on a very broad basis.",143

And again, I think we're advantaged because we've got a large portion of our revenues on consignment, so we're actually controlling that inventory up and to the point that it gets pulled. We also, for many customers, we'll get long-term forecasts. Those consignment forecasts literally sometimes can be on an hourly basis, but certainly on a daily or weekly basis, and typically go out for 6 months in some cases. Now that doesn't mean that they can't change very quickly, and we've seen that before in the past, and they can strengthen or weaken. And that usually happens very quickly.

And in your last filing, you mentioned that you would be reallocating from manufacturing, as well as SG&A, into R&D. So just kind of a 2-part question.

Let me address the second part of that question first. That's clear. We've been focusing on industrial and automotive. That's where we have been biased in our investment for a number of years and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets. And now, over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive. So those investments are paying off. On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comment. We like our stated goal or our model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investment. There are investments in sales, in the sales force and ti.com and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx, 20% to 30%. In stable times, 22 -- in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%. And we have been running like that for now 27 months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx.

And I'll just add, Ambrish. As you know, when we look at making investments, whether it's in R&D or in OpEx, as we pointed out in our capital management presentation that we gave earlier, investing in the business is a top priority. So -- and what we're trying to do, as Rafael indicated by market, but we also want to strengthen our core competitive advantages. So those will include the first one, which is manufacturing and technology, ensuring that we're developing great process technologies and strengthening our position with 300-millimeter. The breadth of the portfolio is the second, and we've talked about that a lot and how that plays out through industrial and automotive. The third is the reach of our marketing channels and strengthening that, and that continues to be our investment in ti.com, as well as how that's coupled with our sales force and apps teams. And then we want all those things to lead to diversity and longevity. And that will lead to good free cash flow per share growth, and that's really what we want to do. Did you have a follow-up?",187

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web, and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18%, and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18%, primarily due to growth in power and signal chain, each of which grew about the same amount. High volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digit. Industrial demand continued to strengthen, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew, while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, which are the end markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they'll provide diversity and longevity of product, which translate to a high turnover value of the portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",570
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2017",2017-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2378.0,1252795.0,50757679.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.37 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, the gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.48 billion or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, which included a $28 million discrete tax benefit, above what we expected.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range. Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months, and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to owners. In the quarter, we retired $375 million of debt, and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issued $600 million of debt in 2 tranches: $300 million each in 4-year and 7-year notes. This leaves total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entity owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.18, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31% compared with our prior expectation of about 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assume no discrete tax -- no discrete items and is what you will need to use as the starting point for your longer-term model. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rate you should use for your 2017 models. I will also remind analysts who are beginning to work with 2018 models that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we are projecting for the third and fourth quarters of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate a 2018 annual operating tax rate, start with 2017 PBT tax of 31% and apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then, model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others.
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",876

For automotive, basically, it increased sequentially with all sectors growing. Industrial, again, we saw a very broad-based growth and -- across the sectors. And overall, it also increased. Personal electronics increased with most sectors growing, communications equipment was about even sequentially, and enterprise systems also grew. Do you have a follow-on?",53

So you talked in the past about R&D potentially being a little bit elevated near term. Now you guys came in slightly below our model for the quarter. How much longer could R&D be elevated in order to invest in the business?",44

First, I would point out that -- I know you're asking about R&D. But let me address it from an OpEx standpoint. We look at OpEx as a model, and our model is 20 -- to be between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable times to be at the lower half of that. In fact, that's where we've been in the last 2.5 years or so, 23% to 22%. Now we're running at 22% of revenue. And again, in stable times, we think we can operate there. Now inside of that, there -- both in R&D and actually in SG&A, we have various investments that are strengthening our competitive advantages. On the R&D front, we continue to focus on industrial and automotive to continue to broaden our portfolio. On the SG&A side, we invested on -- to increase the reach of our channels, ti.com in particular. So we are thinking that we're going to continue to make those investments to strengthen the company.",169

First question, maybe could you contrast auto's demand now versus, say, maybe 6 months ago? And industrial is an even larger market for you guys, and auto tends to get all the attention. Just wondering, do they correlate at all? Can industrial offset any potential demand fluctuations in autos? And then, I have a follow-up.",62
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2017",2017-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2378.0,1252795.0,50757688.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,11,"Sure, yes. So the strength that we've seen inside of automotive is something that we've seen for, probably, greater than 4 years now. So I would attribute that to our early focus on that market, the breadth of our technologies and really just the overall diversity of our position. So we've got 5 sectors inside of automotive that we're investing in, so that includes infotainment; safety systems; ADAS or advanced driver assist systems; PowerTrain, which include EV and hybrid; and body, electronics and lighting. So we're seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market. And really also diversity across subsystem suppliers across car companies across geographical regions. So we feel really good about that. Very similar story inside of industrial, very broad-based growth. I won't speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles or not. But both do have increasing content. So I'd be a little cautious to think that, that increasing content could offset a correction that we may see in a near term in any 1 given quarter or even in any 1 given year. But we believe that there will be more content there over the longer term when you're looking 5 and 10 years, and that's why our investments are higher there. Do you have a follow-on?",218

My second question is more on your free cash flow growth. I'm just curious why -- if you're looking on a trailing 12-month basis why free cash flow hasn't grown, year-on-year despite your core Analog and embedded businesses growing in the low double-digit range. And what's the catalyst for maybe getting that back to the higher single digit, maybe low double-digit range?",63

Thanks for this, Rafael. Thanks for a chance to clarify that. First, in any given quarter, you're going to have puts and takes on free cash on any line of the P&L but particularly on the cash flow statement. In this particular quarter and also on a trailing 12-month basis, what you see there is that we had an increased tax payment in 2Q '17 that was primarily due to our outlook for higher profitability this year.",78

So your revenue is basically back to where it was in the third -- or I guess, a little bit higher than it was than the third quarter last year, but the gross margins were 230 basis points higher. Can you just kind of give us the reasons why they're higher? And then what would be the gross margin drivers going forward?",69
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2017",2017-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2378.0,1252795.0,50757693.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,16,"Yes, sure. I'll be happy to address that. So our gross margins in the second quarter of '17 ended at 64.3%, and that was 300 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. And that's just reflects the quality of our product portfolio as we continue to focus on automotive and industrial, but also, the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. And as you know, we are -- we have the unique advantage of having a 300-millimeter factory that at the chip level, provides a 40% cost advantage. As of 2016, we had about $2.5 billion of our revenue running to 300-millimeter, and as we continue to grow the company, and in this case, Analog in particular, and that growth primarily runs through 300-millimeter, then we're going to accrue that benefit over and over and over. And It's an a cumulative benefit that really yields some nice results to the gross margin line, but even more important, to the free cash flow and free cash flow per share for the owners of the company.",174

Well, I would say, in general, I'm not sure we could see that if it was there. But I'll just remind you that about 60% of our revenues are on consignment. So we've got no inventory of our products sitting in front of the customer's production line that they own. We may have a position that it sits on our balance sheet. And same thing with distributors. But we actually do get demand forecast from them, and those oftentimes will be several months out, sometimes even as far as 6 months out. And that doesn't mean that they can't change. And I'd say, for that, where we do have very good visibility, won't see anything unusual going on inside of there, no unusual expedites or cancellations or those types of things.

So again, I'll make the comment that we've got 60% of our revenues on consignment. So there, we actually don't have orders or backlogs. We only see that -- those demand forecasts.

Year-over-year, revenue was up in all regions, so Asia, Europe, the U.S. and Japan on a year-over-year basis. And that was true, additionally, on a sequential basis. So we saw growth very -- really across the board there. And just as a reminder, some know this well, some don't, that we track our revenue on where we ship it. So it's not where that product is ultimately consumed. So we may ship into a car manufacturer or Tier 1 car manufacturer in Europe, and that car may end up and be sold in China as an example. So really, it's not a good look through for end consumption by market. Do you have a follow-on?",117

So on embedded, strong year-over-year growth in sales. I think you're operating profitability was up something like almost 600 basis points year-over-year.

First off, historically, you guys have always talked about this 30 to 40 basis points of share gain, I think, on an annual basis. I'm just wondering, given the inflection of R&D higher over the last several quarters now, should we start to think about share gains potentially accelerating? Or share gains happening in places where the margin profile is much richer? And when do you see those benefits starting to transfer for you guys on the revenue line?",87
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2017",2017-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2378.0,1252795.0,50757709.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,32,"Well, I'll take a shot at that, and if Rafael wants to add something, he can jump in. I would just say that, as we look and allocate R&D, we're allocating those to the best projects that we can find ones that are going to produce, get designed into the most customers into the most markets and have longevity of revenue. And really mostly, that's about finding better opportunities to invest in and trying to just double the number of products as an example that we're doing. But we have found more opportunities to make investments. It's the things as our products live longer and repurposed product into adjacent markets, we found opportunities to be able to do that. So -- and I'd say, just in general, the quality of the opportunity sure doesn't shift very quickly. And -- so we're not penciling in an inflection point inside of our revenue. But when we look at our competitive advantages -- and I'd just say, just as a reminder, all 4 of those working together and the investments that we're making, and that includes the manufacturing and technology, the most visible one there is the 300-millimeter advantage that we have, the broad product portfolio and just the tens of thousands of products that we've got the opportunity to sell more products to more customers, the reach of the channel market, including ti.com that Rafael had mentioned earlier, as well as our sales force, and then, just the diverse and long-lived positions, all those working together, I think, gives us confidence that in the future that we can continue to gain share in that range of 30 to 40 basis points.",279

The only thing I would add is, as you know and we talked about it quite a bit, we've been focusing on automotive and industrial for quite some time now because those are the best markets. They have the highest semiconductor content growth. And we're confident that we'll continue to have that for many years to come. So as of the end of last year, 51% of our revenue was automotive and industrial, and obviously, with the growth that we're seeing year-to-date, that number appears to be ticking up, that percentage. So as that number increases and we continue driving performance on those 2 segments, then mathematically overall, our revenue will do better.",114

But last 4 quarters, I think in a row, you guys have been pretty much behind the revenue guide that you guys initially provide. Is there a change in the way you provide guide? Have you rolled up the revenue forecast that things have actually ended up at the high end for 4 quarters in a row? Or it just happened to be the case?",76

When we look at the out quarter again, we've got 60% of the revenue that we don't have order patterns to look at, but we can actually see the demand patterns that our customers have. And that can move in both directions pretty quickly, right? So even though we've got great visibility there, things can strengthen or weaken very quickly on us. But we do have very, very good visibility for that 60% of our revenue. And the rest of that, we look at -- we do look at the backlog. We look at order patterns. Our sales teams provide forecasts as well so we go through a bottoms-up and a tops-down approach. So the revenue guidance that we gave you for the third quarter is our best estimate of what we think we'll do.",140

But wondering if you can just talk a little bit about OpEx trends going into the September quarter. Typically, it's a seasonally down quarter for OpEx. I'm just kind of curious is that how we should be thinking about modeling it this September? Or are there some incentive or variable bonus offsets that might have be -- actually have OpEx flatter up sequentially?",70

As you know, we don't guide specifically on OpEx or GPM, any line for that matter, other than revenue and EPS. But on OpEx, and I should say, on OpEx we focus on the model, the 20% to 30%, and we've been operating on the lower half of that. So we like you guys to think about it that way. I would tell you though, if we had anything unusual going on in OpEx, we would point that out second to third, and we do not. And we also don't have anything like vacation or compensation adjustments that sometimes -- or we do see fourth to first, for example, we do not have that going on in the second to third transition.",132

Dave, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the auto market. Because clearly, over the last several years, it's been one of the better growing business for semis, but there have been some sort of mix data points. SAAR is decelerating. You've seen some auto manufacturers actually cutting forecast in the back half of the year. So I guess, how do you think about kind of SAAR unit growth versus content growth? And how is the visibility there? And are you seeing things that others would have highlighted last week on their conference call?",105

So the one thing that's been clear, our business has grown very strong for 4-years-plus now. So -- and that's really due to the early investments that we had made inside of this market and we continue to make. And again, we're trying to ensure that we're making those investments as broad as we can, so we're not dependent on one particular technology or one type of portion of the demand that's increasing. And clearly, the -- I think it's well known that SC content has grown faster inside of autos, and geez, if you just go down into a showroom, you can see that pretty clearly in any car today versus even just a few years ago. So we're confident that, that trend will continue. And we've also seen the announcements, like you've mentioned, that some car companies have reduced their build plan. But we certainly continue to monitor those markets overall. But we're confident in our long-term position there, and we'll continue to make those investments.",169

And this is you're kind enough always when we have this topic comes up every couple of quarters, and not surprisingly, we're in an economic expansion for a while now. Top of the cycle.

So I would say that if you look, again, inside of distribution, our inventory there remains at about 4 weeks. It's actually down sequentially and down from 1 year ago. Our visibility in the customers' inventory is, of course, varies depending on if we're on consignment or not. So with our consigned OEMs, we're not seeing anything that's unusual there, such as expedites that would suggest that we have an issue. And of course, our visibility into inventory beyond what customers manufacture in their operations is very low overall. So again, cancellations remain low. Lead times continue to remain steady. So all of those metrics, I think, really are very similar to what we saw 90 days ago.",119

This is Rafael. What I would tell you is that in any given quarter, default terms will be a little different. In a company the size of ours, there's just a lot of puts and takes inside this big P&L. The more important thing to remember is that we have some fundamental structural drivers that are -- have increased our GPM percent. And we think we're going to continue increasing our GPM percent for the foreseeable future. And those are the quality of the portfolio as we continue to focus on the best markets, automotive and industrial, and the diversity and positions -- long-lived positions that we get with those, where we invest R&D today, and we get the revenue for decades to come. And then, the other piece is a 300-millimeter Analog, as I stated earlier, that is 40% more cost-efficient than 200-millimeter. And that accrues, meaning you start in one part on that and then the next part, you start it on 300, and the third part and the fourth part and you -- next thing you know, a bigger percentage of your company is running on 300-millimeter. And it was only 30% as of 2016, the 30% of the capacity that we have on 300 was used. So we have ample room to continue growing 300-millimeter and accrue benefit to the company.",226

Yes. So comms equipment is 13% of our total revenue. Wireless infrastructure will be a sector inside of that, which tends to take a lot of the calls. It's more than half of that end market by itself, so probably somewhere in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue. And there, I think, when we look at incremental dollars of where we're investing, if I refer you back to our capital management call that we gave back in February, we talked about the fact that we wanted to increase incrementally dollars in both the industrial and automotive markets because that's where we believe the growth will be. With communications equipment, I would say that we've got some caveats depending on which business we're looking at. In embedded, I'd say those investments are down versus where they were maybe 5 years ago. But on the same view, inside of Analog, they're actually up because of some of the complexity that's being developed inside of the radio. So we do believe that, that market will continue to provide great opportunities for us for a very long period of time. But we just don't believe that there's going to be significant growth. We don't know of any carriers that want to take up their CapEx over the next 5 and 10 years over a longer period of time.

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the Industrial and Automotive market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion, which together reflect our commitment to return all our free cash flow to our owners.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E, which began in the first quarter of 2017. 
Now we'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew primarily due to servers. 
We continue to focus our strategy on the Industrial and Automotive market where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that Industrial and Automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",599
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2017",2017-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2119.0,1319497.0,52993799.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million and, on a trailing 12-month basis, were 22% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.79 billion or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing, was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best, sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to our earnings per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of third quarter. 
For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividend or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases and our recent announcement to increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 118, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website, under the Financial summary data section. 
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn back to Dave.",812

I'd just remind you that whenever we have something that's been unusual, whether that's been by market or by sector or sometimes even by customer, we've been pretty clear on that and we'd share it. And we have got nothing to share. So I'll just point out that if you look at the range of our guidance, that's going to vary and can comprehend several different scenarios. And at the midpoint, on a year-on-year basis, we'll grow about 9%, which we consider to be pretty robust. So do you have a follow-on?",115

Thanks for giving me an opportunity to talk about that. The -- on free cash flow, it grew 4% on a trailing 12-month basis. And that is compared to a higher number for the revenue on the same basis. And the difference is higher working capital, particularly accounts receivables and tax payments. If you look at the accounts receivable from 3Q '15 to 3Q '16, that actually drained, whereas from 3Q '16 to 3Q '17, it built. So that is a use -- source of cash in one case and a use of cash in another case but -- and in the case of the tax payments, we had a higher -- disproportionately higher tax payments in the most recent comparison versus the previous trailing 12-month comparison.",129

Clearly, the demand trends are pretty strong in the markets that you serve. Maybe you could just talk about the demand trends from a geographical perspective.

I would say that certainly, the demand was broad-based. If you look across our product lines, we've got 65 to 70 different product lines, and the demand was very strong across those as well as strong across the regions. So we had revenue up in 3 of the 4 regions year-on-year in Europe, Asia and the U.S. And it was about even in Japan. So -- and again, I'll just always remind that when we give regional color, that's where we ship the product. That's what we can measure. Where that product actually ends up from a regional standpoint, we really don't have visibility into. Do you have a follow-on?",112

Thanks for the color there. On the OpEx front, great operating leverage. You drove 12% sequential growth in sales, but your OpEx declined by 3%. So you guys are driving some serious leverage here. The OpEx as a percent of sales is actually just below your target range. And so I guess the question is, what drove the sequential decline in the OpEx? And how should we think about the OpEx profile just over the next few quarters?",79
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2017",2017-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2119.0,1319497.0,52993810.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,13,"Yes, I'll take that. For OpEx, we think of that in terms of -- from a model standpoint, we think of it as a percent of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. And for the last couple of years, we've actually been running at about 23%. And in the current trailing 12 months, we're about 22% of revenue. So we have said that in a stable environment which we are, we can run in the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%. So we've been running at about 22%. So that's well within that. Now of course, OpEx -- to us, OpEx are investments. And obviously, that goes for R&D. But even inside of G&A, we think of a large portion there as investments. So in R&D, of course, we're focusing on Industrial and Automotive because those are the best markets where the semiconductor growth is happening. But on the G&A front, we have many investments there on ti.com and the demand creation just to continue building on our reach of channels, reach of markets, competitive advantage that we have talked about. Before we go to the next caller, I'd like to just make a comment on the previous question on our working capital. I want to stress that while our accounts receivables increased in that last comparison, the delta -- days sales outstanding actually decreased by 1 day. So it's at 34. So that just goes to show you the -- how healthy the accounts receivable balance is. I wanted just to clarify that.",257

If you look at Industrial, it increased with most sectors growing. And again, we've got 14 sectors there, so fairly broad-based. Automotive increased with most sectors growing.

Just a question on the report here. So your September quarter revenues exceeded the high end of your prior guidance and it's the first time in about a year that's happened. However, gross margins expanded just 20 basis points. I think we were expecting more. So given the magnitude of revenue beat, why didn't higher revenues result in more than 20 basis points of gross margin fall-through?",68

What I would tell you is that generally, what we suggest and what we recommend to analysts and investors to think about, our fall-through is in the 70% to 75% range, but that is over the long haul, over a relatively long amount of time. In any one quarter, that fall-through can be a little different. Now, for example, in the comparison versus a year ago, which arguably -- I would argue it's more relevant and to have more time obviously in between, that was close to an 85% fall-through, right. The increase in gross margin was 240 basis points, just as an example, as a comparison to the sequential basis.",112

I'm wondering if you could kind of comment to what extent you think that's share gains, to what extent you think that is just easy compares, to what extent you think that might be a little bit of overheating relative to customer order activity. And you did a fantastic job on your own balance sheet kind of managing inventories. I'm wondering if you could give us some color around customer inventory levels.",105

So John, I think that if you look at general market conditions, they're similar to 90 days ago and certainly continue to remain strong. However, I think it's still yet to be seen how long that will extend, over how long of a period of time. So we've got no indications of inventories growing or double ordering. And like I pointed out last quarter, history suggests we never really see that -- those types of things ahead of time. But I think, again, it's important to qualify what we can see. So we've got really good visibility into our distributors' inventory and that remains at about 4 weeks. It's even both sequentially and year-on-year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary depending if we're on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet. And we don't see any unusual signals or other things like expedites that would suggest that there's issues inside of that. And our visibility, of course, in inventory beyond that and down our customers' channels, we just can't see that, of course. So we just remain focused as we have for a long time, focusing on both our internal manufacturing and internal inventory strategies. And we're focused on trying to keep lead times steady, which they have, delivery metrics really high, because that's what gives customers confidence that they can get the product when they need it. So do you have a follow-on, John?",246

As I think Harlan mentioned, you guys did a fantastic job on operating leverage in the quarter. When you look at absolute operating profits though, there's still a pretty meaningful gap between the embedded business and the Analog business. And I think you've commented in the past that theoretically, there's no reason why that gap can't close over time. I'm kind of curious, when I look sequentially, the operating leverage in the Embedded business was particularly high. I think the fall-through was almost 86% Q-on-Q. I'm just kind of curious, have you reached a scale point in that business where we would expect follow-through to be higher from here on out and that gap to close more quickly? Any comments around that would be helpful.",130

Well, to your point, the profitability of that business has, in fact, improved significantly. On a year-on-year basis, profit from operations is up 673 basis points. But at the end of the day, the main objective here is to grow free cash flow. We think that is -- we believe that is what really drives value for the owners of the company. So -- and then return of that free cash flow to the owners. So we're not particularly focused on any one of those percentages because there are many ways to drive that free cash flow, and one of them is expanding the margins. But then the other one is just growing to top line at the same margin, right. So that's the key message that we're -- the core objective that we're trying to achieve.",138

I think C.J. asked that question, there are probably callers on the line and listening that aren't unfamiliar. But we've got 4 competitive advantages, the first of which is our manufacturing and technology, and I think the 300-millimeter is a good example of that strength. The other 3, just quickly, are the breadth of the product portfolio; the -- our channel advantages, which includes the size of our sales force in ti.com; and then just the diversity and longevity of our -- across markets and sectors and customers and products, which I think leads for investors' high confidence and a high terminal value of that product portfolio. But why 300-millimeter matters is that we've got a structural cost advantage. So with that larger wafer size, we get 40% lower cost on the chip when we manufacture that, and most chips in the industry are built on 200 millimeters. So when we started this year, we've had about 25% of our 300-millimeter capacity footprint utilized. Essentially, most of the Analog growth this year and as we have seen for several years is supported by 300-millimeter. We'll actually give an update to that in our February capital management call on what the precise numbers are. But that revenue continues to grow on 300-millimeter and we continue to see the benefit. So thank you for that question, C.J.",228

Well, as you know, we don't provide color below the top line, but certainly, if there was anything significant there, we'd call out. And I can tell you there isn't anything significant. And I think if you look at that strength inside of Industrial and Automotive, I think as we look at third quarter, as it has for some time, that strength has been very broad-based. So we've got 14 sectors inside of Industrial. Most of those have been growing double digits for some time. We continue to direct our investments across those 14. So it's a very intentional investment and return; same thing in Automotive. So we've got diversity across 5 different sectors.

So well, again, we don't -- we no longer do pay for demand creation, as you indicated. Distributors, of course, will continue to play a role in order fulfillment for our customers. So those relationships have been evolving, especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So as I mentioned earlier even in this call that, that is a unique advantage and includes both ti.com and the size and scale of our sales and [ apps ] team. So those changes were -- began implementation 3 years ago for any accounts where we had direct TI resources that represented about 80% of the TAM. And then later last year, we implemented changes with the remaining 20%. So I'd say a good portion of that is worked through and we won't be -- it's not significant enough that it's going to make any of these earnings conference calls. So we just continue to invest in our demand creation activities, and we feel really good about the results that, that is producing.

And that is more than just -- it's coming from more than just consumer confidence and how they're managing inventories. And I'm just curious. If you look at the performance of Analog and Embedded over the last 12 months, has it changed your outlook for the long-term growth of the company?",98

I think that we're fortunate that we've got investments in capacity and we've got a product portfolio that is very, very diverse. It's rich in Automotive and Industrial, which are the best growing parts of the market. And I don't think that, that changes our outlook over the long term. And the best signal that we get from customers are orders. So we're able to respond to those if things continue to strengthen and strengthen from here. And if they go the other way, we've got a playbook ready to go if that were to happen. So do you have a follow-on?",109

And that with electric powertrains, we could see demand for power semiconductors accelerate. And I was just curious how you guys think about the opportunity in electric vehicles. Is that a subsegment that TI is uniquely positioned for?",65

I think that our investments in Automotive are really directed across 5 different sectors. So powertrain is one of them, which is primarily EV. So -- but if you look at the other spaces, like Infotainment & Cluster, Passive Safety, ADAS or Advanced Driver Assist Systems, and Body Electronics & Lighting, we're very intentionally directing our investments across those areas. So certainly, as EVs become a higher mix of units that are sold on an annual basis, we'll benefit from that. But we're not dependent on it. And I think if I bring you back to our 4 competitive advantages, just that diversity and longevity, we'll benefit from ADAS systems being deployed as the industry marches forward to autonomous driving or the mix of EVs. Those are things we'll benefit from, but our business model isn't dependent on them. So we're really excited with the diversity of the design wins that we have there, and we think we've got a lot of runway there as well as inside of Industrial. So with that, we'll wrap up tonight's call, and thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.",198
