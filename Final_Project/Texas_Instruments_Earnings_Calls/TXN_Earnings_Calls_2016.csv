140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294618.0,Presenter Speech,Dave Pahl,,Executives,1,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter '15 and 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call on February 9 at 10 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the past, Kevin March and I will provide insight into our strategy, and we'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was in line with our expectations even though we experienced slowing demand within a sector of the personal electronics market late in the quarter. Despite that, overall demand was about as expected. I'll elaborate in a few moments. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing performed well in the quarter and comprised 87% of fourth quarter revenue. 
Earnings per share were $0.80 in the quarter and included a $0.09 benefit for 2 items that were not in our outlook. These 2 items were a $0.05 net tax benefit and $0.04 for Restructuring charges/other. 
With that backdrop, let me move into the details of our performance, which even in the face of weaker demand within the sector of personal electronics market continues to illustrate the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up from 26.9% a year ago and consistent with our target range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the breadth and differentiation of our product portfolio and from the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2015, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue decreased 2% from the year-ago quarter. Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog declined while High Volume Analog & Logic grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 4% from a year-ago quarter due to Connectivity and Microcontrollers. Processors declined. 
In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from year-ago quarter due to custom ASIC and DLP products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, distribution resales decreased by 2%. Distributor inventory decreased about a day compared with a year ago to just above 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times. Together, these continue to drive high customer service metrics. 
For the year in total, Analog and Embedded revenue grew a combined 3% despite significant headwinds in wireless infrastructure and foreign currency exchange rates. Analog was up 3% and Embedded was up 2%. In total, Analog and Embedded were 86% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 83% in 2014. Based on data through November, we gained market share in Analog for the sixth consecutive year and held our share gains in Embedded Processing. 
I will now turn to our end market estimates for 2015. As a reminder, we provide this estimate annually of TI's revenue by the end markets our customers sell into. We break this into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this will include products such as PCs, phones and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators and royalties. 
Industrial and automotive combined were 46% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year due to automotive strength. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue; automotive, 15%; personal electronics, 30%; communications equipment, 13%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other, 5%. Of note, Apple, whose revenue is within personal electronics market, contributed approximately 11% of our revenue in 2015. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",824

Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profits set a new record of 58.5%. 
Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $711 million, down $29 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges were $81 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is noncash expense. 
Restructuring charges/other was $68 million, which included gains on sales of 2 properties. It also included a $17 million charge in preparation for the closure of a site, which we announced today in our earnings release. We anticipate about $2 million of quarterly charges through the fourth quarter of 2018 for a total charge of about $40 million. We expect the transition to more cost-effective 200-millimeter fabs to take about 3 years and result in annualized savings of about $35 million per year. 
Operating profit was $1.14 billion or 35.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.0%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 23.4%, 6 percentage points higher than a year ago as we continue to focus investments on our best growth opportunities. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $836 million or $0.80 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 net tax benefit, primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a net benefit of $0.04 from Restructuring/other charges. 
I'll now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.43 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 115, up 4 days sequentially and down 2 days from a year ago. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model in our capital management call on Tuesday, February 9. Capital expenditures were $164 million in the quarter. 
In 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.27 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $551 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity on which we will provide an update in our capital management call in February. 
Free cash flow for the year was $3.72 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up 170 basis points from a year ago. Our free cash flow growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intention is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus any net debt retirement. 
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $386 million in dividends and repurchased $627 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in 2015 was $4.19 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.4% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a repurchase program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our commitment to returning cash are our cash management and tax practices, which are designed to make cash available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that cash onshore, making it available to return to shareholders. 
TI orders in the quarter were $3.10 billion, down 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.09 billion in the first quarter. This includes significantly weaker demand within a sector of the personal electronics market. Specifically, we expect a year-over-year decline of about $150 million within a sector of our personal electronics revenue. Except for this area of weakness, our expectations for the remainder of our business are about even with the year-ago quarter. 
We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate that you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2015 was slower than we expected when we came into the year. However, our unique advantages in manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and a diverse and long-lived product positions enabled important milestones in the year. These included expansion of 300-millimeter Analog production, gross margin improvement of 130 basis points to a new record level, operating margin improvements of 260 basis points and free cash flow margin improvement of 170 basis points to a new record level. 
We will continue to feed our unique advantages through disciplined capital allocation and focus on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve. 
With that let me turn it back to Dave.",977

140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294622.0,Question,Christopher Danely,,Analysts,5,"Can you just divulge to us the market in personal electronics that is causing all the weakness? And if it is handsets, which probably doesn't probably come as a huge surprise, maybe also comment on the other end markets, especially PCs, where some of the other semiconductor companies have talked about a little bit of weakening in PCs and what you guys are seeing in that end market?",68
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294623.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,6,"Okay, Chris. The sector where we saw the weakness, as you were guessing, is mobile phones. And we did see that sector weaken late in the quarter, in the back half of the month of December. If I just take and look at for the year how our end markets did, I'll put it -- put that into perspective. I'll start with an area of strength in automotive. That grew in the mid-teens; most of the sectors inside of that growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even for the year, and we had about half of the sectors there were increasing, offset by the others. Personal electronics, as we've just talked about, grew single digits. I'll note that we had certainly growth in one customer that grew significantly that year, but that was up, primarily offset by declines and others. So therefore, our percentage of our revenue in personal electronics really didn't change too much. It went from 29% last year to 30% this year. Communications equipment was down 20%, and that was primarily driven by wireless infrastructure, and that was down around 30% for the year. And then finally, enterprise systems was down slightly due to projectors. So with that said, Chris, I think, as we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks, outside of that one area of weakness, everything else came in about as we had expected. So that would be inclusive of PCs and the other areas that you talked about. Do you have a follow-on?",251
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294624.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,7,We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.,10

You talked about Apple being an 11% customer for the full year. I'm wondering if you talked about the linearity of that percentage as the year progressed, and did they exit the year as a larger customer? And as you think about the weakness in Q1 in smartphones, do you feel like you're at a build level that's significantly below sell-through, so Q1 will represent sort of a bottom in that weakness? Or how do you handicap that?",82
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294626.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,9,"Yes. So our revenue profile inside of personal electronics, obviously, will be more back-half weighted. As that customer did well in the marketplace, obviously our revenues would be reflective of that. I can point out that we sell very diverse set of products to that customer, and in fact, hundreds of products to it and products in every major platform. That said, I think that the revenues of that customer reported to be somewhere around 2/3 of it is in smartphones. And you'd expect, since we've got a pretty diverse position across that customer, our revenues would be very similar. So -- and certainly, I think that whenever you have a fairly significant change in demand of any customer, their supply chain considerations, where you've got different pieces of inventory sitting inside of that supply chain, we happen to be on the beginning part of that supply chain. So I won't try to handicap where that is. It's where we think the demand will come in, in the first quarter, and we'll see -- we'll make a prediction on second quarter later.",182

Kevin, just to follow up on that. With the rest of the business, even from last year, there's clearly a lot of investor angst about the macro in general. And clearly, if you look at your business profile throughout '15 and exclude Apple, you saw some weakness in the rest of your business starting in the June quarter, and you've had a couple of quarters of year-over-year declines in total revenue even as personal electronics have done strongly. And so when you look at the macro concerns that are out there, do you feel like that that's been fully reflected in the June, September, December numbers and that you're now coming out of this? Or how do you sort of handicap our macro concerns onto your forward-looking guidance?",129
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294630.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,13,"Yes. John, I think at the highest level, we think we'll continue to operate in a relatively weak macro economy as we have been for the last couple of years, so nothing terribly exciting in the economy as a whole. If you kind of look at the compares that we're talking about, recall that a year ago, we were seeing sharp declines at car [ph] communications infrastructure, and we were also seeing some pretty stiff headwinds in the form of foreign exchange with the rate of exchange moving against us from a U.S. dollar strength standpoint. So despite that, when you take a look at all that, we actually see, aside from this one sector in personal electronics, the balance of it's going to be about even on a year-over-year basis. So again, the headlines that we're seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst that you mentioned certainly sounds real, but actually, from a demand signal standpoint from our customers, it's consistent with what I just said. We continue to operate in a weak macro environment with lots of cross currents going on. Again, last year's weakening in the comms infrastructure, very strong auto, foreign exchange issues that we were dealing with. This year, we don't see where those things are coming into play right now.",220

I thought you had something against short people. Just a quick one. So Kevin, as you mentioned, in a -- it's kind of a flat environment, you still managed to grow earnings to 8% in 2015. So in 2016, if things are flat to down, maybe talk about some of the leverage you guys have or would pull to try and keep earnings flat. Or could we see earnings be down again -- or excuse me, be down this year?",88
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294634.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,17,"Yes. There's a lot of assumptions inside there, Chris. But I just -- let me just remind you of some moving parts that are going on here, and you can spot it if you take a look at the release that we just put out there. I think the most apparent number you can see on there is the decline in depreciation begin to occur. And clearly, just from an accounting standpoint, that increases our gross profit margin and falls through to EPS. That depreciation will continue its glide path down in 2016, consistent with the fact that a lot of those purchases that we made 5 years ago are now reaching the end of depreciable life. In addition to that, we're seeing a growing portion of our chips being produced in our 300-millimeter capacity. And as you know, it costs us about 40% less per chip or about 20% less per device to manufacture on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So as that mix improves, that will also fall through to the bottom line. And then the third element that I'd just point out is that we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive, which tend to have higher overall margins and certainly stickier revenue and margin profiles over time. So collectively, those should help our overall margin and earnings performance, notwithstanding whatever direction revenue takes us through over the next 12 months. In addition to that, from an EPS standpoint, as we have been doing for 11 years now, as long as the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the market value, we will continue to be buyers of TI shares. We reduced our share count 3.4% this past year. And certainly, at current prices, it says we should continue to be active accumulators of TI shares. So combined, we have -- we certainly would have momentum in our favor, notwithstanding any significant change in the revenue profile to continue to help us with earnings per share.",337

The OpEx continues to impress. I think for the second year in a row, OpEx dropped by 5%, and I know you had some specific closures in Japan, et cetera. If we were to look forward on OpEx, are there any unique drivers such as closing businesses that are really going to impact that? Or how should we think about OpEx relative to sales?",81

I guess the way I'd answer that is that there are no knobs on the horizon right now of any measure that were similar to what you've seen in the last couple of years. As you pointed out, we had some restructuring actions that we took in Japan and also in certain parts of Embedded Processing over the last 2 years, and those have removed quite a bit of OpEx cost. And those are about done now. They pretty much finished up in the middle of last year. As we look forward, what we would expect to see is what we've talked about in the past, that our OpEx should operate somewhere between 20% and 30% of revenue. In a weak market, it might be pushing 30%. In a reasonably strong market, it might be pushing 20%. I think we're in the low 20s right now, 23% for 2015. So again, as I look forward, I don't see any real material changes to the OpEx profile. I will just remind you that we do always have a seasonable pattern on our OpEx. Just like OpEx was down 3Q to 4Q because of holidays, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, the OpEx will be up again in 1Q versus 4Q because of the absence of those holidays and also, the annual pay and benefits increases that we institute across the company in the first quarter. And just to kind of give you some parameters on that, it's probably in the 4% to 5% range increase 4Q to 1Q on OpEx.",260

I think if you look at that, sequentially, it was down around mid-teens. But -- from a year ago, it was down mid-teens, but actually it did see some growth. That was the second quarter in a row that we had growth inside of there. So I think that business continues to be one that, over the last couple of decades, has been very, very choppy. That characteristic probably won't change. But we're on a position where we've got a couple of quarters of growth. I think that when we look at it longer term, we do believe that carrier CapEx won't grow. It certainly won't drop to 0 either. But we do think that it will get smaller slightly in time.

But if I had asked you a year ago where would gross margins go, given all the levers, right, because it moved from 200- to 300-millimeter, the lower depreciation, the mix shift towards industrial and automotive, do you think you would have thought gross margins would be even stronger than -- right, what you might have -- than what you actually achieved? So my question really is that as we look forward, what is the bigger driver of gross margins? Is it top line growth and wafer starts? Or do you still think the 200- to 300-millimeter is -- that move is being underappreciated in terms of a gross margin driver?",134

As I look into 2015, clearly, any meaningful revenue growth will incrementally have a much stronger impact than any other piece of the P&L on improving overall gross margins. But independent of margin growth, I'd go back to what I talked about a few minutes ago on Ross' question, and that would be really the increasing mix improvement on 300-millimeter, the mix to industrial and auto and then just the decline and depreciation as we continue to march through 2016. It's pretty tough to handicap which one would be the biggest contributor or how to sequence those. But I think that they will all collectively be quite meaningful as we move into 2016, and I think we'll probably pleasantly please ourselves again for another year.",135

The question is on your Other segment, where you have the DLP and calculators and ASICs. So that was down about 14% if I ignore the legacy Wireless space. Why was it down so much?

And if you look for the year, it was down -- I'm not sure if your question was for the year or for the quarter. It's actually the same reason. It's down primarily due to the custom ASIC products. If you remember, those products have a very high exposure to wireless infrastructure, and that's where we saw the headwind. It was also down because of DLP, and DLP had a very good year in 2014, so very difficult compare on that.",82

So I think that if you look last year, it was in the mid-teens. If you go back several years, it's actually been in that same range. Previous years were primarily driven from the exit of the Wireless business. But as we go into next year and as we look, essentially that we've got some long-term growth potentials inside of DLP. I think calculators have been flat to slightly down, and we would continue to expect to see that. Growth in royalties, royalties have been about 1% of our revenue, and we'd expect them to continue to run in that area. And then we've got ASIC that will shift over time into our Embedded Processing as we pick up that functionality. So we'd expect that mid-teens to slow somewhere in the mid to low single-digit declines going forward. Thank you, Vivek.",142

So I think when you look at the Embedded sector, if I look for the year, the increase was due to Connectivity and Microcontrollers. And both of those product lines, I would say have a very diverse customer footprint. And so there's really not one sector or market that's driving it. Collectively, yes, you're right. It's in industrial as well as automotive but probably has a bias to industrial just because of the diversity of those customers and where they're winning designs. So very, very broad-based, and that's part of the reason why we're encouraged with that business and the growth. And I think that also you see how that contributes to the bottom line and the profitability of that sector or that business for the year. You have a follow-on, Harlan?",133

On your broad catalog, Analog business, it's a high gross margin business. I think the team has done a good job of continuing to improve the breadth and the access to the portfolio.

So we don't really have our business so much lined up by catalog or not. I'd say that the majority of the products by number certainly are more catalog-based as we've got tens of thousands of products. But we're not quite organized that way. I mean, we've got the 4 businesses of High Volume Analog & Logic, which will be more application-specific products. And even there, even though they're application-specific, many of those products are available to multiple customers and even sometimes multiple markets even though they're application-specific, something like motor drivers, as an example, sell into multiple markets and multiple sectors. Then we've got Power and then High Performance Analog and FCA. So maybe we just don't have a cut between that. Okay, thank you, Harlan.",128

I think, Ambrish, as we just kind of look at our business and as Kevin mentioned before, we believe that we've been operating in a weaker environment, and that, that will continue for some time. We've had some people ask us if we think a semiconductor cycle is underlying what's -- what we're seeing, and we just haven't seen those signs of a traditional cycle. So there are things like our lead times continue to remain short. Our cancellations are -- remain very low. Our distribution inventory continues to hold around 4 weeks, and we continue to deliver our products on time to our customers when they're asking at very, very high service level. So those are some of the bigger ones that come to mind that you would see some movement if you were moving through a bottom or a top of the cycle. And we just haven't seen that in quite some time.",156

And my follow-up was on the industrial segment. And obviously, I don't pay attention to the quarter-quarter. But on a full year basis, if I recall what the number you gave us, it's flat for the year. And the year before that, it was up 10%. So given it's such a cornerstone of your business, also your gross margin expansion, how do you explain the flat year-over-year last year? And then what do you think industrial should do in 2016?",83
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2839.0,921977.0,39294662.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,45,"Sure, yes. And before I talk about industrial, I just want to remind those that may not be as familiar with this. When we talk about our industrial market, it's something that's very broad and different than what a typical investor would look from an industrial screen. So we've got 14 sectors that makes up industrial, and they'll include things like factory automation, medical and healthcare, building automation, grid infrastructure, test measurement, motor drives, electronic point of sale, space and avionics, display, power delivery, appliances, lighting, industrial transportation and then a bucket of everything else that goes into it. So slightly -- or very different than what most people would think of in industrials. And you're right, it was -- it had a strong year the year before. I think when we started the year, we had expected it to be stronger than what it turned out. And typically, a lot of people ask us of, ""Hey, we hear the rumors in China."" We see the stocks that they follow maybe in the industrial segment are seeing very, very weak demand. But we turned in revenue that was consistent with what we saw after a very strong year. And fundamentally, what we think is going on inside of that is that there is more semiconductor content going into the industrial market, and we think we're in the very early stages of that. And if you look at the automotive market, I think it's much easier to see that content because we know how many cars ship per year. It's much easier to see the difference between total SAR unit growth and what semiconductors are shipping into it. Certainly, impossible to be able to see inside of the industrial market because it's very, very broad and very, very diverse. But that said, we believe that we've got a decade or more of runway of increasing content inside of the industrial market. So that's about all the insight I think I can share on that. Okay, thank you, Ambrish.",337

Chris, the fab in Greenock, Scotland, is one that came to us with the acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011. Most of the parts that are manufactured in there are part of our Silicon Valley Analog business. We announced today that we are going to -- that we're putting together plans to wind down operations there and move the production to other 200-millimeter fabs that we have in Germany, Japan and Maine in the U.S. These are larger, more cost-effective, more technologically advanced factories that can just give us a lot better economics with those chips that are produced there. It will take us about 3 years to wind down those operations by our estimate right now as it takes just that much time to requalify those parts into other factories. And at the end of that period, we will no longer have an operation in Greenock. We took a $17 million charge in the quarter as we begin planning for that activity, and we expect that we'll probably continue to incur roughly $2 million of charges per quarter, each quarter through the end of 2018 as we wind it down for total charges of about $40 million over a 3-year period.",203

And then also as we look at Embedded, I think we concentrated a little bit on MCUs, but maybe we can talk about Connectivity and why that was up year-over-year.

I'll finish off the Scottish fab one, the why not 300-millimeter. The short answer is most of those processors are dual quad -- qual-ed already in other 200-millimeter factories. And it's just a whole lot easier to transfer into qualified processes that already exist in other factories, not all but enough of them. And so consequently, we'll just go ahead and put those into open capacity in 200-millimeter factories versus bringing them into 300. And, Dave, do you want to take the...",92

Chris, your question on Connectivity, what's driving the growth there; there, we've got a very broad portfolio of products. We support about a dozen different standards from a Connectivity standpoint, so low-powered Bluetooth, to WiFi, to other sub-gigahertz standards. And so if somebody wants to connect something, we have a solution that we can offer them. And so we're just seeing a really good uptake of the products that we've got there. I think you rolled in a question about does it change our penchant for acquisition. Again, our belief is that when you acquire a company in the Embedded space, you're picking up additional architectures. And additional architectures doesn't make you stronger, it just makes you bigger. And so we'll continue to look for companies that have characteristics much like a National does if we -- when we are interested and that's the profile of the type of company. Let me just add, too, on the Greenock facility that we do expect to save about $35 million once we've completed all the transition. That's on an annualized basis and once we do complete the transition of the products to the more cost-effective fabs. Okay, thanks, Chris.",198

Because of it, the 300-millimeter factory we have in our fab being highly automated, somewhat counterintuitively, you don't have to have really high-volume parts running through there. Because of the automation, we can actually run relatively low-volume parts through there and still gain significant cost benefit. So what -- the way we've been employing the 300-millimeter strategy is not so much to requal existing 200 into that factory, but instead, to release new products into that factory on already qualified processes. And that's one of the focus that we've had and that we'll continue going forward. And we'll give a further update as to our progress to date on both the Renner fab as well as the DMOS6 fab that we're converting that we announced last year coming on February 9 on our capital management call.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive as well as improvement in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics market, which declined as expected. 
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue declined 8%, while Embedded Processing revenue grew 8%. 
Earnings per share was $0.65. 
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from the year-ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume Analog & Logic. Power Management and High Performance Analog also declined, while Silicon Valley Analog grew. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products. Compared with the year ago, distributor resales decreased 4% due to the lower demand in personal electronics that I described earlier. 
Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4.5 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. 
Automotive demand remained very strong, driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and PowerTrain systems. Industrial demand strengthened broadly, with most sectors growing. Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that declined about $150 million as expected. Overall, personal electronics was down more than that primarily due to mobile phones. 
Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies able to -- capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",727
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2728.0,965232.0,40976259.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion, a 60.6% of revenue, a new record. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs as well as a higher percentage of more profitable products. 
Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year ago period. 
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $968 million or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points higher than a year ago as we focused our investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions. 
Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we staged our inventory for increased shipments in the second quarter. Also, included were 3 to 4 days of inventory associated with the portion of the personal electronics market that started slowing late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year. Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $552 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which include the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. 
 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceed we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned to the shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our effort to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning the 80% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses. 
Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. And with that, let me turn it back to Dave.",691

We don't typically provide a forecast by end market. However, there -- if there's any large shifts, we'll talk about that much like we did in last quarter within a sector in personal electronics. I can say that, that demand, we would expect to grow sequentially, but it will be down significantly from a year ago. And I'd also say that outside of that, we would expect the rest of our business to grow both sequentially and throughout the year.",82

Yes, I do -- just -- yes, I know that the conversion of the 300-millimeter has been an important part of the improving margin profile.

140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2728.0,965232.0,40976265.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,8,"Romit, I'll go ahead and talk to that. Roughly a quarter of our Analog revenue was generated on 300-millimeter last year. We have total internal capability, about $8 billion, so we're using about 1/4 of that capability at this point in time. Just to remind everybody else who's listening, the reason the 300-millimeter is so important to us is really the economics at the factory level. We get about 2.3x as many chips per wafer on the 300-millimeter versus the 200-millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4x as much. So if you do the math, that means the actual die cost is only about 60% as much on a 300-millimeter wafer as on a 200-millimeter wafer. When you kind of take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal, we wanted to put a higher gross margin on those chips we're manufacturing on 300-millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us. As we look out in the future again, we've got about probably $6 billion of growth capacity in 300-millimeter and we continue to increase our loadings in that space. In fact, on a year-over-year, we actually had more starts on 300-millimeter than we had a year ago.",202

If memory serves me correct, when you got out of the Wireless business, you didn't get out of all the cost and you put a lot of that cost into the Embedded Processing market. If I look at sort of the incremental margin, up margin sequentially, it's greater than 60%. Are we sort of at a tipping point here where that's kind of the incremental op margin we should start to see about this business? And is there any reason why the Embedded op margin shouldn't converge with the Analog op margins over time?",110
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2728.0,965232.0,40976269.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,12,"Yes, John. What you might recall was that a year ago, we were still in the process of winding up some restructuring actions in the Embedded Processing segment. That finished about the middle of the second quarter. There was a little that bled over into the middle of second quarter. And so consequently, now we're seeing the benefit of those cost restructurings. The margin improvement that we'll see -- we're right on this business, now it's a solid 25% operating profit in the quarter, and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment. As you noted, we had about a -- quarter-over-quarter about a 62% fall-through to operating profit from the revenue growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management, but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue, so that it can continue to drop through more profit as we go forward. I won't attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same levels as Analog, but we are confident that there remains room for improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued cost containment and the drive towards revenue growth.",205

And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our days of inventory were up, and that's up on the expectation of increased shipments in the second quarter, and plus there's a few extra days that are inside that 1Q inventory as a result of the slowdown in personal electronics that we've mentioned, 90 days ago. We expect that material is going to shift over the balance of the year. And between the increased shipments in 2Q and the shipments of that personal electronics material, we'll see the days of inventory drift back down comfortably inside our model, very similar to what we saw last year. If you go back and take a look last year, we were also a little bit higher in the first quarter in anticipation of second quarter growth, and then days drifted down as we came through the year.",159

So I think if you look at the midpoint, you're right that year-over-year growth would be down about 1%. As we talked about before, we -- on a year-over-year basis, we'll still have the growth impacted due to the weakness inside of personal electronics. Outside of that, we expect to see our businesses growing both sequentially and year-on-year. And again, I think that we're in a good position to capitalize on the trends of industrial and automotive. We think longer term that, that's where the growth in our industry will come from. And just as a reminder, we had last year about 46% of our revenues driven by there. So we feel good with where our products are positioned.",120

So we had low manufacturing costs year-over-year, driven by, as you mentioned, lower depreciation and increased 300-millimeter wafer starts. But we also had a richer mix of overall products. As Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, industrial was up very solidly for us and industrial space, we enjoy a very nice mix of overall profitability. So you have that combination of events going on. And again, to Dave's comments a moment ago, as we continue to see content growth in industrial and automotive, we would expect to continue to see improvement in our mix from a profitability standpoint too as we look out over the quarters and years. So it's all coming together very nicely for us right now.",126

OpEx did come in a little bit higher than what we had planned for. There really wasn't any one thing that drove that. There's just a number of small things that are being taken care of in the quarter. As we look into second quarter, recall that 1Q includes about 2 months' worth of our annual pay and benefit increases. As you look into 2Q, you'll need to account for that, that we will have the full 3 months of pay and benefit increases. I'd expect the change quarter-to-quarter would be very similar to what you saw last year.",101

That's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the comm infrastructure impact on both Embedded Processing as well as Other. And so Embedded is up 8% year-over-year. You noted within your other business that your ASIC, custom ASICs are down year-over-year. I think both of those tend to be driven very highly by comm infrastructure. Can you help us understand the differential between those 2 businesses? Is one of them eating the other, for example?",82

So our Embedded business, as you remember, has 3 product lines inside of it. Microcontrollers and Processors are both about 45% of that revenue, and Connectivity makes up about 10% of that revenue. So we saw a growth in all 3 of those businesses. They all grew very nicely, but it was led by processors. So our communications infrastructure processors would be inside of that business. But we also sell automotive products that are inside of that business that drove that growth. In the Other business, the custom ASIC business, I'll just say that we sell a different mix of products to customers, so it's not always the same. We've got some customers where we only sell both just Embedded and Analog into those customers. So -- and that said, just as a reminder, longer-term, we do expect that the custom ASIC business will decline because that functionality is being absorbed into our SOCs inside the Embedded business.

The utilizations actually haven't changed that much in a number of quarters, and we don't expect it to change much in the next quarter or 2 either. The amount of wafers that we're starting are pretty consistent as we go across the quarters. And Blayne, you can kind of see that when our days of inventory go up in 1Q as we're building more increased shipments in 2Q, that allows us to run the factories pretty close to similar utilizations quarter-over-quarter rather than ramp them up and down to meet the in-quarter demand. So I wouldn't expect utilization to change that much going into the next couple of quarters, just as it hasn't in the last number of quarters.",120

You pointed out particular strength in processors. I think you guys talked about comps as the driver there, and maybe some automotive. But your MCU product also grew nicely year-over-year.

Our MCU business is really a great business that we're building. And as you know, we've been investing in that business for some time. We've got -- and continue to invest both in TI-based architectures as well as ARM-based architectures. And we've got customers that want to have both of those. And we continue to be selective on where we make those investments. Part of the way that you differentiate those products is by having peripherals that are optimized for different types of applications. We develop microcontrollers that are targeted for ultra-low-power battery-backed operations that will be in fielded for, in some cases, decades, as well as very high performance-based microcontroller. And we've got very strong connectivity solutions, both wired but as well as wireless. And that crosses over into our Connectivity business that we've got there, and that we support over a dozen different interface or wireless standards inside of that business. So again very, very broad-based and we really are encouraged by the results of that business. Do you have a follow-on, Harlan?",176

Within the industrial markets, which was obviously, an area of strength for you guys in the March quarter, you guys have talked previously about servicing like, I think, 14 different subsegments, so very broad. You've also talked about content gains in industrial, which has kind of a similar dynamic to the automotive segment. Any of those subsegments within industrial that are showing more of a bias towards more dollar content gains on a go-forward basis?",76
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2728.0,965232.0,40976291.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,34,"Yes. I think, Harlan, the one nice thing about automotive is we can more easily identify what the unit SAAR growth is. And there's enough analysts that follow that market that we can track what the semiconductor content gain in. And there, we think that there's probably somewhere around $350 on average that sells into an automotive. That's a number that's been growing very nicely. And when I look at that, it's probably about 1% of the average sales price of a car. So it's not too hard to imagine that, that number will continue to grow and grow significantly over the future. When you contrast that to industrial, and we think we're in the very early stages of maybe where we were 3, 5 years ago in the automotive market with industrial. You really can't do that same type of analysis unfortunately, because we've got 14 different sectors that we sell into. Underneath that, there are literally hundreds of different end equipments that we track and develop solutions for. And there's just a very, very wide variety of applications. So we can see it going on. And the beauty of it is it's just not one thing. It really is growth on a very broad basis. And I think that, that's reflected in our numbers, not only this quarter, but it's been reflected in the numbers for a number of quarters now. So we really look forward to that opportunity in the future.",244

Is the 60.6% the new baseline and we should model the flow-through from this level?

That's a pretty tough call to make when we're trying to get too precise. We would expect industrial and automotive to continue to be a growing portion of our revenue over time. That's where we're focusing our attention in, especially our R&D dollars. We'd also expect more starts as we look out in the future, proportionally more starts on 300-millimeter, which is lower-cost wafers. We would also expect the depreciation declines that we've been seeing in this past year to continue albeit at a slower pace than what we've seen in the last few quarters. So those will give you tailwinds. So even if you do have some of these other products start back up, you got enough mix going on inside there that these margins that we're operating at right now are probably pretty representative of what the portfolio can do for our shareholders.",154

We're not being that precise.

I guess, the first question would be your first quarter came in at the high end of the range. Can you just talk about what was the positive surprise in the quarter? And maybe in association with that, Dave, I think in the past, you had given the sequential end market performance to match what you've given and then year-over-year. If that helps answer both questions, that would be great.",77

So again, as we had said earlier, that portion of demand where we saw weakness came in about as we expected. The strength was more broad-based, and we continue obviously to see strength in automotive and then the improvement in industrial and comms equipment. So very, very broad-based strength that we saw. So the second part of your question was sequentially what we saw from the trends. There no surprise that automotive remained very strong, and it was driven by Infotainment as well as the Hybrid/Electric and PowerTrain systems. industrial, again, we had growth across almost every sector inside of industrial. Personal electronics down, with most sectors declining. And comms equipment was up sequentially, and that was the third quarter in a row that it actually grew. And then enterprise systems was up due to projectors. So did you have a follow-on, Ross?",144

And you just talked about the comm side, the third quarter in a row it's been up. Generally, how do you think about that versus where we are after burning a ton of inventory and now coming back?

So you said your comms business was actually up for the third quarter in a row. Obviously, that had fallen due to the end market before that.

Yes, I would say that, that, that business as you know, Ross, has always remained choppy, and we had a very strong period of growth going back a year ago, followed by the declines that we saw last year. It's just -- it's really tough to be able to predict what's going to happen in that market. And we just positioned our product and inventory to be able to respond if that demand will continue to strengthen. And if it doesn't, we know how to react in that environment too. So it still continues to be a really good business for us. We continue to make investments in it. And we just know that it will be choppy. Longer-term, we don't view it as a market that will be a growth. We don't think that operators will take their CapEx spending up over the next 5, 10, 15 years. But we do think that there will continue to be shifts in how they spend that money, so we continue to make investments where we believe that growth will be in the future.",184

And our guidance, obviously, is our best estimate of how we performed. So we tried to stay away from making any precise comments on what a seasonal quarter looks like.

Real quick. Just on channel inventory and distribution inventory. I think you said that channel inventory was up a couple of days, around 4.5 weeks. Do you expect channel inventory or dist inventory to go up again in Q2?

And I'd just say that if we could actually convert all of our shipments in distribution to consignment and carry that inventory ourselves, we'd actually prefer to do that. So if anything, we'd encourage our distributors to take advantage of those programs. We've operated, I'd say, around 4 weeks to 4.5 weeks I think for some time. That number probably somewhere in that range even if it drifted up a little bit, it always just depends on the product that's out there and at the speed at which it turns. But we've got other peers that measure their inventory in months and not weeks. So we're very efficient on how we use that channel. And it works out really well for both us and our distributor partners. So we feel very good about where that level is overall.",171

I made a comment a few minutes ago that the rate of depreciation decline that we have seen over the past year is -- will slow down meaningfully as we go into 2016. Recall that from a capital spending standpoint, our model is to spend about 4% of our revenues on CapEx, which we have been doing for the last couple of years and we expect to continue this year. Our depreciation runs more than 4%. So clearly, they will have to converge at some point. Our depreciable life for most of our equipment is 5 years, and you may recall that it was about 5 years ago when we brought on several new factories, one in Aizu, the equipment that we brought into our fab here in the Dallas area, and a factory we bought in China. And so we're seeing those depreciation curves roll down now. So the rate of decline that we saw over the last few quarters this past year will slow down, although it will still decline as we go into 2016.",179

But I expect that we'll probably do what we've done similarly in the last couple of cycles on this, where we have -- if the interest rates are favorable by the time we go back into the market, we'll likely pay off a portion and roll the balance into a new issue.

Yes, the automotive business that we're building continues to be very, very broad-based. So we've got strong participation in both Analog as well as Embedded. And inside of Embedded, we've got both Processors and Microcontrollers as well as even some Connectivity designs inside of that business. From an Analog standpoint, it actually is very, very broad-based. And one of the things that we've been focused on is broadening the number of business units that the company participates in, in automotive. And I think if you went back 5, 10 years ago, we might have had 1 or 2 business units participating in that marketplace. And today, out of our 70 or so different business units, I think over half of them actually shipped products into that marketplace. So it's very, very broad-based. We've got 5, what we call sectors that make up the automotive market. And again, the largest one is not more than mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue last year. So they are -- the 5 segments are Infotainment & Cluster; Passive Safety; Advanced Driver Assistance System, or ADAS, as it's known; Body Electronics, which also includes Lighting; and then the Hybrid/Electric Vehicle and PowerTrain.

No new factories here lately, but we do continue to pick up equipment that was quite expensive new for pretty good prices when you buy them the way we buy them. As it relates to the closure of the factory in Scotland, just as a reminder, we expect that factory will not close before the end of 2018. As it has been with other factories in the past, when we close those things, it usually takes a couple of years as you slowly do lifetime builds on the inventory. And certainly, on other parts of those factories, you'll recall it to other existing factors. And that's just a multiyear effort. So it's progressing as planned, and we, again, don't expect it to actually complete until about the end of 2018.",147

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. 
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and grew in the industrial and communications equipment market. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago. 
In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 9%, and Analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.76. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30% of revenue, up from 27.4% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. 
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue was about even with growth in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley offset by declines in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. 
Embedded Processing revenue increased by 9% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines, led by processors. Our investments in Embedded continue to build a diverse business of long-lived products that contribute to free cash flow growth over the long-term. 
In our Other segment. Revenue declined 4% from a year ago due to calculators, royalties and custom ASIC products, which was partially offset by DLP products. 
Now I'll move to provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with the majority of sectors growing led by infotainment. Industrial demand had broad-based growth, with more than half of the sectors growing. Personal electronics declined broadly, led by mobile phone. Communications equipment grew from a year ago but declined sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems grew.
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived position. These 4 attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",627
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2733.0,1011669.0,42624161.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion or 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $805 million, up 2% from a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.29 billion on research and development, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.12 billion or 34.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 25.0%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $779 million or $0.76 per share. 
Now let me comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.07 billion in the quarter. Inventory days are 133, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days as we stage inventory for expected revenue growth in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $158 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 9% in the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4.5% of revenue. 
As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 30.0% of revenue. Free cash flow was 7% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested into the business. 
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive in the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. 
For those who may have missed it. In May, we issued $500 million of 6-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.85%. In addition, we have retired $1 billion of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.63 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.22%. 
In the second quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $527 million of our stock for a total return of $909 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.07 billion. 
Outstanding share count was reduced by 3% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitments to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.54 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 2% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year. 
In summary, we believe our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",694

So -- and again, if there's anything that's moving around that's significant, our practices have been to call that out to provide clarity.

Stacy, the drivers to gross margin are -- last quarter and going for the foreseeable future is the same thing that we've been seeing for a while, and that is, we're seeing depreciation rolling off, which has clearly given us an accounting benefit to gross margin. But more importantly, we've got increased production on 300-millimeter, which is considerably more cost-effective on a chip level than the equivalent 200-millimeter production. And as we see depreciation continue to roll off, albeit more slowly as we move into future quarters and more production on 300-millimeter, we'll continue to see the benefit to gross margins. So I think that the -- well, what you've seen going on is just a prelude to what you'll see going on as we look out a little bit further. 
If we look out further in time as to what to expect, I think we'd just tell you to do what we've been doing in the past, which is on any delta revenue that you forecast in your model, that falls through around 70%, 75% on average over time. That'll give you a pretty good way to anticipate what the company's gross margin will stack up as.",199

So CapEx is going to be noisy in any one quarter so it makes more sense to kind of look at it on a what we think is a trailing 12-month basis. And over the last 12 months, CapEx has run about 4.5% of our last 12 months revenue. Depreciation has been running about 5.2% over the last 12 months revenue. So obviously, those will converge at some point, but I don't expect those to converge before the end of 2016. They may converge in any 1 quarter, but on that trailing 12-month basis, it'll take a couple of quarters before we see those meet up. And again, remember, our long-term model is to keep our CapEx spending at around 4% of revenue, and that includes the conversion and expansion of our 300-millimeter capacity for Analog production.",138

Yes, if I could just follow-up. OpEx, I guess, it appears in the June quarter, it looks like it was higher than expected. Sort of comparable to what happened in the March quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So could you just talk about how do you look at OpEx as a percent of sale? And what's driving the higher uptick there? It sounds like -- it looks like it's more R&D than anything in the first half of the year so far.",84

I'm not so sure, Amit, if it was higher-than-expected per se, but it was certainly higher than it was last quarter and higher on a year-over-year basis. And you've got a couple of things going on there. Sequentially, you've got 3, 4 months worth of pay and benefit increases. So last quarter, you only had 2 month's worth. That's also true year-over-year, by the way. We just got pay and benefit increases. But also importantly on the R&D, as you noted, we have been, for a number of quarters now, reallocating our internal resources towards more development efforts. So those will be resources that may have been working in manufacturing support or they may have been working in SG&A, and we're redeploying those resources into development activity in R&D, and we expect to continue doing that for a number of quarters to come. And so consequently, you're seeing R&D begin to move up a little bit more than what you might see on the G&A line.",167

So if we look at calendar '16, things play out seasonal, it looks like $150 million benefit from D&A, but another $200 million from those other categories. Is there any way to parse that out and then better understand going forward what that might look like for each of those categories' mix utilization [indiscernible]?",91

C.J., just to think about that, from an underutilization standpoint, frankly, there's no real benefit going on there. The underutilization cost are almost exactly the same for multiple quarters in a row now. Depreciation has actually come down. So if you compare the most recent quarter, $155 million of depreciation, the year-ago quarter was $198 million. So you're getting about $45 million depreciation lift. And really, the rest of it is just lower overall manufacturing costs. And again, incrementally, we're getting more production on 300-millimeter, which, at that dye level, has a 40% cost benefit for us. So that's an overall 20% improvement to gross profit margin on -- or excuse me, 20% -- takes growth profit margin up effectively because cost comes down, bottom them out. So you've got the combination of all of those things weighing together. So again, depreciation down about $45 million 2Q-to-2Q on a year-over-year basis. Underutilization charge is pretty flat throughout that period. So it's really a conversion to lower-cost manufacturing.",168

So we've got a footprint manufacturing Analog products at 200-millimeter. And the 300-millimeter we've -- we ended last year with about $6 billion of open capacity on 300-millimeter. And the wafer size is bigger, and that translates into a lower cost, as Kevin was talking about. At a chip level, or the silicon level, it's 40% lower. So basically, as we build more of our products on 300-millimeter, that will help to drive gross margins as well as free cash flow. So C.J., you have a follow-up question?",109

I wonder if you can give us an update on the Embedded Processing segment. You're showing some nice growth there. Can you talk about where that's coming from?

Sure, Joe. So year-over-year, as we had said before, we're seeing good growth in all 3 product lines. And just as a reminder, for 2015, we had 3 product lines inside of Embedded. Microcontrollers, which made up 45% of revenue; processors, again 45% and Connectivity at 10%. So I'll just say over the last few years, Connectivity has been growing very strongly, though it's coming, obviously, from a much lower revenue base. And they're -- we support a dozen or so connectivity standards. And those products are finding, I'll just say, very, very diverse -- different applications and doing very nicely. 
Processors, again, is doing very well. It is being benefited from both automotive as well as recovery that we saw inside of comms infrastructure. And then Microcontrollers is benefiting from, really, the industrial market as it is finding very, very diverse application. That's kind of what that looks like across the board. Do you have a follow-on?",159

I'd say that across the board, our lead times have remain unchanged and at very, very low levels. So product availability continues to be very good, and both at our distributors as well as for the products that we support through consignment programs or in a classical book-ship business. So really no changes on that. And I'd just also mention that just our on-time delivery, so kind of our metrics to when customers want to have them remain at a very, very high level. So okay.

For the last couple of years, the company has had the objective to get them higher, and you've done a lot on the OpEx side now. For the second consecutive quarter, we're in the mid-20s. Can you put in context where operating margins are now versus, I think, levels that the company would be happy with? Is it possible to get to Analog levels? Or are we at optimal levels now with EP?",86

What I would say is that while we won't try to predict margins in the individual segments per se, we're confident that Embedded Processing, just like Analog, can be a very solid contributor to free cash flow growth over the long haul. And again, this is larger because the products that we manufacture in that segment have very long market shelf lives. And so you can get the -- you may recall that over the last couple of years and in early last year, we were doing some restructuring activity in Embedded Processing and taking some costs out. And we've been talking for a while now that the real secret to being able to improve the profitability in that area was on revenue growth. And that team has been doing a very good job at turning the results of their efforts into solid revenue growth. And consequently, we're seeing the profitability go up. They are committed to continuing in that direction and so I look forward to seeing what they turn in as we go multiple quarters out.",207

The follow-up is related to Chris' question. You mentioned that the performance of the business was just a little bit better than expected on a broad-based basis in the second quarter. Was that because the order strength of the business was just better than the team thought going into the quarter? Or was in fact the business just scoped a little bit more conservatively than it played out? What accounted for the upside versus expectations?,76

So I'd just point to that we've got 55% of our revenue that runs through consignment. So we actually don't get orders there. We get forecasts that get pulled to actual demand. We've got 60% of our revenues that run through distribution, and 60% of that is actually on consignment. So our -- what we shipped, the demand that we ship to is much closer to real-time of what customers want and need. So I think that very simplistically, they just ended up pulling more -- slightly more than what we were initially expecting across a broad range. So if there was something in there that we could point to, 1 or 2 things, we would do that. But that's just not the case this time. So...",128

For the last, kind of, 3 years, you've had good sequential revenue growth in the calendar third quarter of about 6%. And you've been able to take OpEx down on average by about 3%, sequentially. So I'm just kind of curious. Is there a seasonal pattern to OpEx that we should think about for the calendar third quarter in general? And specifically, how do you see OpEx trending this September?",86

John, I think you said it well in that you do tend to see some patterns similar to the numbers you just recited. Typically, you'll see SG&A and R&D down a bit in the third versus the second. And probably, that's just people taking vacations and so on for the summer holidays. But I think this quarter, you'll continue to see that sort of trend probably in the SG&A area. But I would expect that R&D would continue to increase a little bit as we move forward, dampening the overall decline that you might expect in OpEx. And that, again, has to do with what I mentioned earlier in the call -- that, for a number of quarters now, we have been redeploying resources into development activities, and those costs are winding up in R&D as we deploy those resources. 
So as you look at the third quarter. Again, you're probably going to see that -- I know G&A will probably be down again a little bit, but R&D will probably be up some.",175

If I could -- yes, as a follow-on, guys, one of the things you guys have always sort of talked about is the consistency of growth year and not necessarily absolute growth. Albeit, you've talked about sort of modest share gain expectations every year. And just when I look at the Embedded Processing growth of over 9% year-over-year, to me, that clearly is sort of outgrowing the industry and the peers. And so I'm just kind of curious, what do you think the cause of that is, how sustainable that is, and kind of, should we expect to see continued market share growth within the Embedded segment at these sort of clips?",115

We'll finish the year before we declare any victory laps on market share gains, and I'll just say that if you look at that business as well as Analog, we've just had steady share gains. And we've talked about averaging between 30 and 40 basis points per year. But we've had years where we've put up 100 basis point gains in the past. So again, we don't want to get ahead of where the year will end. We'll wait until the scoreboard is up before we analyze that. But we -- I'd just say that we continue to focus our resources in places where we can develop products that are going to be differentiated. They're going to find a long-lived position in the marketplace. And when you're able to do that, you're able to have a revenue stream in which you're able to build on. And the great thing about these -- both these markets is that share gain doesn't move quickly. And so -- but it does -- just steady share gains over time will make a significant difference to the business model. And we think that, that is certainly showing up in the numbers today. So...",200

You talked about some of the forecast visibility from your consignment revenue. Can you talk a little bit about how far out that goes and what the order patterns are telling you? And then correspondingly, what have you seen with regard to order rates over the last 9 days as compared to the previous quarter? Are they fairly stable, improving or declining?",75

So Chris, it'll depend on the customer or distributor. I'd say that typically, we'll get -- look out on demand out for 6 months. Sometimes, it'll be longer, and we'll get a longer term forecast run. But usually, they run about 6 months. Inside of a certain window, those forecasts are deemed as more firm. But that said, they can change and they can change very quickly. So we can have 100% visibility, but that doesn't mean that those forecasts can't change. 
From an order standpoint, I can tell you that during the quarter, we saw orders were higher in May. They increased again in June. That's kind of what happens in the second quarter. And I'd just say that those order rates versus when we were all on the book-ship business without consignment certainly were a different signal than what they are today. So we look at those -- the orders that we have on the books. We look at the consignment forecasts that we see and we make judgments based on that and roll that all up to what we provide to you in our outlook. So do you have a follow-on, Chris?",196

With regard to inventory, they were -- it looks like it was down sequentially in days, but still, I believe it's toward the higher end of your range. Can you talk about your expectations? I suppose that you would expect that to drop as you go into second half. Do you have a particular target in mind for where you expect inventory to approach as we exit the year? And then what that implies for production in the second half; I know you often try to level load production given the seasonality. Is that still the case this year?",100
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2733.0,1011669.0,42624211.0,Answer,Kevin March,,Executives,52,"Yes, Chris. I don't really have a specific inventory forecast for you per se. I would just point out a couple of things on inventory to kind of keep in mind. Total dollars of inventory are actually down on a year-over-year basis even though days are up, and that's really a function of the higher profitability that the company is performing at now, and you just do the math at a higher gross margin percent, that same inventory towards more days of potential sales. So that's part of what's going on there. But as you noted, it is down quarter-over-quarter on a day's basis. And typically -- going into third quarter, typically, it tends to be an up-revenue quarter for us. And as you mentioned, when we level load the factories, that would anticipate that some of the inventory will be drained as we go through the quarter. But we don't have a specific forecast as days or dollars. We just expect that will probably drain somewhat going into the third quarter, and then we'll continue to adjust our loadings and our expectation for the first and fourth quarter as we continue through the year.",195

I just wanted to follow back upon a prior OpEx question. It's just -- how do you think about managing it? Obviously, you've gotten the question probably 2 years in a row on why R&D as a percentage of revenue is low? And it bottomed in '15. You've grown it faster than revenue. How do you think about it over the next year or 2 going forward? Is there a particular percentage you're managing it to? Or is it a function of where you can get gross margins; just how you're thinking about it? And then if you can just talk about where you're deploying these new resources.",119

So just -- it's kind of a -- first, on the 50,000-foot level, we've talked about our total OpEx will probably fluctuate between 20% and 30% of revenue. Meaning that in weaker markets, we might be toward the higher end of that range. In stronger markets, we'll run at the lower end of that range. Again, in the last couple of years, we've been around the middle of that pack, around 23%, 24%, 25% kind of range. So that's kind of a high-level look at OpEx as a whole. And more specifically on R&D, when it comes to allocating capital -- and R&D is certainly a place where we allocate some of that capital to; it's a pretty important thing for any management team to pay attention to. We take it extremely seriously to make sure that when we do allocate to R&D, we allocate in areas that we believe that we can actually develop differentiated products with very long revenue streams and very high margin opportunities. Now the idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on R&D dollars spent. So it's not a percent per se that we're trying to manage to. It's an opportunity that we're going after. And as we've just talked about earlier in the call, some of our R&D spend is actually moving up a little bit even these past few quarters, and will probably continue to move up in the next few quarters as we are seeing opportunities to reallocate some of our resources from where they have been into development areas for R&D purposes that will just extend the overall availability of our products into new marketplaces. So we're really look at it opportunistically and not based upon a particular model or percent of revenue or anything like that.",301

There's been concerns all year, but I think the data points have been stronger than not. Just curious, your perspective on that market as you go into September in terms of inventory.

Clearly, what's driving the market today, we believe, is content gains. And if you've visited an auto showroom anytime in the last year, that's pretty obvious to see with the new models that are coming out. Our belief is that automotive sales will fluctuate much like they have in the past and into the future. But certainly, that -- overall, the content gain is what's growing things. 
So -- and as Kevin said, when we look at the automotive market, we're making investments that will produce revenue 5 and 10 and 15 years out into the future. If things were to weaken in that market, and we don't know if that's going to be next quarter or 5 years from now when that does, but we know how to handle those types of situations tactically.

I would say, we disclose by segment the revenue and the operating profit, and we don't dig into too many details underneath that as to what's happening between the lines. I would say that the -- at the gross margin level, obviously, it does benefit from our continued efforts to lower our manufacturing costs. So that's clearly happening inside there. From an OpEx standpoint, we have been reducing OpEx for a couple of years up through about May of last year. We've got an OpEx now mostly at the level that we want it that. So it really is a question of being able to drive revenue growth and get leverage off the OpEx that we have. And that leverage then falls straight through to free cash flow, which is a direct benefit, of course, to our shareholders based upon the formula we've talked about with capital management. So that's how we tend to look at it as opposed to trying to force a model on it that no -- the 2 segments being comparable, we look at what they can actually generate bottom line.",187

And Vivek, that -- we talked about, in our capital management call, that we ended last year with about $2 billion of our Analog revenue, which were roughly about $8 billion in that year on 300-millimeter, so approximately 25% of revenue. I will say that when you look at that factory where we're building it, we call it -- it's our Richardson fab or we call it the R fab for short, that'll support $5 billion of revenue when it's completely full. And if you look at that $5 billion, one of the reasons why we believe that our manufacturing and technology is one of the competitive advantages that we've got is because that $5 billion is significantly larger than any of our Analog competitors that we've got. So that level of scale just doesn't makes sense for them. And beyond our fab, we've got and qualified our second 300-millimeter factory that we creatively call DMOS6, which sits a little less than a mile from the office that we're currently in. So I can say that we did qualify that at the end of last year as we were anticipating. And we have revenue-generating wafers that are running through that factory today.

I guess, the first question that I have is, I was hoping you can comment a little bit on what customers are telling you these days as it relates to the consolidation the industry is seeing. I mean, are they coming to you and perhaps asking you to get into certain businesses? Because I assume they must be a little bit concerned about there being less and less suppliers. Just curious if you -- if some of those discussions have already happened with your customers?",87

And at that point in time, we had a lot of customers congratulate us and pleased that we were doing it because they knew we were friendly with business terms. Aside from that, I cannot point to any example of a customer coming to us and saying anything about the consolidation going on in the industry and what they think we should be doing about it.",85

And I'll just add to that, Tore. If you think of the business model that we're trying to put together, it's not focused on one customer or 1 or 2 products where, if you saw consolidation as an OEM, you might have significant concerns and maybe go to one of those companies' competitors. So I think to a large extent, that's probably why we don't have those overall concerns. Obviously, as you know, the Analog market continues to be extremely fragmented, both from a customer base as well as suppliers even with the consolidation that we've seen. Do you have a follow-up, Tore?",104

And the follow-up, just back to the near-term environment, so you talked about the sell-through as probably being a little bit better-than-expected.

So -- and that's just an environment that I'd say that it's okay. If I used one word to describe it, it's not really strong. It's not really weak. And we're operating in that type of environment. I think the benefit of us having consignment and having consignment with distribution is that our revenues more closely match that demand. That doesn't mean that they can't change quickly in the future at some point. But certainly, we're shipping what we believe -- what we know for sure, and that portion of demand is -- those shipments are very, very close to actual demand and consumption. So thank you, Tore.

Indications I've seen, the British economy is probably about 4% of the global GDP. So even if there's a wobble inside that economy, it's going to be really hard for us to be able to detect it. I would say that -- what we really do see is our customers are global. They sell globally and it's the larger macro environment that we're in. And as Steve said a few minutes ago that macro environment has been and we believe will continue to be relatively slow. And so it's up to us to execute as best we can inside it to gain market share.",128

And then just back to personal electronics, I'm going to ask it in sort of a little bit of a different way. I think you said last call that it would be a little less of a headwind in the second quarter than it was in Q1, and it sounds like it was less of a year-over-year headwind. Can you commit at least to it being even less of a headwind in the third calendar quarter? I guess, the reason why I ask is because it's a pretty big hockey stick as this all normalizes. So I'm just trying to sort of figure out when that hockey stick is going to come.",114

Well, I won't try to get that granular on any one customer or any one market in providing a forecast. I'll just say that typically, and what we saw last year, certainly, PE had a very strong back half, right? So -- and we saw the demand weaken very, very late in the quarter. So we've seen a headwind year-on-year the last 2 quarters as we described. So I won't put together a forecast for you in the second half, but I'd just point out that we did have a very strong second half last year. So I hope that helps a little bit.

And as usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago. In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins in both -- increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. 
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. 
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment. 
From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all 3 product lines led by processors. In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago, primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by decreases in royalties and custom ASIC products. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double-digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even, despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew. 
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through: manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These 4 attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. 
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",625
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2697.0,1063069.0,44553857.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter of $2.28 billion was 62.0% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million or 21.9% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. 
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the third quarter was $968 million or $0.94 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. 
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. 
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt requirements. 
Consistent with this intent, we have announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share or $2 annualized. I will also note that we have updated our long-term dividend model from our prior target of about 50% for our trailing 4-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. 
Today's announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are important element of shareholder returns. In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. 
These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. 
So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",701

It's roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, R&D up and you've talked about increasing R&D investments. Given that, what are your expectations for R&D and total OpEx as we go into Q4? I know seasonally, they would be down. But given the increases that we're seeing in R&D, how should we think about OpEx going into next quarter?",62

But overall, you should think about OpEx in 4Q pretty much being the same as you've seen in each of the last several years not as down because they have the seasonal benefit there just from the fact that there's going to be Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays going on. So total OpEx should continue to be seasonally down.",93

For my follow-up. I wanted to ask about the change in strategy between or apparent change in strategy between dividends and buybacks.

We are planning to allocate more towards the dividends at this point in time. We've always said the buybacks were various of function of the stock price and a dividend model that can vary from 50% to 80% we believe is a more thorough comprehension of our capital allocation.

I believe record levels for you, 40 plus here. I think the highest I've seen out there is high 40s at linear. Curious, do you think that you could achieve that over time?

And that is as we have more and more revenue being generated on 300-millimeter, well, we enjoy a significant cost benefit versus any of our competitors. We'll see that just falling straight through not just the margin but all the way through the free cash flow, which is most important in our mind. So clearly as you pointed out, this has been a new high for our Analog segment, and that business still has plenty of runway underneath as we go forward.",112

So as revenue grows, if that was 200-millimeter capacity, that will help to grow free cash flow margin as well as operating margins in the businesses that use that. So the fact that it's 300-millimeter of course, and the fact that it's 40% lower costs will certainly help us as well. So you have a follow-up, C.J.?",99

A shorter-term question. As you look to your implied guide of down 10%. And I know typical seasonality is kind of thrown out the door here. But I guess in the last 5 years, your average is roughly down 7%. So is there any onetime issues here, customer concentration? Conservatism? How should we think about that?",58

I think if you look at the midpoint of the guidance, C.J., it would suggest a year-on-year growth of about 3%. So I think in general, we just believe that's just very consistent with the modest overall macro environment. And that's really kind of been the case for the last 2 years. So our view really remains that we're in the slow growth economic environment. We don't really see any catalysts that's really going to change that one direction or the other any time soon.

So let me just talk about what drove the quarter. We, as I mentioned before, the automotive market remains strong. We've got 5 sectors inside of that market and most of them had grown double-digits. Industrial demand improved and the encouraging part of that was that it was very, very broad-based and we had most of the sectors growing. Inside of personal electronics, that was even. And that was despite continued year-over-year declines and demand from one customer. But I think speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics. And then communications equipment grew from a year ago, was even sequentially. So -- and lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well. So when we look into the fourth quarter, we don't -- we'll call out anything that is moving around significantly. You've seen us do that in the past when we've had some type of discontinuity to help explain the results. And that's not the case as we move into fourth quarter. So do you have a follow-up, Toshi?",190

There are really 4 attributes that we think that we have that put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and to actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity in all the positions that our products enjoy in the marketplace. So when we look at the acquisitions, it's about trying to see if we can strengthen those 4 attributes and really it starts out by looking at companies from the standpoint of a strategic match. And that means will that strategic match leverage the strength and competitive advantages we've been building on for these last number of years. So from a strategic standpoint, that would probably include a company that's likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to industrial and automotive, which is where we believe most of the growth for semiconductor is going to happen for quite a few years to come. If a potential target passes the strategy test, then we got to get passed the number test and that really means the price that we pay for it. Well, the return on that price, well, the return on that investment in capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about 4-year time frame. If we can't get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines. As we look at what's been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple of years, it strikes us that there are probably really 2 things underway for most participants in that space. They're either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets. In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those. So we don't feel compelled to have to move unless we can pass that strategy and math test, I just talked about a moment ago.",350

So I'm just looking at the results in the last 10-or-so years. And it's only been down double-digits I think once in 8 years or something like that. I remember last year you guys guided down 7%, sequentially. So did anything -- has anything changed recently? Have you seen any change in order rates? Any change in the end markets? Change in linearity? Change in anything? I'm just wondering why the down 10?",83

I think it's just consistency with the overall macro. And I -- if you look over the last 5 years, we've had a range from as high as down 1.3% and back in 2012. I think we were down 12.1%.

It really hasn't changed much in probably the last 3 or 4 quarters, and I don't expect it to change anytime in the near term. We load the factories in accordance with our expectation of demand and because of our inventory strategies, sometimes that demand goes beyond just the next quarter, may include the following quarter. From an inventory standpoint, you'd recall that our model is to have 105 to 115 days. Excuse me, 105 to 135 days. We had quite a bit more inventory last quarter and we -- from a days standpoint, and we had mention then that we had built that in anticipation of growing revenues in the fourth -- third quarter. We have had those growing revenues and our inventory days dropped down 117. So I expect that we'll continue to operate within the model days that we talk about and our utilizations will continue to be relatively stable as we've seen in the last 3, 4 quarters.",166

At that level, we've had PCs come in year-over-year about even, which is an improvement from what we saw. I think that outside of that one customer, we've actually seen really broad-based growth.

And then yes, on the longer-term side, as you look at your automotive business, obviously, that's a focus for you guys. Can you talk a little bit about how do you plan for that business? And how much of your effort is sort of aimed at sort of traditional building block catalog type products?

Yes, so we have -- we've got 5 sectors that make up the automotive market for us that we look at. They're infotainment, safety, advanced driver assist systems or ADAS, body electronics and lighting, and then PowerTrain systems, which include hybrid and electric systems. And we're -- have a very intentional focus to invest across all of those 5 sectors. We're seeing that in the results with revenues and most of those sectors growing double-digits. And we have an approach inside of automotive that is similar really across our other markets where we look to leverage our 4 competitive advantages. And I think that, that's helping to turn in those results. So we are favoring what I would say catalog and application-specific solutions. I wouldn't put that into the category of full turnkey system-level solutions where we're doing what we would consider to be the work that our customers do. So we are providing them building blocks that have different levels of integration. But we're not looking to provide a full ADAS system as an example. So we'll enable those systems and I think that, that's pretty consistent with what you see across all the markets and sectors that we serve. So okay. Thanks, Joe.

I think as we talked about, last quarter, we did see an improvement in industrial demand. It actually had been flat for several quarters year-on-year. So we were encouraged by that. This quarter, we built on that a little bit. And like last quarter, it was very, very broad-based. I won't try to go in and try to predict how long that will last or carry forward.

And the follow-on is regarding inventory in both the channel at your customers. And given the stronger growth in Q3, was any part of that growth perhaps attributed to some increase in inventory?

And that's pretty similar to what we saw a year ago. So again, we just -- we believe that, that inventory level just reflects an environment of really good product availability. We've got good inventories on our books available to be able to ship. We've continued to have very stable lead times. And those things kind of taken together just drive very high customer service metrics. So customers in general are getting products when they want to have them. So -- and I'll just make the reminder too, that 4 weeks of inventory is just structurally lower because of the consignment programs that we have at our major distributors. So thank you, Chris.

I think when you look at the Embedded markets, we've seen good growth there for a number of quarters. And if you look at the end markets, they have a very good exposure to automotive, to industrial and to the comms market. So as we talked about, the communications market or really, all 3 of those markets contributed to growth. And the great thing about the growth is it's very broad-based. It's not in one market. It's not in one sector. It's not driven by one technology, so we feel really good about the sustainability of that growth. And the great thing with that it's falling through to the operating profit, which you can see inside of that business and most importantly, it's falling through to free cash flow growth.

Yes, so our relationship with distributors have been evolving and always evolve, I think any healthy business relationships evolve. But especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So you've heard Kevin and I, both mention our 4 competitive advantages and certainly the reach of our channels is one of them. And so that includes both the size and the skill of our direct sales and applications teams, but it also includes the growing capabilities of the web and ti.com. So as an example, 3 years ago, we discontinued our incentive programs for demand creation on accounts that represented about 80% of the TAM where we had resources calling on those accounts directly. And we made that change because our team is just more effective and efficient at demand creation. And this has played out as we've continued to gain share every year since then. And then more recently, we've discontinued the incentives for the remaining balance of the account. So -- and so we expect, as with all relationships, we'll continue to evolve. But we do believe distributors will continue to play an important role in order fulfillment for our customers. So okay. Thank you, Ambrish. And we'll go to the next caller, please.",209

If you look at our normal seasonality, the one thing that we can conclude for sure is that second and third quarter are our seasonally strongest quarters, fourth and first are seasonally weakest.

And I don't know whether it's the Other segment, which had very strong growth in Q3. And I know Dave, you mentioned on a year-on-year basis but last year, I believe your sales were down in Q4.

It is our best outlook right now based upon a continuing weak macroeconomy. We had a book-to-bill in 3Q of 0.99, compare that to 1.0 a year ago. So the visibility into the quarter is a little bit reduced versus what it was a year ago. There is no one market, no one customer, no one product. It is our best estimate at this point in time.

Now given the focus on free cash flow, why isn't TI better utilizing an asset like your balance sheet? Because you're operating, if my numbers are right, at about 0.15 net debt to trailing EBITDA. And most of your peers are comfortable operating at 3 to 4x. So given this low growth environment and sort of negative returns for holding cash, why is TI holding so much cash? And why not buy back more of your stock if you think M&A looks expensive or not attractive right now?",89

We have been buying back shares every quarter, since the fourth quarter of 2004. Our method for buying back shares is to be disciplined and consistent in how we go about doing it. More importantly, what we've talked about is that we will buy back more shares when the price is lower and probably fewer shares when the price is higher. And so to that end, we recently as with today's announcement, have updated our allocation budget, if you will, for what we allocate for free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing 4 years average free cash flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases. To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now, the balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past. We have been slowly paying that debt back down over time, which means the debt is available should an important strategic opportunity presents itself at the right moment in time. We believe that leveraging now just for the sake of leveraging would actually block the balance sheet from being available should an opportunity present itself out there from a strategic standpoint.",236

I guess just starting on the dividend increase that you guys announced. Could you just talk about I mean, as I think about the future dividend payout strategies you guys have, is it going to be more a reflection of your free cash flow growth on an annualized basis? Or would the desire be to increase dividends along with free cash flow growth plus increasing the payout till you get to the midpoint of this 50% to 80% range, just how do I think about this on an annual basis?",100

And that is our free cash flow has been growing consistently for quite a few years now. And our formula design means that by definition, our dividends are increasing consistent with that. What this new range does is just give us more framework to adjust the allocation between dividends and stock buyback. We call it -- we take all the free cash flow and we use it either for dividend or buyback. And this allows us to allocate more towards dividend growth as opposed to buyback going forward. If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time, then this allows us to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases. So that's what this new range is designed to do, is to give us more flexibility to be responsive to the changing market valuations that we see out there.",172

So let me just follow-up. Your R&D has sort of increased double-digits for a few quarters. It sounds like it will do so again. I guess, does that suggest that you're kind of shifting a little bit from harvest into investing more in your business? And if that's the case, should we recalibrate expectations maybe in calendar '17 and '18, that the share gain that you guys have typically had of 30, 40, 50 basis points could be somewhat higher given all the investments you're making?",88

And really what we're doing on this stuff today, we're being very disciplined on R&D as well. We're not spending just for the sake of spending, but we're spending because we have a higher degree of confidence in the ideas that are coming to us that we can actually turn that into profitable revenue growth and ideally, market share. And we're doing that by just reallocating our internal resources as I mentioned, meaning we're not taking our total spending up, but we're taking people who may have been working in the manufacturing lines or people who may have been working in sales or general administrative areas and putting them into working on R&D projects as well. So as an overall reallocation internally, and I would expect that, that will continue to support our market share gains as we go forward.",159

And I just -- I would add that we've gained, on average, 30 to 40 basis points of market share. And I think we've gained share each of the last 6 years, I think we're on track to be able to put a seventh year up. And we'll wait for the -- wait for the numbers to get posted before we declare that. But again, market share just doesn't move quickly in the markets that we've got. And I think that, that just speaks to the quality of the market. So I think this -- these opportunities that Kevin's talking about just gives us confidence that we can continue to have share gains in the future. So thanks, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller, please.",128

So do you anticipate any greater opportunities or fire sales as the industry, I would say, rapidly consolidates? I mean, you probably got wafer fabrication equipment but maybe there's other areas like test and packaging?",52

And we have been pretty much every quarter, picking up some pieces of equipment here or there. But again, we look at the total opportunity, meaning, can we get it at the right price? And can it be something that will contribute to our free cash flow as we go forward? And so we look at it in that context when we consider these sort of things. So I would expect that we'll continue to be out there, making opportunistic acquisitions. Some may rise to the level of an announcement, but most of them will probably just remain as they have been, just spot purchase that we do from time to time as we look around the world.",163

Over to Embedded Processing. Questions on expectations for DSP applications, should we think of it as largely communications infrastructure, 4G and 5G? I notice there's DSP IT companies out there, they're talking about using these chips as accelerators for things like deep learning, artificial intelligence, accelerating some applications.",49

So like you said, in the comms equipment space, you've got processors that have multicores of both ARMs and DSPs, but also have a heavy component of hardware accelerators. Our OMAP products that are gaining traction in automotive and other applications inside of industrial, have DSPs inside of them. If you look at our communication products where we support over a dozen different standards that helped machines be connected and be smarter, they will have DSPs inside of them. So we kind of just look at that as an enabling technology. The good news is that, that business complements our Analog product portfolio very well. It isn't one type of product or a technology that's building that business. We've got a very good diversity of customers that we're building over time. So we're encouraged by the confidence and the sustainability of that revenue. And the wires underneath and the technology underneath are important on how we deliver it. But the business model is what's really encouraging for us. So okay. We can go to -- have time for one more caller, please.",206

Depending upon how much down sequentially it is, you could still have gross margins kind of flat to up in the December quarter and notwithstanding the revenue decline you've had in prior quarters were down, revenues doesn't necessarily mean down gross margins. So kind of curious how you think about gross margins going into the calendar fourth quarter? And what leverage you can still pull other than just volume to keep moving gross margins up and to the right?",97

I think you know that we normally don't try to give that precise a forecast, other than just topline and bottom, and earnings. But I will just remind you that just like 3Q benefited from lower costs as we increased production in the 300-millimeter and depreciation rolling off. Depreciation will continue to roll off and 300-millimeter will continue to become a bigger portion of our wafers that we start. So you've got a number of underlying cost things that will continue to give us good results on the overall gross margin for those who are interested in that number.",101

I appreciate it. And then Dave I guess, as my follow-up, you talked about your largest customer in personal electronics being down year-over-year in the September quarter. Do you think that's an accurate reflection of kind of their unit demand? Or is there something going on with your content or your pricing? And would you expect that customer to be down again year-over-year in the December quarter?",70

And with most of our large customers, I'll just generalize the comment, most of our large customers will be on some type of consignment or hub-based system. So there's usually not a large delay in the demand when it actually gets pulled and when it's used. There's always exceptions to that over all. From a content standpoint. I think we've mentioned before that we sell hundreds of products into our largest customers and including our largest one. And we continue to win new products. So we're confident in the design wins that we've got and the revenue that, that will drive overall. 
So okay. Well, thank you, John for your call. Thank you, everyone for listening tonight. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.",145
