We significantly accelerated our business and exceeded our aggressive growth goals for the year while navigating industry-wide challenges caused by COVID-19. 
We built substantial momentum throughout the year as we successfully ramped volume production of more than 20 7-nanometer PC, gaming and data center products. Annual revenue grew 45%, setting a new record at $9.76 billion. We also expanded gross margin for the fifth straight year and more than doubled net income from the prior year. While the PC market grew approximately 13% in 2020 to surpass more than 300 million units for the first time since 2014, our annual client processor revenue grew by more than 50% as AMD Ryzen processor adoption increased. 
We delivered record client annual processor revenue as we gained significant share in 2020. Adoption of EPYC processors across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers also accelerated significantly in 2020. We set a new all-time record for annual server processor revenue. Server processor sales more than doubled year-over-year, and our overall data center sales are now a high-teens percentage of our total annual revenue. 
Looking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year very strong. Revenue grew 53% year-over-year to a record $3.24 billion, while net income increased 66%. 
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Fourth quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $1.96 billion. Desktop CPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially driven by strong demand for our Ryzen processor family in both OEM systems and the channel. Sell-through of our new Ryzen 5000 processors featuring our Zen 3 core was particularly strong, more than doubling the launch quarter sales of any prior generation Ryzen desktop processor. 
In mobile, CPU shipments increased by a double digit percentage, both sequentially and year-over-year. We set records for both quarterly and annual mobile processor unit shipments as Ryzen 4000 notebook shipments continued to ramp in support of the 100 notebook design wins launched in 2020. 
At CES earlier this month, we launched our Ryzen 5000 mobile processors for ultrathin, gaming and commercial notebooks. These new mobile processors featuring our Zen 3 processor core, extend our performance and battery life leadership, delivering up to 23% higher performance compared to our previous generation and 17.5 hours of battery life. We are on track to increase the number of notebook designs powered by our new Ryzen 5000 processors by 50% compared to our prior generation, positioning us well for further growth in 2021. 
In Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year and increased sequentially. Desktop GPU sales increased significantly from the prior quarter, driven by the ramp of our new Radeon 6000 series GPUs, featuring our RDNA 2 architecture that deliver up to twice the performance and 65% more performance per watt than our prior generation. 
We are seeing very strong demand for our new GPUs. The Radeon 6000 series are our fastest-selling high-end GPUs ever with launch quarter shipments 3x larger than any prior AMD gaming GPU priced above $549. We continue to ramp production to meet the strong demand, and are on track to expand our Radeon 6000 GPU portfolio in the first half of the year with the new RDNA 2-based desktop and mobile GPUs. 
Data center GPU revenue decreased year-over-year but increased sequentially, including initial shipments of our AMD Instinct MI100 accelerator. MI100 features our new CDNA data center GPU architecture and is the industry's fastest HPC accelerator for scientific research, and the first Data center GPU to break the 10 teraflops barrier. We are making strong progress on our data center GPU hardware road map and expanding our software ecosystem in preparation for the launch of the first exascale supercomputer in the United States, the all-AMD powered Frontier system planned to go online later this year at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue of $1.28 billion increased 176% year-over-year driven by strong growth in both semi-custom and server processor sales. Semi-Custom sales increased year-over-year and sequentially based on strong demand for the next-generation Sony and Microsoft consoles. Our Semi-Custom SoC sales are ramping faster than the last console cycle, and we expect sales to be better than typical seasonality in the first half of this year based on the current strong demand. 
Now turning to server, we had record revenue in the fourth quarter as both cloud and enterprise sales grew sequentially. Cloud adoption remains strong as Google, Microsoft, Tencent and others continue expanding their use of EPYC processors to power larger portions of their critical internal infrastructure, and the number of AMD-powered cloud instances expands. 28 new public cloud instances launched in the fourth quarter from Alibaba, AWS and Oracle, while Google expanded general availability of their confidential computing VMs powered exclusively by EPYC processors to 9 regions. 
For the year, the number of AMD-powered instances available from the largest cloud providers doubled to more than 200. In the enterprise, adoption of AMD-powered servers grew as Dell, HPE and Lenovo secured new end customer wins with Fortune 1000 accounts across key verticals, including manufacturing, financial services and automotive. In HPC, the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the November top 500 list increased to 21 systems including 2 of the top 10 and the fastest supercomputer in Europe. 
We expect our data center business to accelerate in 2021 as we further extend our performance, efficiency and TCO leadership with the launch of our next-gen server processors, code name Milan. Milan production began in the fourth quarter as planned, with initial shipments to cloud and HPC customers. We are very pleased with the performance of Milan. 
We conducted the first public preview of Milan at CES, highlighting 68% better performance compared to 2 of the highest-end dual-socket processors from our competition when running a compute-intensive weather modeling simulation. We're on track to publicly launch our 3rd Gen EPYC Milan processors in March with very strong ecosystem support. 
In summary, our strong 2020 results and 2021 guidance demonstrate the growing momentum for our leadership product portfolio and the robust demand for high-performance computing. In the last year, we have all seen firsthand the essential role high-performance computing now plays in our daily lives, and we expect adoption to accelerate over the coming years as we enter a high-performance computing mega cycle, driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing services, accelerating digital transformation of industries and experiences, the transition to exascale supercomputing and the mainstream adoption of AI. 
Against this backdrop, we are very confident we have the right long-term strategy and capabilities to deliver a strong cadence of leadership products and make AMD the premier technology growth franchise. Longer term, our strategic acquisition of Xilinx further strengthens our technology capabilities and positions us well for growth across a broader set of markets. We passed several important regulatory milestones to date, and remain on track to close the transaction by the end of 2021. 
I am very proud of what AMD has accomplished over the last few years as our talented and dedicated employees established a new pace for innovation in the high-performance computing industry. I'm even more excited about what we can accomplish over the coming years based on our road maps and the strong opportunities we see to play an even larger strategic role with our customers and partners. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder?",1269
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3730.0,2181802.0,85406628.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was an outstanding year for AMD. Our industry-leading product portfolio and market share gains drove record annual and quarterly revenue with full year revenue growth of 45%. We also achieved record annual net income and free cash flow. We are pleased with our strong performance and the leverage in our financial model.
Fourth quarter revenue was $3.24 billion, up 53% from a year ago and up 16% from the prior quarter driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and semi-custom game console SoCs. Gross margin was 45%, approximately flat year-over-year. Operating expenses were $789 million, up 45% year-over-year driven by increased investments in R&D go-to-market activities and higher variable employee compensation-related expenses.
Operating income was $663 million, up $258 million or 64% from a year ago driven by significant revenue growth, and operating margin was 20% compared to 19% a year ago. Net income was $636 million, up $253 million or 66% from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.52 compared to $0.32 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Fourth quarter Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.96 billion, up 18% year-over-year primarily driven by significant Ryzen processor growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $420 million, or 21% of revenue compared to $360 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 176% year-over-year driven by strong semi-custom product sales and continued EPYC server processor momentum across the cloud and enterprise markets.
EPYC processor revenue grew sequentially, including early shipments of third-generation EPYC Milan processors. EESC segment operating income was $243 million or 19% of revenue compared to an operating income of $45 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. We had record free cash flow of $480 million in the fourth quarter. Inventory was $1.4 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter in preparation of 2021 sales. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $753 million compared to $469 million a year ago, driven by higher quarterly earnings.
Before I turn to the full year financial results, let me address a GAAP tax item. Based on our financial results and strong outlook, we released a significant portion of our tax valuation allowance totaling $1.3 billion which had a GAAP EPS benefit of $1.06 in the fourth quarter and a benefit of $1.07 for the full year.
Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2020 revenue was $9.76 billion, up 45% year-on-year driven by strong growth in both business segments. Gross margin of 45% was up 190 basis points from the prior year driven by Ryzen and EPYC products, partially offset by semi-custom and Radeon product sales.
Operating expenses were 28% of revenue, improving from 31% in 2019. 2020 operating income was up 97% from a year ago to $1.66 billion or 17% of revenue. Net income was $1.58 billion, up 108% from the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.3 billion at year-end and full year free cash flow was $777 million as compared to $276 million in 2019. We reduced principal debt by $225 million in 2020 and ended the year with $338 million of gross debt.
Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. We expect revenue to be approximately $3.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million an increase of approximately 79% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth in all businesses. The sequential performance is driven primarily by better than normal seasonality in our PC and semi-custom businesses and strength in our data center business. In addition, for Q1 2021, we expect: non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $830 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $105 million, including an effective tax rate of 15%; and first quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full year 2021, we expect revenue growth of approximately 37% driven by growth in all businesses; we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 26% of revenue; non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%; and we expect the company's cash tax rate to be approximately 3%.
In closing, I'm very pleased with our 2020 results, which demonstrate the strength of AMD's product momentum, customer traction and market share gains. As we enter 2021, and continue to invest in the business and execute our long-term strategy, we are well positioned to drive gross margin expansion, increase profitability and deliver strong shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth?",802

So thanks for the question, Blayne. Look, we're excited going into 2021. Obviously, 2020 was quite a strong growth year for us. As we look at the annual guidance, we really do see strength across all of our businesses. So the -- it's led by our larger businesses. So significant growth -- we expect significant growth in server, growth in PCs as well as growth in the semi-custom console business. But we also see growth in our graphics business across consumer and data center graphics as we ramp the full product lines there as we go through 2021. So overall, I think we're seeing the strength of the new product portfolio as well as a positive demand environment.",119

Obviously, March seems to be much better than seasonal across several product lines. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the overall PC market. I think Intel talked about for being first half weighted. And then obviously, semi-custom, you probably didn't as much in December as you did the first 3 quarters of 2020. Kind of curious how you just think about first half, second half within that.",88

So you saw that a little bit in our Q1 guidance. I think our Q1 guidance is better than normal seasonality. We normally see as the first half weaker than the second half just given the consumer bent.
What we see this year is a little bit of a different shape. The shape is -- from a market standpoint, we see PCs and gaming better than seasonal. There's some pent-up demand coming into the first half of the year, and that's baked into the guidance.
But we're also seeing a strong data center environment. So we see server up sequentially in Q1, and that's on the strength of both our current products or our Rome products as well as the Milan ramp. So a little bit different shape than normal, but I think we see strong demand across our PC gaming and data center segments.",146

And I picked up in the prepared script, Lisa, that you mentioned accelerating growth for your data center franchise in 2021. I think that's probably off a business that doubled last year. So do I have that right that it will accelerate in percentage terms? And maybe you could break down a little bit. I saw Alibaba in the slides announced. There's a Milan launch coming that I think could push you into enterprise a little bit more than you've been in the past. Some drivers of that server growth would be really helpful.",120

Sure. So Matt, thanks for the question. We are happy with the progress in the data center business. I think 2020 was a strong year for us. We do see a significant growth into 2021.
I think there are a number of drivers. First of all, I think we're seeing the cloud business strengthen for us. So going into the first half of the year, and as I said, that's both on the current-generation Rome as well as the next-generation Milan. The reception to Milan is very strong. So we're pleased with the performance. We started shipments in Q4. That's continuing into Q1. You'll see -- we expect to see sort of more customers, sort of new customers adopt Milan than perhaps that had been on our previous generation. You'll also see a very strong enterprise portfolio. So I think we have a very strong time-to-market platforms with the key OEMs, and that's part of our launch plan later this quarter.
So overall, I think we are optimistic about the data center in 2021. I think there's a lot of need across cloud and enterprise, and we think Milan is very well positioned.",194

It's no secret that the industry is supply constrained, both due to growth and because of some of the challenges with COVID, and your company is no different. Maybe you could characterize for us the magnitude of supply constraints. And how much they might have been hindering what was obviously really strong growth as it was. But that's number one.
And then number two, I noticed that a lot of folks had maybe thought that the big CapEx increase from TSMC might have been something to do with Intel. And I think the incoming CEO there has maybe clarified some of those thoughts. But I wonder as you look forward through this year, how your guidance incorporates increasing supply coming online. And if you've guided to an assumption of better supply or what you have line of sight to with your partners.",154
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3730.0,2181802.0,85406639.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,14,"Yes, sure. So certainly, when I look at the semiconductor environment in 2020, it was very strong. So we saw a strong revenue ramp in our business as well as across some of our peers. It's fair to say that the overall demand exceeded our planning. And as a result, we did have some supply constraints as we ended the year. Those were primarily, I would say, in the PC market, the low end of the PC market and in the gaming markets.
That being said, I think we're getting great support from our manufacturing partners. The industry does need to increase the overall capacity levels. And so we do see some tightness through the first half of the year, but there's added capacity in the second half.
And then as in terms of how we think about these things. So for our full year annual guide, we do have good visibility on both the demand side and the supply side. And that was the basis for the guidance across the businesses.",172

Lisa, just one question to go back to a prior one. I was hoping you could help us dissect Q1 and the 2021 outlook with and without your semi-custom business, so we get a sense for the different moving drivers of the business, both in Q1 and for the full year.",62

So let's see. Let me start with Q1. So as I said in the -- earlier that we do see the PC market and the console business a bit better than seasonal. Normally, consoles would be seasonally down quite a bit, double digits. You would expect consoles this quarter will still be, let's call it, modestly down. We do see a sequential increase in the server business as well as in the graphics business as we ramp new products there.
And then as we go into 2021, I would say we're now at the place where we have, let's call it, 3 businesses at scale. And so the guidance really encompasses very significant growth across our data center business in the service space, growth in PCs, just given the visibility that we have around platforms and platform launches on both the notebook side and the strength of our channel portfolio. And then we do see growth in the console business as well as there's a lot of demand for the new consoles.
So I think those are the 3 big drivers for the full year. And I would say it's well balanced between the 3. And then in addition, we also have growth in our consumer and data center GPU business as a result of some of the new products launched there. So it's a fairly, let's call it, broad based set of drivers, particularly around the product launches.",240

And for my follow-up, it's interesting that as you're launching Milan, your competitor is also launching their data center server. And so both kind of a near term and then a '21 question. So in the near term, there has been some discussion of cloud digestion. I know you're talking about your business actually growing sequentially. So I was hoping you could address what demand environment you were seeing in the very near term from your cloud and enterprise and HPC customers.
But looking out to 2021, both you and your competitor will actually be on very -- almost the same manufacturing node. So how do you think that will play a role in your decision-making of your customers. Because I think a lot of times the discussion kind of becomes one dimensional on who is at which manufacturing node. So talk to us about, even if you are on the same node as your competitor, what's your ability and confidence and visibility to take market share in the server CPU business.",174

Thanks, Vivek. That's a very good question. So in the near term, what we're seeing in the cloud is actually a period of strong demand. And so that's -- we saw it strengthening as we went through the fourth quarter, and we see demand environment robust in the first quarter. So I think that's a -- those are good signals for us.
I think for the year 2021, we're excited about Milan. I mean it's a very strong product. You've already seen a bit of what Zen 3 can do in just our desktop and notebook portfolio. I think it builds upon what we did in Rome. So I completely agree with you. I think manufacturing technology is one aspect of what makes a product competitive, but we have been very focused on overall performance, overall system performance, how it performs in the cloud and enterprise environments. I will say that I think Milan is the most balanced product that we have. Both for, let's call it, enterprise applications as well as for the broad set of cloud applications.
And in terms of visibility, I would say that we have better visibility starting this year than we've had in the past years because this is our third-generation with EPYC. So we're now on, let's call it, deep customer relationships. Many of the decisions have been made earlier as they were testing out our product. And we have good confidence that we're going to ramp well. So exciting year for the data center. But certainly, we're pleased with how Milan is performing and the interest in the marketplace.",268

So in the quarter, you had record server revenues, you said high teens, I'd put it to something like $550 million or $600 million which looks pretty good. At the same time, like gross margins sort of barely came in line with guidance. I mean they actually missed by a few kind of tens of basis points. I guess I'm just a little surprised, is that all console mix? And was consoles like that much better-than-expected relative to servers that you wouldn't see gross margin upside in the quarter? And I guess the same comments on the guide a little bit of upside. But at the same time, we've got consoles down. We've got everything else growing, and yet we've only got a little bit of upside in gross margins. So I guess if you could help me square that or square that with what you're seeing, that would be helpful, please.",159

Be happy to do that. So first, on the fourth quarter. I think we saw strength across a couple of different businesses relative to what we had guided. So we saw strength -- a little bit of strength in the console business, some strength in servers as well as some strength in PCs. And PCs in the fourth quarter tend to be a bit more weighted to the consumer side of the business. So those were some of the puts and takes. But from an overall sort of margin expectation standpoint, I think we were right where we expected to be.
And then going into 2021, if you're talking about the first quarter guide, I think my commentary was that we see PCs and consoles a bit better than seasonal. So consoles would normally be let's call it, down double digits, and that's not the case in this particular quarter. We have server up. And so again, these are just a few puts and takes, but we do see the sequential increase into Q1. And then for the full year, as we see the mix of business.",190

I guess for my follow-up, just to push on that a little bit. So what are you seeing on the pricing environment, especially in servers. I mean your competitors actually talked quite actively about a more competitive environment for servers. We're actually starting to see some impacts on their ASPs and their margins. What are you seeing -- I guess what did you see in terms of server pricing specifically on those kinds of trends in the quarter. And what are you incorporating in your guidance for price -- the pricing environment in data center in 2021.",99

So in the quarter, we saw ASPs in the server business actually up sequentially, and that was mostly because of mix, just mix between customers and the ramp of Milan. So as we go into 2021, again, I would say the environment's competitive. So I don't know that it's gotten more competitive. I think it's about as competitive as it's always been. Our focus has not been to compete on price, but to compete on overall value and total cost of ownership.
As we go into 2021, again, I think for us, ASPs are primarily determined by the mix between cloud and enterprise in any given quarter. We're still cloud weighted, and I would expect us to be cloud weighted as we go into 2021. But overall, I would say the ASP environment is about what it's been for the last [ year ].",145

Thanks for the question. So 2020 was a very strong year for the PC market. I think you've heard that from a number of the OEMs in the market. 2021, most people are saying, let's call it, mid-single-digits type growth. We see something similar to that. This shape is perhaps a bit different than normal in the sense that the first half is a bit stronger than it would normally be. 
Our focus in the PC market, though, is -- has been very clear on sort of the subsegments where we could actually move up the stack. So if you look at our focus on gaming, particularly gaming notebooks and desktops, premium consumer as well as commercial. And we made very nice progress on the commercial side. And I think that business tends to also develop over a number of quarters.
So overall, I think our expectations are -- the PC market will continue to be strong as we go into 2021. That being the case, it's one element of our growth. And particularly, we're focused on growth in commercial, growth in gaming as well as sort of in the premium consumer segment. And the Ryzen 5000 series that we just launched in both mobile and desktop have actually gotten very strong reception from the OEMs in terms of overall platforms.",223

And then as a quick follow-up on OpEx. The rate at which you're spending is very consistent with your long-term target. But that said, I mean, you are growing -- spending at a very fast clip. Can you remind us where the focus is today in terms of your spending profile? And how do you see that translating into future growth over the next couple of years? You have this 20% top line growth target out through 2023. You just grew 45% last year. You're guiding this year to up 37%. Is 20% still the right number? Could we envision something better?",104

Sure. So I don't think we're going to change our long-term growth rate just yet. We set that in March, and I think it's the right long-term growth rate. That being said, we're very happy with the growth of the business. And from our standpoint, this is a great time to invest in the business. So the model has always been, let's invest in the business, let's call it, at a rate slower than revenue growth so that we get leverage in the model. And so we're doing that. Yes, you can see the percentage of OpEx as a percent of revenue has come down over the last couple of years and will come down as well in 2021.
But the overall dollars have allowed us to expand considerably, and really just build out the foundation of the company. So our investments are really across R&D, expanding our product portfolio. We've leaned in hard on both the CPU, foundational IP, the GPU foundational IP as well as on the GPU side, we have split out the architectures between gaming and compute, so that we have very competitive offerings in both spaces.
As we go forward, more investment on some of the system IPs that link the CPUs and GPUs as well as investments on the software side and then investments in go to market. So across the board, I think we're becoming, let's call it, a company of scale. And that helps ensure that we have sort of the breadth and depth of road map as well as customer support to support the long-term growth objectives.",267

So definitely. So we do see sort of the expansion of, let's call it, our competitiveness across the enterprise set of workloads as well as the broad set of cloud workloads. Our goal in life is to make sure that we're offering improvements in total cost of ownership to our customers. So as the performance goes up, we do expect some ASP lift as well. But overall, from a customer standpoint, it's so important that the TCO really improve generation to generation.
Particularly with Milan, some of the single-threaded performance is very, very helpful. And we expect on some of the enterprise workloads that perhaps can't use all of the cores for -- that we have -- we'll be able to benefit significantly from Milan just given the uplift in overall performance. So we're excited to tell you more about it. Like I said, we'll be launching that later this quarter. But overall, we feel very good about the positioning of Milan.",163

Absolutely. Look, I think the data center GPU business is definitely coming into its own. And it will still likely be lumpy quarter-to-quarter just because the number of customers is not that large. But in terms of as a growth driver for the company, we see 2021 as a growth year for data center GPU, especially as the CDNA architecture comes into manufacturing and production and goes into some of the larger HPC installments as well as some work that we're doing in the cloud, around machine learning and AI. And more importantly, we see it as a multiyear growth driver over the next couple of years.
So we feel very good about the CDNA architecture. It's positioning. I think this is an important year for the data center GPU business, and it will be an important growth driver for us over the next few years.",147

So the graphics business, I think, has really been focused on ensuring consistency in road map, very similar to the CPU side. So we launched the first generation RDNA architecture that had a 50% performance per watt improvement. We launched second generation of RDNA 2, just a few months ago, and then we're going to fill out that portfolio here in the first half of the year. And I think that consistency is important in the road map. There is a lot of pent-up demand for graphics cards and gaming. And we see that, and we see it as an attractive market. So I do see that the consumer graphics business will grow in 2021. We expect to continue to make progress, both with the OEM business as well as the add-in board business.
And over the coming years, there's -- the team is working very hard on the next-generation RDNA 3 architecture as well. So I think the consistency in the road map, the top to bottom stack and really using sort of the depth and breadth of our customer relationships is sort of our strategy there.",190

You gave the shorter-term answer for the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but I wanted to ask one about 2021 as a whole. It's good to see that it's rising again up to that 47% target. I just wanted to walk through the puts and takes on that. And I guess the core question is if the semi-custom business is going to grow substantially as a percentage of your revenues, what's offsetting that to have the gross margin rise year-over-year. Is it mix between segments, so server, for example, is going to keep up with that? Or is there something within the segments that is also improving, whether it be in semi-custom or graphics or some area like that?",137

Server and client up in 2021, obviously, helped the gross margin. And you are right, semi-custom in 2020 is the initial ramp in a couple of quarters, and then it grows in 2021. And with the guidance that we gave, we are talking about going from 45% to 47% as overall for the year on a year-on-year basis. And semi-custom, obviously, lower than corporate average with higher revenue full year in 2021, does have an offset there from client and server.",92

So maybe just to add to that, Ross. So the -- I think the answer that -- to what you asked is, yes, consoles are, let's call it, below corporate average margin, although quite reasonable operating margins. Server is above and server is growing substantially in 2021. And also the PC business within the PC business, we do see some mix improvement as we focus on, let's call it, the more premium part of the stack.

I would kind of argue, given the mix in the December quarter and the fact that it was the first quarter of the console ramp, that the gross margins you were able to put up were quite good. And I'm kind of just trying to understand how we should think about gross margins ex console. And as we think about '21 unfold, typically in the console business, gross margins start relatively low, but there is good improvement over time. And so what's kind of the exit rate of gross margins in your 47% full year guide? And I guess why isn't it higher? It might just be that you guys are being conservative, but it seems like you got a lot of tailwinds as the year unfolds.",140

So again, maybe, Devinder, I'll start and see if you'd like to add to this. John, I think it's early in the year. So let me state that. We have good visibility into sort of the puts and takes in the various places. But obviously, there's a lot to unfold over the next 11 months. I do think all the statements that you made are accurate. So the console business does have a history of improving over time. I do think, though, that we'll just have to look at the mix of all the businesses, again, as it plays out.
And from an exit velocity standpoint, we're guiding to 46% for Q1 and then 47% for the overall year. So we will see improvements over the year. And the key is what is the mix amongst the businesses in any given quarter.",143

And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, it's pretty clear that semiconductors are becoming much more strategic to nation states and world governments. And there's a lot of speculation that your chief competitor is lobbying Washington pretty hard to get some incentives for domestic manufacturing.
I'm just kind of curious how you're trying to be part of that conversation? Because clearly, given the IP portfolio you have, given the share that you're taking, I would argue you're as much a national champion as anyone in semis, but it does seem like the focus is on manufacturing. So how do you kind of get the ear of Washington to make them understand how important you are in this whole mix?",121

And I think we all believe that. As it relates to what's important, I think the focus on manufacturing is certainly well documented. I think there's also a focus on leading-edge research and making sure that the leading edge research is also very well supported in the overall conversation. So we participate in many of the industry associations and the conversations. And the key is to continue to invest at both the leading edge in both research and manufacturing to sort of push the envelope on sort of the next 5 to 10 years. And that's one of the reasons we're investing as much as we are, and we continue to also agree that it's important as an industry that we continue to invest.",148

Perfect. Yes. So there's 2 questions. The first one's actually on the manufacturing side, I feel like people are poking about on the gross margin. But when you look at the company, you guys are driving 3 products ramp up. So the question I kind of want to pose here is what would the gross margin look like if you didn't -- if you had yields similar to what you had about 2 years ago, meaning that are the yields per TSMC and your -- I guess your overall foundry partners improving at the same rate as a normal environment? And then I have a follow-up after that.",109

Well, Mitch, maybe let me start by level setting the conversation with gross margins. I mean we're right where our road map says we would be, right. Our long-term road map says, given the mix of the business, we set out a target to be greater than 50%. I think we're right on track for that. I think as we go through each of the product ramps, there are the ebbs and flows. But that being the case, I think the yields are right on track with where we expect them to be as well.
And the most important thing is we're now seeing growth across, let's call it, 4 -- I'd say, 4 or 5 large businesses. And so again, there are some ebbs and flows between them, and sort of the mix between cloud and enterprise, the mix between consumer and commercial and then just the mix between consumer and data center graphics.
So put all that together, and like I said, I think we're pleased that we grew margins 2 points last year, and we're again, guiding to growing margins 2 points this coming year, and it's right in line with our overall road map.",199

Perfect. Yes, that makes complete sense to me. I think it's very difficult to grow the gross margin line with so many yields ramping up right now. The second one I just had, in terms of the overall addressable market, I realize you guys don't guide by segment. But I think that one of the big things that happened last year is PC surprised me as on the upside. So maybe you could level set us in terms of the 3 major markets you guys serve. GPUs, CPU PC side and servers. Just what do you think the total industry is going to do? This way, maybe you can give us at least an idea of what you guys view as a full year, and then we can kind of come to our conclusions -- our own conclusion, sorry, on what that means for AMD.",146

So I think my commentary was PCs, if you just look at what various sources are saying, we would say, sort of mid-single-digit growth, and I think we would agree with that. I think server as a market, if you take a look at enterprise and cloud, again, they have different growth rates, but let's call it, modest growth. And then gaming is hard to call because, again, it's a different cycle.
Within that sort of market backdrop, I think we see, let's call it, 37% growth. And much of that is because of the product ramps and the product portfolio that we have. So we're pleased with the growth. We think we're growing significantly ahead of the market. That being the case, we'll have to see what happens in 2021 because, as you said, the 2020 market was stronger than most projected at the beginning of 2020.",149

And maybe give us a sense. You've talked about in the past about the need to sell twice. You're sort of selling to the cloud service provider, and then they're selling it to the enterprises that they service. How are you doing with that? And where are you with sort of internal cloud workloads that they're internally focused on versus enterprise-facing workloads within the cloud?",77

Thanks for the question, Joe. Yes. So if you look at the cloud environment, we call it both internal as well as sort of the external-facing workload. I would say we've done very well with internal workloads in the last couple of quarters, Joe. We've seen a number of applications just ramp here in the second half of this year and going into next year. So we're pleased with the performance on the internal workloads.
We see that carrying over to Milan. And sort of the -- let's call it, the move from Rome to Milan is not too heavy a lift. And so we expect that, that will continue going into 2021. And in terms of the external-facing workloads. We've spent quite a bit of effort sort of building our, let's call it, sort of the business development engine that sort of, let's call it, sells along with the cloud vendors as well as, frankly, enterprise OEMs. And so our conversation with large enterprises is usually a hybrid conversation. It's -- if you want to buy on-prem, let me tell you what AMD EPYC can do. If you want to use cloud instances, we have a wide variety of cloud instances across all of the largest cloud vendors. And that's actually progressed very nicely. So I think, overall, that's leading to some of our positive commentary in cloud is that we have seen both progress on internal as well as the external sale with motion.",247

So I think the cloud gaming portion of the business was a larger portion of the business in sort of past years for the data center GPU.

It sounds like server CPU share is running like 12.5% on your $20 million TAM base that you use. So you have Milan ramping and you're talking about a lot of visibility on that ramp this year. So I'm sort of wondering if maybe you can give us what your guidance implies or sort of what the next milepost to think of would be in terms of server CPU share as you sort of exit the year and maybe look into next year.",111

So Tim, thanks for the question. What I would say is I don't have a new market share target. And I think just given all of the variance in the market. But what I will say is, we've given you a good view of the business through sort of the percent of revenue it is. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the data center business was high-teens percentage of annual revenue, and it was predominantly server. So the data center GPU was a very small piece of that, and it was predominantly server.
As we go into 2021, again, we see significant growth. I would say it's one of the key growth drivers for the company. And we'll give you updates as we go along the way in 2021 in terms of how it's growing as a relative size of the business.",145

Got it. And then just quickly on data center GPU. It looks like it was maybe flattish this year, year-over-year. And obviously, it's going to grow this year as Frontier comes in midyear. Can you just sort of maybe give us some sense in terms of how much you think it could grow. I mean could it double year-over-year? I understand it's not big from a dollar point of view. But could it double year-over-year? Maybe just talk about how big Frontier could be as a contributor to that business.",91

So I think -- as I previously stated, the data center GPU business is still relatively small for us. It was actually down year-over-year. So from 2019 to 2020, it was actually down year-over-year because some of the cloud gaming ramps in 2019 paused in 2020.
In terms of what it could do in 2021, we see it as a growth driver in terms of relative size, yes, it could double. I think the way to think about it, though, is we said that we would like to get that business to, let's call it, $0.5 billion as sort of the first milestone. And I think we're making good progress towards that milestone. But that's what I would say about it.",122

And good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our business continued to accelerate significantly in the first quarter, driven by the best product portfolio in our history, strong execution and robust market demand. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth and record quarterly revenue and profitability. First quarter revenue increased 93% year-over-year to $3.45 billion, with growth in all of our businesses. 
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. First quarter revenue increased 46% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, led by growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. In client computing, revenue grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year and increased sequentially as we set records for client processor revenue and ASP.  
Against the backdrop of strong overall PC demand, our revenue is growing significantly faster than the market, particularly in the ultrathin, gaming and commercial segments. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share in the quarter. Our revenue share has doubled over the last 2 years as we have expanded in the premium products.  
In notebooks, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of record mobile processor revenue based on sustained demand for Ryzen 4000 Series processors and the launch of our new Ryzen 5000 Series processors. Ryzen Mobile 5000 Series processor revenue has ramped twice as fast as the prior generation. We expect continued growth in 2021 as the number of notebook platforms powered by our new processors is on track to increase by 50% compared to our prior generation.  
We're also making good progress in the commercial market as unit shipments of our Ryzen PRO Processors grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We secured multiple high-volume wins across Fortune 500 aerospace, automotive, electronics and engineering companies in the quarter. And we're well positioned for further growth as we have tripled our commercial notebook design wins with the largest OEMs this year.  
In graphics, revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially, led by channel sales growth as revenue from our high-end Radeon 6000 GPUs more than doubled from the prior quarter. We introduced our Radeon 6700 XT deskstop GPU with leadership 1440p gaming performance in March and are on track for the first notebooks featuring our leading-edge mobile RDNA 2 architecture to launch later this quarter. We expect Radeon 6000 Series GPU sales to grow significantly over the coming quarters as we ramp production.  
Data center graphics revenue grew year-over-year and sequentially, driven largely by adoption of Instinct accelerators across cloud and HPC customers. 
We are making great progress on our data center GPU road maps and expect revenue to grow in the second half of the year as we begin the production ramp of our next-generation AMD Instinct GPU to support multiple HPC wins including Frontier, the first U.S. exascale supercomputer. Frontier will use next-generation AMD CPUs, GPUs and software to deliver unprecedented scientific computing and AI capabilities, creating a blueprint for scientific, cloud and enterprise customers to enable exascale-class computing and AI performance over the coming years. 
Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 286% year-over-year to $1.35 billion, driven by strong growth in both semi-custom and EPYC processor sales. Semi-custom revenue declined by a single-digit percentage sequentially, which is better than typical seasonality. We expect semi-custom sales to remain strong throughout 2021, driven by significant demand for the latest generation Sony and Microsoft consoles.  
In server, we delivered another quarter of record server processor revenue as EPYC processor sales more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. Sales of both our second- and third-gen EPYC processors increased sequentially as growing adoption of our second-gen offerings was complemented by third-gen EPYC processors successfully ramping into production across multiple cloud and enterprise customers.  Third-gen EPYC processors offer 25% more performance per watt compared to our previous generation and deliver both per socket and per core leadership across database, ERP, data analytics, Java, virtualization, cloud and supercomputing workloads.  
Cloud demand was particularly strong in the quarter as Tier 1 providers expanded their EPYC processor deployments to power more of their internal infrastructure and introduced 11 new AMD-powered instances. We expect the number of AMD-powered instances to double by the end of the year to 400 as Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle and Tencent significantly expand their offerings with third-gen EPYC processors.  
For the enterprise, Cisco, Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro all announced plans to expand their AMD-based offerings with more than 100 new third-gen EPYC processor-powered server platforms that deliver superior performance and total cost of ownership. In HPC, we built momentum with new high-volume wins, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Sweden's Institute of Science, as well as a unique on-prem and cloud solution for the United Kingdom's National Weather Modeling Service that will be the world's most powerful weather and climate forecasting supercomputer.  
Taking a step back, I am very pleased with the progress we have made in our data center business over the last several years as each new EPYC processor generation has ramped significantly faster than the previous generation. We have established AMD as a trusted strategic partner to the largest cloud enterprise and HPC customers based on developing and consistently delivering a leadership multigeneration CPU road map.  
2021 marks an inflection point in terms of the scale, ecosystem support and customer adoption of our EPYC and instant processors. In the first quarter, data center product revenue more than doubled year-over-year and represented a high-teens percentage of our overall revenue. We expect data center product revenue to grow significantly as we go through the year, driven by our strong pipeline of new cloud, enterprise and HPC wins.  
We significantly accelerated our business in the first quarter and now see higher growth for the year, driven by increased customer adoption for our products, overall market strength and additional supply from our supply chain partners. We also passed another major milestone with our pending acquisition of Xilinx in the quarter as shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction. We remain on track to close the strategic acquisition by the end of the year. 
In closing, we have entered a high-performance computing megacycle with the strongest products and the deepest customer relationships in our history. Our success is built on delivering a consistent cadence of leadership products. We are increasing our R&D investments and aggressively driving our road maps to continue setting the pace of innovation for the industry and deliver best-in-class growth over the coming years. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1109
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3534.0,2259888.0,87630898.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD had excellent execution and very strong financial performance in the first quarter. Our multi-generation product road map is driving significant revenue growth, and we delivered record financial results and free cash flow.  
Driven by this momentum, we delivered first quarter revenue of $3.45 billion, up 93% from a year ago and up 6% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong increases in sales across all businesses. Gross margin was 46%, flat from a year ago despite significantly higher semi-custom product revenue.  
Operating expenses were $830 million compared to $584 million a year ago as we continue to invest in our business. Operating income was $762 million, up $526 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin increased from 13% a year ago to 22%. 
Net income was $642 million, up $420 million from a year ago, excluding $15 million of Xilinx acquisition-related costs. Diluted earnings per share was $0.52 per share compared to $0.18 per share a year ago.  
Current quarter results include a 15% effective tax rate compared to a 3% tax rate a year ago. We continue to anticipate a cash tax rate of approximately 3% for 2021. 
Now turning to business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.1 billion, up 46% year-over-year due to the significantly higher client processor and graphics revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $485 million or 23% of revenue compared to $262 million a year ago.  
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.35 billion, up 286% from $348 million the prior year. The revenue increase was driven by the ramp of semi-custom product sales and very strong growth in EPYC processor revenue, which more than doubled year-over-year. EESC segment operating income was $277 million or 21% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago. The higher operating income was driven by higher revenue. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.1 billion, up from $2.3 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Inventory was $1.7 billion. Free cash flow was $832 million in the first quarter compared to negative free cash flow of $120 million in the first quarter of 2020. Principal debt was $314 million, including a $24 million reduction in our 2026 convertible notes, which have only $2 million remaining. 
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2021. Today's outlook is based on current expectation and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals.  
We expect revenue to be approximately $3.6 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 86% year-over-year and an increase of approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth in all businesses. The sequential increase is expected to be primarily driven by growth in data center and gaming. 
In addition, for Q2 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $900 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $130 million. And the diluted share count in the second quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.  
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue growth of approximately 50% over 2020, driven by growth across all businesses, up from the prior guidance of approximately 37%. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 26% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%, and we expect the company's cash tax rate to be approximately 3%.  
In closing, we had an excellent start in 2021 with very strong year-over-year growth in both segments. We continue to invest in the business and drive strong financial returns.

Could you give us some sense of what has changed in the last 3 months? Because your competitor was recently talking about cloud digestion, and you're raising guidance by $1.3 billion. So I'm curious what changed in the last 3 months? And if you could help us parse which products or end markets are contributing to this increase, how much from servers or PC or semi-customer, or if there is any crypto impact. So any color on what's driving this really strong guidance and increase for the year would be very helpful.",108
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3534.0,2259888.0,87630902.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,7,"Yes, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So we are -- we started the year very strong, very pleased with the first quarter performance and what we see overall for the year. So we are increasing our full year guidance. We exceeded in the first quarter. We guided up in the second quarter, and then that's carrying through to the second half of the year.  
What we've seen is the following. We came into the year with an overall strong demand picture, and that was certainly true. What we've seen over the last 90 days is consistent strong demand, very strong visibility from our customers on what they need throughout the year. Particularly, you asked about data center. I think we saw actually strong signals in the first quarter that it would be a strong data center year for us.  
We're on a product ramp cycle. We launched new products in PCs on the mobile side with our Ryzen 5000. We launched new products on the graphics side with Radeon 6000. And then the launch of the third-generation Milan has actually gone very, very well.  
So in terms of what we see, we see very strong demand for our products. We see good customer ordering patterns and strong backlog. And then we have also seen that the supply chain has been tight overall for the semiconductor industry. And we've been working very closely with our supply chain partners. And so we also have good visibility to additional supply as we go throughout the year. So with all that in place, I would say we feel very good about how the year is shaping up. 
In terms of where you see the strength overall, I would say it's strength across all businesses. But particularly the strength in data center is good. And we also see just, again, very good visibility and very close working relationships with our customers.  
You asked about crypto. We do not -- we have negligible crypto in here. So this is really the foundational business, really the new products and just seeing the customers adopt and ramp quickly.",351

Very helpful. And Lisa, for my follow-up, should we assume that now you are getting adequate supply? So you're kind of caught up from a supply perspective and supply is no longer a constraint. Or is that still a constraint? And if it is, in which end market? Because you're keeping full year gross margins steady at 47%. So I was curious if there is any impact from supply or rising input costs that could be impacting your gross margins, which you decided to keep to kind of flat versus your last outlook?",95

I would say, Vivek, it's still early in the year. So the entire semiconductor supply chain is very, very tight. I think you hear that from all of our peers in the marketplace. That being said, we've been working very closely with our supply chain partners. We have seen improvements that have led to the improved full year guide. 
We're going to continue to work on that because right now, I would say the channel -- the inventories are very low throughout the entire supply chain, whether you talk about at our customers or in the channels. And so there's quite more that we would like to be able to do. That being the case, I think we continue to work well with our partners and take lots of actions there.  
As it relates to overall costs and things like that, we are watching those things, I think, from logistics and some of the component costs and things like that. So there's -- mostly the gross margin guidance is reflective of the fact that we do have ramping of our new products. And we also have some ramp of the gaming products, which are a little bit below corporate average. But we'll see how things progress as we go throughout the year.",213

Maybe just following up on Vivek's question. I was just curious. The semi-custom business obviously is not following any sort of seasonality, but there's a lot of talk about supply constraints there as well. You basically saw no seasonality in March, and it seems like it's not growing much in June. So just maybe just -- is that still impacted by maybe not your shortages or other shortages? And just any perspective on that business for the year.",80
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3534.0,2259888.0,87630907.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,12,"Yes. So thanks, Blayne, for the question. I think the semi-custom business, if you look at the console launches that happened last year, I mean they were phenomenally good launches, right, very, very good products. So you're right, seasonality is completely different this year than sort of a typical year. We had a strong first quarter better than seasonal. We were down but down single digits. There's a bit of growth as we go through the year, but it's just starting from such a high point in the first half of the year.  
So the way I would say it is I think there is a strong secular demand for gaming. And whether you're talking about consoles or you're talking about PC gaming or you're talking about the overall sort of gaming ecosystem, there's a significant demand. And so we believe there's strong demand, and we're continuing to ramp supply to meet that.",153

You clearly gained a couple of points of share in March. Intel was talking about they're being more aggressive on their percent of 10-nanometer product. Just -- maybe just talk about the competitive landscape as you look through the rest of the year. And are you seeing any change to that landscape as they ramp 10-nanometer?,72

So Blayne, I think the PC business has certainly had a very strong second half of last year and is strong this year. I think within that, we feel very good about our progress, particularly in notebooks and particularly in the premium segments of notebooks. So we had a strong record quarter for our notebook business. Our ASPs were up sequentially and year-over-year. I think we're seeing traction in sort of the premium ultrathin, gaming and commercial. 
We feel very good about the platforms that we have and the platforms that we have throughout the year. Ryzen 5000 is a very competitive product. I will say that there are lots -- a bit of low-end units have come into the market, but our focus on the premium segments have done very well. So overall, pleased with the PC environment and feel that we're very competitive.",146

I wanted to ask a little bit about the server CPU cycle. I know you've talked about kind of an expanding footprint with the cloud guys. But I'm curious of where we stand today as far as more of the traditional OEMs, the progression of their systems. I think you've said 100-plus systems. When do you think that those will all be shipping in the market? And how would you put the context of Milan relative to Rome on that front? And I have a follow-up.",90
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3534.0,2259888.0,87630912.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,17,"Sure. So Aaron, the data center business obviously is a very strategic focus for us. And with EPYC with each generation, we've really tried to expand the reach. I think here in the first quarter, what we saw is very strong results, doubling year-over-year. It is on the strength of cloud. But what we saw was both Rome ramping, so we saw Rome units up sequentially, and we also saw Milan ramping. 
And what that says, this is what we expected. We actually expected that we had a good footprint in Rome and that, that would continue to be well deployed as we come into the first half of this year, and that's played out. And then Milan is just a very, very good product. I mean it's extremely well positioned. Not only do we have per socket leadership, but we have per core leadership, which again expands the footprint. 
So in terms of your question about cloud versus enterprise, we were more cloud weighted in the first quarter as some of those instances, both internal and external, ramped. We would expect that enterprise, both enterprise as well as HPC deployments, will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. But we'll see Rome and Milan in the market together all through this year, and we expect strong adoption on the enterprise side.",225

And then the other question kind of dovetailing off that is you talked in response to a couple of different questions. You've talked about visibility. Our visibility is very strong. It's improved, et cetera. So how would you characterize your visibility today relative to, let's say, what it was 3 months ago? And what gives you the confidence? Has there been something that's happened as far as discussions with the cloud guys that's given you more confidence in the visibility of the growth through the remainder of this year?",90

So Aaron, I mean we -- when we started this year, we expected to have a strong product cycle, just given everything that we saw in terms of platforms, design wins, sort of customer engagements and process. But in the last 90 days, I think we've seen that really firm up. So from the standpoint of just the consistency in all of the schedules that were supposed to be met, I think customers are liking what they see. 
We are having multi-quarter conversations, just given the tightness overall in the supply chain. I think everyone is wanting to be clearer and more transparent about their needs. And that's very helpful for us, frankly. That's very helpful for us in a tight environment. It gives us the ability to plan several quarters out. And so I think that's the differences is we have strong visibility into what customers want and what we can deliver. And so that gives us confidence that we have the right signals in place.",168

And I noticed you highlighted in the release and in the slides where you are in several different verticals in design wins on enterprise notebook in the Fortune 500.

It's been a high focus for us to ramp our enterprise notebook business as well as the enterprise server business. And they actually share many of the same customers and IT departments.  And so yes, we've made very good progress on the enterprise notebook business. I think we have a great set of platforms with our OEM partners. We've also ramped up our field application support and our customer engagement models for deployment. Overall, I think we've gotten some very nice commercial notebook design wins.  
And again in this environment, the -- for us, the important thing is to stay very focused on the longevity of the business that we win. And so a lot of focus is on those commercial pipelines and how they develop both on the notebook side as well as on the server side. And I think we've made good progress, but we still have a lot of opportunity to grow as we go through the coming quarters.",165

One of the businesses that maybe you've not had supply or there's been other parts of the business growing much more quickly, I wanted to ask a bit about gaming. The new RDNA 2 architecture, I think, brings some new features, but obviously there's a strong incumbent competitor in the gaming market. 
Maybe you could just talk about where you are competitively right now, how you see supply coming online that might support that gaming franchise a bit better and just maybe the lay of the land and gaming right now. Because it's one piece of the business that everything else is going so well, I think there are some opportunities there.",120

So the consumer graphics or the gaming graphics business, as you talked about, has actually done well for us. It grew double digits this past quarter. We had a very deliberate strategy here with the launch of RDNA 2. We started at the top of the stack with our Big Navi product. And then we've now introduced a couple of additional products. And you'll see that both from the channel, sort of adding board cards into more OEM systems and notebook business as well as additional variants. 
So it's an important market segment for us. We're happy with the progress. I think gamers really appreciate the product. 
It's fair to say that the graphics demand is very high across the marketplace. So we've actually put quite a bit of product into the market, but the demand still exceeds supply. You'll see that increase as we go through the second half of the year. And overall, I think the progress that we've made with RDNA 2 is fantastic, and we continue to believe that gaming overall is a great secular growth story.",182

I realize it's still a relatively small percentage of the overall business. You talked about production ramping in the second half of this year. You talked a little bit about Frontier as well.

Thanks for the question. We're making very nice progress in the data center GPU business. It's in the investment mode now, so we're investing heavily in the business. We launched the CDNA architecture or the compute optimized architecture last year. You'll see updates to that this year as we bring out the next generation with our Frontier systems. The revenue is albeit on the lower side in terms of just size of the business relative to the rest of the business, but we will see growth into the second half of the year. 
And the business here is actually very strategic, right? It's the idea of really putting together heterogeneous systems and bringing our CPU technology with EPYC together with our GPU technology with Instinct with the software capabilities that we have been investing in, and really getting strong HPC systems as well as AI and machine learning capabilities. 
So we will see growth in the second half this year. It will still be a smaller business, but we see it growing in this strategic time frame over the next couple of years. And it is very much that end-to-end story of what you need to really satisfy sort of the key workloads in the data center.",209

And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the potential threat from ARM longer term. Within x86, obviously you've got significant runway from a market share perspective. But how are you thinking about the potential threat from ARM-based processors, both in your client business as well as your server business? 
You've got Apple obviously internalizing some of their CPUs on the client side, hyperscalers talking about internal solutions. And your closest GPU competitor launched -- or introduced rather ARM-based CPU multiple years out. So any thoughts on ARM versus x86 and how you address that would be helpful.",101

I think the key point here is you really have to have a very, very strong product road map, and that is really what we're focused on. I think the overarching trend that computing is becoming very important and so there are additional entrants trying to address different aspects of computing, I think is to be expected. And when you look at the data center, in particular, I think the trend that computing is becoming more workload optimized is also an important trend. These are the things that we've been thinking about for a long time, and we've been looking at ensuring that we address that in our road map. 
So our focus is to continue to optimize solutions across the data center and across the PC ecosystem, make sure that what we have is very competitive, addressing what customers' needs are. And we also have the ability to customize solutions as well with our strong IP portfolio. So all that being the case, I think the answer is very competitive market, but we feel very good about the road map that we have in front of us.",191

Lisa, maybe another way to ask that last question of x86 versus ARM. I'm wondering if you could address it from the perspective of general-purpose compute versus semi-custom and ASIC? Because clearly as Moore's Law is coming up with some issues, the move towards semi-custom and ASIC is much more prevalent. I know to the answer to Toshiya's question, you said that you're doing -- or you have the ability to do semi-custom. Do you actually have engagements? And how do you see sort of general-purpose compute versus semi-custom and ASIC playing out over time?",100

So John, the way I would address that is I think there's a whole range of computing solutions that you need. And this is back to a few years ago, our conversations about heterogeneous compute being you need to have the right compute for the right workload. So I think that's the overarching aspect of it. 
No question that for our business, general purpose compute is the largest piece of our business and will continue to be so. We are doing -- we certainly do optimizations for specific customers today. And I think that's -- that for large cloud customers, they expect that, and we are doing that. 
We do have the ability to optimize on a more specific basis. And if you look at the evolution of our architecture, I think that when we do these chiplet architectures and things like that, it really allows that. So lots of good engagements going on with customers overall, and I think the key is to be able to have the right IP building blocks. And that's what we're focused on, right, having the best CPU cores, the best GPU capability, having great interconnect. And then with the bringing on of Xilinx having the adaptive computing solutions there as well, it gives us a lot of options to optimize solutions with customers.",221

So I guess can you tell me if my math is materially off? And if not, what is -- is this a new higher rate of share gains? And what would you chop this up to? Are you guys at a tipping point? Are your customers at a tipping point for embracing AMD as a supplier? Do they have increased comfort? Or is your ecosystem for support? Can you just maybe just give us a higher-level picture about where you think your customers are and really embracing and ramping up your server offerings at a higher rate. And I have a follow-up, if I may.",163

So in terms of our data center performance in the first quarter, it was quite strong. And when I look at the drivers of that, we saw cloud, in particular, quite strong. And when I look at the drivers underneath that, there are a couple of things that have come together. 
First of all, I mean we've been very, very deeply engaged with our customers the last number of quarters in qualifying new instances, qualifying new internal workloads, really expanding the regional capability of our coverage. And so all of those things, I think, have left -- led to some lift overall in the data center business. 
And then going forward, I think the other piece of it is if you recall when we did the Naples to Rome transition, that transition was pretty much people switched from Naples to Rome. What we're seeing in this cycle is a bit different. What we're seeing is that Rome has a set of very strong coverage in terms of applications that they're in, that are ramping very nicely, that are having good demand. And then on top of that, we're adding Milan, which is just a very strong product on top of that. 
So I think those are some of the things that are perhaps a bit different about what we're seeing right now. That being this case, things move around from quarter to quarter. So I would say that the data center signals that we're seeing are positive. We're excited about what we're seeing. It's a lot of engagements with customers. 
And the main thing for us is as important as the current year is we're also very focused on the long-term road map. And so we're engagement -- we're engaging now on Zen 4 and beyond. So it really is a multigenerational discussion with our top customers.",309

That's very helpful. And then a follow-up on -- just coming back to ARM. You -- they -- you answered the previous questions with kind of talking about embracing the idea of having heterogeneous architectures in semi-custom and working with your customers to develop solutions. 
But if I go back, AMD had an ARM server offering before. Can you give us an update on the state of that ARM server IP? Is that something that you can resurrect? Or have you've been keeping it, the development working on that? And can you discuss -- are your customers asking for your help in delivering semi-custom solutions that have an ARM component to it? 
Because from what I can tell, it looks like 3 cloud service providers have ARM server offerings in their platform, and -- but there's a lot that don't and don't have quite the development capabilities. So I was hoping if you could just talk more specifically about the IP that you had. And are you bringing that back if your customers are asking for it?",178

So look, we know the ARM architecture well. Certainly, our engineers know it well. And we consider ARM a partner in many respects. We use ARM IP in various aspects of our devices.
In terms of that specific custom ARM design, we don't have that in plans right now. In terms of whether we would do custom ARM designs, I think the answer is yes. That's the whole idea of the semi-custom business. And so I think it's less about ARM versus x86 and much more about having the right IP in the right sort of combination to satisfy sort of the customer solutions. 
And that's the way we look at it. It's really -- what problem are you trying to solve? And let's look at sort of the collection of IP that we have and the capabilities that we have to help address that set of sort of issues.",153

Lisa, I wanted to ask you a little bit of a conceptual question. In your full year guidance, you clearly raised the revenues to a very strong number, but you kept the margins the same. I think people understand the operating margin side of it, that you have an opportunity to invest and great opportunities in front of you to grow. 
But on the gross margin side of things, I'm just a little surprised, given the strength that you're talking about in the data center business, the HPC, Frontier, those things kicking in the back half of the year. I'm a little surprised that it didn't go up. Now you've delivered very consistent guidance and increases improvements over time, and I can't recall the last time you missed your gross margin guidance. But I'm just wondering what the puts and takes are that would keep that gross margin guidance flat for the year.",160

So let me perhaps start, and then Devinder may have a few comments. So I think from an overall revenue standpoint, I think we are very comfortable with the guide up, just given the visibility that we have on the customer demand front and on the supply front. 
On the overall margins, we are guiding up sequentially as we go from Q1 to Q2. And then I think for the second half of the year, what we would say is, look, it's early in the year. And it's a very dynamic environment, Ross, I mean a very dynamic environment. And so we're watching the puts and takes, and there's always product mix things that come into play in terms of the puts and takes. 
But I think we're confident that we're in a good place. And as we go through the year, we'll give you more updates on that. But there isn't anything more than that. I think it's just where we are in the year. And given the dynamic environment we have in the marketplace, that's what gives us approximately the 47% guide. I don't know, Devinder, you want to add to that?",197

So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that.",89

For my follow-up, I want to be a little more tactical, but it will somewhat fold into your answer to the first question. And that is for your second quarter guide from the midpoint of up roughly 4%, could you give us a little bit of puts and takes between your 2 main segments? 
And I guess the slightly longer-term question part of that would be data center being high teens in the first quarter was great sequential growth, doubling year-over-year. Any sort of color on how you think that percentage changes throughout the rest of the year, given your 50% growth guidance for the entirety of the year.",113

So in terms of the second quarter, as we look at sequential growth, we do see sequential growth in the data center business, so on the server side as well as on the data center graphics side as well as some growth on the gaming side. 
As we look at the full year, our expectation is that the percentage of the company that is sort of the data center percentage of the company will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. And that's just the dynamic of some of the strength in the consumer businesses in the first half, so that's not normal seasonality. And just the acceleration or some of the growth that we see in the data center business as we go throughout the year would lead to a higher percentage of revenue in data center on higher revenue.",146

So the EESC was up almost $100 million. EPYC was up, and semi-custom was down, which means EPYC was up even more than that. Can you -- I know it was both Rome and Milan grew. But how much of the actual growth, the $100 million-plus sequentially that must have been EPYC, how much of that growth, how did that split out between Rome and Milan? Was it like the majority of the growth of that was Milan? And how do you see Milan as a percentage of a data center CPU mix in Q2?",106
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3534.0,2259888.0,87630943.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,48,"Sure, Stacy. So if I look at the first quarter, we shipped Milan as well in the fourth quarter, right? So we shipped a good amount of Milan in the fourth quarter, a good amount in the first quarter. 
I would say in terms of growth, it was probably more Rome-weighted in the first quarter compared to Milan, but there was good growth in both. And then as we go into the second quarter, we would still expect to see growth in both Rome and Milan, with Milan growing faster as that ramps. And we would expect by the third quarter that it would cross over and Milan would perhaps be higher than Rome. 
Now obviously, these things change a little bit as customers go through their ramps, but that's sort of what we see. So the meta point is Rome demand is robust and will stay a good part of the revenue for this year in its entirety. And then Milan is ramping quickly and customer adoption is strong. And so we expect it will ramp quickly as we go through the next couple of quarters. Hopefully, that answers your question.",192

I have a follow-up, if you don't mind. I actually do want to ask a question about OpEx. So I know the model you gave at the Analyst Day had a midpoint for OpEx revenue of 26.5%. I know you're running ahead of revenue and everything right now. But if I sort of back out the second half implied guidance for OpEx, it actually is at that 26.5% run rate in the second half to get to 26% for the full year. 
Should we think about, I guess, it's like as we go into 2022, do you think you're sort of at the model OpEx run rate, that sort of like more than 26%, 26.5% on whatever the revenue is? Is that the right way to think about the OpEx trajectory going forward? And I guess like -- do you think you're actually spending enough at this point, given where you're taking the road map? Are you spending at the right levels right now to ensure that, that road map is actually cemented and firm?",177

I think we are -- the revenue is well above our long-term model. And certainly in this year, it's well above our long-term model. Last year, it was well above our long-term model. 
And we're taking the opportunity to invest. And from that standpoint, our investments in R&D really, as you say, cementing the road map, our investments across sales and field support and all of the customer-facing support. And frankly, we're making investments in sort of some of the infrastructure surrounding the company as well since it's just a much larger company than it was a few years ago. 
So I think the answer is yes. We're investing enough. And I think we're taking the opportunity to be very aggressive with those investments to -- given the strength of the revenue growth. Maybe, Devinder, you want to add to that or...",147

I think you covered it. We've been very disciplined as you know, Stacy, over the years about managing the OpEx. It does scale with revenue, but OpEx is growing lower than -- a lower rate than revenue. And obviously, that shows up in the financial results from a model standpoint.

You've done a great job this year in both client and in data center.  At the same time as was referenced before, Intel's tone is definitely changing. They use the word leveraging relationships. And they talked about other tactics to sort of stem or arrest some of the share losses and they're now offering x86 cores via foundry and things like that. 
So I guess the question is sort of beyond this year, because the competitive environment this year is pretty much set. So can -- do you think we can extrapolate the success you've had this year into '22 and '23? Or do you think the competitive environment will intensify in the next few years?",125

So there's -- by the way, there are lots of competitors out there. 
From our standpoint, I think over the past few years and the past few generations, I think we've built a track record with customers, and we've built a set of deep relationships. And we've learned a ton about what's important to customers, where to spend the time, the effort, and where we need a close partnership. 
So I feel very good about where we're positioned this year, but I feel very excited about what we have in the road map going forward. And I mean we are not slowing down.

So I think, Joe, I would say overall the demand  if we look at coming into this year, the demand has been sort of higher than our expectations. And there are sort of industry-wide types of things that are going on. 
We work very closely with our supply chain partners. So whether it's wafers or back-end assembly test capacity or substrate capacity, and we work it on a product line by product line level. So I don't know that there is a single thing that I would point out. 
I would say that on a product line level, what we've done and what we'll continue to do is ensure that there are multiple sources for things, particularly in the back end, that gives us flexibility to move things back and forth. We continue -- on the substrate side in particular, I think there has been under-investment in the industry. And so we've taken the opportunity to invest in some substrate capacity dedicated to AMD, and that will be something that we continue to do going forward. We're also -- I mean we also have fantastic engineering teams that are just looking at how we, together in the ecosystem, just get more productivity into the system. And and we work very closely with TSMC to make sure that we're forecasting well and getting the right support. 
So I think it's all of the above in terms of making sure that we have the capabilities. And the other thing I'll mention, Joe, is just it's not just about processors, but it's included -- it's also ensuring that they're matched sets in the ecosystem. And so our teams are also working very closely with our OEMs to make sure that we're together ensuring that they're the full system components necessary. 
So it is a complex supply chain environment. And I will tell you, given everything that I've seen, it is a complex environment because all markets are so hot. But I'm happy that we've been able to make progress. 
And by the way, we're not done, right? There's plenty more that we would like to do to get more capability in the supply environment. And so we're working closely with our partners across the board.",373

Our business performed exceptionally well in the second quarter as strong execution and growing customer preference for our high-performance products generated significant market and financial momentum. 
We saw a very strong demand across all of our businesses, which resulted in second quarter revenue growing 99% year-over-year to $3.85 billion. We expanded our gross margins by 4 percentage points, doubled operating margin and more than tripled profitability year-over-year. We also delivered record revenue for the fourth straight quarter and generated record free cash flow in the quarter.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Second quarter revenue increased 65% year-over-year to $2.25 billion, driven by significant growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. In client computing, we had another record quarter of processor revenue. Both desktop and notebook revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, and we believe we gained revenue share for the fifth straight quarter. 
In desktop, robust demand for our highest-end Ryzen processors drove a richer mix in the quarter as Ryzen 9 processor unit shipments more than doubled year-over-year. In notebooks, unit shipments and ASP increased sequentially and year-over-year. We delivered our seventh straight quarter of record mobile CPU revenue, led by the steep ramp of our latest generation Ryzen 5000 mobile processors.
In the enterprise, Ryzen PRO mobile processor unit shipments nearly doubled year-over-year as we won multiple high-volume deployments in the quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive and pharmaceutical companies.
In graphics, revenue doubled year-over-year, led by demand for Radeon 6000 series desktop graphics cards in the channel and adoption of our data center GPUs. RDNA 2 GPU shipments grew by double-digit percentage sequentially as the first notebooks powered by our Radeon RX 6000M Series GPUs launched, including the first AMD Advantage notebooks that combine high-performance Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs and AMD software with premium design features to deliver best-in-class gaming experiences. ASUS, HP, MSI and Lenovo announced plans to bring AMD Advantage notebooks to market over the coming months as we further expand our presence in the gaming notebook market.
Data center graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year, driven by new deployments of our AMD Instinct accelerators, including initial shipments of our next-generation data center GPUs featuring our CDNA 2 architecture. CDNA 2 represents a major step forward in our multiyear data center GPU strategy, delivering more than twice the performance of our current generation and significantly higher performance than competitive offerings in HPC workloads. We expect data center GPU revenue to grow in the second half of the year as we ramp production of our next-generation AMD Instinct accelerators and open-source ROCm software to support multiple leading-edge supercomputer wins including Frontier, LUMI and Pawsey.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 183% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by strong growth in both semi-custom and EPYC processor sales. Semi-custom revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year, and we expect game console demand to remain strong throughout the year. We announced a new semi-custom win earlier this month as Valve chose AMD to power their Steam Deck handheld game console planned to launch this December.
In embedded, we are making good progress expanding our presence across key verticals, including automotive, networking and storage. We ramped production shipments in the quarter of AMD Ryzen embedded CPUs and Radeon RDNA 2 GPUs to power the in-dash infotainment systems in Tesla's latest Model S and Model X vehicles.
Now turning to server. We delivered our fifth straight quarter of record server processor revenue. Sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage sequentially, driven by higher unit shipments and ASP. We are seeing very strong demand across our full server portfolio with second-gen EPYC processor revenue growing sequentially and third-gen EPYC processor sales more than doubling quarter-over-quarter. Third-gen EPYC processor revenue is ramping faster than the prior generation as customers and multiple third-party reviewers recognize the absolute performance and price performance leadership of our latest server processors.
Cloud demand further accelerated in the quarter, led by growing internal workload adoption and nearly 50 new AMD-powered instances by AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, Tencent and Alibaba. Google announced it chose AMD EPYC processors to exclusively power the first offering in its new Tau VM family that delivers industry-leading performance and value for scale-out workloads versus other competitive x86 and ARM offerings.
In enterprise, we see demand accelerating as more than 100 third-gen EPYC processor platforms are now in production from Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco and others. In addition, we are seeing a rapid expansion in the number of AMD-powered solutions and appliances from our OEM and ecosystem partners targeting hyper-converged and virtual desktop infrastructures as well as workloads demanding the highest per core performance such as EDA and computational fluid dynamics.
We secured multiple HPC wins in the quarter, including newly announced deployments by the National Supercomputing Centre in Singapore and the French Atomic Energy Commission. Our substantial momentum in HPC was highlighted by the fact that the number of AMD-based systems on the latest top 500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers increased by almost 5x in the last year and that EPYC processors power half of the 58 newly listed systems.
Looking at our overall data center business. Revenue nearly doubled year-over-year and increased sequentially from a high-teens percentage of overall revenue in the first quarter to greater than 20% in the second quarter. We expect data center revenue to continue growing faster than overall revenue based on the strength of our EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators and the significantly expanded engagements we have built with the leading OEMs and largest MDCs.
Turning to our Xilinx acquisition. We passed additional milestones in the quarter and received unconditional regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions, including in the EU and the United Kingdom. We remain on track to close this strategic transaction by the end of the year and are excited about the opportunities ahead.
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our execution as our business accelerated considerably in the first half of the year. Based on growing customer preference for our products and strong supply chain execution, we now expect annual revenue to grow by approximately 60% year-over-year, up from approximately 37% growth we guided at the beginning of the year.
Our engineering teams are aggressively driving our product and technology road maps to continue setting the pace of innovation for high-performance computing. We remain on track to launch next-generation products in 2022, including our Zen 4 processors built with industry-leading 5-nanometer process technology and our RDNA 3 GPUs.
We also recently demonstrated the next major advance in our triplet strategy with our differentiated 3D die stacking technology that enables significantly denser and more efficient connections between stacked chips. Based on the strength of our long-term road map and the deep partnerships we have established, we expect to continue growing significantly faster than the market.
In summary, we are making great progress towards our ambitious goal of establishing AMD as a high-performance computing leader and a best-in-class growth franchise.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1196

AMD had another outstanding quarter. Our high-performance computing product momentum is driving record revenue growth, record profitability and significant cash generation.
Second quarter revenue was $3.85 billion, up 99% from a year ago and up 12% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by significant revenue increases across all businesses. Gross margin was 48%, up 360 basis points from a year ago, driven by an improved revenue mix and higher margin contribution from all businesses.
Operating expenses were $909 million compared to $617 million a year ago as we continue to invest in business growth and our long-term product road maps. Operating income was $924 million, up $691 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin doubled to 24%, up from 12% a year ago.
Net income more than tripled to $778 million, up $562 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.63 per share compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. This includes a 15% effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 3% a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.3 billion, up 65% year-over-year, driven primarily by significantly higher client and graphic processor revenue with a richer product mix in both businesses. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $526 million or 23% of revenue compared to $200 million or 15% a year ago.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up 183% from $565 million the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by higher semi-custom product revenue and EPYC processor sales. EESC segment operating income was $398 million or 25% of revenue compared to $33 million or 6% a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.8 billion, up from $3.1 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Free cash flow was a record $888 million compared to $152 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow for the first half of 2021 of $1.7 billion was more than double 2020 annual free cash flow.
With our strong financial results and growing cash generation, we announced a $4 billion stock repurchase program in May, under which we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $256 million in the second quarter. Inventory was $1.8 billion, up from the prior quarter in support of higher revenue expected in the second half of the year.
Let me now turn to the third quarter outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately $4.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 46% year-over-year and approximately 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The sequential increase is expected to be primarily driven by growth in our data center and gaming businesses.
In addition, for Q3 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 48%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $150 million; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue growth of approximately 60% over 2020, up from our prior guidance of approximately 50%, driven by growth across all businesses. We also expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 48%, up from prior guidance of approximately 47%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 25% of revenue, down from previous guidance of approximately 26% of revenue; non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%; and we expect the company's cash tax rate to be approximately 2%.
In closing, we delivered another excellent quarter with very strong year-over-year growth, accelerated our business momentum and delivered exceptional financial returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?",661

Lisa, you didn't really touch on the supply situation in the marketplace today. That appears to be a pretty big focus for companies and also for investors. How would you characterize the current gap between supply and demand? And importantly, as we look ahead to 2022, how comfortable are you from a foundry wafer capacity and ABS substrate capacity perspective as you continue to grow the business strong double digits? And then I've got a quick follow-up.",85

Well, thanks for the question. I think it's fair to say that the semiconductor demand environment and particularly the AMD demand environment has been very strong in 2021. We've been working on supply for the past couple of quarters. I think I'm actually quite pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of increasing our supply. And what I've said previously is, certainly, we do see some level of constraints, but we are making progress each quarter. And we made progress in the second quarter that enabled us to exceed the original guidance. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're continuing to bring on extra supply each quarter, which is leading to the full year guidance raise that we have.
So I think overall, we continue to make progress. I will say that it's tight, like you've heard from many other companies, through the end of this year. I think it improves in 2022. We've been planning for significant growth. Our model is one where we're going to drive significant growth. So we've been planning with that with our supply chain partners. And we do have confidence that we can continue to grow substantially as we go into the second half of this year and into 2022 with the supply chain.",218

And then as a quick follow-up, I guess a multipart question on your server CPU business or data center business more broadly. I was hoping you could speak to sort of the revenue construct in the second quarter and if you can differentiate between second gen and third gen, Rome versus Milan, and then what you're seeing on the cloud side versus enterprise side of your business and the outlook into the second half as you think about sort of the different segments of that business. And then finally, you talked about data center being more than 20% of revenue in Q2, what's embedded in your second half guidance?",110
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,2352127.0,89903582.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,9,"Sure. Okay. Quite a few questions there. So let me try to work through them. So in terms of the makeup of our data center business, I mean our server business was very strong. I think the product capability and sort of just -- sort of the performance and the total cost of ownership for Milan has proven out very well with our customers. So we're very happy with that launch.
In the second quarter, we did see significant growth with Milan. And that being the case, Rome was still a larger portion of the revenue. And I would say in the second quarter, it was more cloud-weighted. So we saw cloud tends to ramp faster on new generation, and that was the case in the second quarter. So cloud grew faster than enterprise.
As we go into the second half of the year, we expect that Milan will ramp very quickly and cross over -- third gen will cross over second-generation in the third quarter. And what we're seeing actually is continued strength across cloud and HPC, which have been traditionally strong for AMD. But we're actually seeing very good momentum in enterprise. And I think with the breadth of the platforms that we have out there and just the coverage and then sort of the per core performance as well as the overall socket level performance, we're getting a very strong traction, and we're pleased to see that. 
So I think as we go into the second half of the year, I think enterprise will be a stronger component for us than it was in the first half of the year, and that's the balance that we want. But overall, we're pleased with that.
And then in terms of your question about server was -- I'm sorry, data center was greater than 20% of our revenue in the second quarter. We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year. And so it will be a larger percentage of our overall revenue in the second half of the year.",354

I wanted to ask about kind of the trajectory of gross margin. If we take the full year guidance now, guiding up 100 basis points with the 3Q guide into consideration, it looks like you're actually pushing towards a 50% gross margin. How do we think -- maybe you can unpack how we should think about the segment gross margin levels. And do you think that if we're hitting 50%, that's a new threshold that we can consider modeling going forward?",87
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,2352127.0,89903585.0,Answer,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,12,"I think on the gross margin, first of all, I'll say we are very pleased with the progress we have made. And as you observed, we have taken up the guidance for the year from 47% to 48%. And in our long-term target model, we have plans to get to greater than 50%. And I think the strength of the businesses that Lisa just talked about, especially in the data center, help us get there. 
The product mix is important. The ramp in the data center and the client PC business as we gain revenue share is going to be important to drive that. And we are confident that we can continue to improve the gross margin given the mix of the business and also the revenue ramp in the businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin. So I feel very good about getting to the greater than 50% over time.",153

I think the most important thing to think about as you think about our business going forward is it really is about the mix of business. So as data center becomes a higher percentage of our business, that's a favorable mix for us. And then within the segments as well, as we look at where we're strategically focusing as we really mix to the higher end of the portfolio, those are the key things that we're looking at from a margin standpoint. But there are always puts and takes in the business. It's just really about the mix.",107

And then just as a real quick follow-up. As Milan ramps, and appreciating that Rome sounds like still the majority of the EPYC lineup, how successful have you been as far as leveraging a stronger position with regard to uplift on blended ASPs as we think about the continuation of Milan and even starting to think about Genoa going forward?",61
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,2352127.0,89903588.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,15,"Yes. So as we think about sort of the trajectory of the business, it is about offering more performance per socket, and that is what we're doing. So I think Milan is certainly a performance uplift relative to Rome. It does lend itself to a higher ASP or a higher mix of the business. 
And then clearly, as we go to Genoa, we're going to continue that trajectory. So I think -- and then within server, there's also a mix between cloud and enterprise. As I said earlier, we're quite cloud weighted here in the first half of the year. And as we go to a stronger percentage of enterprise, that would also be a favorable mix in the service side of the business.",124

Vivek, thanks for the question. Well, as you know very well, we're very focused on sort of multiquarter, multiyear progress in the server and the data center business. I think we're excited with the momentum around our server business. I think the product road map is very strong. I think the execution has been very strong. 
I think customers also, with the third generation in Milan, felt much more comfortable to go more broadly with Milan just because this was sort of the third time, right? They had -- many of our customers were on Rome already. But with Milan, it was sort of socket compatible, and so there was -- it was a faster time to ramp, and we're seeing it ramp faster. So we feel good about where we're positioned. 
I mean it's a very competitive market out there, Vivek. I'll always say that. We expect our competition to be really good, and we need to be better than that. And so our team is very focused on execution, and we're excited about Genoa. I think our customers are excited about Genoa.

Maybe I'll start and then see if Devinder has anything to add. I think we've always been very thoughtful about how we both invest in the business as well as delivering operating leverage. And look, I think our revenue growth has been very strong. It was certainly above what we had previously forecasted. We are taking the opportunity to invest in the business, and that's investing in R&D and investing in sales and marketing and really the overall capabilities there. But you do see the operating leverage in the business. And I think we intend to continue to deliver improved operating margins as we go forward. 
So I think we can do it -- do all of those things. I think we can continue to grow revenue significantly above the industry. We will continue to invest in OpEx at a lower rate than the revenue growth. And we will continue to deliver operating margin improvement over time.",159

And Lisa, your competitor gave some fairly bullish commentary about the state of the PC industry going forward. And I wonder if you might share your view. And we've heard in our work a few bobbles in the Chromebook market and maybe a couple of PC OEMs saying they're building a tiny bit of CPU inventory. So on the back of that commentary about the market, if you have any views on your own visibility in inventory of AMD parts or maybe the gap between orders and your ability to fulfill them in the PC market, those things would be really helpful.",131

Sure, Matt. So look, there are lots of different signals in the PC market. So maybe I will make a few comments. I think it's fair to say that the end-user demand has been very strong. So very strong in the first half of the year, very strong in the second half of last year. And that's from all this work from home, school from home, sort of, and then some of this return-to-office trends. Within that, there is a little bit of a mix shift as you go through time. 
When I look at the market, I would say that we've performed very well. Within this market backdrop, we continue to gain revenue share. And what that means is we're focusing on the most strategic segments of the PC market. As we go forward, I do agree that end-user demand is strong. I also believe that if you look at the second half of this year for the PC market, you'll hear about sort of pockets of component shortages or match sets and things like that. So we're taking that into account as we think about the second half of the year. 
From our perspective, we're planning the PC -- our PC business to be about flattish first half into second half. And again, we think that that's very well supported by all of the ordering patterns and all of our sort of look at what the PC OEMs are doing. From an inventory standpoint, we do not believe there is significant inventory. We do track it very closely, of AMD product anyways. We look at it at the retailers as well as at -- with our OEMs. 
So I think we have this very -- we're watching it very closely and recognize that the PC market may go up or down. We're expecting it to be -- like I said, for our business roughly flattish first half into second half. And that being the case, we continue to believe that there is strong end user demand and there's just some supply matching that needs to happen in the marketplace.",352

First is just a clarification. I think you said in your prepared comments relative to the June quarter that EPYC grew solidly double digits sequentially. The overall segment grew about 19%. I'm just curious, did EPYC outgrow the overall segment? Or was it more in line? Can you give us a sense of how it did relative to the segment?",65

And then my second question is just more of a strategic question around pricing. Clearly, last week, on their conference call, Intel talked about perhaps being a little bit more price aggressive, especially in data center, to protect share. And I'd like to get kind of your thought on pricing. I mean in my mind, that market is much more about a total cost of ownership than an entry point. And given your price performance, I'm just kind of curious as to how concerned you are about the pricing environment and how concerned you think we should be over time.",101

Thanks for that, John. Look, I think the market has always been competitive. I don't see that it has become more competitive or that's changed. As you said, pricing is not the first order variable when you're buying a server CPU. It really is about total cost of ownership. I think the performance leadership that we have is clearly there, and I think customers see that. So we'll always fight for every socket. I mean you know that we're very competitive in that fashion. But we think that the way to do that is with the strength of the road map and the strength of the deep partnerships. And price is sort of a second order lever in this market.",121

Now with Milan on a strong ramp trajectory and also good to see the momentum in enterprise, as you guys continue to drive EPYC into new markets, just wanted to get an update on the pull in the telco service provider market, right? It's a relatively big market, right? It's about a $6 billion, $7 billion market. Milan supports much more networking functionality versus prior generations. And operators continue to virtualize the core of their networks. And with 5G, they're also starting to virtualize their radio access networks. And so just wanted to see if the team is seeing early momentum with Milan with telco equipment OEMs as well as with some of the large 5G service providers.",124

Harlan, thanks for the question. Yes. Look, we believe the telco segment is a very good segment for us. And I would say that there is a lot of interest. I wouldn't say it's a significant piece of revenue today. So I view that as sort of opportunity as we continue to build out the solutions for Milan. But it is one of the areas that we believe is very strategic for AMD. 
And as Xilinx comes into -- so as we combine the Xilinx business with ours, I think their relationships as well in the communications and telco market will be helpful in just bringing the overall solution set together. So yes, we think it's a good market for us, but I would say we're still very early on that particular cycle.",135

And then on the strong early momentum in enterprise as you move into the second half and as you probably have some visibility into next year because the enterprise call cycles are probably a bit longer than some of your cloud customers, can you just talk about the breadth of the engagements in enterprise across large corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses?",63
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,2352127.0,89903609.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,36,"Yes, Harlan. So we have seen a very strong pipeline. And that started with Rome, but we see that expanding with Milan. I think if you look at the breadth of platform offerings from all the largest OEMs for Milan, it's just broader than our past generation. And I think people are also starting to come up with more appliances, and we've done quite a bit more ISV optimization as well. So our visibility is very good into the second half of the year, and it's also very good into 2022. 
I think the good piece about this, as you said, it is longer design cycles. But with large companies and certainly with some of the Tier 2 cloud guys, we've seen good strong visibility for multiple quarters. And then as we think about sort of the small, medium business and more of the channel business, I think all of that is a strong opportunity for us.",157

So the console business, we're quite early in the console cycle, and I think you've seen that there's very strong demand for those products. And so I think the seasonality is not typical. So typically, we see the second half stronger than the first half, and that is sort of more muted this year. So there is some growth into the second half of the year, but it's not nearly what it is in a typical console seasonality.",80

And maybe that's a function of some of the opportunities -- the other opportunities that you have. I'm just curious, given your other outlook for kind of continued strong growth, do you think that strong growth is dependent at all on the state of the PC market next year? So for example, like if PCs, say, were down 10% next year, do you still think you could still grow strongly year-over-year in 2022 off the rest of the portfolio?",106

So look, I think -- I mean there are lots of different signals in the PC market for 2022. So I think what we're doing is taking, let's call it -- we're planning for various different scenarios. But I would say that from our point of view, the overall answer to your question is yes. I mean we believe that there is a -- we have strong growth momentum across the portfolio. And we believe that we will -- we can grow in the PC business as well even if the market is, let's call it, not as robust as some might forecast. 
Our view is that we're still underrepresented across the board in the markets that we play in, whether you're talking about data center or PCs or gaming. And on the PC side, in particular, we're making very good progress in sort of commercial, premium gaming notebooks, premium consumer. We have more platforms coming with our Ryzen 5000 and our next generation. So I think our sort of outlook is less dependent on what exactly happens in the market. But obviously, we watch the market very closely, and we work with our OEM partners very closely to stay in tune with what they're seeing.",209

That's helpful. For my follow-up, I want to ask the OpEx question a little more explicitly. So you didn't take it down for the year and you're 25%. But if I'm doing my math right, the Q4 OpEx percentage is closer to 28%. And I get why and I understand. But I think the Analyst Day model you've given, 16 months ago, had sort of an OpEx to revenue midpoint somewhere in the mid-26s. Should we think about OpEx, I guess, trending down from that exit rate to that more kind of like model level? Or are you still going to be taking this opportunity, at least for the next like several quarters, maybe to invest at a bit of a higher level? Is that exit rate of OpEx to revenue more representative of what we might see in the near to medium term?",146
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,2352127.0,89903617.0,Answer,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,44,"Yes. I think, Stacy, first of all, you hit it right. The priority for this is to invest in the business for growth. We are growing significantly and just took up the guidance. So obviously, there's a lot of areas to invest in to support that growth, whether it's R&D or go-to-market or even hiring. Second half of the year, you also have salary increases that kick in for our employees. And obviously, that does drive the OpEx higher just given the guide we gave for Q3, which is higher than Q2 from an overall OpEx standpoint. 
As far as the numbers are concerned, I know you're probably running your model there, but those numbers are approximate. And really, if you ask me from an overall standpoint, I would expect that for the year, we come in a little under 25%. We gave the approximate guidance of 25%, but I think we'll come in under 25% for the year. 
Nothing extraordinary there. It's just making sure we plan the business, support the growth and make sure that into 2022, as we have new product introductions that Lisa just talked about, we continue to support that because there are a lot of new products coming into 2022. So really, that's what it is, Stacy.",213

I think you said it doubled. Just curious, is there a way to parse out how much is coming from crypto? And then I think what I heard you say is in the back half, it's a driver for September. Just driving into December with PC flat again kind of just maybe you could describe how much of the strength in graphics is kind of more client graphics versus the data center?",81
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,2352127.0,89903621.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,48,"Yes, sure, Blayne. So to your question about the quarter, the second quarter, we do not believe there was a significant crypto component in our graphics revenue. I mean the graphics revenue, as we see it, is really RDNA 2 ramping. We launched some new products in mobile. And we're pleased with the reception of RDNA 2 in mobile as well as we started shipments of some of our data center GPUs. So our view is that the crypto-based component is really negligible. 
And then as we go into the second half of the year, I wouldn't say graphics is the largest driver of our business. The driver really is around data center, and that's data center across CPUs as well as some of the early ramp of the GPUs. But we do expect there continues to be strong demand for gaming graphics. And we know there are a lot of gamers out there who are still looking to get some of their cards, and so we will support that demand. But I don't think crypto was a big piece of it, and we'll continue to focus our efforts on getting our gaming graphics over into the gamers' hands.",199

So I mean we'll see some growth in the second half of the year off of a small base. I think it becomes a more meaningful driver as we go into next year and then certainly the following year. So think about the data center GPU story as sort of the early innings of what we did on the CPU side. We're excited about the product, Blayne. I think it's a very exciting product with our next-generation CDNA 2. I think we have won some early wins with HPC. We're continuing to work with some cloud customers, the machine learning and AI aspects of it. But it's really a multiyear journey, and the larger driver of our data center business is the server CPU side.",126

I thought it was fascinating because it looks like they're disabling one of the threads and running Milan in a single-threaded mode, which seems to me like a throwback to 20 years ago. So I had a couple of questions on this. I haven't seen Intel Xeon processors in this mode. 
Is there something about the AMD architecture or the Milan architecture beyond higher core count that just makes it more sense to use AMD processors in this mode versus Intel processors? Are you seeing a lot of demand outside of Google for this kind of single-threaded implementation? And if you are, would it make sense to make like a separate line of CPUs that streamlines the logic for only one processing thread and then you could fit -- potentially fit a lot more cores on the CPU and cut the power dissipation? It seems like it would be the next logical step. Would that even be feasible? Is that something you consider you're getting demand for?",181

So Mark, the way I would say it is this, and again, I want to be a little bit sort of broad in how I answer the question. I think what you see in the server land is that there are lots of different use cases for the processors. And you have some that are looking for sort of the bleeding-edge performance. And there, the multi-threading is very, very useful. And you get better performance per watt, performance per dollar and just overall socket-level performance. 
I think what we've seen is that as you look across use cases, there are some use cases where you're more focused on performance per dollar than overall performance. And you might choose to optimize sort of what you do, sort of how you configure the processor differently. I think what you'll see from us, Mark, is we're spending a lot of time with our hyperscale partners. And what we want to do is offer them the type of incidence that they need and that their customers need. 
So you'll see us do more customization across the board with the idea of we want to satisfy that range of performance that -- across sort of the entire range of use cases. So I think we'll talk more about how we think about the road map as we go forward. But I will say that we're being very thoughtful in ensuring that we have the right product for the right workload and that it's optimized for performance and power and cost in all those areas.",260

Our business performed extremely well in the third quarter as our leadership product portfolio and strong execution drove record quarterly revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We delivered our fifth straight quarter of greater than 50% year-over-year revenue growth, with each of our businesses growing significantly year-over-year and data center sales more than doubling. Third quarter revenue grew 54% to $4.3 billion. Gross margin expanded by more than 4 percentage points and operating income doubled year-over-year. 
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Third quarter revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $2.4 billion, driven by our latest generation Ryzen, Radeon and AMD Instinct processors. In client computing, sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and declined slightly sequentially. Ryzen 5000 processor shipments increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially, resulting in a richer product mix as we believe we gained revenue share for the sixth straight quarter. 
In desktops, we launched our Ryzen 5000 processors with integrated Radeon graphics for the channel to strong demand as third-party reviews highlighted the leadership computing and graphics capabilities and energy efficiency of these processors. In notebooks, Acer, Asus, HP and Lenovo, all expanded their mobile offerings powered by Ryzen 5000 mobile processors as we continue gaining momentum in the premium consumer, gaming and commercial markets. 
Commercial client growth year-over-year was based on new deployments across public sector and Fortune 1000 technology, energy and automotive customers as the number of AMD-based commercial notebook designs available from the largest OEMs increased significantly year-over-year. We're also seeing strong growth in the workstation market. According to IDC, Threadripper PRO processors now powered the best-selling workstations in their category in both North America and EMEA as we continue winning high-volume deployments across key verticals including media and entertainment, engineering, architecture and automotive. 
In Graphics, revenue more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially, driven by shipments of our next-generation AMD CDNA 2 data center GPUs and demand for Radeon 6000 GPUs in the channel. AMD RDNA 2 GPU sales grew significantly in the quarter as we ramped production and expanded our top to bottom portfolio with the launch of the midrange Radeon RX 6600 XT cards that deliver leadership 1080p gaming performance at their price point. Data center graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, led by shipments of our new AMD CDNA 2 GPUs for the Frontier exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
Frontier was architected specifically to deliver breakthrough HPC and AI compute performance and provide a blueprint for how supercomputing, enterprise and cloud customers can enable exascale-level performance over the coming years by combining AMD CPUs, GPUs and software. We are very pleased with the performance of our AMD CDNA 2 GPUs and look forward to providing more details on their leadership performance next month. 
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, driven by strong growth in EPYC processor and semi-custom sales. Semi-custom revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year as demand for the latest Microsoft and Sony consoles remains very strong. We expect semi-custom revenue to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter as we further ramp supply to address the ongoing game console demand. 
Turning to server. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of record server processor revenue as sales more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a significant double-digit percentage sequentially. Third-gen EPYC processors continue ramping faster than the prior generation and contributed the majority of our server CPU revenue in the quarter. 
In cloud, multiple hyperscalers expanded their third-gen epic processor deployments to power their internal workloads. And both Microsoft Azure and Google announced multiple new AMD-powered instances. Cloudflare, Vimeo and Netflix also all recently announced new deployments powered by EPYC processors, with Netflix highlighting how they doubled their streaming throughput per server while also reducing their TCO. 
Enterprise growth was particularly strong in the quarter as the more than 100 third-gen EPYC processor platforms from Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco and others ramp into broader end customer deployments. We expanded our wins in the quarter with Fortune 1000 financial services, automotive and aerospace companies and see significant ongoing growth opportunities as our enterprise server pipeline has more than doubled year-over-year. 
In supercomputing, we won multiple installations in the quarter, highlighted by Argonne National Laboratory selecting third-gen EPYC processors to power the new Polaris supercomputer that will be used to test and optimize software in preparation for future exascale class systems. Overall, we are very pleased with the momentum we have built in our data center business as server CPU and GPU revenue grew to a mid-20s percent of overall revenue in the quarter. 
Turning to our Xilinx acquisition. We are making good progress towards securing the required regulatory approvals and remain on track to close by the end of the year. The Xilinx acquisition provides significant benefits to AMD, including expanding our product portfolio with leadership adaptive computing and AI solutions and further diversifying our customer base into complementary markets, including wired and wireless communications, industrial and automotive. 
In closing, our record third quarter results and the significant acceleration of our business in 2021 demonstrate that we have the right products and strategies to drive best-in-class growth and significant shareholder returns. We continue growing faster than the market, driven by our consistent execution and the investments we have made to build leadership products. Our supply chain team has executed extremely well in a challenging environment, delivering incremental supply throughout the year, supporting our strong revenue growth. We are also investing significantly to secure additional capacity to support our long-term growth. Our product portfolio and road maps have never been stronger, and I look forward to sharing more details about our next-generation server CPUs and GPUs at our Accelerated Data Center Premiere on November 8. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1001
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3093.0,2413301.0,91769698.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD had another excellent quarter. Our leadership products and growing data center momentum are driving record revenue, record profitability and significant cash flow generation. Third quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 54% from a year ago, driven by strong revenue increases across all businesses and up 12% from the prior quarter.
Gross margin was 48%, up 440 basis points from a year ago, driven by strong revenue mix and competitive products. Operating expenses were $1.04 billion compared to $706 million a year ago as we continue to invest in our long-term product road maps and scaling our business.
Operating income more than doubled to $1.06 billion, up $530 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin was 24%, up from 19% a year ago. Net income grew to $893 million, up $392 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 compared to $0.41 per share a year ago. This includes a 15% effective tax rate compared to 3% a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.4 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by significantly higher client and graphics processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $513 million or 21% of revenue compared to $384 million or 23% a year ago. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating margin was slightly lower year-over-year, primarily due to investments in R&D and go-to-market.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.9 billion, up 69% from $1.1 billion the prior year. The strong revenue increase was primarily driven by significantly higher EPYC processor and semi-custom sales. EESC operating income was up significantly at $542 million or 28% of revenue compared to $141 million or 12% a year ago. Operating income growth was primarily driven by higher revenue and richer product mix, partially offset by higher R&D and go-to-market expenses.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion. We utilized $750 million to repurchase more than 7 million shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2021 as part of our ongoing stock repurchase program. Free cash flow was $764 million compared to $265 million in the same quarter last year and $888 million in the prior quarter.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, free cash flow was lower as we made strategic investments in long-term supply chain capacity to support future revenue growth. Inventory was $1.9 billion, up $137 million from the prior quarter in support of continued revenue growth.
Let me now turn to the fourth quarter outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately $4.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 39% year-over-year and approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be driven by higher server and semi-custom sales.
In addition, for Q4 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 49.5%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.15 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $170 million; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.22 billion shares. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue to increase approximately 65% over 2020, driven by growth across all businesses, up from the prior guidance of 60%. In addition, we continue to expect gross margin to be approximately 48% for the full year.
In closing, we delivered another outstanding quarter with very strong year-over-year revenue growth, significant financial momentum and record profitability. Our leadership products position us well to drive future growth, significant cash generation and strong shareholder returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?",651

Just kind of curious, the overall outlook for Q4. So computing graphics being down. I was just curious if that was more the supply. You're still growing sequentially. And obviously, I would assume you prioritize servers. Just kind of curious what you're seeing in the computing graphics market. And is it anything related to supply constraints for you that would be down sequentially or maybe downstream constraints. 
And then maybe for Devinder. Just curious, you're still growing gross margin. I'm assuming embedded, semi-custom and service kind of offsetting. So just kind of walk us through the nice increase in gross margin for Q4.",105

Sure, Blayne. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the fourth quarter and where we are. Look, we're overall very pleased with our performance in terms of the second half of the year. It's playing out about what we expect it to be in the PC market. So as you're asking about computing and graphics. We had seen that the PC market and user demand is strong overall, but there are some matched set constraints in the PC market. And so for that reason, we've called the PC market really flattish. I would not have said down. I would have called it flattish as we look into the fourth quarter.
However, as we look overall at the business, I think the data center business has performed very well, and we see strong demand there, and we're continuing to see that. And as well, the console business, overall gaming is also quite strong. And so we see growth in servers and semi-custom as we go into the fourth quarter.
And then on the margin dynamics, Devinder, do you want to cover that?",184

So Q4, it is up slightly based from our guidance, 1 point from Q3, and that's really product mix, higher margin from server, offset by semi-custom revenue also been higher going from Q3 to Q4. So we're very pleased with the progress on the gross margin. As you look at the Q3 results, up 440 basis points from last year, up 80 basis points from last quarter and the progression into Q4, obviously driven by the server, our revenue growing. I'm very pleased with that also.",87

Lisa, how are you feeling about the spending environment in the data center as you look over the next several quarters?

So I was just wondering how you're thinking about the competitive landscape and the spending landscape over the next year.",73

So thanks, Vivek, for the question. I think overall, we're feeling very, very good about the server business or the data center market. I think from a market standpoint, we've seen a strong market year in 2021 in both cloud and enterprise and we see that continuing into 2022. I think from a competitive position standpoint, I think Milan is extremely well positioned. So we were very pleased with sort of the adoption rate of Milan. We said that we expected it to grow faster than Rome, and it has. And so the crossover with Milan and Rome in the third quarter is an important metric for that.
Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see a strong environment. And then as the competitive environment goes into 2022, we always expect the competition to be strong, but our focus has been consistent execution of our road map, and we feel very good about Zen 4 and Genoa in 2022. I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning there. And we continue to believe that data center is the most strategic part of our business, and we're making good progress with our customers and partners.",198

And for my follow-up, Lisa, AMD has done very well in terms of gaining share at the hyperscalers. Where are you in that journey? Is there still a lot of share gains to be had at hyperscalers? And importantly, can you repeat that in the enterprise? Or do you think your competitors' incumbency limits the share gain opportunity in the enterprise?",63

So Vivek, what I would say there is, our business has been more cloud weighted with the hyperscalers than enterprise, that continued here in the third quarter. I do believe that there is significant additional opportunity for us in the cloud. So as we work with these partners, it is about sort of expansion of workloads. Really, there's more tailoring of workloads as well as we go forward. And then there's also just more customers and broader penetration in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 cloud guys. So I think that's a good market for us.
On the enterprise side, I would say, we saw a very strong enterprise quarter here in the third quarter. I think the strength of Milan with our OEMs in terms of the breadth of the platforms, is very good, and we're seeing a good traction with sort of Fortune 1000 companies.
So I would say, overall, I think we see a growth trajectory for both our cloud and enterprise business. I think in the enterprise, the key thing has been to get more familiarity with EPYC, and we've made very good progress there. And so I feel very good about where that's going.",200

I did want to ask a question specifically on your server business in China. Your competitor called out China and some of the turmoil that's gone over there as a reason why some of their cloud business had some headwinds in the third quarter. And maybe you could comment on how you see spending over the last quarter and then in the next couple of quarters, specifically in that end market in China. And then I have a follow-up.",100

So again, what I would say is our data center business performed very well in the third quarter, that was across both cloud and enterprise.  And in cloud, that was across geographies. So we haven't seen anything particular as it relates to China or there. What I would say is we continue to work with the breadth of customers. And we're in the process of really rolling out sort of broader adoption across the customer set. So I think we saw a pretty normal environment for demand.",89

You guys mentioned in the comments, still plans to get the Xilinx deal closed by the end of the year. And I think that's important as then there's a lot of things that you can talk about more, maybe more openly about the heterogeneous compute strategy for the business over the long term. Lisa, maybe you could walk us through to the extent that you can talk about it, obviously, there are some things that you can't talk about. 
But to the extent you can, what milestones you've achieved behind the scenes that make you feel confident and what hurdles are still there to have the confidence? I mean I guess we've got weeks till we get into the month of December and things kind of slow down a little bit regulatory-wise. So I just wonder what gives the confidence that we can get there and what we should expect?",157

So look, we've been working diligently on the closure of the Xilinx acquisition. I would say we're through the vast majority of what we need to do in the regulatory front. We're finishing up here. And there's very good progress on the integration side. So we've done a lot on the integration. I think we're excited with the plans that we have.

Lisa, I had 2 questions as well. First, on your outlook for 2022. I realize it's early, and I certainly don't expect you guys to provide a point estimate. But I think people are kind of concerned that you've been sort of overgrowing, if you will, relative to your long-term growth rate. You grew 45% last year. You're on track to grow 65% this year, given your long-term through-cycle growth target of 20%. Again, there is concern that you could decelerate going into next year, given PC dynamics and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth.
So again, I don't expect you to give any quantification of next year, but if you could describe the year qualitatively, what are the potential pluses and minuses at this point, that would be super helpful? And then I've got a quick follow-up.",145
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3093.0,2413301.0,91769718.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,23,"Sure. So look, as you said, it's a little bit early to talk about quantitatively. I'll cite qualitatively, what we see is, look, we see a positive demand environment. And that's a market statement, but that's also an AMD statement, right? I think the strength of our product portfolio has multiple growth vectors. Data center continues to be a very important one for us. I think we're -- we continue to make progress in the graphics market, and we think graphics is a good growth vector. Our console business, we would expect would be -- I mentioned earlier that it'd be up in the fourth quarter, and we would expect it to be up in 2022, just given the strength of the demand environment there.
And so on the PC side, the comments I'll make on the PC side are -- the end user demand appears to be strong. So there's a good amount of refresh going on, whether you're talking about consumer and your high-end consumer or commercial or gaming. There are some supply constraints around matched sets that we believe will continue into the first half of the year. That being the case, what we're using from a planning assumption standpoint, is that the PC market may be flattish as we go from 2021 into 2022. But even within that environment, we think there are opportunities for us to continue to grow.
So overall, I think we're very focused on execution, very focused on working with our customers to make sure that we're aligned with what they need and overall feel very good about our product portfolio going into 2022.",272

That's super helpful. And then as my quick follow-up, a similar question on gross margins. I'm not sure if this is for Lisa or Devinder. You're guiding Q4 to 49.5%, which is obviously significant progress from a year ago. Given some of the dynamics you've talked about whether it be the growth potential in server CPU, the mix within server CPU, and I'm sure the mix dynamics on the client side, I think most of us do expect a pretty nice positive trajectory into 2022, potentially with a five handle in terms of, again, gross margins.
But any risks or any headwinds that we should be aware of? I think your foundry partner is raising pricing. There is cost inflation generally across the board, but any risk items that we should think about at this point?",138

As Lisa said, with the growth factors that we have, we expect to continue making progress from where we are currently and especially predicated on the competitive leadership products we have.

So Stacy, on the data center GPU side, the third quarter was a larger quarter for the data center GPU. This is where we shipped the Frontier shipments that are now in the build cycle. It is still a relatively small business compared to the CPU side. So our expectation is that going into the fourth quarter, it's a lumpy business for us. So Q3 was a strong quarter given the shipments of -- for Frontier. We would expect, as we go into the fourth quarter, that it will be down sequentially quarter-on-quarter. But still, it's a strong growth year overall for a business that we think is a significant strategic growth driver for us over the next few years.",121

All right. Let me start and then let -- I want to make sure I answer your question. How's that? So look, on the revenue side, when we look at the sequential growth, we have been able -- look, the supply chain, this is about really supply chain optimization.
And we have been able to secure some additional supply, given some of the work that we've been doing. And we see strong demand across the board. But sequentially, what we're guiding to is stronger server demand as well as gaming, and gaming includes the semi-custom game consoles, as well as our graphics business is doing quite well as well.
And then in terms of the sequential margin, it's similar. I mean we're having servers, some improved mix and graphics driving upside. And that's partially offset by the consoles which are below corporate average. But net-net, I think it's a positive sequential both on revenue and margin.",157

It seems like that's the business that's probably struggled the most to get silicon and you've shown some pretty nice growth there. What's the prognosis for that business going forward?

Sure, Joe. Look, the graphics business did have a strong third quarter. I think that's true for graphics gaming as well as data center GPU. I think the portfolio that we have there with RDNA 2 has turned out really well. So we're pleased with how it's positioned competitively in the marketplace. And overall, gaming has been a secular trend that has continued with very strong demand.
In terms of crypto, our view is that it's really negligible revenue for us in the third quarter. It's not a segment that we have been servicing. We've tried very much to try to keep our gaming graphics focused on gamers. And we were able to increase some of the supply for graphics, and that's one of the reasons that we saw the sequential growth that we saw. And going into the fourth quarter next year, again, I think we see gaming overall as a strong segment for us, and the product set is very good. So we feel good about it.",170

Just kind of sticking on the expectations in the next year, appreciating that you're not going to give a full guide. I'm just curious how we should think about the semi-custom business given how sizable that's been to the overall growth in 2021. Any framing of how you expect 2022 to shape up at this point?",66
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3093.0,2413301.0,91769737.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,42,"Sure, Aaron. So again, if you look at the overall growth that we had in 2021, I would say it was actually quite balanced across all of our businesses. The semi-custom business was in the second year of ramp, and demand has exceeded supply. We've been able to ramp that as we've gone through the year. 
As we look into 2022, the historical view of game consoles has been year 4 is the peak, at least that's what it was in the last generation. What we expect in this generation is, again, very strong demand going into 2022. So we would expect it to grow into 2022, which would be the third year of the cycle, and then we'll see what happens after that. But overall, I think our view is we have a very balanced business with multiple growth drivers across data center, PCs, graphics as well as consoles.",150

And then the follow-up question is on your own supply chain side. I know in the prepared comments you said working on securing adequate supply given your growth trajectory. Are you currently able to meet on the goal of the demand that you currently see? And can you give any color of what -- how we should think about the supply situation on your end?,69
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3093.0,2413301.0,91769739.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,44,"Yes. So I mean we've been working on ramping the supply chain really for more than a year. If you think about sort of dynamics here. What I'd like to say is, overall, the demand has been very, very high. So the fact that we can grow revenue this year 65% year-on-year, I think, is a testament to the supply chain work. I think if we had more supply, we could certainly ship more. 
That being the case, I think we're prioritizing in the most strategic segments. And we have invested significantly in capacity for additional capabilities, and we'll see some of that come online as we go through 2022. And we're going to continue to be aggressive to secure additional capacity because we believe our product portfolio will enable that growth.",132

Lisa, my first question is back on the supply side of things. I'm just wondering if you can help me better understand, was it more of an issue in your PC business or your server business? And I guess, especially as we look into next year, as supply begins to loosen up, this year, given how tight the overall ecosystem was, competing on price didn't make a lot of sense. 
As supply begins to accelerate across the ecosystem, how are you thinking about pricing, especially in lieu of your large competitor kind of resetting their gross margins for next year? In your view, does that give them more wiggle room? Or do you think that they're being pretty benign on the pricing side of things on that gross margin reset?",132
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3093.0,2413301.0,91769742.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,47,"Yes. So maybe let me -- there's a lot of various aspects to that, John. So let me try to take it in pieces. As it relates to current supply, I want to make sure that we're clear. I mean we have brought on a tremendous amount of additional supply, and that's part of the reason that we overachieved the Q3 results and then we guided higher in Q4. So I do think that we have done a lot of work on our supply chain.
In the PC market, in particular, I think the market is not necessarily constrained on CPUs, but more constrained on matched sets. And so we're trying to ensure that we're not building inventory in the channel. And that's part of the optimization that we do is to ensure that as we ship sell-in processors that we see matched sets to sell through. And so from that standpoint, we think inventory is very healthy at the OEMs, and that's an important factor as we go into 2022.
As it relates to what happens with the pricing environment as supply eases up. I think, right now, what we see is a -- again, it's an environment where most people are prioritizing supply. As we go into 2022, though, I think this is all about the product. And what we view is -- our focus in sort of our product line has been moving up the stack, ensuring that we're providing significant value to our customers in terms of total cost of ownership on the server side and innovative features and capabilities on the PC side and the graphics side. And we're going to continue to do that.
I mean we're excited about our product portfolio into 2022. We're going to continue to be very aggressive on the overall road map. And with that, I think our game plan is exactly what it was, what it always has been, which is lean into the product cycle, and the deep customer relationships and continue to build that out over time.",341

And then as my follow-up, Devinder, you did a good job kind of explaining the year-over-year changes in operating margins in the compute and graphics business. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about sequentially what happened. Revenue was up and op margins were down a little bit. Is that just the influence of the very strong growth in GPUs going into the data center? Because it sounds like in the core compute business mix probably got better sequentially for you. So I'm just trying to make sure I understand all the dynamics you play.",100

And obviously, you're making efforts to bring on more supply. You spoke about in PC these constraints with regard to matched sets. I'm sure at this point, you don't want to provide guidance for Q1, but how should we be thinking about seasonality for Q1 as we contemplate these supply constraints?",72

I mean I think -- let's see what would we say about seasonality. I don't have a lot to say other than typically, Q1 is down from Q4. That's typically what the pattern is, given the consumer-related businesses. It might be a little bit subseasonal as we go into this first quarter just given the demand environment, but we'll have to see how things play out over the next couple of months.",85

A little bit of a bigger picture question for my second question. And we've heard and seen from some of the hyperscalers is a trend of, in some cases, doing some custom designs, doing it on their own, often with ARM-based designs. Do you consider that an opportunity or a threat for AMD? And to what extent are you engaged with some of those hyperscalers on some of these custom designs because you do have an IP portfolio yourself?",81
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3093.0,2413301.0,91769749.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,54,"Yes. Chris, on that, we definitely view it as an opportunity, right? So I think what's happening in the data center market is that as the need for compute gets larger, sort of this tailoring of compute for the various workloads is an important trend. I think our IP portfolio today is very strong. I think it will even be stronger given some of the things that we have in plan to allow more tailoring. And we are working very closely with a number of hyperscalers on sort of the vision of compute over the next few years and how we might put together some different solutions between our CPU, GPU, interconnect capability and then with the addition of Xilinx as well coming into our portfolio. So lots of opportunity there for customization. I think that's a key trend that we're certainly going to lean into.",146

Lisa, I just wanted to ask about the comparison on your CNG side between the C and the G and specifically on the client graphic side of things. Clearly, this year has been a really strong year for AMD. Can you just talk about the go-forward on the client side in that? 
I think we're all pretty well aware of what's going to happen in the data center GPU side. But how do we reconcile your commentary on where you think the PC market would be in the flattish area versus the strength you've had in GPUs this year in a strong GPU market? Do you think that continues next year? How much of it is AMD specific? Or if the PC market is weaker, is that something that's a little bit of a headwind for AMD?",153
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3093.0,2413301.0,91769752.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,57,"Yes. So again, what I would say is our market share is still, I would say, underrepresented, whether you're talking about the client sort of CPU or APU side or the GPU side. I think what we have seen here in the third quarter and then into the second half of the year is our graphics business has performed quite well. It is channel driven in the sense that there's still strong demand amongst gamers for GPUs.
As we go into 2022, though, I don't view sort of the PC market as a headwind for the company. I think as we look at all of these markets, of course, we do a bunch of scenario planning if the market is up or if it's down. I think there are many who think that the market may be up. 
There are some who think that market may be down. And that's why we're choosing to model sort of the base case is flattish. But even within that market, whether you're talking about client CPUs or -- client GPUs, we think we have opportunities to gain share and grow in that business, just given the strength of our product portfolio and the fact that we are sort of underrepresented to we think the -- sort of what we can expect given those products.",221

I think you're going to be closer to 24% versus your 26% to 27% entering the year and 25% as of last quarter.
So great expansion there in margins and better leverage. As we look forward, though, I think the third quarter was the first time where you guys spent enough that it actually impacted a segment where the operating margin fell a little bit. And I think we all understand why you're doing that and it feeds great growth. So it's not a negative.
But as I look into '22, do you think next year can be another year where your operating leverage is positive? Or do you expect to be able to spend closer to your former targets in kind of the 25% to 27% of sales range?",180

Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an OpEx standpoint, whether it's R&D, go-to-market, hiring, which we are doing from a viewpoint of the growth in the company.
And I think from a modeling standpoint, a guidance standpoint, you can assume that the growth in OpEx will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, OpEx flattish or even down. I mean you can model it, but very disciplined on that standpoint and making sure that we are investing for the growth is a top priority for us.",125

So yes, we continue to invest heavily in software, particularly on the data center GPU side. We -- with our next-generation GPU architecture, MI200, which we'll be talking a little bit about in the next few weeks, we have made significant investments in progress. Our focus has been on using sort of the Frontier beachhead with high-performance computing and expanding that into AI and working with our partners on that software development. So overall, continue to make good progress there. I think the Xilinx acquisition and bringing in sort of that software talent also provides opportunities to optimize across the overall portfolio in terms of just the software infrastructure that people want in an overall ecosystem.

So server share, if I look at your guidance for Q4, it looks like you're going to be in the 12.5% to 13% share, if I use the entire TAM, and that's up like 500 basis points versus last year Q4. So I guess the question is, like, is that a reasonable trajectory into next year? As if we're sitting to 12 months from now, would you be surprised if you gained another 500 basis points next year?

So I think, overall, our server trajectory has been very strong. I mean I think we're very pleased with the trajectory here in 2021. I think having a number of quarters where we're doubling the revenue year-on-year kind of speaks to the progress there. As we go into 2022, we still believe we are a share gainer in that environment just given the strength of our portfolio and let's call it, platforms that are still yet to launch across our customer set.
So we're continuing to play out the strategy of a data center being a place where our technology is very differentiated. And we think that's true in the third generation with EPYC, and we certainly are very focused on ensuring that the next generation with Zen 4 and Genoa are similarly well positioned in the marketplace.",139
