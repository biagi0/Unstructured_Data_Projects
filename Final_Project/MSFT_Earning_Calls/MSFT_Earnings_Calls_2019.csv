21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3482.0,1645881.0,64868214.0,Presenter Speech,Satya Nadella,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining on the phone. We delivered $32.5 billion in revenue this quarter with double-digit top line and bottom line growth driven by strength across all of our commercial cloud. Our commercial cloud revenue grew 48%, anchored by Azure revenue growth of 76%. These results speak to us picking the right secular trends in large and growing markets, many of which are still in their infancy, as well as focused innovation and execution.
Leading companies in every industry are partnering with us to build their own digital capability to compete and grow. This is creating a broad opportunity for everyone, including our ecosystem. As one example, the co-sell program we introduced 18 months ago has already generated $8 billion in contracted partner revenue.
Now I'll briefly highlight our momentum and innovation across our businesses. Microsoft 365 empowers everyone, enterprises, small businesses and then more than 2 billion first-line workers with an integrated secure experience that transcends any 1 device. We are helping every business build out their system of communication and collaboration to drive their productivity as well as their business transformation. Microsoft Teams is the hub for teamwork and a powerful on-ramp for Microsoft 365, and we're seeing increased usage of OneDrive, SharePoint, Yammer and the entire Office Suite of applications.
Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging, meetings, video conferencing as well as document collaboration. And as of this quarter, enhanced voice capabilities like group call forwarding, delegation, location-based routing are all being brought into Teams.
We are seeing rapid adoption of Teams with more than 420,000 organizations of all sizes and 89 of the Fortune 100 using Teams, including customers like Pfizer, who chose Teams as the collaboration platform for their 115,000 employees, and we are expanding into new and underpenetrated markets. This quarter, we introduced new capabilities to empower first-line workers in the service and task-oriented roles to communicate and collaborate more effectively on the go with mobile schedule management, location sharing as well as the ability to easily record and share secure audio messages.
We're expanding our opportunity in education with Microsoft 365, innovating in hardware and software to improve learning outcomes from the more collaborative classrooms with Teams to personalized learning tools in OneNote, to social learning with Flipgrid, to affordable easy-to-manage Windows 10 devices.
Cybersecurity is a central challenge, and Microsoft is leading the way, helping all organizations operate in what is known in the industry as a zero trust environment. It all starts with Azure AD Active Directory and the deep work we're doing with Microsoft Threat Protection to provide an integrated solution for our customers that extends across identities, device endpoints, e-mail, information, cloud applications and infrastructure. And this quarter, we introduced new advanced capabilities for identity and threat protection and for information protection and compliance. A comprehensive approach to security and compliance is another reason why customers are adopting Microsoft 365. Customers from Neiman Marcus to Brooks Running to global biopharmaceutical leader, Sanofi, all chose our solutions.
Surface had its biggest quarter ever this holiday, delivering strong double-digit growth in both consumer and commercial. We continue to innovate and expand our family of devices, setting the bar for the industry with newest Surface Pro, Surface Laptop and Surface Go. More broadly, Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. And at CES, our OEM partners showcased always connected Windows 10 PCs that deliver break-through levels of performance to enable powerful new scenarios like immersive gaming.
Moving to business applications and LinkedIn. Dynamics 365 grew 51% this quarter as we win customers with our differentiated approach to systems of record and systems of engagement by making them more modular, extensible and AI-driven. Increasingly, business process automation includes digitizing physical spaces, activities and interactions. Dynamics 365, along with advances in Azure IoT, AI and Mixed Reality are leading the way for organizations to create these new systems of observation and systems of intelligence that drive end-to-end business processes and bridge the online and off-line worlds.
For example, we now have the capability for customers to manage inventory in real-time from the shelf to the warehouse to the farm. But we're not stopping there. Our Power platform spanning Power BI, Power Apps and Flow enables anyone in an organization to start building an intelligent app or workflow where none exists. It is the only solution of its kind in the industry, bringing together no code or low code app development, robotic process automation and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive application platform. And it enables extensibility across Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 as well as leading third-party SaaS business applications.
With Power platform, Microsoft is fundamentally demarketizing business processes, empowering everyone to make smarter, faster decisions, and I'm energized about the tremendous opportunity in this space. Already, Centrica is relying on Power BI, Power Apps and Flow along with Dynamics 365 to transform scheduling and dispatch of its first-line workforce in the United Kingdom. Virgin Group is using Power Apps and Dynamics 365 to generate a single view of its passengers' surfacing insights to improve customer service and increase operational efficiency. And in Italy, postal service is using Dynamics 365 to jump start the digital transformation of thousands of the post offices across the country.
Moving to LinkedIn. We continue to generate strong revenue growth across all businesses, with sessions growth of 30% year-over-year fueled by record levels of engagement in the feed and content shared across the platform. We also saw record job postings again this quarter. We introduced new brand and community building tools for marketeers with LinkedIn pages, making it easier for organizations of all sizes to foster strong connections with LinkedIn's 610 million members.
Finally, Glint broadens our market opportunity with its industry leading employee engagement platform. At a time when competing for talent and skill development is a priority for every leader, the combination of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, LinkedIn Learning and now Glint helps every business attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs marketplace.
Now turning to Azure. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud with a consistent computing stack that extends from the data center to the edge, and customers across every industry recognize this architectural advantage. In retail, Azure was front and center at the NRF. Kroger is partnering with us to redefine customer experience in stalls and provide employees with AI-driven insights, while the Gap chose our cloud to accelerate the digital transformation. And just this week, Albertsons chose Azure as its preferred cloud.
In financial services, MasterCard is partnering with us on a new, more secure way to verify digital identities. BlackRock is applying the power of the Microsoft Cloud to reimagine retirement planning, and UBS is using Azure to increase agility across the organization while meeting the highest bar of compliance and security.
In health care, Walgreens Boots Alliance chose Azure to put people at the center of their health and wellness with digital solutions to improve health care outcomes and lower costs. In addition, they will roll out Microsoft 365 to more than 380,000 employees in stores globally.
We're accelerating our innovation in emerging workloads like IoT and edge AI. At CES, our partners showcased how Azure IoT and Azure AI are enabling them to build new connected devices and experiences that span the cloud and the edge from connected homes to cars to smart cities. Just this month, Starbucks chose Azure Sphere to secure its business-critical edge devices in the stores.
Developers will increasingly drive the influence business -- and influence business processes and functions across every organization. And we are committed to drive at giving developers the tools they need to be productive on any platform. More than 12 million developers around the world use Visual Studio to build applications, and new features enable them to collaborate in real-time and spend more time driving innovation.
We closed our acquisition of GitHub this quarter, enabling us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos. GitHub has more than 31 million developer accounts and recently surpassed 100 million code repositories, a major milestone. Development teams at more than half of the Fortune 50 do their work in GitHub Enterprise. This month, we announced significant updates to make GitHub accessible to even more developers, introducing unlimited private repos as well as new, simpler and unified enterprise offering already available through the Microsoft global sales force, and we're not stopping there. Just last week, we announced our acquisition of Citus Data, the leading provider of PostgreSQL, enhancing our overall data platform differentiation and building on our investments in Azure and making it the most comprehensive cloud for open source and proprietary workloads at any scale.
And now I'll turn to gaming. We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity to transform how games are distributed, played and viewed. Our investments in content community and cloud services across every endpoint drove both record user engagement and record average revenue per user and contributed to our largest gaming revenue quarter ever, driven by software and services.
We acquired 2 new studios this quarter, bringing the total to 13 and more than doubling our first-party content capacity in the past 6 months. Xbox Live monthly active users reached a record 64 million, with the highest number of mobile and PC users to date. Xbox Game Pass subscribers and Mixer engagement also hit new all-time highs. And Minecraft, which continues to be one of the most popular and durable gaming franchises in the industry, delivered record revenue as we expanded into new platforms, geographies and segments like education. PlayFab surpassed 1 billion player accounts this quarter, and xCloud will be public trialed later this year as we make progress on our ambition to build a world-class gaming platform spanning mobile, PC and console.
In closing, our accelerating customer momentum is driven by our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies and differentiated innovation across our portfolio. Every company is becoming a digital company, and they're looking for a trusted partner to help them build tech intensity. Microsoft is that partner.
With that, now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.",1736
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3482.0,1645881.0,64868215.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as a reminder, my comments across our results and outlook include the impact from GitHub, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses.
This quarter, revenue was $32.5 billion, up 12% and 13% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 12%. Operating income increased 18%, and earnings per share was $1.10, increasing 15% and 14% in constant currency when adjusting for the net charges related to TCJA. Strong execution and continued customer demand for our hybrid cloud offerings drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. We continued to benefit from favorable secular trends and IT spending conditions. From a geographic perspective, our performance was in line with macroeconomic trends with strength across the U.S., Western Europe and the U.K. partially offset by weaker performance in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa.
In our commercial business, annuity mix grew 3 points year-over-year to 89%. Commercial unearned revenue was $25.3 billion, growing 20%, slightly above our expectations. And commercial bookings were strong, growing 18% and 22% in constant currency driven by solid renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger, longer-term Azure contracts.
As a reminder, strong performance in larger long-term Azure contracts, Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts will drive bookings growth and in-period revenue but will have a limited impact on unearned revenue. Commercial cloud revenue was $9 billion, growing 48% and 47% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year-over-year to 62% driven by significant improvement in Azure gross margin.
Our company gross margin percentage was 62%, flat year-over-year as improving cloud margins were offset by sales mix shift to commercial cloud and Surface hardware. The U.S. dollar was a bit stronger than anticipated, which resulted in a slightly greater impact to our results. FX reduced revenue, COGS and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. Operating expenses grew 7%, slightly lower than expectation as some marketing spend shifted to Q3. We again expanded operating margins as a result of focused investment, solid execution and improving gross margins in key product areas.
Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $10.1 billion, increasing 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn and Dynamics 365. Office Commercial revenue grew 11%. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 34% and 33% in constant currency driven by seat growth of 27% and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher value E3 and E5 offerings. We saw installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments.
Office Consumer revenue grew 1% and 2% in constant currency, below our expectation. As discussed on our last earnings call, Q2 revenue growth was impacted by channel inventories normalizing after the prelaunch builds in Q1 but was further negatively impacted by a smaller-than-expected consumer PC market and execution challenges through the quarter. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 33.3 million, a sequential slowdown primarily due to changes made in how Office 365 is sold in Japan. Our Dynamics business grew 17% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 51% and 50% in constant currency. This quarter, more than 9 out of every 10 new Dynamics CRM customers chose our cloud offering.
LinkedIn revenue increased 29% and 30% in constant currency with continued strong execution across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions grew 30% as engagement once again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as increased cloud mix offset the benefit from improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins. Operating expenses increased 3% and 4% in constant currency as we continued to invest in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which now includes GitHub. Revenue was $9.4 billion, increasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our hybrid solutions. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 24%. Azure revenue increased 76% with strong growth from both the consumption and per user base businesses. In our on-premises server business, continued customer demand for flexible hybrid solutions and our premium offerings drove growth of 3% and 4% in constant currency.
Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged as revenue mix to Azure IaaS and PaaS was offset by material improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage. Operating expenses increased 26% with continued investment in cloud and AI engineering as well as commercial sales capacity and the addition of GitHub. Operating income grew 16% and 15% in constant currency.
Now to the results for More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $13 billion, increasing 7%. Results in our Windows OEM business were lower than expected, partially offset by strong Surface results. In Windows, the overall PC market was smaller than we expected primarily due to the timing of chip supply to our OEM partners, which constrained an otherwise healthy PC ecosystem and negatively impacted both OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue growth. Windows OEM Pro revenue declined 2%, roughly in line with the commercial PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 11%, below the market with continued pressure in the entry-level category.
Inventory levels ended the quarter below the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 14% in constant currency with continued customer adoption of our premium offerings. Windows 10 deployments across new and existing devices remained strong.
Gaming revenue grew 8% and 9% in constant currency. Xbox software and services revenue increased 31% and 32% in constant currency, primarily driven by continued strength from a third-party title. Additionally, strong subscriber growth across Xbox Live and Game Pass helped to offset lower-than-expected performance from other third-party titles on the platform. Xbox hardware performed better than expected but declined year-over-year given the holiday launch of the Xbox One X a year ago.
In Surface, revenue increased 39% and 41% in constant currency to nearly $1.9 billion, ahead of our expectations, driven by strong growth across both our consumer and commercial segments. Search revenue ex TAC increased 14%, driven by Bing rate growth and increased volume in U.S. and international markets. Segment gross margin dollars increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased due to sales mix to our lower-margin Surface and gaming businesses. Operating expenses declined 4%. As a result, operating income increased 18% and 19% in constant currency.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were down sequentially to $3.9 billion, lower than originally planned mainly due to quarter-to-quarter variability and the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for plant, property and equipment was $3.7 billion.
Cash flow from operations increased 13% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion and decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of higher cash payments for plant, property and equipment.
Other income was $127 million, higher than anticipated, driven by interest income and investment gains partially offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was slightly above 17%, in line with expectations.
And finally, we returned $9.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 91%. Our Q2 share repurchase was $6.1 billion, higher than our normal quarterly pace and aligned to our commitment of incremental buyback to fully offset stock consideration issued in the GitHub transaction by the end of the fiscal year.
Now let's move to the outlook. For Q3, first, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and assuming the current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to decrease revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points and decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point. With the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth and Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing.
Second, continued strong customer demand, healthy bookings growth and increasing revenue annuity mix should drive another solid quarter in our Commercial business. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to decline approximately 2% to 3%, in line sequentially with historic trends. We expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to continue to improve year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin will again be partially offset by the mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services.
Third, CapEx. We expect a sequential dollar increase in capital expenditures as we continue to invest to support increasing demand.
Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.9 billion and $10.1 billion, driven by double-digit growth in Office Commercial and Dynamics as well as healthy LinkedIn growth on a strong prior year comparable. We expect Office Consumer revenue growth to continue to be in the low single digits as growth in Office 365 will be partially offset by the continuation of the consumer PC market headwinds.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $9.15 billion and $9.35 billion, with our hybrid demand continuing to drive strong growth in server products and cloud services. Azure growth will continue to reflect the balance between strong growth in our consumption-based businesses and moderating growth in our per-user business.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.35 billion and $10.65 billion, with a shift in revenue mix to our Surface and gaming businesses.
In Windows overall, OEM revenue growth should be in the low single digits as we anticipate continued market demand -- market impact from constrained chip supply in Q3. In Surface, continued momentum from Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2 and Surface Go will drive another strong quarter of over 20% growth for Surface.
In search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q2. In gaming, we expect revenue growth to be slightly higher than last quarter. Sales mix will shift to software and services where we expect healthy growth.
Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.35 billion to $10.55 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion dollars, inclusive of marketing spend that moved from Q2 to Q3. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest expense. And finally, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with the full year rate of 17%.
Now a few comments on our outlook for Q4 and the full fiscal year, which are unchanged from October. First on FX. In Q4, assuming rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by approximately 2 points and COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.
Second, in Q4, we expect continued strong performance in our commercial cloud business; but as a reminder, we also have several challenging comparisons from the prior year, specifically in on-premise server, LinkedIn, Windows OEM and the strength of a third-party title in gaming. In terms of operating expenses, we continue to expect full year growth of roughly 8%. We will continue to invest in strategic growth areas like Azure, GitHub, Dynamics, the Power platform, LinkedIn, Teams and gaming content given our significant growth opportunities, competitive advantage and growing momentum. We still expect full year operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year, inclusive of the full GAAP impact of GitHub.
For CapEx, we continue to expect the growth rate for the year to moderate, even as we meet the high demand for our cloud services. We remain committed to an incremental share buyback beyond the normal quarterly pace that will fully offset stock consideration issued in the GitHub transaction by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we still expect the full year effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability.

Satya, there's been a lot of press releases of you up on the stage with CEOs from guys like Albertson and Walgreens talking about these large strategic deals that you're doing with these companies. Can you help us understand sort of how do these large strategic deals translate into sort of the services being used on Azure changing? Like is there a mix shift in the type of services that are supporting these large digital transformations that we should be sort of aware of on a going-forward basis? And to Amy, one of the sort of big investor debates is a lot of suppliers into -- on the big cloud vendors like yourself are talking about weaker shipments into the suppliers. But you guys have seen very stable growth. I mean, Azure growth was dead solid from Q1 to Q2. Can you help us understand how the sort of capital intensity of some of these cloud businesses has been changing over time?",178

First of all, thank you, Keith, for the question. It is very true that, at this point, we have seen these very large digital transformational efforts and projects that we are partnered with. And they span, quite frankly, all the industries. I think in the last quarter, you saw in health care, in retail, in financial services. In fact, I sort of internally think of them as what our relationships with our traditional OEM partners in the PC ecosystem were. At this point, some of the partnerships we have with customers are of that same magnitude. And that just speaks to, I think, what's happening in the economy, which is every company is becoming a digital company, and essentially what used to be COGS and operating expense is all going digital. From a mix of services, it starts always with, I would say, infrastructure, so this is the edge and the cloud, the infrastructure being used as compute. In fact, you could say the measure of a company going digital is the amount of compute they use. So that's the base. Then on top of that, of course, all this compute means it's being used with data. So the data estate, one of the largest things that happens is people consolidate the data that they have and so that they can reason over it. And that's where things like AI services all get used. So we definitely see that path of -- where they're adopting the layers of Azure. But it doesn't stop in Azure. In fact, if you take Walgreens Boots Alliance, it was Microsoft 365 as well as Azure. In many cases, it's Dynamics 365. Any IoT project on Azure leads to a Dynamics field service project in most instances. So we're seeing the breadth and depth of our cloud offering, which is what we are really architected to have real synergies in the context of what our customers want to achieve, and that's what we are seeing. And one comment before I throw it over to Amy. Even on that -- our own demand for it, we don't see any change. In fact, it's very healthy and we think that it'll continue to be healthy. And if anything, at our scale, as you can imagine, we are becoming much more efficient in how we use software to utilize the capacity we have. So we have significant gains in utilization across our estate. So with that, I'll turn over to Amy.",414

Satya, in the different documents related to the earnings this quarter you have on product launches, et cetera, there's a discussion in there on the Microsoft launch of the Quantum Development Kit. Can you give us a bit of color on how you're thinking about quantum computing today, where the -- how soon the opportunity, where is it in the maturation? And then I have a follow-up for Amy.",85

Thanks, Mark. So the way we think about our overall investment, I think of this as a systems investment because at the scale at which we operate, the Intelligent Cloud and the intelligent edge infrastructure, which you all track as Azure, you got to remember it's the core platform that's powering everything from our gaming ambitions to what we are doing with Microsoft 365, to what we are doing with Dynamics 365 and of course, our third-party business in Azure. So that's the core platform. And now when you think about the scale at which we operate, it is very important for us to make sure that every new breakthrough that happens in the system architecture that can improve efficiencies in what is distributed computing is something that we stay on the forefront of it. So that's why we have a very long-term view on Quantum, and the things that we did even in this last quarter is take things like the quantum simulator stuff and bring it to Azure. In fact, we are seeing very good adoption in scientific labs, in universities and some pharma companies and others who are looking at really building their quantum algorithmic promise long before the quantum computer [ cloud ] is real so that they are ready to be able to take advantage of that computing resource. So that's how we look at it, but you got to remember that before Quantum, there are many byproducts of a quantum effort that have significant implications on how we get more competitive, efficient in terms of providing computing to the world. So that's one of the reasons why you hear us talk about quantum as the long-term goal, but you can fully expect us to take a lot of learnings, advances in that roadmap and bring them to market earlier.",306

Amy, you gave a lot of color this quarter, but in the quarter, there was overall transactional weakness. Can you give us a little more color? Is there something structural driving it, U.S. government, China weakness? Were there just simply less contracts up for renewal? Or is it the cloud? Any additional data would be helpful.",60

The only transactional weakness I felt in the quarter at all was what we covered, which was the OEM impact from the chip supply, which was about 1.5 points of growth on MPC, and the Office Consumer impact, which was secondary impact of the PC environment plus some execution challenges we had that I feel really good that we've gotten to the root of and will get handled in H2. Outside of that, our transactional execution was really precisely as we expected. Office Commercial actually had a pretty reasonable quarter given some of the impacts we had in Q1, a couple of points of impact of extra growth that we talked about. And the product and services KPI on prem and server was also quite good when we think about the balance and what that represents for hybrid demand. We continue to see good demand on DC -- sorry, data center modernization as well as some of the premium SKUs.",165

Amy, I think you've guided to low single-digit growth in Windows OEM revenue for Q3. And just wondering if you can sort of help us bridge that because you also talked about inventory levels, Windows being low in the OEMs as well as some mix. So maybe kind of help us bridge the gap between your comments about maybe continued storage as a component but -- the revenue growth. And then the other side of Windows, the Commercial, obviously it's been super strong, but we're starting to lap some -- there's some pretty big growth numbers Q3, Q4 last year, and then, obviously, there's some accounting change with 606. Maybe give us some color there. So I guess, one, on the OEM side and then, two, on the commercial side.",136
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3482.0,1645881.0,64868231.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,19,"Great. Thank you. On the OEM side, the way to think about those comments is we do expect inventory levels to likely remain low as we exit the next quarter as well. So think about there having -- because your -- we do expect chip supply to remain constrained. I don't expect to see any impact from changing inventory levels through the next quarter. So I would sort of remove that as one of the mechanisms you're thinking about on overall OEM demand. I do think what we will see in Q3 is we're expecting a little better performance in the Pro side of the market in terms of seeing growth there, and that's probably helping a little bit. To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and you're right, we are starting to reach some tougher comparables. But a lot of that comparability, which you referenced, is due a little bit of how it's licensed, which is a lot of this is new and gets recognized more upfront in quarter. That's going to continue to have some lumpiness still as we go over the years. As that business continues to grow, it'll get less of that impact. The primary driver in terms of billings is how I tend to think about that, has been pretty consistent. It's been double-digit consistent growth. It tends to look a lot like our Office 365 motion. It's sold with Microsoft 365. It's about the selling motion of E3 and E5 that we talk about. If you could almost take out that 606 impact in the billings team to almost mirror the Microsoft 365 SKUs we sell.",282

It sounds like you feel pretty good or at least stable about the PC outlook for the remainder of this year. But given that Windows is a pretty material driver of profitability at Microsoft, if we do start to see a more protracted decline in PC unit sales and you think about your investments going out through the remainder of this calendar year, are there opportunities to sort of flex down the cost structure at this point to preserve profitability in margins? Or should we assume that much of the investments happening right now are really tied to the commercial cloud and some of the lower margin but higher opportunity businesses and maybe there isn't so much of an offset? Just how should we think about contingency planning if we do see a weaker -- an extended weakening in the global economic climate?",161

See, first of all, I'd say the opportunity for our shareholders when they think about Microsoft has never been better. When I look at every business becoming a digital business and then take that opportunity and map that to our capability, we have the broadest platform of anyone in the tech sector to really help every customer in every country become that digital business. And we have the business model that aligns with them and their interests and the trust. And so therefore, from a secular perspective, we are all in on making sure that we invest in our commercial cloud as well as our investments in things like gaming and going after the opportunity that is there in front of us. And as you even think about Microsoft 365, the value proposition of Microsoft 365 transcends Windows and Office on Windows. We think about the relevance of our applications across all device sockets. We think about the security, identity management, information protection and all that value across all device sockets, so therefore, I feel very, very good about the product investments and the go-to-market investments we are making to really help our shareholders realize that growth potential that's available in what is going to be an increasingly digital world. And I'll let Amy answer.",225

We know that the signals we get from especially our commercial customers is that there's a healthy demand for the value that exists in Windows 10. We're seeing it in terms of deployments on new and existing devices and the security and manageability value prop that comes with a modern device and the experiences that employers want their employees to have and be able to take advantage of, along with some of the end-of-support deadlines that we have talked about, there is still an opportunity for us to remain focused on and execute on through this calendar year.

And then our Cosmos DB has become the leading multi-model, multi-region database. And so therefore, I feel very, very good, as I said even earlier, whenever these customer digital transformation projects start, they start by really getting their data into shape. And what that means is you bring all the data in its native format. You need the full comprehensive platform and then the ability to able -- to do things like AI and analytics on top of all of this data. So our data platform growth as well as competitiveness is very good and increasing. And we're the only provider still who can do this in a hybrid way. That is the consistency between what happens at the edge to the cloud when it comes to data tier becomes even more important as edge scenarios become very, very real. So therefore, I feel very good about our data story in Citus, which is the company we just bought for the Postgres capability, is something that we are very excited about.",199

I'm wondering if you can talk about just your visibility into the growth in that business. A lot of that comes from enterprise agreements and commitments customers are making. Some of that's on sort of credits that they have to consume. I'm not sure if you're willing to give us sort of a growth kind of trajectory as you look out forward, but I think there's a lot of investor interest in terms of how much visibility

In terms of the Azure growth, most of the Azure growth is really driven by consumption. So this is about getting projects started, making those projects successful, making sure customers feel the value and get the value of their investment. And increasingly, that's why we've been talking a bit about the form of these contracts changing, larger commitments being made that are -- that land in bookings but not in unearned, right? So it's a bit different mechanism than you think about having in our standard EA, where it goes to the balance sheet and gets earned off. These are contracts that unless it is used and deployed and a customer gets value from, it does not land into the P&L. And so the part that looks a little bit more EA-like is the part we've talked about on a per-user basis, right? That's something you're going to deploy, whether that's EMS, is the best example. And so those have the characteristic you talk about, which is that it really comes from the EA and the recognition is more predictable. But on the IaaS and PaaS layer, that's about our execution each quarter and especially making an impact. The way that -- the only other way that, that Azure number, to think about it, is when we've talked about the Azure Hybrid Benefits that exist, those show up actually in the on-prem number, right, even if they ultimately get used on the Azure side. So there actually is some Azure Benefit revenue ultimately that shows ""is on-prem.""",262

I'm just curious whether you're sensing an amplified tailwind there due to Amazon's ambitions to actually compete with grocers and retailers and health care providers and other industries. And then, Amy, I am assuming that those wins are captured by this robustness that we're seeing in the commercial bookings growth, which is up 22%. But I guess, I don't understand if they're fully captured, if this is a consumption-based structure. Or are we only seeing a portion of those bookings if we look in the unearned revenue and in the KPI?",121

I mean, the first thing is to -- we need to have product truth and product competitiveness and capability to, first of all, play, and that's where I'll start. We have a very, very good compelling platform across our commercial cloud. That's what's really leading us to be able to do these types of partnerships that you referenced. It's clear that we also have a fantastic alignment of our business model with the interest of our customers. In other words, we want to make sure that we are, in fact, making our customers fully capable digital companies in their own right, whether they're in retail, whether they're in oil and gas, whether they're in health care because that's really what's in our long-term interest, which is to ensure that they have full digital capability, and then they'd use the subscriptions and the consumption capabilities of our cloud. And of course, that means we have a trusted relationship, which is a competitive advantage in a world where some of our competitors have more complex business models, where in some cases they give them platforms, in other cases where they compete with them or tax them. That's definitely something that I'm sure our customers pay attention to.

Very little shows up in unearned, and that's the distinction that we're starting to see in many of these Azure contracts.

But as you think about going after the front-line worker, people you could not get to previously, how should we think about the TAM expansion from that from a seat standpoint?",54
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2019",2019-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3482.0,1645881.0,64868248.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,36,"Yes, a good example of the first-line opportunity was something that you could have seen at NRF this January. We launched, for example, Teams for first-line workers, which had things like shift worker capabilities, secure messaging. One of the challenges in retail and in many other industries is what's that messaging tool that has actually got the security framework that they expect of any other enterprise tool as opposed to using one of these consumer messaging tools, which then all the liability is with the enterprise. So that's the opportunity we see, whether it's -- for all front line, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, whether it's in healthcare. So that's the TAM expansion. So in other words, it can be -- start with Teams. It can start with some of our devices in the first-line worker. For example, one of the things that we see the most traction for HoloLens is with first-line workers. People in manufacturing and other in field service, where they were never issued a standard laptop or even a phone are being issued a HoloLens as their first computing device, and that's just because of the productivity it drives. So those are the kinds of TAM expansion we see across Microsoft 365.",209

So it is true that the deals are much broader, deeper. The relationships with the customers that we have now signed up with span a lot more of our capability and also drives a lot more of their own ambition. So for sure, the sales cycles are different. But at the same time, you've got to remember, at Microsoft, we do have a lot of different business that we do with the customers, which may include some things like refreshes of their on-premise infrastructure all the way to some very high-ambition digital transformation projects. So I would say we are well equipped to deal with that complexity and the variability of what our customers want us to be helping them with.

Those do naturally have longer sales cycles. Azure has many of those same attributes at the higher end of the complexity and digital transformation Satya's talking about. And in these very large transactions, many of which we've been signing recently, where you'll see some of that volatility would be in bookings. But I think, in general, the goal is to have -- and continue to build on that business, but certainly, that would be where the ""volatility"" would show up.",127

It was another strong quarter with double-digit top line and bottom line growth, the result of picking the right secular trends, accelerating innovation and most importantly relentlessly focusing on our customers' success. Our trusted extensible cloud platform spanning application infrastructure, data and AI, productivity and collaboration as well as business applications enables every organization to create their own intelligent systems and experiences to compete and grow.
Now I'll briefly highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our business. Microsoft 365 empowers everyone from the largest multinationals to small businesses, from knowledge workers to first-line workers with an integrated, secure, compliant experience on any device. It's the only comprehensive productivity, collaboration and communication solutions that integrates with an organization's business process workflows.
Microsoft Teams brings together everything a team needs: messaging, video conferencing, meetings and collaboration into a single integrated user experience scaffolding, eliminating the need for discrete apps that only increase an organization's security and compliance exposure. 91 of the Fortune 100 use Teams, and more than 150 organizations have over 10,000 active users. And we are expanding Teams to new industries like health care with priority notifications for patient care and the ability to securely access patient records.
Cybersecurity is a central challenge, and Microsoft is the clear leader in cloud security with our unparalleled operational security posture and our growing portfolio of security and compliance solutions spanning identity, device endpoints, e-mail, information, cloud applications as well as infrastructure.
In financial services, National Bank of Canada, BNP Paribas, Refinitiv, a joint venture between Thomson Reuters and BlackRock, all chose Microsoft 365 for our advanced security and compliance. We expanded Microsoft Threat Protection to include the Mac and manage vulnerabilities in third-party applications, providing the best defense for customers' heterogeneous environments. And we introduced 2 first-of-their-kind services. Azure Sentinel analyzes security signals at massive scale across an entire organization using AI to detect, investigate and respond rapidly to threats. Microsoft Threat Experts is a new cyber threat hunting service that provides access to our security experts on demand. All this innovation is driving growth. Office 365 Commercial now has 180 million users, our EMS installed base reached 100 million and the Outlook apps on iOS and Android surpassed more than 100 million users for the first time this quarter.
We expanded our Surface family of devices with Surface Hub 2S, which brings together Teams, Windows and our category-creating Surface hardware to power teamwork for organizations like Volvo, Domino's Pizza, Northwestern University and NASA Jet Propulsion Labs. Finally, Windows 10 is now active on more than 800 million devices and continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system.
Moving to business applications. Today, traditional systems of record and engagement are often siloed, limiting the value of an organization's most important asset: its data. Dynamics 365 solves this challenge, connecting all their systems and creating digital feedback loops, enabling any organization to become a true AI-first company. The open data initiative we announced last year with Adobe and SAP delivers on this promise and is already enabling customers like Unilever to unify their business data across all their lines of business applications to unlock new AI-driven insights.
Personalization is increasingly key to every organization's marketing strategy, enabling them to effectively engage customers, tailor their experiences and increase return on investment. Tivoli, one of the world's oldest amusement parks, is using AI and Dynamics 365 to help personalize marketing campaigns and transform how their first-line workers engage with guests, reducing churn and increasing customer loyalty.
And we are not stopping there. We are leading in 2 emerging categories: robotic process automation and mixed reality. Our Power Platform brings together robotic process automation with self-service analytics and no-code/low-code app development. Recent updates enable citizen developers to build higher-quality Power Apps faster and easier and, along with new capabilities in Power BI, empower customers like SNCF, France's national railway, to create a more data-centric culture.
Our new HoloLens 2 is the most advanced intelligent edge device available and, in combination with Dynamics 365 and new Azure Mixed Reality services, enables organizations like PACCAR and Chevron to digitize physical spaces and the interactions to empower their first-line employees with the right information at the right time in the context of their business process work. All this innovation is driving growth. Revenue for our Power Platform grew triple digit year-over-year, and for the first time, more than 50% of our Dynamics revenue was driven by the cloud.
Moving to LinkedIn. LinkedIn again exceeded expectations across all lines of business driven by record levels of engagement in the feed, content shared across the platform, the messages sent this quarter. Marketing solutions was up 46% year-over-year, and customers are relying on our new pages experience and audience-targeting capabilities to connect with LinkedIn's nearly 630 million members. We saw record job postings again this quarter and making -- are making it easier for job seekers to find more relevant and higher-paying jobs and get personalized salary insights.
We have the most comprehensive solution for every organization to manage and engage their most important resource: their talent. New tools in Glint empower managers to quickly analyze and action feedback to have the greatest impact on team performance. And with our combination of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, LinkedIn Learning and Glint, we are helping employers access data-driven insights to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs marketplace.
Now let's talk about Azure. From the outset, we took a differentiated approach to the cloud to meet the real-world needs of customers. Our architectural advantage is a clear reason for our success. Azure is the only true hybrid hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge. Operational sovereignty is increasingly critical to customers, and Azure uniquely provides consistency across development environments, operating models and technology stacks whether connected or disconnected to the public cloud. And we are accelerating our innovation. Azure Stack extends our hybrid differentiation, enabling customers like Airbus Defence and Space to build and run cloud applications at the edge. And now with our new Azure Stack HCI, customers can build and run virtualized applications on-premise in a consistent way.
Azure Data Box Edge is a powerful new AI-enabled edge appliance that sits within a customer's environment, in their data center or on a factory floor so that they can use AI to reason over data at the edge. More than 95% of the Fortune 500 run their workloads on our cloud, including TD Bank, and AT&T chose Azure to shape the future of 5G with computing at the edge.
We are building Azure as the world's computer with more global data center regions, and now 2 in South Africa and more compliant certifications than any other cloud provider. And just last week, we announced 2 new Azure government regions to meet the stringent requirements for maintaining the security and integrity of classified U.S. government workloads.
Every organization needs an IoT strategy to manage the 20 billion connected devices coming online by 2020. Our comprehensive Azure IoT platform enables customers to build, manage and secure their connected devices. And our recently announced acquisition of Express Logic furthers our goal, bringing our cloud to more than 6 billion MCU-powered endpoints. BMW Group is partnering with us to speed the adoption of industrial IoT, both in automotive and more broadly in manufacturing. And Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and Volkswagen both chose Azure to fuel their new connected car experiences.
Data and analytics is the foundation for building an organization's AI capability, and we're investing to make Azure the best cloud for data estates from data warehousing to real-time stream analytics. Daimler chose Azure as its new platform for big data and advanced analytics, and third-party analysts affirm our price performance lead in this fast-growing space. And we're investing to make Azure the best place to build AI. This quarter, we introduced new Azure Cognitive Services for fraud detection and image identification. Telefónica is using Azure AI services to create new intelligent experiences for their customers around the world and transform customer engagement.
The developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation, and we are committed to giving them the tools they need to be productive on any platform. GitHub surpassed 36 million registered users, and free private repositories expanded the opportunities for all developers, with private repo creation more than doubling this quarter. The new Visual Studio 2019 optimizes developer productivity and team collaboration. And I'm excited to share more about how we are empowering developers at our Build Conference in 2 weeks.
Now to gaming. We are investing in content, community and cloud to capture our massive opportunity in gaming, delivering record user engagement again this quarter. Microsoft Game Stack brings together our tools and services to empower game developers from independent creators to the biggest game studios to build, operate and scale cloud-first games across mobile, PC and console. Our Xbox Live community, now 63 million strong, is key to our approach, and we are enabling developers to reach these highly engaged gamers on iOS and Android for the first time.
Our fast-growing gaming subscription service, Game Pass, is expanding our reach bolstered by a growing pipeline of first-party content. And Project xCloud, our new game streaming service, will be in public trials later this year.
In closing, I'm energized by our progress and incredibly optimistic about our opportunity ahead. Across all of our businesses, we are delivering differentiated value for customers and creating new categories of growth that position us well for the future.
With that, I'll now hand it over to Amy who will cover the financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",1638
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105214.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.
This quarter, revenue was $30.6 billion, up 14% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 18% in constant currency. Operating income increased 25% and 27% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.14, increasing 20% and 22% in constant currency. Our sales teams and partners delivered strong results across each of our segments, once again resulting in double-digit top and bottom line growth.
From a geographic perspective, most markets performed in line with our expectations. However, results in Japan were much stronger than we anticipated. In our commercial business, cloud services strength drove our annuity mix to 90%, up 1 point year-over-year. Commercial unearned revenue was better than expected at $25.1 billion, up 19% and 20% in constant currency. Commercial bookings growth was strong, increasing 30% and 34% in constant currency.
Bookings growth was driven by healthy renewals on an expiration base that was over 20% larger than a year ago as well as an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, an increased mix of these larger long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings will drive more volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth. Commercial cloud revenue was $9.6 billion, growing 41% and 43% in constant currency, highlighted by healthy growth in the U.S., Western Europe, the U.K. and Germany.
Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year-over-year to 63% driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Company gross margin percentage was 67%, ahead of our expectations and up year-over-year, primarily from an increase in margin in our More Personal Computing segment due to sales mix shift. FX reduced revenue growth by 2 points and COGS growth by 1 point in line with expectations. FX reduced operating expense growth by 1 point, less than anticipated. Even with this headwind, operating expenses grew in line with expectations, increasing 9% and 10% in constant currency. Strong revenue growth, improving gross margins and disciplined investment in strategic and high-growth areas resulted in operating margin expansion.
Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $10.2 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by performance in Japan and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 30% and 31% in constant currency driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as ARPU growth from our customers' continued shift to our E3 and E5 offerings. Office 365 Commercial seats grew 27% and benefited from the strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers.
Office Consumer revenue grew 8% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of our expectations, with 4 points of growth from transactional sales in Japan. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 34.2 million. Our Dynamics business grew 13% and 15% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 43% and 44% in constant currency. We saw continued progress in our finance and operations offering with strong growth in customer billings and deployments.
LinkedIn revenue increased 27% and 29% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses. LinkedIn cessions increased 24% as engagement once again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset increased cloud mix. Operating expenses increased 4% and 6% in constant currency driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 28% and 30% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $9.7 billion, increasing 22% and 24% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 27% and 29% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 73% and 75% in constant currency driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments partially offset by tempering growth in our per-user business. Our Enterprise Mobility installed base grew 53% to over 100 million seats. And our on-premises server business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency driven by the continued strength of our hybrid solutions, premium offerings and GitHub as well as increased transactional demand ahead of the end of support of Windows Server and SQL Server 2008.
Enterprise Services revenue increased 4% and 5% in constant currency driven by growth in premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased slightly as the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue was partially offset by another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses increased 22% and 23% in constant currency driven by continued investment in cloud and AI engineering, GitHub and commercial sales capacity. Operating income increased 21% and 23% in constant currency.
Now to the More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $10.7 billion, increasing 8% and 9% in constant currency as better-than-expected performance in Windows was partially offset by lower-than-expected gaming revenue. In Windows, the overall PC market was stronger than we anticipated driven by improved chip supply that met both unfulfilled Q2 commercial and premium consumer demand as well as better-than-expected Q3 commercial demand. Therefore, OEM Pro revenue grew 15%, and OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%. Inventory levels were within the normal range.
Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 18% and 20% in constant currency with continued double-digit billings growth and a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. Windows 10 deployments across new and existing devices remains healthy.
In gaming, revenue grew 5% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower-than-expected monetization across third-party titles and console sales. Xbox software and services revenue grew 12% and 15% in constant currency with continued momentum in Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriber growth. Surface revenue grew 21% and 25% in constant currency driven by continued strength across consumer and commercial segments, particularly in Japan.
Search revenue ex TAC increased 12% and 14% in constant currency primarily driven by Bing rate growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points due to sales mix shift to higher-margin products in Windows and gaming. Operating expenses increased 1% and 2% in constant currency, and operating income increased 25% and 28% in constant currency.
Now back to our total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were down sequentially to $3.4 billion and lower than initially planned primarily due to normal quarterly spend variability and the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for property, plant and equipment was $2.6 billion. Cash flow from operations increased 11% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $11 billion and increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of lower cash payments for property, plant and equipment.
Other income was $145 million driven by interest income and net gains on derivatives and investments offset partially by debt and finance lease expense. Our effective tax rate came in lower than expected at 16%. And finally, we returned $7.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 17%.
Now let's move to next quarter's outlook. First, on FX. Assuming the current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by approximately 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Second, we again expect customer demand and solid execution to drive continued strong performance across our commercial business in our largest quarter of the year.
The expiry base will grow in Q4 but at a more moderated rate than in Q3, and we expect commercial unearned revenue to increase 36% to 37% sequentially. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should continue to improve year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin will be partially offset by the continued mix of revenue toward Azure IaaS and PaaS services.
Third, CapEx. Our full year outlook remains unchanged. Therefore, we expect a sequential dollar increase in capital expenditures in Q4 as we continue to invest to meet growing customer demand.
Now to the segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $10.55 billion and $10.75 billion. Office Commercial revenue growth rate will be slightly down sequentially as is normal for Q4 due to the high mix of cloud billings during this quarter. As a reminder, under ASC 606, a higher mix of cloud billing is reflected in more unearned revenue and less in-period revenue recognition.
Dynamics should see another quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by Dynamics 365. LinkedIn revenue growth should be in the low 20s against a high prior year comparable. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between 8 -- $10.85 billion and $11.05 billion. In Azure, we expect continued strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business given the increasing in size of the installed base.
In our on-premise server business, demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings should remain strong. And we expect continued benefit from the upcoming end of support for Windows Server and SQL Server 2008 though, as a reminder, their prior year comparable will impact the year-over-year growth rate.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.8 billion and $11.1 billion. In Windows, overall OEM growth rates should normalize with revenue growth roughly in line with the PC market. In Surface, we expect low double-digit growth with continued momentum across commercial and consumer segments. In search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q3. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline year-over-year driven by the tough comparable in Xbox software and services and the continuation of the hardware trends from Q3.
Now back to the overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.65 billion to $10.85 billion and operating expenses of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest and finance lease expense. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 17% with some potential volatility given it is the final quarter of our fiscal year.
Now I'd like to provide some closing thoughts as we look forward to FY '20. Overall, we feel very good about the progress we've made thus far in FY '19. Our decision to invest with significant ambition in high-growth areas, coupled with strong execution, has resulted in material revenue growth at scale and a stronger position in many key markets.
As FY '20 approaches, we again see tremendous opportunity to drive sustained long-term growth. We will invest aggressively in strategic areas like cloud through AI and GitHub; business applications through Power Platform and LinkedIn; Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security and Surface as well as gaming. At the same time, we will continue to drive improvement and efficiency as our business scales. This consistent approach of investing in future growth while delivering strong operating performance will result in double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY '20 with stable operating margins.
With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.",1888

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105217.0,Question,Heather Bellini,,Analysts,6,"Amy, if I go back and look through your KPIs, it looks like the year-over-year growth in commercial bookings has never been this high on a constant currency basis at least I was able to go back through fiscal '13. You mentioned an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts, which obviously is a driver. But is there any more color you could share? Is this coming from a handful of customers, I mean, that are just driving all of their -- like outsourcing everything to you guys and shutting down their data centers? Or do you see this as kind of a broad-based trend even in some of the industries that have been slow to move to the cloud where this is really starting to snowball? And then the follow-up would be just Azure gross margins where you guys have done a remarkable job just continuing to increase efficiency there. How much room is left to go? And how do you think about the percentage of COGS in Azure that are variable versus fixed? Then has the ratio been changing?",183
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105218.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,7,"Great. Heather, let me try to take both of those questions. On your commercial bookings growth question, I find it easiest to think about commercial bookings, before I answer the larger question about onetime, in 2 ways. The first is the expiration base absolutely does matter, and that's how we talked about it. And we had a, actually, very good quarter here in terms of renewals and what I think of as revenue recapture where we're able to grow the revenue in existing contracts. And so that absolutely contributed and has contributed over the past couple of years to what I do believe has been reasonably consistent commercial bookings strength versus the expiration base.
The second component is what I would put in bucket of new business whether that new business comes as what you saw this quarter, 2 ways: there was some on-prem strength this quarter. It does show up in bookings. It doesn't show up in unearned, and it does show up in the P&L. We had a good quarter there. And we did have some large Azure contracts, which tend to be longer-dated and tend to have low billings upfront. That means it shows up in bookings and again not in the unearned balance in the same way. And so you will see as we go forward, and you're already starting to see it, more volatility in this number not just based on the way we've traditionally talked about it, which is the movement of the expiration base but also in some of these larger, longer-term commitments by what we now think of not just as customers, but these are really now partnership relationships that we have where, to your point, we're co-collaborating to help customers be successful as they build their digital future. And so you will see a little bit of volatility in this number as those contracts and those type of contracts start to land.
On your second question of Azure GM, we have continued to see strong improvement in the core gross margin of Azure. The team has done a nice job on a number of fronts, continue to make progress on both software innovation but also importantly hardware innovation and working with our supply chain to continue to have and see benefits on that side. Also is increasing use of premium services also contributed to Azure gross margin improvement. So while we remain focused on efficiency and the utilization of the hardware and software, it's also important to continue to see premium upsell, premium workload usage, so the customers are getting the most out of their deployments and usage of the Azure platform. In general, I -- it hasn't changed a ton in terms of that final component about fixed versus, I think, variable base. It's still been in that, I think, low 40% as a range for us in terms of what's depreciation versus what's more variable.",486
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105219.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,8,Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.,13

I'm going to pick a similar question to Heather's but directed at you, Satya, to try to get a higher-level answer. In terms of -- during this quarter, it just sounds to me like I've heard Amy talking more about exceeding expectations than we have in prior quarters and exceeding plan more than we have in prior quarters. This matches up from what we're hearing, and our CIO is sort of has been talking to customers. It almost sounds like there's an inflection point going on in the adoption of cloud and digitalization efforts. So the question to you is are you guys seeing that. Are you starting to see an inflection point in terms of these adoption trends and the investment that you guys have made behind this really starting to take hold? And then perhaps a follow-up for Amy. So operating margins really exceeded our expectations this quarter and I think consensus expectations. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what drove that and kind of why we wouldn't see as much of that on a go-forward basis in terms of operating margin expansion?",192
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105221.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,10,"Yes. Thanks, Keith, for the question. So let me start. I think overall, what we are seeing is continued momentum. If you think about even -- our overall approach has been to have a view of an architecture that is grounded in our customers' needs. So we always believe that in distribute computing, you need a cloud and an edge. You need hybrid. And guess what? Today, in 2019, hybrids become much more mainstream, but we were talking about this even 5 years ago. They also sort of said things that will matter in this transition to the cloud will be consistency and productivity. So for example, whether it's developer productivity or IT productivity, it's not any one dimension, you need to bring IT and developers together to drive agility in an organization and the digital capability building.
This is again a place where we've had also traditional strength and that's showing up in the marketplace. And also, if you look at our cloud stack, we have application and infrastructure, data and AI, productivity and collaboration as well as business applications, that's pretty unique again. So that's, I think, what is showing up at scale as competitive differentiation, and that's what you see in our numbers. But most importantly, I think you see it in the customer momentum and what I believe is what is customer success. Digital technology today is not about tech companies doing innovation. It is about the rest of the world doing innovation with technology, and Microsoft's uniquely in position to enable that.",257
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105222.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,11,"And on your operating margin question, Keith, there's a couple of things I would say that in this quarter in particular, the places where we had a lot of outperformance were especially high-margin areas, and I would point out 3. The first is obviously the OEM and chip supply. The improvement in that in Q3 is obviously very high margin and falls to the bottom. Japan as a geography for us is a high transactional market. And so when Japan is strong, it tends to be a very high-margin landing down to the bottom line. And the other one is the on-premises server number, which is very good, in terms of hybrid demand this quarter also is high margin. So when that happens, you do see, because it's a lot of -- almost 100% in-quarter recognition, a lot of help at the operating margin line.
Now the more sustainable conversation, I think, we continue to have on operating margin is our ability to pick the right secular markets and the right secular trends. You see significant revenue growth. We continue to focus on improving the gross margin of each individual product area, which creates leverage over time. And finally, focused investment in operating expense, and that obviously creates leverage. And I think you do see that in general through the year as we continued to keep that formula.",228

Amy, Satya. Amy, can you delve into the impact of Azure hybrid benefits on Azure revenues, server and tools, renewals? I don't think it's really well understood. Does it have any meaningful impact on Azure's reported revenue growth because of the fact that some of this is appearing in server and tools? And Satya, can you give us some added color on why this specific offering is resonating so well with customers, which is what we're hearing?",84

Maybe I can start on the second part and then leads to the first question. I would say, Mark, the main thing that this offering enables is the flexibility with which customers can adopt hybrid computing. And as I've always said that there is -- hybrid computing is important for workloads that are more in the characteristic or can be characterized as lift, shift and modernize. So that's one motion. And then there is new world hybrid as well, which is people are building. In fact, they'll do an AI training job in the cloud but want to deploy the model close to the edge. And in both of these cases, hybrid benefits, actually help with -- our business model is basically differentiated in supporting the architectural needs and the flexibility needs.
The one additional thing I'll mention, which is increasingly becoming clear to us, is operational sovereignty will become important. The world and its distributed computing needs is not going to become some homogeneous set of requirements, but it's going to be very heterogeneous, very, in many cases, regulated. And so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model, I think, shows up with the maximum flexibility.",204

In general, today, Mark, almost all of that benefit shows up in what I would say is the on-premise KPI. And so over time though, how you should think about that is it will eventually show up in Azure consumed revenue growth. This is a benefit that's fundamentally about high value and flexibility and meeting customers where they are so that they can make the determination of when to make that choice. And so it tends to be why I keep focusing people back on the all-up KPI because it's the best representation of really customer commitment and usage of our architected-from-the-beginning hybrid cloud. But to your specific question, it shows up today in the on-prem number, it's where you could see most of the strength of that value. And over time, as it gets used and consumed, it will show up more in the Azure ACR number.",173

I'm just wondering if you could frame how material the contribution of the version 2008 upgrades were. And assuming that, that lift can continue throughout calendar 2019, could it be enough to keep that on-prem KPI, as you described it, flat or even up slightly in the coming 2 quarters despite the tougher comps?",89

In -- when I think about the on-prem number, I really divide it into things that have durable value and things that I think of as more onetime. When I think about the durable trends that I expect to see, it's been the hybrid value prop that we really just talked about on Mark's last question and then the premium mix. Those 2, we have seen and continue to see. I do think we saw some benefit of end of support, but I would not say it was the primary benefit this quarter. The primary benefit was the 2 things I just talked about. In the support, obviously we've got SQL in July  and then Windows in January. And so I do think we saw some impact particularly in SQL, and I do expect we'll see some of that in Q4. But the Q4 comparable for on-prem is very big. And so even with some of that benefit of the durable trends plus, I think, a more temporal one of end of support, I do expect to see a deceleration in that number in Q4.",187

I wanted to turn to the Office 365 Commercial business a bit, and that's been a consistent, very strong performer for you and was again this quarter. But maybe just sort of 2 related questions there. First, if I heard you right, Satya, I think you said there was 180 million users now on Office 365 Commercial, which seems like you're hitting a lot of the customers that you thought might be there a couple of years ago. So I was just curious to get your view on how far along you are in that adoption cycle and if there's still a lot more opportunity in terms of seat expansion in the upcoming year. And then related, Amy, you mentioned E3 and E5 were both pretty big contributors on the ASP front in the quarter. Are we starting to see a shifting where E5 is sort of increasing in relevance and E3 has played out a bit? Or is this sort of equally balanced? I'm just curious to get sort of the mixing there as well.",177
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105232.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,21,"Sure. In terms of overall reach of Office 365, we continue to see significant opportunity going forward on multiple dimensions. So for example, we never participated as much in, I would call it, nondeveloped market medium and small businesses with all of the sophisticated workloads. So now that -- with the SaaS approach, you can reach a much broader base of business customers all over the world is one opportunity.
The second opportunity is if you look at Teams as an example, we are now reaching a lot of first-line workers. So this is whether it's in health care, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, just not knowledge workers but where you now have messaging solutions as well as business process workflows integrated. So it's that combination of things where you're going from knowledge workers to first-line, going -- and the ability to reach all sizes of businesses is what's going to continue to help us, I think, have overall feet growth or socket growth. And then of course, there is the other dimension, which is the levels of Office 365 all the way to E5 with significant value.
And the one thing I would mention is having compliance security that spans all of these tools is also proving out to be a very big architectural advantage and a customer value proposition because I think as customers look to use more SaaS applications, they don't want an exponential increase in their security exposure or more compliance burden. And so therefore, Office 365's approach resonates even there.",258
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105233.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,22,"And Jen, maybe a little to your question, which is fundamentally about seat growth and ARPU as the drivers of that all-up Office 365 Commercial growth number. This quarter and a little bit last, I actually think some of the ARPU increase has been masked by some of the trends in seat growth. What I mean by that is that 27% seat growth is starting to include some lower ARPU seats that Satya just mentioned, whether that's in academic, in edu, in frontline workers. And that's really important for us to keep having that seat growth even if it's not at the same ARPU level, those are not seats that we ever could reach before at any level, and that's absolutely a new opportunity for us. But it does tend to mask a little some of the ARPU improvement that we've seen. It's still E3 and E5. There's opportunity on both, although we are starting to see the impact of E5 in that ARPU number.",165

Do you think that you have found the right formula now for Azure to win the majority of workloads in the enterprise IT world? And then Amy, just given the trajectory and the long-term commitments that you mentioned there, do you see a path for Azure to surpass Office 365 Commercial and thus become the largest revenue stream for Microsoft, say, in the next couple, a few years?",83
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105236.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,25,"Sure. I'll start, Mark. And I mean, having grown up essentially in our infrastructure business in Microsoft, I would say that compared to even the previous eras where we did well in the client/server era in the face of tough competition and in this era again in the face of a different set of competitors, we are doing well. And we are doing well, much better than we did in the previous era because we are seeing these Tier 1 workloads, which we never saw in the past. If you think about it, in the client/server era, we never participated in the core of the digital infrastructure of the financial services or in health care or in retailer or in manufacturing. And absolutely, when we think about the digital transformational design wins, deployment, consumption, it's kind of like what we would have done with some ISVs of the past, how we worked perhaps with SAP in the '90s when we were coming out with SQL Server and they were coming out with R/3 is what we are now doing with many, many, many businesses as they build out their digital businesses. So that sort of perhaps characterizes for you what's new in terms of Microsoft's own growth in this space.",210

And really, the question is we have quite a bit of per-seat or per-user type businesses. But what Satya just talked about is really about the Azure concept of participating both in an expansionary total addressable market, which I think people have talked about for a long time. But what was different about what Satya just said is our ability frankly to have higher share in the next era than we had in the last era. And so if you look about then our ability to grow and will Azure be larger over any period of time than our per-seat or per-user businesses, it certainly could be. But I don't want that to really diminish the fact that there's a lot of room for us in our per-seat businesses, particularly in business applications across LinkedIn, the Power Platform work we're doing, Satya mentioned security, identity, compliance. There is a lot of room for us to continue to add value and growth in that area as well.",212

We continue to see this really nice progression in the commercial cloud gross margin, and you called out the Azure gross margin improvements. And within that, there's some moving pieces. I think you've got better utilization and efficiency of core Azure. You've got premium services, and then you've got this maybe counter-prevailing force of the different growth in consumption versus user base. Two questions on this, one for Satya. On the premium services, I'm just curious as to which 1 or 2 or 3 are you seeing maybe break out and become the largest or grow the fastest, which are most meaningful at this point. And then second, for Amy, as we think about this trend, are you convinced that we'll continue to see, not just for fiscal Q4 but into fiscal '20 and beyond, consistent progression and growth in the overall commercial cloud gross margin?",150
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105240.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,29,"Sure. I mean on the first question, Ross, as far as premium services, just even on the application infrastructure side, for example, in compute, there is increasing need for things like IoT services. Essentially, there is a new business application-like set of services that are getting developed to help people manage their complex IoT application development. IoT Central is a good example of that. When you have many, many connected devices, you need a control plane for many of those devices so that you can tame the complexity of your app deployments, security management. That's one example.
The other one is, of course, data. And the sophistication of the data estate is growing exponentially both in terms of the needs of the databases required, the processing that is required close to data. So that's another place where something like Cosmos DB, which is very unique in its capability of the marketplace, is definitely another service that's got real traction. Even data warehousing, the scale at which. This is another market, which we never participated in, in the past whereas now we have one of the most competitive products when it comes to benchmarking around data warehousing. So those are all things that I would say are premium services that's just talking about new applications being built on Azure not counting all of the SaaS applications about that.",227

But what you'll see is a revenue mix shift, right, that will offset that to Azure IaaS and PaaS. And so what that generally will do will be a headwind to continued gross amount of the improvement, even though you'll see individual improvement across all of the GM services. And you'll continue to see Azure increase as a percentage of the total revenue.",121

I want to follow up on Karl's question but more generally on database products. With the end of support coming for SQL Server 2008 in July, Satya, can you tell us how that's sparking conversations with customers about database offerings on Azure and moving workloads to the cloud? And Amy, can you perhaps help us contextualize the opportunity to move traditional database workloads onto Azure and what the expansion economics look like?",78
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2019",2019-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3510.0,1706405.0,67105244.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,33,"Yes. A couple of things, Brad. One is overall, the need to get on the latest and greatest database technology just because of what is the increasing need for compute and data at the edge is what's driving a lot of the conversations on SQL Server. Interestingly enough, we have a lot of requirements around edge devices even so that you can have databases with compute, so that you can really have what is needed at the edge. That's sort of one conversation.
The other one is in terms of the cloud migration, there is a variety of different use cases. We see people who are using SQL DB, which is essentially a PaaS service with complete compatibility of SQL Server. They won managed services around SQL Server, which we have. And so both of those are all happening in parallel. A good example of this is, in fact, even the rewrite of -- complete revamp, I would say, of Dynamics. Dynamics 365 and its architecture, at least in my eyes, is a thing of beauty because it's completely been rewritten for the new database technology, whether it is in the database side or on the data warehouse side, again uses a whole bunch of micro services and functions so that you can do AI close to data. That type of architectural approach is what we see is possible now for every SaaS application when they're out there as well because we think about the number of SaaS -- number of business applications that were built on SQL Server, I feel that, that's an architecture that can support both what they want to do on the edge but as well as in the cloud.",284

And so when it's annuity-based, there's really no opportunity to see it as upside in Q4 from an end-of-support frame. For the smaller portion of our business, it's still not annuity per transactional. It does provide, as I talked about earlier, some opportunity, but it's not that large just because the nature of the commitment of our customers now is far more of the annuity type.",93

I think we actually, in Q3, as I said, met sort of the unfulfilled Q2 demand and Q3. So I don't think of it as a pent-up situation heading into Q4, and our guide certainly does not indicate that, that is what we believe will happen.

It is a strong finish to a record fiscal year. We delivered more than $125 billion in revenue for the full year with double-digit top line and bottom line growth. Our commercial cloud business is the largest in the world, surpassing $38 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 63%. I'm proud of what we've accomplished over the last 12 months and I'm energized by the tremendous opportunity ahead.
Every day, we work alongside our customers to help them build their own digital capability, creating new businesses with them, innovating with them and earning their trust. This commitment to our customers' success is resulting in deeper partnerships, larger multi-year cloud agreements and growing momentum across every layer of our differentiated technology stack from application infrastructure to data and AI to business process to productivity and collaboration. 
Now I'll briefly highlight our innovation and momentum. In a world where every company is a software company, developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation across every organization. And GitHub is their home. GitHub is used by more than 36 million developers as well as the largest enterprises, including a majority of the Fortune 50. And we're investing to build the complete toolchain for developers, independent of language, framework and cloud. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are the most popular code editing tools in the world. With Azure DevOps, you can build, test and deploy code to any platform. And with Azure PlayFab, we have LiveOps, a complete backend platform to optimize engagement and interaction in real-time.
We are building Azure as the world's computer, addressing customers' real-world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. We have 54 data center regions, more than any other cloud provider, and we were the first in Middle East and in Africa. Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge, spanning identity management, security and infrastructure. This year, we introduced new cloud to the edge services and devices from Azure Data Box Edge to Azure Stack HCI to Azure Connect, bringing the full power of Azure to where data is generated. 
Azure Sphere is a first-of-a-kind edge solution to secure the more than 9 billion MCU-powered endpoints coming online each year. And now IoT plug-and-play seamlessly connects IoT devices to the cloud without having to write a single line of embedded code. Azure is the most open cloud and this quarter, we expanded our partnerships with Oracle, Red Hat and VMware to make the technologies and tools customers already have first class on Azure.
Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities across the customers' entire data estate. The variety, velocity and the volume of data is increasing, and we are bringing hyperscale capabilities to relational database services with Azure SQL database. New analytics support in Cosmos DB enables customers to build and manage analytics workloads that run real-time over globally distributed data. And we offer the most comprehensive cloud analytics from Azure Data Factory to Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Power BI.
The quintessential characteristic of any application being built in 2019 and beyond will be AI. We are democratizing AI infrastructure tools and services with Azure Cognitive Services, the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools so developers can embed the ability to see, hear, respond, translate, reason and more into their applications. And this quarter, we introduced a new speech-to-text, search, vision and decision capabilities. New updates to Azure ML streamlined the building, training and deployment of machine learning models, bringing a no-code approach to machine learning. 
Our differentiated approach from developer tools and infrastructure to data and analytics to AI is driving growth. The world's leading companies trust Azure for their mission-critical workloads, including more than 95% of the Fortune 500. And just yesterday, AT&T chose our cloud in one of the largest cloud commitments to date.
Now let's move up the stack to business process. We are redefining business processes with Dynamics 365 and Power Platform with modern, modular, extensible and AI-driven applications. Dynamics 365 uniquely enables any organization to create digital feedback loops and take data from one system and use it to optimize the outcomes of another, enabling any business to become an AI-first business. Our Open Data Initiative with SAP and Adobe builds on this promise, giving customers like Coke, HP, Unilever and Walmart a single 360-view of their customers built on one data model on one data lake, eliminating data silos and driving real-time insights at scale.
This year, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where systems of record are converted into systems of engagement and intelligence. The citizen developer movement is here and we are empowering it. 500 new -- 500 million new apps will get created in the next 5 years and more than the total created in the last 40. Businesses will need to empower domain experts with tools to create applications as well as robotic process automation to streamline and customize workflow like service monitoring and time and expense tracking.
Our Power Platform, spanning Power BI, Power Apps and Flow, is the only solution of its kind in the industry. It brings together low-code, no-code app development, robotic process automation and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive platform. Chevron has gone from 80 users of Power Apps to 5,500 in a year and now has over 200 apps in production. 
This quarter, we introduced AI Builder, adding AI capabilities like object recognition to any Power App. And with Power BI, we are the leader in business intelligence in the cloud with more than 25 million models hosted on the service and 12 million queries processed each hour. We are enabling our customers to digitize not only their business processes but to bridge the physical and digital worlds with our investments in Mixed Reality cloud. Spanning HoloLens 2, Azure Spatial Anchors and Dynamics 365 applications, we are seeing traction in every industry from manufacturing to retail to gaming. Airbus alone is pursuing more than 300 use cases from training to design to remote assistance. All this innovation is fueling rapid growth with more than 90% of the Fortune 500 using Dynamics 365 or Power Platform.
Now to LinkedIn. People are an organization's most valuable asset. Our strong talent portfolio from Talent Solutions and Talent Insights to employee engagement with Glint to LinkedIn Learning enables every organization to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs market. New capabilities help job seekers find and land more relevant and higher-paying jobs through alerts, deeper insights and the new suite of interview prep tools, contributing to another quarter of record job postings.
Marketing solutions is now our fastest-growing business with new brand and community-building tools that make it easier for marketeers to connect with LinkedIn's 645 million members. And we are enabling every business to drive a culture of relationship selling and take full advantage of their social networks with the combination of Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn Sales Navigator. All this innovation contributed to another record year for LinkedIn driven by all-time high engagements across the platform.
Now turning to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is the world's productivity cloud. It empowers everyone, including the 2 billion first-line workers around the world with an integrated, secure AI-infused experience on any device. It's the only comprehensive productivity and collaboration communication solution that integrates with an organization's critical business process workflows. 
Multinationals from L'Oréal and Walgreens Boots Alliance to the largest chemical producer in the world, BASF, all chose Microsoft 365 this year. And over the last 2 quarters, our premium offerings gained momentum with S&P Global, CenturyLink and KPMG all selecting Microsoft 365 E5. Microsoft Teams has had a breakout year. Teams now has more than 13 million daily active users and 19 million weekly active users. It brings together everything a team needs, chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of Office apps and the business process workflow into a single integrated user experience, scaffolding, eliminating the need for discrete apps that only increase an organization's security and compliance exposure. 
And we are broadening our opportunity, bringing Teams to new under-penetrated markets, including health care, hospitality and retail as well as first-line workers. We are empowering them with mobile tools in Teams like shift scheduling and priority notifications.
And we are infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to enable new automation, prediction, translation and insight capabilities. Meetings are now more inclusive in Teams. Presentations are more accessible in PowerPoint. Videos, more searchable in stream; and e-mails, more relevant in Outlook. And with Workplace Analytics and Microsoft Search, we take our relationship schedules and activities and distill insights and knowledge to help people work smarter, not longer.
We are investing in cybersecurity to protect customers in today's zero trust environment. Microsoft is the only company that offers end-to-end security, spanning identity, device endpoints, information, cloud application as well as infrastructure. It starts with Azure Active Directory and builds with 3 new services we introduced this year: Microsoft Threat Protection, Azure Sentinel and Azure Confidential Computing. We expanded our family of category-creating Surface devices this year, including the new Surface Go and Surface Hub 2S. And Windows 10 is active on more than 800 million devices with accelerating adoption in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system.
Finally, gaming. We're investing to empower the world's 2 billion gamers to play the games they want with anyone, anywhere on any device with our new game streaming service, Project xCloud, which will enter public trials this fall, Xbox Live monthly active users increased to a record 65 million with the highest number of mobile and PC users to date. We are bringing one of the world's most popular video games to a new generation of mobile gamers with Minecraft Earth and Mixed Reality. And we nearly doubled our first-party game studios this year to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing subscription services like Xbox Game Pass now available on both console and PC.
In closing, I'm optimistic of what's ahead. We are accelerating our innovation to deliver differentiated value to customers across the cloud and the edge from GitHub to Azure to Dynamics 365 to Microsoft 365 as well as Xbox Game Pass. We're investing in the right secular trends to expand our opportunity, and we are working to earn our customers' trust every day. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy who'll cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",1776

Our fourth quarter revenue was $33.7 billion, up 12% and 14% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 15% and 17% in constant currency. Operating income increased 20% and 24% in constant currency. This quarter, we transferred intangible properties from our foreign subsidiaries to the United States and Ireland which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.6 billion. When adjusting for this and the net benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the fourth quarter of FY '18, earnings per share was $1.37, increasing 21% and 24% in constant currency.
In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results, which drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes. Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to grow. In FY '19, we closed a record number of multi-million-dollar commercial cloud agreements with material growth in the number of $10 million-plus Azure agreements. 
Commercial bookings growth was significantly ahead of expectations, increasing 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, our contracted-not-recognized revenue was $91 billion, up 25% year-over-year, reflecting our continued momentum and growing long-term customer commitment.
We expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue in the next 12 months. Even with the higher mix of larger long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings, commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $34.1 billion, up 13% and 16% in constant currency. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 90%.
Commercial cloud revenue was $11 billion, growing 39% and 42% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points year-over-year to 65%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin.
The company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 2 points year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by sales mix to commercial licensing and OEM. In line with expectations, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by 1 point. Operating expenses grew slightly ahead of expectations, increasing 9% and 10% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in cloud and AI engineering, LinkedIn and GitHub. Operating margins expanded again this quarter as a result of strong revenue growth, improving gross margin and disciplined decisions we've made over the past 5 years to invest in strategic and high-growth areas.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11 billion, increasing 14% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both our cloud and on-premises businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, including roughly 4 points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition that benefited both our cloud and on-premises business. 
Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 31% and 34% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as ARPU growth from our customers' continued shift to our E3 and E5 offerings. Office 365 Commercial seats grew 23% on a prior year comparable that included the strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers. Office consumer revenue grew 6% and 8% in constant currency with 4 points of growth from transactional sales in Japan. Office 365 Consumer subscriptions grew to 34.8 million.
Our Dynamics business grew 12% and 15% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 45% and 48% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 28% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 22% with record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset increased cloud mix. Operating expenses increased 8% or 9% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 25% and 31% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.4 billion, increasing 19% and 21% in constant currency. Our on-premises server business drove our better-than-expected performance. Continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid solutions drove strong server product and cloud services revenue growth, increasing 22% and 24% in constant currency on a significant revenue base.
Azure revenue increased 64% and 68% in constant currency with another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business and continued moderation in our per-user business. And our on-premises server business grew 5% and 7% in constant currency with roughly 4 points from stronger-than-expected demand ahead of the end of support for SQL Windows Server 2008 as well as continued strength across hybrid offerings, premium version and GitHub.
Enterprise Services revenue increased 4% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 21% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was flat year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue.
Operating expenses increased 23% and 24% in constant currency driven by ongoing investments in cloud and AI engineering and GitHub as well as revenue-driven expenses given the strength of the quarter. Operating income increased 15% and 19% in constant currency.
Now to the More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $11.3 billion, increasing 4% and 6% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better-than-expected performance in Windows more than offset lower-than-expected gaming and search revenue. In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 8%, below the consumer PC market, with continued pressure in the entry level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 18%, ahead of the commercial PC market, driven by healthy Windows 10 demand, strong momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support and roughly 4 points of benefit from increased inventory levels due to uncertainty around tariffs. Therefore, inventory levels ended the quarter above the normal range.
Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 16% in constant currency with strong double-digit billings growth and a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 14% and 17% in constant currency driven by strength in our commercial segment, particularly in the U.S., Japan and Canada.
Search revenue ex TAC increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower-than-expected volume. In gaming, revenue declined 10% and 8% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower console sales and monetization across third-party titles. Xbox software and services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, with the tough comparable from a third-party title in the prior year offsetting continued momentum in Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriber growth.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points due to sales mix shift to our higher-margin Windows businesses. Operating expenses declined 2% and 1% in constant currency. As a result, operating income grew 18% and 22% in constant currency.
Now back to the total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including finance leases were up sequentially to $5.3 billion driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.1 billion. Cash flow from operations increased 41% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections and roughly 8 points benefit from tax payments made in the prior year. Free cash flow was $12 billion and increased 62% year-over-year, reflecting strong operating cash flows and timing of cash payments for PP&E.
For the fiscal year, we generated over $52 billion in operating cash flow and $38 billion in free cash flow driven by improving margins and operating leverage across our businesses as well as operating improvements to better optimize cash flow.
Other income was $191 million, higher than anticipated due to recording of mark-to-market gains. As a reminder, under the recently adopted accounting standards for financial investment, we're required to recognize unrealized gains and losses on our equity portfolio. As a result, we expect increased quarterly volatility in other income and expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 16%. And finally, this quarter, we returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 45%, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $30 billion for the full fiscal year.
Now let's move to the outlook, starting with Q1 where we expect another strong commercial quarter. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease total company, Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points and More Personal Computing revenue and total company COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. In our commercial business, we expect continued customer demand to drive commercial unearned revenue up 11% to 12% year-over-year with volatility based on contract type. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be up slightly on a sequential basis, and we expect capital expenditures to be roughly line in with Q4 as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services.
Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion driven by double-digit growth in Office Commercial, Dynamics and LinkedIn. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect the balance of strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business. Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings as well as the continued benefit from the end of support for SQL Server and Windows Server 2008.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $11 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be slightly ahead of the PC market driven by healthy commercial demand. Surface revenue will decline slightly year-over-year driven by product life cycle transition. Search ex TAC revenue growth should be roughly in line with Q4. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline year-over-year at a similar rate to Q4 as we move through the end of this console generation and a challenging Xbox software and service comparable from a third-party title in the prior year.
Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expenses should offset each other. Next, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year expected tax rate of 17% due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter.
And finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making a $4.7 billion tax payment related to TCJA transition tax and the Q4 transfer of intangible property. 
Now I'd like to share some comments on FY '20. First, FX. Assuming that current rates remain stable, we expect FX to reduce full year revenue and COGS growth by 1 point. FX should have no impact on operating expense growth. Next, revenue. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth with another year of strong performance and continued momentum in our commercial business. As a reminder, our commercial, licensing and OEM Pro businesses in the second half of the year will be impacted by a comparable that benefited from the end of support of SQL Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 as well as transactional strength in Japan.
We expect revenue in our gaming business to be down slightly year-over-year as double-digit growth in Xbox software and services will be offset by declining console sales. We do expect a stronger H2 than H1 in gaming as we work through a third-party titles comparison. And as a reminder, an increasing number of large long-term Azure contracts will drive more quarterly volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth.
Next, commercial cloud gross margin. Revenue mix will continue to shift to our Azure consumption-based services. Even with this headwind, we expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to be up slightly as we again drive meaningful improvement in Azure gross margin. Capital expenditures will increase to meet the growing demand for our cloud services. 
Finally, on operating expenses. We will continue to invest, given our strong execution, our growing competitive position and our significant ambition in high-growth areas. Investment in areas like cloud through AI and GitHub, business applications through Dynamics, Power Platform and LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security and Surface as well as gaming, should result in operating expense growth of 11% to 12%. Even with these strategic investments, the continued shift to our cloud business and our very strong finish to FY '19, we expect double-digit operating income growth as well as stable operating margins. We are looking forward to FY '20.

I wanted to focus on the Office 365. If I'm looking at this right, I think you guys saw acceleration in the Office 365 Commercial business. And the kind of recipe to get in there seemed to have changed a little bit in that it's more sort of positive pricing versus just the seat growth. Is there a changing dynamic in kind of what's pushing growth there? Because we had seen the F1 SKU and the frontline workers bringing down the price point a little bit. It looks like the pricing actually improved this quarter. How should we think about sort of the dynamics and what's going to be driving growth for Office 365 into FY '20 and beyond?",129
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3288.0,1776400.0,69531619.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,7,"Thanks, Keith. Let me walk through a little bit of this because there are some new behaviors that I think are important this quarter. But the fundamentals that you talked about are relatively unchanged. We continue to see and saw again installed base growth across all of our customer segments from the enterprise to small business. That's happening not just because of frontline workers but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base. 
We did see ARPU growth this quarter. It wasn't as much different from past quarters. We continue to see improvement from E3 and E5 transition, saw both again. And I think we were quite encouraged by E5 performance particularly in Q4 as we ended the quarter, which was great to see. What you saw a little bit, and I referred to it, was some more in-quarter recognition, but let me talk about why that's happening because it's got 2 important and positive trends that underlie it. 
The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments. When you say longer commitments under 606, you often have more recognition upfront. And so we saw longer commitments and we got a little bit more recognition in the quarter, and so you saw then revenue grow a little faster. The other thing that we saw is increasing focus. As we were having more conversations across organizations around Azure and rethinking their digital transformation plans with us, it opens up a very large conversation around the value Microsoft 365 can bring as people go through and think about those transitions. 
And so the fact that we -- then we're often seeing extensions take place of prior commitments on Office 365 to again be longer and include the Azure contracts. When that happens, it's almost like they're adding new product and new value and a lot of that gets recognized faster in-quarter when you see that happen. And so when you have a dynamic where you're seeing longer contracts plus you're able to sell more and new things and I think different conversations around Microsoft 365, it was a good execution by the team and I think a recognition of the value that we continue to put into that what we believe is our hero experience.",383

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3288.0,1776400.0,69531621.0,Question,Mark Moerdler,,Analysts,9,"And congratulations not only on the great end to the year but confidence into next quarter and next year in terms of growth, investment, et cetera. We met recently at E3 with your gaming team and heard a lot about the steps that were being taken. Satya, can you give us more color explanation on how you see the gaming business fitting into the overall company's direction over the next few years? Specifically, how does gaming change? How does the synergy between gaming and the rest of the business change? How should we think about that overall mix and that whole morph that's going to occur?",106
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3288.0,1776400.0,69531622.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,10,"Sure. First, I would say we are in gaming because of what we believe are going to be the secular changes in the gaming addressable market for us. We've always had a gaming position with console as well as the PC. But going forward, we think that any endpoint can in fact be a great endpoint for high-end games, which is where our structural position is. And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming. We have a social network in Xbox Live that is the best in the business. So I feel we are well positioned to what is going to be a much larger market than what was traditionally gaming in spite of all the success we've had over the years in gaming. 
Now the second point is that it builds on the rest of the cloud investment. So if you think about what we are doing with xCloud, it's a hero workload on top of Azure. So when we think about capital allocation, what's happening in the cloud, what's happening in the edge, how we build the network to optimize the streaming, the same infrastructure, for example, is what Sony has decided to use as well and be on Azure as well as use our AI capabilities. So you'll see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn all being the same.",246

Just thinking through with the Azure mix becoming an ever bigger portion of IC revenue and when you factor in continued gross margin expansion that you continue to show in Azure, how should we think about the gross margin potential of IC overall? And I guess I also wanted to ask about the build-out of data centers related to the cloud build-out. How do we think about your points of presence today from a coverage perspective, if you will, versus the regional -- the revenue pockets that you're targeting over the next few years?",102
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3288.0,1776400.0,69531625.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,13,"Great, Heather. Let me -- on gross margin, over any long-term period in Intelligent Cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over the long term. Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see -- expect to see very good hybrid performance and execution, which helps to offset some of that. 
So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number but of course, a lot of opportunity in terms of gross margin dollar growth and of course, operating margin dollar growth as we move forward. 
When it comes to our build-out, Heather, I tend to think it's 2 components. The majority of our capital expenditures is actually in server equipment, it's new capacity. It's not necessarily in the overall geo footprint build-out. We'll, of course, continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself. And we do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to be able to get those up and running quite quickly. But the majority of the investment today is continuing to build capacity inside existing incredibly large data centers.",220

IBM also had an announcement with AT&T. Oracle has been a long-time partner with AT&T in the cloud as well. I don't want to dwell on AT&T in particular, but I do think it's interesting that a few different large-scale cloud players are around the table there. So as you see more of these very large deals out there, and Amy mentioned the increase in $10 million deals, how often are those multi-cloud deals and companies taking that sort of approach versus ones that are committing to Microsoft? And how do you navigate that landscape?",109

I mean I think overall, you all, I think, do a good job of tracking what is the public cloud competition and that's the competition we pay most attention to. And in this context, I think we see a mix. There are a few of us who are at scale in public cloud, who are very competitive. And anybody who decides to be multi-cloud, public cloud, those are the winners. When someone thinks of only using one cloud, we are definitely one of the names. And in the case of AT&T, we were the only public cloud in there. And so that's why we highlighted -- they highlighted us and we highlighted that in our quarterly announcement.",118

And so Jennifer, listen, I kind of think about this as we have incredibly strong footprint inside existing enterprises today. That footprint, and you could see it in our results, customers are relying on us for not only that footprint but as they continue to expand, they sit under of a Tier 1 opportunity we haven't seen before. And so we, of course, see multi-cloud in a lot of our larger accounts, but this type of significant commitment is an opportunity, I think, you all continue to see us execute well on.",124

A couple of the metrics, 18% Windows OEM Pro and 16% on the volume licensing side were extraordinary. I know you called out a couple of, call it, one-time issues around inventory levels and an uptick in in-quarter revs. But I wanted to ask you 2 questions. How much of a tail do you think we have left on the Win 7 to Win 10 migration? Is it too cautious to say that there's really just 2 quarters of that tailwind left? And secondly, on the volume licensing or commercial and cloud services segment, do you think that can, in fiscal '20, contribute to your overall double-digit growth?",117
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3288.0,1776400.0,69531632.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,20,"Thanks, Karl. I don't actually combine these because really, there's a fundamental driver that sits underneath this and then we can get to the specifics of end of support. There is, I think, a recognized momentum with Windows 10, its deployment inside of enterprises for its security and management value prop. 
We've worked hard and I think Satya mentioned some of the new features as we continue to invest in security for all of our products, one of the places I think that often resonates the most is Windows 10 and inside that value. 
The OEM Pro number, as I talked about, was impacted by a number of factors. But what we've seen is over the past 3 or 4 quarters, pretty consistent sort of high single-digit performance once you take out various impacts from chip supply and inventory levels on the tariffs. That performance certainly has some end-of-support impact to it as we talked about before. I think in general, what we've seen in prior releases is it does extend a bit past the deadline, especially in our small and midsize business customers. And it's really important for us to continue to work hard to have the small and medium businesses find a path forward to make sure they can experience the most secure computing environment we have. 
And so we'll see some extensions pass the line, we certainly have seen 3 or 4 quarters of that and we certainly expect H1 to remain strong. The more important part around the security and management value prop is in fact I'm going to pivot back again a little bit because it's the same thing we saw in Office. The Microsoft 365 value prop to customers, especially in the second half of the year and particularly in Q4, has 3 components. It has Office 365, it has EMS and it has this Windows 10 commercial component. 
The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success in our motions, in overall being able to sell the Microsoft 365 value prop. It was a good quarter for that. We've seen consistent double-digit billings in this segment and it speaks to that. I expect that to continue. Although you'll have volatility because what's interesting about that specific metric is it has a little bit more 606 impact than we've felt, it's an on-prem product. And so there will be volatility in this number but the consistent theme of seeing double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think and I do expect to continue.",426

I just want to focus in on M 365 particularly, Satya, your comments on Microsoft Teams. Really kind of 2 components to this question. How do you think about the sort of why customers are adopting Teams, especially the larger ones you highlighted at the Ignite Conference? Is it the fact that it's a single app with those combined features you talked about? Or is it the broader, call it, Office experience? And then I guess a question for Amy off that, when you think about sort of the relevance of Teams on a going-forward basis to keep the migration up, E1, E3, E5 and then plus those add-ons that are associated with Teams like calling, et cetera, how critical is Teams to the long-term, call it, like price migration here at Office and M 365?",146
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3288.0,1776400.0,69531635.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,23,"Yes. So overall, I think, first, there's no question this last fiscal year has been an absolute breakout year for Teams in terms of both the product innovation and most importantly at-scale deployment and usage that we're seeing. And I think in fact, unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. Office has obviously had very, very successful individual products that have been deployed broadly. But each of them was a singular tool. Perhaps SharePoint was the last time we had a platform effect of this kind. 
But Teams is -- transcends all that. It's the communications tool, it's the collaboration tool. It's the line of business tool for meetings as well as business process. And so the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first-line. 
The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. Even our licenses to the non-knowledge workers were just mostly licenses of the tools we built for knowledge workers whereas now we actually have specific value which is in fact very valuable to those first-line workers. And the thing that we realized is the businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first-line worker productivity. 
So we are in the very early innings of it but we're pretty excited. The one other benefit, to sort of tease off of some of the comments Amy was making, is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale. And Teams in some sense helps them a lot because it builds on all the rest of the investment they have made already in Office 365. And so we see that benefit even on that front.",317
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2019",2019-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3288.0,1776400.0,69531636.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,24,"And I think it's an important component of our M 365 value, but it's really not outsized. I mean we have all these components of value. That's really been the secret of what customers look and see. They see Teams that can not only change what Satya talked about but also it's about culture change in terms of employees being able to be involved and collaborate regardless of the org chart. And that is what you're going to see. When you have 500 million new applications built in the next 5 years, you're going to see, and I believe, Teams to be one of the major interfaces through which that experience and business process reinvention will happen. 
Teams really span multiple categories. So I wouldn't think of it just as productivity or even just collab or meetings. That is an interface. As you see business process reinvention occur, I do think of this is the surface through which many people will experience it. And so I would ask you to expand your thinking on this one. It's not just Office or needed to be in Office. It's really about having employees fundamentally experience Microsoft in a different way day to day.",202

I'm wondering as we consider this robust 25% growth in your commercial bookings this quarter, roughly how many points are coming from that -- from any tailwind of the longer-duration types of contracts? And then Satya, I wanted to ask you regarding the recent partnership with AT&T. Some media reports said it was worth over $2 billion. Wondering if there's some hyperbole there in the media. Or is this an example of how Microsoft can play in every line of a company's OpEx budgets today?",94

There's a motion around renewals and there's a motion around new. Both were very good this quarter and it wasn't while certainly long-term Azure contracts had a meaningful component of the new, they weren't alone in being the only component of the new. And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution not just on renewals in-quarter but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we had seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction. So while the long-term large contracts will add volatility to that number, if you look at our -- seen our balance of $91 billion and see that, that also grew 25% year-over-year, you'll get a sense that it certainly wasn't alone in its impact for the year.",186

I wanted to zone in on Dynamics. There, you obviously like you're playing in applications and we've seen other vendors kind of do SaaS applications. If you look at Dynamics online, you now, on my math, kind of around $2 billion, still growing at a clip that organically not many others have achieved. It's now bigger than your on-premise business. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? And is there -- what are the ways to kind of -- how did you achieve that growth at this scale? And what are the drivers going forward?",104

We are very, very excited about the progress again in the last fiscal year around Dynamics 365. Both the traditional business process applications themselves have become much more modular and much more modern. And we have a very disruptive business model as well that goes with it. And so therefore, we're becoming much more competitive with the large customers deploying, whether it's sales or operations. 
The other exciting thing is we have this entire new class of applications and I talked about this even in this week's conference, which is these AI-first modules, whether it's for sales, for marketing, for customer service or this customer 360. And these are modules that there isn't an installed base of those anywhere nor competition even exists. So in other words, we can, in fact, have these modules get deployed in commercial customers even on top of existing business applications. And so we feel that we have plenty of opportunity ahead. Again, this is a place where we are a very low-share player. And so the fact that we have become a very competitive supplier of this technology at a time where the world needs more business process automation, we feel good about the opportunity ahead.",203

What we said for FY '20 and particularly in Q1 is we expect to be up sequentially in Q1.

We're off to a strong start in fiscal 2020, delivering $33 billion in revenue this quarter. Our commercial cloud business continues to grow at scale as we work alongside the world's leading companies to help them build their own digital capability. Microsoft provides a differentiated technology stack spanning application infrastructure, data and AI, developer tools and services, security and compliance, business process, productivity and collaboration. For each of these areas -- first, each of these areas represents secular long-term growth opportunity. Second, we are delivering best-in-class innovation and openness in each layer. And third, we offer unparalleled integration and architectural coherence across the entire stack to meet the real-world needs of our customers.
Now I'll briefly highlight how we are accelerating our progress and innovation starting with Azure. Organizations today need a distributed computing fabric to meet their real-world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. This quarter, we opened a new -- new data center regions in Germany and Switzerland. And in India, we are bringing the power of Microsoft Cloud to millions of small businesses through our partnership with Jio, one of the largest mobile carriers in the country.
Every Fortune 500 customer today is on a cloud migration journey, and we are making it faster and easier. Just this week, we announced an extensive go-to-market partnership with SAP, making Azure the preferred destination for every SAP customer. And our partnerships with VMware and Oracle also bring these ecosystems to our cloud. 
We're extending beyond the cloud to the edge, enabling customers to get real-time insights where data is generated while ensuring security and privacy. And we are seeing traction in every industry, from Azure Sphere securely connecting Starbucks coffee machines to Azure Stack enabling scenarios from smart factories and modern compliant banking to mobile health care in remote areas.
We're reimagining customers' data estates for the cloud era with new limitless capabilities. Azure SQL Database brings hyperscale capabilities to relational databases and Azure Cosmos DB, the low-latency, high-availability database for globally distributed applications of any data type.
The quintessential characteristic of every application going forward will be AI, and we have the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, infrastructure and services. Azure AI now has more than 20,000 customers, and more than 85% of the Fortune 100 companies are using Azure AI in the last 12 months.
In health care, Novartis chose Azure AI to transform how medicines are discovered, developed and commercialized. Nuance will rely on our cloud to power the patient exam room of the future where clinical documentation writes itself, and Humana is using Azure AI to build personalized health care solutions for its more than 10 million members. 
We're also pushing the bounds of how computers and AI can generalize learning beyond narrow domains, collaborating with open AI on a supercomputing platform to train and run AI models. I'm excited about our partnership and our collective pursuit to democratize AI and its benefits for everyone.
Now to developer tools. The rise of digital IP creation in every organization means developers will increasingly drive and influence every business process and function, and GitHub is where they go to learn, share and collaborate. GitHub has grown to more than 40 million developers, up more than 30% since our acquisition a year ago, and more than 2 million organizations use GitHub, including the majority of the Fortune 50. At Ford Motor Company alone, 8,000 employees use GitHub to innovate and collaborate with the vast ecosystem of third-party software developers. Our acquisition of Symantec code analysis engine family this quarter strengthens our security capabilities, enabling developers to more easily find vulnerabilities in large open source code bases. 
Now let's turn to our workflow cloud, Power Platform. Automating workflows across every function will be key to productivity gains for every organization. We are building Power Platform as the extensibility framework for both Microsoft 365 inclusive of Microsoft Teams as well as Dynamics 365. It brings together low code, no code app development; robotic process automation; and self-service analytics, enabling everyone in an organization to build an intelligent app or workflow where none exist. Power Platform already has more than 2.5 million monthly active seasoned developers. Power Apps helps domain experts, those closest to the business problem, to design, build and publish custom apps fast, and 84% of the Fortune 500 have already created Power applications.
Now let's talk about security. Rising cyber threats and increasing regulation means security and compliance on a strategic priority for every organization. We have a comprehensive offering across identity, security and compliance spanning people, devices, apps, developer tools, data and infrastructure to protect customers in today's zero-trust environment. It starts with Azure active directory premium used by more than 100,000 organizations for identity, access management and SaaS application security across heterogeneous environments. It builds with information protection and cloud security with Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection and now with risk-based vulnerability management. And it extends to Azure Sentinel, now broadly available. Sentinel is a cloud-first service that analyzes security signal at massive scale across the entire organization using AI to detect, investigate and automatically remediate threats. We'll share more about our expanding opportunity in security at our Ignite conference in the next few weeks.
Now onto business applications. Dynamics 365 is the only AI-powered business cloud that gives customers a 360-degree view of their business from marketing and sales to finance and operations to unify data and unlock insights. It enables every level of organization to move from reactive silo transactional processes to proactive, repeatable and predictable business outcomes.
This quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 Commerce, a new omni-channel solution to unify back-office, in-store and digital experiences and deliver personalized content wherever shoppers are. Dynamics 365 AI insights app ingest data from any first-party or third-party source, freeing data from systems of record to power modern systems of engagement and intelligence. New Dynamics 365 Product Insights provides organizations like Ecolab real-time view of how customers are using their products to maximize customer lifetime value. And Dynamics 365 Connected Store helps retailers select Marks & Spencer analyze observational data to optimize in-store shopping experience.
We're enabling our customers to bridge the physical and digital business processes with our mixed reality cloud, spanning HoloLens 2, Azure mixed reality services and Dynamics 365 applications. Pharmaceutical company, Patheon, for example, is using Dynamics 365 Guides along with HoloLens 2 to reimagine training for its employees.
Now to LinkedIn. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter across the platform. Marketing solutions remains our fastest-growing segment, up 44% year-over-year as marketeers leverage our community-based tools to connect with LinkedIn's nearly 660 million members. We continue to innovate across our talent portfolio, including Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, Glint, LinkedIn Learning, to help every organization attract, retain and develop best talent. LinkedIn skills assessment is a new way for members to showcase their proficiencies and become more discoverable to recruiters.
Now turning to Microsoft 365 and Surface. Earlier this month, we unveiled our broadest Surface line up to date, including 2 new dual-screen devices coming next year. We are reimagining every layer with how we infuse AI from silicon up to device form factors and the role of operating systems to help people be more productive and creative in a multi-sense, multi-device world. We will continue to invest across form and function to new create categories that benefit our entire OEM ecosystem. And our expanded partnership with Samsung builds on our promise to help people be more productive on any device anywhere, bringing OneDrive, Outlook and Your Phone and more to new Samsung devices.
Microsoft 365 is the world's productivity cloud and the only comprehensive solution that empowers everyone from the C suite to first-line workers with an integrated secure work -- secure experience on any device.

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3232.0,1840429.0,72038291.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $33.1 billion, up 14% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 20% in constant currency. Operating income increased 27% and 32% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $1.38, increasing 21% and 25% in constant currency. Consistent execution and strong demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove a solid start to the fiscal year with another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth.
From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strengths across all markets. In our commercial business, we again saw increased customer commitment across our cloud platform. In Azure, we had material growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts. Additionally, Microsoft 365 drove new customer adoption as well as expansion in our existing customer base given the strong value Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility and Security provide as a secure intelligent solution. As a result, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 30% and 35% in constant currency with a higher volume of new business and strong renewal execution.
Commercial annuity mix increased to 91%, and commercial unearned revenue was ahead of expectations at $31.1 billion, up 14% and 16% in constant currency. Our commercial remaining performance obligation was $86 billion, up 26% and 27% in constant currency driven by these long-term customer commitments. As a reminder, going forward, we will disclose the commercial remaining performance obligation as a KPI, which better reflects commitments our customers are making across all contract types.
Commercial cloud revenue was $11.6 billion, growing 36% and 39% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points year-over-year to 66%, a significant improvement in Azure gross margin, offset a sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 3 points year-over-year and ahead of our expectations driven by sales mix to higher-margin businesses.
The U.S. dollar was a bit weaker than anticipated, which resulted in slightly less impact to our results. FX reduced revenue growth by less than 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. Operating expenses grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, slightly lower than expectations, mainly driven by the timing of marketing and project spend. And operating margins expanded this quarter driven by the combination of higher gross margins and operating leverage through effective resource allocation.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.1 billion, increasing 13% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by our on-premises Office Commercial business. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency and benefited approximately 2 points from the transactional strength in Japan. Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 25% and 28% in constant currency was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. Office 365 Commercial seats increased 21% with a growing mix from our Microsoft 365 suite.
Office Consumer revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan, more than offsetting the strong prior year comparable related to the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 35.6 million.
Dynamics revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 41% and 44% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 26% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions increased 22% as engagement again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset an increase in cloud revenue mix.
Operating expenses increased 8% and 9% in constant currency driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 23% and 27% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $10.8 billion, increasing 27% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by our on-premises server business. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 33% in constant currency driven by continued demand from our hybrid value. Azure revenue increased 59% and 63% in constant currency with strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments partially offset by further moderation in our per user business.
Our enterprise mobility installed base grew 36% to over 120 million seats, benefiting from the Microsoft 365 suite momentum. And our on-premises server business grew 12% and 14% in constant currency driven by continued strength across our hybrid and premium offerings, GitHub, and roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for SQL and Windows Server 2008.
Enterprise services revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency driven by growth in premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 30% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was up slightly as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin was partially offset by a growing mix if Azure, IaaS and PaaS revenue.
Operating expenses increased 22% driven by ongoing engineering and sales investments in cloud and AI, including GitHub. Operating income grew 33% and 38% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11.1 billion, increasing 4% and 5% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better-than-expected performance in our OEM Pro and Windows Commercial businesses more than offset lower-than-expected monetization across third-party titles within gaming.
In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 7%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry-level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 19%, ahead of the commercial PC market driven by strong Windows 10 demand and momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range.
Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 26% and 29% in constant currency driven by healthy demand for Microsoft 365, which carries higher in-quarter revenue recognition.
Surface revenue declined 4% and 2% in constant currency driven by the timing of product life cycle transitions ahead of the recently announced product launches. Search revenue ex TAC increased 11% and 13% in constant currency driven by Bing rate growth. 
In gaming, revenue declined 7% and 6% in constant currency driven by lower console sales. Xbox content and services revenue was relatively unchanged and increased 1% in constant currency with growth from Minecraft, Gears of War 5 and Game Pass subscriptions offset by a strong third-party title in the prior year.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 4 points due to higher-margin sales mix. Operating expenses declined 7% and 6% in constant currency as redeployment of engineering resources to higher-growth opportunities was partially offset by investments in gaming. As a result, operating income grew 28% and 31% in constant currency.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $4.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year driven by ongoing investment to meet growing demand for our cloud services and slightly below expectations due to normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.4 billion.
Cash flow from operations was $13.8 billion and increased 1% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by tax payments related to the Q4 transfer of intangible property. Free cash flow was $10.4 billion and increased 4%. Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 27% and 39%, respectively.
As expected, in other income and expense, interest income was offset by interest expense, foreign currency remeasurement and recognized losses on investments. Our effective tax rate was 16%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 28% year-over-year.
Now let's move to our outlook. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points; total company, Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing revenue growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on total company COGS and operating expenses growth. We expect another strong quarter in our commercial business. Demand for our hybrid offerings and cloud services remain strong, and capital expenditures will continue to reflect that.
Given the normal variability and infrastructure spend timing, we expect Q2 CapEx spend to be down slightly on a sequential basis but still growing from the prior year. And commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to improve on a year-over-year basis even with the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services.
Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion driven by double-digit growth across Office Commercial, Dynamics and LinkedIn. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $11.25 billion and $11.45 billion. In Azure, we expect continued strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per user business given the size of the installed base.
Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid and premium solutions as well as the continued benefit from increased demand ahead of the end of support for Windows Server 2008. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.6 billion and $13 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should again be ahead of the PC market as we balance healthy Windows 10 demand and the benefit from the upcoming end of support for Windows 7 with the supply chain's ability to meet this demand in Q2. Based on our customer demand signal and prior end-of-support cycles, we expect some continued momentum past January, end-of-support deadline. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, we expect another strong quarter, benefiting from continued Microsoft 365 momentum.
In Surface, the launch of the latest Surface Pro and Surface laptop devices should drive low double-digit revenue growth on a strong prior year comparable. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q1. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20% range driven by lower console sales as we near the end of this generation as well as the most challenging quarterly comparable and third-party titles from last year.
Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion and operating expenses of $10.8 billion to $10.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest and finance lease expense. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full year rate of 17%.
Now let me share some additional comments on the full year. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth driven by continued momentum in our commercial business. Given our strong first quarter results and the expected sales mix for the remainder of the year, we now expect operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year even as we continue to invest with significant ambition in high-growth areas.
With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.",1852

I was hoping to dig in a little bit into the Intelligent Cloud business and what you guys are seeing there from a hybrid perspective. So maybe one question for Satya and one for Amy. For Satya, can you talk to us a little bit about sort of how these hybrid engagements are kind of rolling out with the largest customers, how they're contracting from it? And any sense you can give us in terms of in what way do they engage both kind of the on-premise assets as well as the cloud assets? Because I think that's part of the equation that's really positively surprising a lot of investors in how well server and tools is doing. And maybe for Amy, you could help us understand, sort of when we look at server and tools up 14% in constant currency, which is well ahead of our expectations, how should we think about the durability of that in terms of what comes from sort of the pull forward of demand ahead of some -- like SQL Server and Windows Server expirations and what is going to be more durable over time on the back of those pull forwards.",201

Thanks for the question. Overall, our approach has always been about this distributed computing fabric or thinking about hybrid as not as some transitory phase but as a long-term vision for how computing will meet the real-world needs because if you think about the long term, compute will migrate to wherever data is getting generated. And increasingly, there'll be data generated in the real world where just -- when you think about the cloud, you have to think about the edge of the cloud as a very first-class construct. And so in that context, the -- what we see is a couple of things that you see even in the results today. One is the hybrid benefit that is increasingly what is getting customers excited about the Azure choice and the fact that they can renew knowing that they have the flexibility of both the cloud and the edge. That's definitely driving growth.
Second is we're also gaining share. When you think about what's happening even in the edge, some of the -- our data center edition products are very competitive in the marketplace. And so you see both of those effects. But architecturally, we feel well placed. In fact, at our Ignite Conference, you'll see us even take the next leap forward even in terms of how we think about the architecture inclusive of the application models, programming models on what distributed computing looks like going forward. So we feel well positioned there.",246

And so -- but for us, if you step back for a second, the durable trends that Satya just talked about, which is making sure we license in a way that respects this long-term reality of where data and compute will be needed is what we call the hybrid value proposition. And the rights to that, of course, are inherent in how we report this number. And so for us, what you'll see is premium strength, which we saw this quarter in both SQL and Windows because of some of the value proposition of hybrid and of course, broad strength as well when people feel that flexibility to not be constrained by licensing in terms of how they view their estate.",155

I was just wondering, you've been saying for a while now that you're seeing material improvements in Azure gross margins and that's obviously hugely benefited commercial cloud gross margin. I'm just wondering if you could share with us how much of the improvement is related to the need to maybe expand data centers at a lower clip than you have been. Maybe it's less depreciation and amortization that's coming -- that you're starting to recognize. How much of it is due to just better capacity utilization then? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much longer you're going to be able to say that for I guess. And just have you guys been ratcheting up your target gross margins for Azure over the years to where you think they could be as you look ahead?",143
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3232.0,1840429.0,72038299.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,11,"Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying, in general, at the commercial cloud gross margin, what you're seeing is revenue growth that, for the past almost 2 years, has vastly been faster than our capital expenditure growth. So if you start at the top of the frame, what we're seeing is overall gross margin improvement across portfolio and improving -- and that comes from a couple of things, which is where you're getting to on Azure. It comes from structural improvement on sort of cost per unit, but it also comes from mix shift of revenue to premium services, from being able to sell more SaaS-like services and consumption services or even premium data services that really do have both more margin but also are quite consistent in terms of their growth. And you see then that represented as improving targets for us.
But I would say in general, Heather, what the team has done is actually delivered on what I think we felt was a 5-year road map of improving gross margins on a material basis. Now as you continue to see the mix shift to the consumption-based Azure services, the overall cloud gross margin will improve at the same rate. And we've said that, and you'll continue to see that on a go-forward basis as well. But we do continue to expect Azure, especially on the consumption side gross margins, to improve. And they still have room to improve, especially as we start to see some of these premium services both being made available and being utilized at higher rates.",262

When I look at your next quarter guidance by revenue segment, it seems to equate to an overall revenue growth rate assuming the midpoint of about 9% to 10%. So when I combine that with the 14% growth you just put up in Q1, it implies that, in the second half, overall Microsoft revenue growth should remain roughly in the 10% zip code to enable you to get to double-digit growth for the full year despite the fact that you're moving past some fairly key end-of-support milestones. I think some of us were expecting a little bit more of a first half, second half delta. So I just wanted to ask you what are the maybe 1 or 2 or 3 drivers that enable you to sustain that growth rate in the second half and if it's fair to assume that your guidance doesn't really reflect any deterioration in the overall spending environment.",157
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3232.0,1840429.0,72038302.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,14,"Yes. I think in general, Karl, a couple of things I would point to or many of the things I talked about in the comments that we prepared, overall, Q1 was a very strong start commercially from a bookings perspective with some very strong trends across the board. Whether it is in both the absolute size and number of the Azure commitments that we're seeing, the consistency we're seeing in the consumption growth rates of Azure, the commitments we're seeing to Microsoft 365, some of the signs we're seeing across our Dynamics, the Power Platform, the workflow cloud that Satya referred to and LinkedIn, it's a good bookings quarter, a good execution quarter on overall contracting value. Renewals were good, recapture rates were good, and new business was good.
So with that confidence, some of those same trends that we had talked about, of course, show up through the year. And we've tried to be consistent in that while end of support will make for points here and there each quarter, the more sustainable trends are the fact that our commercial cloud overall offers significant value and differentiation to customers and are making longer-term commitments and we continue to grow ARPU. So when I think about sort of some of the seasonality that you're talking about, Q2, I felt we were -- I wanted to be clear that that's really a gaming challenge in Q2, and you see that reflected in the margins in Q2 being significantly better than they were last Q2. And if you think about H2, I do expect Surface will have some easier comparables in H2 and a new portfolio to grow from. So I think that's another change you'll see in trajectory in H2 as well.",291

AI is obviously a large focus. It was a large driver of Intelligent Cloud OpEx spending growth this quarter. Satya, can you give us some more color on where you see Microsoft on the AI journey?

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 23, 2019",2019-10-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3232.0,1840429.0,72038305.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,17,"Thanks, Mark. It's a great question because we look at what's happening with AI having 2 dimensions to it. One is I would say just our own use of AI as first-party SaaS applications. There's some phenomenal breakthroughs. When you see new transcription features or new computer vision features that come with HoloLens, all of these are being driven by new AI capabilities. They're all, by the way, powered by the same cloud infrastructure. We all build everything at Microsoft with first party equals third party with Azure as the core platform. So what you see us is, in fact, using our own SaaS applications and consumer innovation even to drive the high-end AI capability but then bring the best-in-class tooling for enterprise customers. So for example, like we have innovated even in what does DevOps look like for the machine learning age. That's a unique capability that's there in Azure ML. And those are the types of innovations that are even driving the projects that enterprise customers have on Azure. So you'll see us leverage our overall spend, whether it's CapEx or OpEx across all of what Microsoft does and then surface them in, I think, what is perhaps the best way to get traction in the enterprise market, which is great tooling, compliance, security. And that's a place where we are making good progress.",226

What I think you heard through Satya's commentary is actually AI woven through every layer and component of the entire tech stack and how important that is, whether you're participating at the Dynamics 365 layer with insights or whether you're using components like some of our customers are maybe for a natural interaction work. And so for me, it is almost fundamental to see that cost and investment because you'll see it in margin and usage and frankly, product differentiation that we can provide versus our competitors.",113

What I would say is, for us, it has been so important to remain focused on where growth and opportunity exist and to invest in those areas that are large, expansive and durable TAMs. And I think when you think about where we've spent our time, both building products, investing in marketing, investing in sales capability and technical capability, it has been in many, if not all, of those places. So when I look and say where is our execution or how do I think about our ability to execute in a macro environment, for me, it is about investing in the right places, executing in a great way, remaining focused on the transition our customers need us to help them through to create their own opportunity and their own growth. And I think we've done a nice job of being invested in the right places. Satya mentioned a few of them on the call, but there are really many. If you think about security, compliance, communication, workflow, business process reinvention, the list can go on and on where I feel like we have set up a multiyear journey to be well positioned. And I tend to think of every quarter, every year as an opportunity to continue to differentiate, invest in innovation and execute well to take share.

When it comes to security, compliance, we never participated in this. Guess what? We get to participate in a fairly competitive way now. We have built for something that didn't even exist a few years ago, which is the workflow cloud. That's a huge opportunity for us. Biz apps, we are a very competitive and growing footprint. Even when we think about something like Microsoft 365, we never participated in spite of our past success with all the first-line work, and now we get to participate in it. So I see long-term secular growth opportunities, and we want to stay focused on making sure our innovation is competitive in all those layers we talked about.",163

Satya, I want to focus on the strategic announcements you talked about earlier in the call, Oracle, VMware and obviously, the most recent one with SAP. Wondering if you would just walk us through the sort of the strategic thoughts behind these. And then also especially with VMware and Oracle since those have been out there obviously longer, what's the feedback from customers been? And then I guess to Amy, how do you think about sort of these big strategic [ offices ] this year actually showing up in the numbers?",97

Thanks. So overall, I think this is again one of those things where, in the past, we participated in the infrastructure business, but we had a fairly narrow footprint, which is we had our own infrastructure that supported primarily our databases and our operating systems. Whereas with the migration to the cloud, customers are looking for us to be a provider of all their infrastructure needs, which is heterogeneous. And that's what has really led us at the infrastructure layer to have partnerships with VMware and Oracle. We, as you know, have first-class support for Windows and Linux, Java and .NET, Postgres and SQL, VMware, Red Hat as well as obviously Windows hypervisor.
So we -- I feel that we now have that ability to be able to take the entire infrastructure estate, the entire data estate and really add value with these partnerships. And SAP represents the same because SAP has got both infrastructure. We now are the preferred cloud, so I think it's a fairly no-brainer for any customer who's an SAP customer who wants to accelerate their migration to the cloud and innovation from SAP and us that they should move to Azure, and that's what this announcement was all about. And so we're really looking forward to essentially executing on that strategy and that customer need that we see very clearly.",227

But at the heart of this is making it easier, faster and more reliable for us to help customers move their estate to the cloud and to migrate that with confidence. And so when we do that, it's about becoming a committed partner. And you actually see that in broader Microsoft Cloud results, whether that's helping even through these partnerships to be able and get closer to Tier 1 workloads, business process changes. And so I actually think these are quite important for us to continue to make sure the first goal is customer centric, which is why we continue to move in this direction.",138

As I sort of parse through the Dynamics within Office 365 and through the discussion around sustainability of double-digit growth within the commercial segment, we've seen seat count decelerate. Also, the uplift on pricing maybe isn't as much this quarter as we saw in the past, which leads me to believe that you are seeing a lot of success in the front-line worker piece and maybe that's a bigger driver of the seat count from here. But can you just -- and at the same time, you're seeing strong uptake of the premium SKUs as well. But as we think about seat count going forward, how much opportunity is there still left on the migration front of commercial licenses versus leaning a bit more on things like front-line worker to sustain outgrowth? And is there a point where potentially the seat growth and things like frontline could start to eat further into your ability to continue to lift ARPU on the base you already have?",173

Let me break this question apart because you're actually asking important dynamics that I don't always think of as trade-off, and so I want to make that more clear in my answer. First, to your question on seat growth, we have room even beyond just first-line workers. Whether that is our ability in small- and mid-sized businesses, on a global basis with mobile-first workers, this is a very broad opportunity for us to reach people trying to accomplish tasks and do their work on devices of any size. And so there is significant room for us to continue to make progress on that front.
Now could that end up with some ARPU pressure long term? It certainly could, but the important -- for me, I don't think of that as being necessarily a negative. We used to really make no money through these seats that we just talked about. And so every dollar or multiple dollars or many dollars earned on those new seats is all new revenue, new opportunity and new socket for us. Let me separate that from the next dynamic, which is why sort of an average number may not be the best indication, which is our ability to continue to move people to higher-value SKUs, whether that's through the addition of really compelling things in security or compliance or communications or collaboration or knowledge or learning, where we can add value. Whether we call that E5 or E3, we have room in that transition as well and new opportunity in a way that I'm not sure I've seen us. I feel very optimistic about M365 -- I'm sorry, Microsoft 365 and our ability to continue to add value. So hopefully that helps, Jen.",289

If I look at the SAP announcements, but you had some other industry announcements out there as well like Humana, et cetera, like how do I have to think about the progress you guys are making here in terms of getting more into the different industries and to kind of create deeper relationships around Azure rather than just doing kind of simple infrastructure outsourcing?",68

It's a very deliberate strategy that we have. In meeting our customers' needs, we need to have the partners they already work with and want to work with also on our platform. So it starts sometimes with the customers, whether it's Humana or Walgreens or Walmart and others. It also starts with partners like Nuance, which is another one that we announced recently. And so the idea is for us to be really ensuring that by every industry we have the right marquee customers as well as the partners and have strong go to markets.
One of the things that everyone, I think, in the marketplace understands is Microsoft, especially from a partner perspective, is a great route to market. We have a platform directly with our sales force as well as our channel that is very attractive to third-party developers to get on Azure and they've realized those benefits. And in fact, our customers rely on that also as a benefit because it helps them get the best value from their partners as well.",176
