These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",467
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3677.0,3007395.0,109920348.0,Presenter Speech,Satya Nadella,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We have moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. 
Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress, starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open source models, including both LLMs and SLMs all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data and tools on Azure. We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers. Over 1/3 are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs from our partners like Cohere, Meta and Mistral on Azure without having to manage underlying infrastructure. 
We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Anchor, Ashley, AT&T, EY and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM, Phi, for their applications. And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter, we added support for OpenAI's latest models, including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Poplexity, Symphony AI as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today, including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola and Rockwell Automation. 
For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how its millions of customers shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migration. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide. 
Now on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale, powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubushi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB, including its built-in native vector search capabilities, along with Azure OpenAI Service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year. 
And for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI Search offers the best hybrid search solution. OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT. And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Millman and PwC go from data to insights to action all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multicloud data lake, OneLake, increased 46% quarter-over-quarter. 
Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all our platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter. And more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot Business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will roll out GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year. 
And we're going further, making Copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features as well as Copilot Enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code, no-code development, helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data and now build custom Copilots. More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter. And with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom Copilots. It has already been used by over 10,000 organizations, including An Post, Holland America, PG&E. In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital build Copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. 
We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance and supply chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales, our Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations, including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric, to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. 
And with our new Copilot for Service, employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we are tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 health care systems, including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. 
Now on to future of work. A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks. And overall, early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer all deployed Copilot to their employees. And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We are also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural and Trello as well as customers like Air India, Bayer and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities. 
When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration, chat, meetings and calling on 1 platform. And Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than 2/3 of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms, or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats, and organizations like BP, Elenco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. 
Now on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster, from searching for answers and summarizing e-mails to optimizing performance in battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs. And with our new Copilot Key, the first significant change to the Windows Keyboard in 30 years, providing one-click access. 
We also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year. And all up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2x year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. 
Now on to security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems we reported 1.5 weeks ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall, we announced a set of engineering priorities under our Secure Future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a zero-trust security architecture. 
Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR, Microsoft Defender and Copilot for Security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. And with Copilot for Security, we are now helping hundreds of early access customers, including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel significantly increase their SecOp team's productivity. This quarter, we extended Copilot to Entra, InTune and Purview. All up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use 4 or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, J.B. Hunt and The Mosaic Company. 
Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year. Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with posts. 
New AI features, including more personalized in-mails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform, and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter. And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum. Earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both Bing and Edge took share this quarter. 
We also introduced Copilot as a stand-alone destination across all browsers and devices as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just 2 weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers. 
Now on to gaming. This quarter, we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King. With our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love, where and when and how they want. Our stream increased 44% year-over-year. 
Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our lineup of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox, PC and Game Pass, including Indiana Jones. And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.",2056

This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusting for the prior year Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. 
In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, including AI services, drove better-than-expected growth in large long-term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, drove our results. 
Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 19%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels. Gaming console market was a bit smaller. 
As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on adjusted operating income growth and a negative $0.05 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. 
FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. 
Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned. 
Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. At a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, a favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. 
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over 400 million, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. 
Office Commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business, bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals. 
Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. 
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. 
In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. 
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall. Growth included 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance in higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations from [indiscernible] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remained healthy. 
Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations as stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier. 
Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year-over-year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. 
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.5 billion, lower than expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid for property and equipment. This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations at negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point, and we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, along with long-term Azure commitments, should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. 
We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the slip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. 
Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. 
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. 
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services, revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 14.7 billion to USD 15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. 
In devices, revenue should decline in the low double digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the mid- to high single digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. 
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 18.6 billion to USD 18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of USD 15.8 billion to USD 15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. 
Now some additional thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full year revenue growth by less than 1 point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full year COGS or operating expense growth. Second, Activision. For the full year FY '24, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs. 
At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1, and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2. Our commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion includes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. 
In closing, we are focused on execution so our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.",2645

Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you delivered Azure growth stability. But if we drill in 1 layer, we see Azure AI continuing to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue and what is other IaaS/PaaS revenue that are leveraging while driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with 2 related questions? Optimization has been stabilizing, and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then? Do we see nondirectly AI consumption being flattish? Or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data inferencing grows?
Second part, on AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of the Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to the pickup in non-Microsoft inferencing kicking in? When do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver?",172

So none of the large model training stuff is in any of our either numbers at all. Small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there but that's sort of a minor part. So most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing. And Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about like what is the new workload in AI. The new workload in AI obviously, in our case, it starts with 1 of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the frontier model, Azure OpenAI.
But it's not just about just 1 model, right? So you -- first, you take that model, you do all that jazz, you may do some fine-tuning. You do retrieval, which means you're sort of either getting some storage meter or you're eating some compute meters. And so -- and by the way, there's still a large model to a small model and that would be a training perhaps, but that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure. So I think that's what's happening. So you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a life cycle, which is they'll get built, then they will be continuously optimized over time. So that's sort of 1 side.
And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization. And I think last quarter, we said, one, we are going to continue to have these cycles where people will build new workloads. They will optimize the workloads and they'll start new workloads. So I think that, that's what we continue to see. But that period of massive, I'll call it, optimization only and no new workload start, that, I think, has ended at this point. So what you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycles by customers, both whether it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads.",347

I think whether you use the word lapping these optimization comparables or the comparables easing, it's all sort of the same thing. That we're getting to that point in H2, that's absolutely true. We'd like to talk about the contribution of AI, specifically for the reasons Satya talked about. These are -- this is starting to see the application of AI at scale and we want to be able to show people, this is how that's going to look.
It's inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue. And so I do think about those as both related. And ultimately, the TAM that we go after is best thought of as across both of those, both AI workload and I guess, ""non-AI workload"", although to Satya's point, you need all of it.",148

I'm curious if you could just walk through how this is possible and what you're seeing so far in some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI.",53
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3677.0,3007395.0,109920359.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,13,"Thanks, Brent. First of all, thanks for the question. The teams are obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that Q2, because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say is sort of a run rate margin improvement. So let me first say that.
Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good. And it speaks to, I think, one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that we want really to make sure that we're making investments, we're making them in consistency across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on, is inclusive of AI enablement. And so think about it as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that. It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work.
And I think that's important because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use but in what people are working on day to day. That does obviously create a leverage opportunity. There's also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the product. We talked about it with Office 365. We talked about it in Azure core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen materially improvements over the course of the year. And so we need to kind of take improvements at the gross margin level plus this consistency of re-pivoting a workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing without adding a material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage.
And we still need to be investing. And so the important part, invest towards the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments. And so it's a great question, and hopefully, that helps piece apart a few of the components.",350

Just one question for you, Satya. Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back. The nature of the database layer, the operating system, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it?",54
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3677.0,3007395.0,109920362.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,16,"Yes, I think it's going to have a very, very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power density to the data center design to what used to be the accelerator now is that sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so I think -- and the network, the memory architecture, all of it. So the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes. And so yes, so there's a full -- like take our data layer.
The most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute, we'll have traditional sequels, we'll have spark. And by the way, you can have an Azure AI drop on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lake house pattern. And then the business model, you can combine all of those different computes.
So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just 1 example. The tool stuff is changing. Office. I mean, if you think about what -- if you look at Copilot, Copilot extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. So yes, I mean, it definitely builds. I mean, I do believe being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI. But now AI is just redefining what it means to have -- what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.",300

The 6-point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary. But I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand.

Maybe I'll start, and Satya, feel free to add on. Karl, I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen it scale through that process. And that is going toward, as we talked about, servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward.
And so I do feel like the teams have done a very good job. I feel like primarily, obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand. And I tend to think looking forward, you'll tend to see and I guided toward it, accelerating capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline.",172

Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past? What, if anything, is holding it back? And how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? How -- to what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market?",79
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3677.0,3007395.0,109920368.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,22,"No. Thank you for the question, Brad. And so a couple of things. In my comments, I said increased in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5, whatever, 2 months in, it's definitely much faster than that. And so from that perspective, it's exciting to see, I'll say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right? I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app. You click on it like any ribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit.
In fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back in the day of PC adoption, right? It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right? So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters. I think that's the cycle that at least we expect.
In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting if you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like, number one, like I'm doing summarizations of teams, meetings inside of teams during the meeting, after the meeting, Word documents, summarization. I get something in e-mail, I'm summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, right? You're drafting e-mails, drafting documents. So anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting.
Chat. To me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications, is now query-able by natural language in a powerful way, right? I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said I should be watching out for next quarter? And it will come out with great detail. And so chat, summarization, draft.
Also, by the way, actions, one of the most used things is, here's a Word document. Go complete -- I mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So those are the stuff that's also beginning. So I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is you remember the PC adoption cycle. What it did was work, work artifact and work flow changed, right? You can imagine what forecasting was before Excel and e-mail and what it was after. So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster, chat to get knowledge from your business. And so those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.",446

One of the exciting things, as Satya said, for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like a PC. For other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains and then expand. And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month is really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach too.
And the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software, you sell software, then you wait and then it gets deployed. And then after deployment, you want to see usage. And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this in some ways with Copilot, even in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly. But really what we're seeing is engagement growth. To Satya's point on how you learn and your behavior changes, you see engagement grow with time. And so I think those are -- just to put a pin on that because it's an important dynamic when we think about the optimism you hear from us.",193

I mean, that's the easiest way to think about it. And we also saw growth in GitHub Copilot, which you talked -- which Satya talked about. And we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some smaller ways for training. But this is primarily an inferencing workload right now in terms of what's driving that number and how do you use to think about that.",95

And over the last couple of quarters, we're getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large. As we look forward, should they run even for a period of time or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term?",61

And let me split apart the components and then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually, believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectories and I'll explain why I say that. Seat growth, as we talk about, is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-sized businesses and really frontline worker scenarios. And to your point, on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats. But they are also -- they're new seats. And so you see that in the seat count number.
And as we get through and we've seen that come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter. But a very separate thing is being able to add ARPU. And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that's come over time from E3 then from E5. And we're continuing to see very healthy sweet momentum and you heard very good renewals. So all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth.
Then the next thing that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question, I'm trying to recall, is that you're going to see Copilot revenue will land there as ARPU, right? That won't show as seat growth. So you'll have E3, E5 transitions, Copilot all show up in ARPU over time. And then you'll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios. So I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not. I think about them as sort of unique independent motions we run, and there's still room for seat growth. And obviously, with the levers we've talked about, there's room for ARPU growth as well.",301

I mean, it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT and then its use inside of an Office scenario with GitHub Copilot. And so yes, I think this is the place where it's most evolved in terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits. And you see it. We see it inside of Microsoft. We see it in all of the case studies we put out of customers.
Everybody had talked it's become -- it is the 1 place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer. It's like if you take away spellcheck from Word, I'll be unemployable. And similarly, it will be like I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development. The thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked about, right? So you are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers, right?
I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great but they're pretty low. But frankly, even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we are a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's Sales Copilot or Service Copilot or GitHub Copilot or Security Copilot, they are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the OpEx, right? So it's like 2 points, 3 points of OpEx leverage would go to some software spend. I think that's a pretty straightforward value equation. And so that's the first time. I mean, this is not something we've been able to make the case for before, whereas now I think we have that case.
Then even the horizontal Copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level. Even there, you can make the same argument. Whatever ARPU we may have with E5, now you can say incrementally as a percentage of the OpEx, how much would you pay for a Copilot to give you more time savings, for example. And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work even and their productivity and how we participate.
And I think GitHub Copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity. And now you're seeing that transition. It's just not tools. It's about productivity of your dev team.",455

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3613.0,3097988.0,112009961.0,Presenter Speech,Satya Nadella,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Brett. It was a record third quarter powered by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%. Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack spanning everyday productivity, business process and developer services to models, data and infrastructure are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry.
Now I'll highlight examples walking up the stack starting with AI infrastructure. Azure again took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA, AMD as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI service.
We also continue to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open source models, LLMs and SLMs. With Phi-3, which we announced earlier this week, we offer the most capable and cost-effective SLM available. It's already being trialed by companies like CallMiner, LTIMindtree, PwC and TCS. Our Models as a Service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers from Accenture and EY to Schneider Electric are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models including, as of this quarter, the latest from Cohere, Meta and Mistral.  
And as part of a partnership announced last week, G42 will run its AI applications and services on our cloud. All up, the number of Azure AI customers continues to grow and average spend continues to increase. We also saw an acceleration of revenue from migrations to Azure. Azure Arc continues to help customers like DICK'S Sporting Goods, and World Bank streamlined their cloud migrations. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up over 2x year-over-year, and we are the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premise Oracle estates to Azure and Kyndryl and L'Oreal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure.
Overall, we are seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion-dollar-plus multiyear commitments announced this month from Cloud Software Group and The Coca-Cola Company. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals increased over 80% year-over-year, while the number of $10 million-plus deals more than doubled.
Now on to data and analytics. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capability, spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, governance and AI. Over half of our Azure AI customers also use our data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure, PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB with deep integrations with Azure AI.
TomTom is a great example. They've used Cosmos DB along with Azure OpenAI service to build their own immersive in-car infotainment system. We are also encouraged by our momentum with our next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric. Fabric now has over 11,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from ABB, EDP, Energy Transfer to Equinor, Foot Locker, ITOCHU and Lumen; and we are seeing increased usage intensity. Fabric is seamlessly integrated with Azure AI Studio, meaning customers can run models against enterprise data that's consolidated in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake. And Power BI, which is also natively integrated with Fabric, provides business users with AI-powered insights. We now have over 350,000 paid customers.
Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. We now have 1.8 million paid subscribers with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter and continues to see increased adoption from businesses in every industry, including Itau, Lufthansa Systems, Nokia, Pinterest and Volvo Cars. Copilot is driving growth across the broader GitHub platform, too. AT&T, Citigroup and Honeywell all increased their overall GitHub usage after seeing productivity and code quality increases with Copilot. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers, and revenue accelerated over 45% year-over-year.
Anyone can be a developer with new AI-powered features across our low-code, no-code tools, which makes it easier to build an app, automate workflow or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 Organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. Cineplex, for example, built a Copilot for customer service agents, reducing query handling time from as much as 15 minutes to 30 seconds. All up, over 330,000 organizations, including over half of Fortune 100, have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, and Power Apps now has over 25 million monthly active users, up over 40% year-over-year.
Now on to future of work. We are seeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce. What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns the creation and diffusion and knowledge are to productivity of an organization. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns. That's having a cascading effect, changing work, work artifacts and workflows and driving better decision-making, collaboration and efficiency.
This quarter, we made Copilot available to organizations of all types and sizes from enterprises to small businesses. Nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot, and we have seen accelerated adoption across industries and geographies with companies like Amgen, BP, Cognizant, Koch Industries, Moody's, Novo Nordisk, NVIDIA and Tech Mahindra purchasing over 10,000 seats. We're also seeing increased usage intensity from early adopters, including a nearly 50% increase in the number of Copilot-assisted interactions per user in Teams, bridging group activity with business process workflows and enterprise knowledge.
And we're not stopping there. We're accelerating our innovation, adding over 150 Copilot capabilities since the start of the year. With Copilot and Dynamics 365, we are helping businesses transform every role and business function as we take share with our AI-powered apps across all categories. This quarter, we made our Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales broadly available, helping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O'Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation and Toyota Group generate role-specific insights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow and Zendesk.  
And with our Copilot for Finance, we are drawing context from Dynamics as well as ERP systems like SAP to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and contract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own Copilot integrations. For example, new integrations between Adobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketeers access campaign insights in the flow of their work. When it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is now available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2x quarter-over-quarter. With Copilot, we have an opportunity to create an entirely new category of devices purpose built for this new generation of AI.
All of our largest OEM partners have announced AI PCs in recent months. And this quarter, we introduced new Surface devices, which includes integrated NPUs to power on device AI experiences like auto framing and live captions. And there's much more to come. In just a few weeks, we'll hold a special event to talk about our AI vision across Windows and devices. 
When it comes to Teams, we once again saw year-over-year usage growth. We're rolling out a new version, which is up to 2x faster while using 50% less memory to all customers. We surpassed 1 million Teams Rooms for the first time as we continue to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker recognition. And Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling now with over 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year-over-year. All of this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365 companies across the private and public sector, including Amadeus, BlackRock, Chevron, Ecolab, Kimberly-Clark. All chose our premium E5 offerings this quarter for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.
Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. We are also bringing AI-powered transformation to every industry. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 health care organizations, including Providence, Stanford Health care and WellSpan Health. And in manufacturing, this week at Hannover Messe, customers like BMW, Siemens and Volvo Penta shared how they're using our cloud and AI solutions to transform factory operations.
Now on to security. Security underpins every layer of the tech stack, and it's our #1 priority. We launched our Secure Future Initiative last fall for this reason, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection, and we are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else, before all other features and investments. We are focused on making continuous progress across the 6 pillars of this initiative as we protect tenants and isolate production systems, protect identities and secrets, protect networks, protect engineering systems, monitor and detect threats, and accelerate responses and remediation.
We remain committed to sharing our learnings, tools and innovation with customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available earlier this month, bringing together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights.
Now let me talk about our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. We continue to combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way members learn, sell and get hired. Features like LinkedIn AI-assisted messages are seeing a 40% higher acceptance rate and accepted over 10% faster by job seekers saving hirers time and making it easier to connect them to candidates. Our AI-powered collaborative articles, which has reached over 12 million contributions are helping increase engagement on the platform, which reached a new record this quarter. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn Premium growth with revenue up 29% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strength across our other businesses with hiring taking share for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Now on to search, advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketeers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines and descriptions.
Now on to gaming. We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices. We set third quarter records for game streaming hours, console usage and monthly active devices. And last month, we added our first Activision Blizzard title Diablo IV to our Game Pass service. Subscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it 1 of our biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever. We were also encouraged by ongoing success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is attracting new gamers and retaining franchise loyalists.
Finally, we are expanding our games to new platforms, bringing 4 of our fan favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time. In fact, earlier this month, we had 7 games among the top 25 on the PlayStation store more than any other publisher.
In closing, I'm energized about our opportunity ahead as we innovate to help people and businesses thrive in this new era.
With that, let me turn it over to Amy.",1958
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3613.0,3097988.0,112009962.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses.
In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. In Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite.
Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 20% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%.
In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations. In gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services.
At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related cost.
FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365 even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.
Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. 
At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 23%, and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB.
Office Commercial licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses.
However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.
In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.
Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets.
Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. Overall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12%, ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge.
And in gaming, revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 41% with 43 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. 
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion. Cash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. When compared to our January guide for Q4 FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.
In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure, will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.
We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases. We continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity.
Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or USD 19.9 billion to USD 20.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. We continue to progress with adoption of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity.
In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or USD 28.4 billion to USD 28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.
In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or USD $15.2 billion to USD 15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits.
As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens driven by continued volume strength. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat.
And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year.
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 19.6 billion to USD 19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of USD 17.15 billion to USD 17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.
Therefore, we now expect full year FY '24 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. This operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.
As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.
Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth opportunities for years to come. In FY '25, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth. To scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY '25 capital expenditures to be higher than FY '24. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services, so we will manage that signal through the year.
We will also continue to prioritize operating leverage. And therefore, we expect FY '25 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year.

And there's media speculation of more spending ahead with some reports talking about like $100 billion data center. So obviously, investments are coming well ahead of the revenue contribution, but what I was hoping for is that you could give us some color on how you as the management team try to quantify the potential opportunities that underlie these investments because they are getting very big. And maybe if you could give us some hint on whether there's any truth to the potential of like $100 billion data center out there.",142

Let me start and Amy, you can add. At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are 2 sides to this, right? There is training and there's inference. What -- given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side. We want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.
Then, Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure. And it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track very closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks, very, very closely. 
So we feel -- and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years. So this is not the quarter. I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays. But if you look at it, we have been doing what is essentially capital allocation to be a leader in AI for multiple years now, and we plan to sort of essentially keep taking that forward.",269

And we look forward to being able to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to meet the demand. Another thing that you really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.
And so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of ""cloud infrastructure"" is important. It's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend, is the same way we approached it for a decade. Watch the signal. Invest to be a leader in the technical foundation, and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add. And I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that.",216

On one hand, you have bookings in Azure both accelerating year-over-year in the quarter, but we're seeing a lot of future concern, hesitation from other vendors we all cover. So I think everyone would love to get your sense of budget health for customers this year.",54

There are a couple of things I would say. On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very, very good about the -- we're fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective, at this point, Azure has become a port of call for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project.
And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers. Some of the logos, I even referenced in my remarks, are new Azure customers. So that's one. The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database. In fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT, is one of the fastest growing services for us.
We have Fabric integration to Azure AI and so -- Cosmos DB integration. So the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction. So we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI.
And lastly, I would say, migration to Azure as well. So this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers -- I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle. But there's also -- as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize. So it's a continuous side of it. So these are the 3 trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side.",293

I want to follow up on the AI obviously. We're seeing companies shifting their IT spending to invest in and learn about AI rather than receiving additional budgets for AI. At some point for AI to be transformative, as everyone expects, it needs to be accretive to spending. Satya, when do you believe AI will hit the maturity level? Will it be net increase to IT or outside of IT spending? And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation? And Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure? Some projects are being delayed so that, that spending could be shifted to -- from core Azure toward Azure AI?",120
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3613.0,3097988.0,112009973.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,14,"Yes. Great set of questions, Mark. Let me just start by saying a good place to start is to watch what's happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right? I mean if you think about it, they bought tools in the past. Now you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you're spending today, right?
That's really a good example of, I think, what's going to happen across the board. We see that in customer service. We see that in sales. We see that in marketing, anywhere there's operations. That's why I described it as knowledge turns. You can even think of it as lean for [ knowledge ] work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed and customer value.
And so one of the interesting rate limiters is culture change inside of organizations. When I say culture change, that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because, at the end of the day, companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process and apply these solutions.
And so that requires not just technology but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we're going to see firm-level performance differences. So one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it. Internally at Microsoft, we see it, right? We're also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process. And we know that this is not just about technology. It's about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. 
And so we see it in software development. We see it in customer service. We're seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize. And so that's like the PC when it became standard issue in early '90s. That's the closest analogy I can come up with.
And so yes, it will take time to -- for it to percolate through the economy. But this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past. As evidenced even by Copilot, right, it's faster than any suite we have sold in the past. And -- while it is going to require workflow and process change.",434

In our results, that's not what we saw. We saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is you see maybe growth in migrations again. You're seeing work in the data space, again, and you're seeing AI project starts.
And I think that's why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It's because it's a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said. It's about spending maybe in other areas that we don't traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO. It's spend being done by the Head of Customer Service. It's spend being done by the head of marketing. And I do think that will be important as we think about the opportunity ahead.",160

I'd love to hone in a little bit on the 7 point lift to Azure growth from AI, outstanding number, but it's leveling off a little bit from 6 points in December. I'm wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. To what extent did the capacity issues that you Amy highlighted on the call impact that number. Is there any seasonality? I wouldn't think so. Or any other factor that can swing around that number that you'd advise us to keep in mind?",94

There's not a seasonality to the numbers. So you're absolutely right to start there, and it's a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by -- it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side in particular. And so that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that it is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and does impact a little bit the number in Q4.",119

If you think about copilots and what you're doing there, you're kind of impacting a lot of this in businesses and the opportunities seem very broad-based. How do you think this will play out in the industry between you guys offering certain copilots versus like the rest of the industry following and everyone seems to have a copilot now and seems to be talking about it? How does that impact what you want to do, your partner strategy going forward?",87
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3613.0,3097988.0,112009980.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,21,"Yes, it's a great question. So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes, right? So it's not like -- when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work. They're doing knowledge work in support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service revenue ops, supply chain or what have you, right? So that's the first thing to note. And they do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you.
Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data. So when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow. It has the ability to integrate with SAP, with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing.
In fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility -- and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise is you want to ground your copilot with the enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications, and Copilot Studio is the tool to use there to make that happen.
And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all these other copilots, which to us appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right, because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting. The meeting is in the context of some business process. It could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do. And so now you can access all that data right in the Team's context.
So that's, I think, what's exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say we're under underappreciated for the amount of work -- how you -- people use those tools to make progress on business process, but we now get to bridge that between the business applications and knowledge worker tools more horizontally.",426

I wanted to go back to Azure. You've been hinting at stabilization there for the past couple of quarters, but still very good to see the balance. Maybe you can expand on just what the commercial bookings number, appreciating the variability there does in terms of visibility. And any characterization you can give us around what you're seeing in areas like cost optimization and core workload growth coming back is just helpful context for us in unpacking the numbers.",84

Maybe to -- I may take those a bit in reverse. It's a little easier to address them. When you think about -- we've been talking about sort of stabilization and what you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Karl, was 7 points of contribution from AI, and you could call them the difference [ 24 ] from our core really Azure business. And within that, the activity we saw in the consumption side was really this balance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations.
And then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle, which is actually quite normal, we saw it again this quarter in a balanced way. And I think when we talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which is a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back to not just AI starts but lots of other workflows. The companies are still going from on-prem to cloud. That's why Satya mentioned migrations. And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects, this is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings. And the total TCO is still really good.
And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos. So I would say it was actually pretty consistent, is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.
And so then when you're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload, what are we seeing, where it starts. And this one actually felt quite balanced, and optimizations look like they normally would, which, by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do. You want to run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that. So I sometimes think we -- you all may ask the question more as a negative, and for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level.",415

Kirk Materne,,Analysts,27,"I'll add my congrats in the quarter. Satya, I was wondering if you could chime in on a discussion that comes up a lot with investors, which is, is there a sort of data quality problem in the market in terms of being able to take advantage of all these new GenAI capabilities? And I was just curious if you could comment on do you see companies making inroads on sort of addressing that. And do you see that as sort of an inhibitor to AI growth at all at this point?",93
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2024",2024-04-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3613.0,3097988.0,112009987.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,28,"Yes, it's a great question because there are 2 sets of things in order to make sense of -- for successful deployment of these new AI capabilities. I mean if you sort of say this, what is this AI, it does 2 things, right? There's a new user experience. There's a natural language interface, and second thing is it's a reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good -- requires good data for grounding, right?
So people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then helps with the reasoning, I think, is helpful. And then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further.
So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how people can deploy these models across various business processes, where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.
So all that's maturing. So we feel good. And this is what I think, on the commercial side. These are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios. Whereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I'd point to GitHub. If you think about how it's got an entire system, right, it's just not an AI model. It's the AI -- or the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, the interpreter and the debugger, work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces which help the entire thing work. 
And effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced as business value and better grounding. But you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreS or SQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects.",399

It's a good opportunity to clarify. We -- and I would not say that there is a capacity constraint on the Copilots. It's a real priority for us to make sure we optimize the allocation of our capacity to make sure that those per user businesses are able to continue to grow.

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2024",2024-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3580.0,3204813.0,114140034.0,Presenter Speech,Satya Nadella,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All up annual revenue was more than $245 billion, up 15% year-over-year and Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135 billion, up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the Cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital-intensive investments. And as we go through this shift, we are focused on 2 fundamental things. First, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications, so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity while in parallel, continuing to scale our cloud business and prioritizing fundamentals, starting with security. 
Second, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable long-term operating leverage. 
With that, let me highlight examples starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI. We expanded our data center footprint announcing investments across 4 continents. These are long-term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia and we introduced new Cobalt 100, which provides best-in-class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake and Teradata. 
We continue to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry from ABB and Cathay Pacific to LALIGA to streamline their cloud migrations. We now have 36,000 Arc customers up 90% year-over-year. We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, Atos, Kohl's, Daimler Truck AG, Domino's, Haleon, for example, all migrated their mission-critical SAP workloads to our Cloud and with our Azure VMware solution we offer the fastest and most cost-effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads, too. 
With Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers' unique cost, latency and design considerations. All up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers up nearly 60% year-over-year and average spend per customer continues to grow. Azure OpenAI service provides access to best-in-class frontier models, including as of this quarter GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. It's being used by leading companies in every industry, including H&R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho and Zomato. 
With Phi-3, we offer a family of powerful small language models, which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union and others. And with Models as a Service, we provide API access to third-party models, including as of last week, the latest from Cohere, Meta and Mistral. The number of paid Models as a Service customers more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry from Adobe and Bridgestone to Novo Nordisk and Palantir. 
Now on to data. Our Microsoft intelligent data platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence and governance along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year-over-year. 
Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered next-generation data platform, now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from Accenture and Kroger to Rockwell Automation and Zeiss, up 20% quarter-over-quarter. And this quarter, we introduced new first of their kind, real-time intelligence capabilities in Fabric, so customers can unlock insights on high-volume, time-sensitive data. 
Now on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI power developer tool. Just over 2 years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations from BBVA, FedEx and H&M to Infosys and Paytm have adopted Copilot up 180% year-over-year. And we're going further with Copilot Workspace, we offer Copilot native end-to-end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug and deploy cycle. 
Copilot is driving GitHub growth all up. GitHub annual revenue run rate is now $2 billion. Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it. 
We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter-over-quarter. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year-over-year. 
Now on to future of work. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers as it transforms work, workflow and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter as they use it to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings and automate business workflows and processes. 
Copilot customers increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter. Feedback has been positive with majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats, all up the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis and EY alone will deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees and we are going further adding agent capabilities to Copilot. 
New Team Copilot can facilitate meetings and create an assigned task. And with Copilot Studio customers can extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom Copilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporation, Cognizant and Eaton to KPMG, Majesco and McKinsey have used Copilot Studio, up over 70% quarter-over-quarter. 
We're also extending Copilot to specific industries, including health care with DAX Copilot, more than 400 health care organizations, including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have purchased DAX Copilot to date, up 40% quarter-over-quarter and the number of AI-generated clinical reports more than tripled. 
Copilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter as customers like Thermo Fisher Scientific switched to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 contact center is a Copilot first solution that infuses Generative AI throughout the contact center workflow. Companies like 1-800-Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, Synoptek will rely on it to deliver better customer support. And Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP. 
Microsoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate and do business. We once again saw year-over-year usage growth. Teams premium has surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400% year-over-year as organizations like Dentsu, Eli Lilly, and Ford, chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation. 
When it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of Copilot+ PCs this quarter. They are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews, and we are looking forward to the introduction of more Copilot+ PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months. 
More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year-over-year, and we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, E.ON, National Australia Bank. 
And now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default and secure operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI. 
Over 1,000 paid customers used Copilot for security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW, and we are also securing customers' AI deployments with updates to Defender and Purview. All up, we now have 1.2 million security customers over 800,000, including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, TomTom use 4 or more workloads, up 25% year-over-year. 
And Defender for Cloud, our cloud security solutions, surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. 
Now let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement 1.5 million pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform and video is now the fastest-growing format on LinkedIn with uploads up 34% year-over-year. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform. 
And when it comes to our subscription businesses, premium sign-ups increased 51% this fiscal year, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools. Our reimagined AI-powered LinkedIn Premium experience is now available for every premium subscriber worldwide, helping them more easily and intuitively connect to opportunity, learn and get career coaching. 
Finally, hiring took share for the second consecutive year and now on to search advertising and news. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge and Copilot collectively are driving more engagement and value to end users, publishers and advertisers. Our overall revenue ex-TAC increased 19% year-over-year and we again took share across Bing and Edge. We continue to apply Generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience, which creates a dynamic response to users' query while maintaining click share to publishers. And we continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web, consumers have used Copilot to create over 12 billion images and conduct 13 billion chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year. 
Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And in fact, we have paid them $1 billion over the last 5 years. We are helping advertisers increase their ROI, too. We have seen positive response to Performance Max, which uses AI to dynamically create and optimize ads and Copilot and Microsoft ad platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language. 
Now on to gaming. We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices, and our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. 18 of them, such as Call of Duty, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on devices they already have, including as of last month, Amazon Fire TV. 
Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the second most watched title on the platform ever and hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter-over-quarter. 
In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the long term in our fundamentals, in our innovation and in our people. 
With that, let me turn it over to Amy.",1863
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2024",2024-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3580.0,3204813.0,114140035.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $64.7 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% and 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform. 
Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency. This record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number of $10 million-plus and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. 
Commercial, remaining performance obligation, increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $269 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. 
At a company level, Activision contributed net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and includes $938 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. 
FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 69%, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. 
Company gross margin dollars increased 14% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. 
Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency, and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. 
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $20.3 billion and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all business units. Office Commercial revenue grew 12% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 13% and 14% in constant currency with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as Copilot for Microsoft 365. 
Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office Commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency with continued customer shift to Cloud offerings. 
Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 10% to $82.5 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Dynamics revenue grew 16%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 19% and 20% in constant currency. We saw continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue. 
Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income increased 12% and 13% in constant currency. 
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $28.5 billion, increasing 19% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, Server products and Cloud services revenue grew 21% and 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 30% in constant currency, in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year. Azure growth included 8 points from AI services, where demand remained higher than our available capacity. 
In June, we saw slightly lower-than-expected growth in a few European geos. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 281 million seats, with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure. 
In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, although with slightly lower-than-expected transactional purchasing. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency. 
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.9 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by Windows Commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Windows Commercial products and Cloud services revenue increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 11% and 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. 
While early days, we're excited about the recent launch of our Copilot+ PCs. Search and News advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 19%, ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. And in Gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61%, slightly ahead of expectations with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. 
Stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% and 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition, operating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. 
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $19 billion, in line with expectations and cash paid for PP&E was $13.9 billion. Cloud and AI-related spend represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease data centers that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining Cloud and AI-related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs to serve customers based on demand signals. 
For the full fiscal year, the mix of our Cloud and AI-related spend was similar to Q4. 
Cash flow from operations was $37.2 billion, up 29% driven by strong Cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our Cloud and AI offerings. For the full year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion. 
This quarter, other income expense was negative $675 million more favorable than anticipated with lower-than-expected interest expense and higher-than-expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively. 
And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $34 billion for the full fiscal year. 
Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '25. 
First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue, COGS or operating expense growth. Next, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers. To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and Cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY '25 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY '24. 
As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management. Therefore, we expect FY '25 OpEx growth to be in the single digits. And given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY '25 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY '25 effective tax rate to be around 19%. 
Now to the outlook for our first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than 1 point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth. 
In commercial bookings, increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can derive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. 
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our Cloud and AI demand as well as existing AI capacity constraints. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. 
Next is segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency or USD 20.3 billion to USD 20.6 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. 
In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency or USD 28.6 billion to USD 28.9 billion. 
Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per user business will continue to moderate. 
And in H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. 
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the low single digits. And More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 12% in constant currency or USD 14.9 billion to USD 15.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market. 
In Windows Commercial products and Cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. Search and News advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid- to high teens. This will be higher than overall Search and News advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low single digits. 
And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s, driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year-over-year. 
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 19.95 billion to USD 20.15 billion, including approximately USD 700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of USD 15.2 billion to USD 15.3 billion, including approximately USD 200 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. 
Other income and expense should be roughly negative $650 million, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. 
In closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly 3 points year-over-year even as we accelerate our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition and had a headwind from the change in useful lives last year. 
So as we begin FY '25, we will continue to invest in the Cloud and AI opportunity ahead. aligned and if needed, adjusted to the demand signals we see. We are committed to growing our leadership across our Commercial Cloud and within that, the AI platform, and we feel well positioned as we start FY '25. 
With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.",2593

Right now, there's an industry debate ranging around the CapEx requirements around Generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth? Or does the shift in gross margin profile change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yield on those investments?",97
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2024",2024-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3580.0,3204813.0,114140038.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,6,"Thank you, Keith. Let me start, and then Amy can add to this. I think, I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what's the product -- shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense that it was both a knowledge intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure, meters as well as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at.
And how is that value landing with customers and what's the growth rate. So when I think about what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we're getting recurring customers, so our customers coming back buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it. What's happening in the contact center with Dynamics. So I would say -- and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the CapEx spend, basically, that's the demand signal because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60-plus percent is the kit, that only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? So that's, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle even.
The asset, as Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully, we can even have things which are semi-constructive, we call Kohl's shelves and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset and a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal.
There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's on commercial per seat side or on the consumption meters, that's, I think, the fundamental driver.",418

Being able to maybe share a little more about that when we talked about roughly half of FY '24's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases, and those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond.
And they're incredibly flexible because we've built a consistent architecture, first with the Commercial Cloud and second with the Azure Stack for AI, regardless of whether the demand is at the platform layer or at the app layer or through third parties and partners or, frankly, our first-party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So it's a long-lived flexible assets.
And if you think about it, that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe. Because when we did this last transition, the first transition to the Cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes. It rolled out quite differently. We rolled out more geo by geo and this one because we have demand on a global basis, we are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully, with that sort of shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is sort of near-term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.",282

GenAI has been a bit of roller coaster for tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 Commercial, not yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it.
Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings?
And Amy, with Cloud, it took time for margins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near term and long term from all the investment on AI?",142
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2024",2024-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3580.0,3204813.0,114140042.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,10,"Yes. Thanks again, Mark, for the question. So to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%, right? That's a pretty good healthy sign.
The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It's 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a healthy SaaS core business.
And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared are on Dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is one, we are gaining share. We are -- Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is sort of really biz app, it's probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I think we can drive that value to our customers.
And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think, last quarter is when we started giving you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just for -- we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think, how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.",402

That's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So -- because we're building to on Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments. We're making one. We're using that internally first party, and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs. So it does, in fact, make margins start off better and obviously scale consistently.",94

A question for you, Amy. When you look at the CapEx, how do you ring efficiencies out of the CapEx? You've disclosed that 50% of that was infrastructure, the other 50% tech, is very useful. So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates? Or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and Generative AI? That's the main question in my mind.",86
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2024",2024-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3580.0,3204813.0,114140046.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,14,"Thanks, Kash. That's a very good question. There's really 2 pieces, I think, as I heard your question that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see sort of consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate.
And the answer to that is yes because there's 2 different pieces, right? You're seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Satya mentioned, the pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand-driven. And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect, and we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understanding to do the same thing on the GPU side.
And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and capital spend quarter-to-quarter.
The other thing I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a growing distinction between our CapEx number, and on occasion, the cash that we pay for PP&E and you're going to start to see that more often in this period because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility. I've mentioned it back in my comments before, but I mentioned it again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments and hopefully that's helpful context.",265

I think as people think about capital spend, I think, it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about -- we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item, land which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time.
So those are the other 2 considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset. Land, network, construction, the system or the kit and then the ongoing cost. And so if you think about it that way, then you know how to even adjust, if you will, the capital spend based on demand signal.",132

Great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high end. The 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta. I guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments, there's 2 things that I heard you say. One, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half? And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a little bit more economic rather than Azure specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter?",141

Yes, that's exactly right. Maybe I'll just repeat it, just so people can hear it in my words as well to that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end at 30%. You're exactly right. The distinguishing between being at the higher end or at the lower end, really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non-AI consumption really made the difference in that number. And we've assumed that going forward into H1 inclusive of my guide 28% to 29% going forward.
And then let me separate which was your larger point, which is what are the other factors you see ongoing. Number one, you're right, capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure will remain in Q4 and will remain in H1. So hopefully, that's helpful.",137

Maybe separate a couple of things. We are -- and we've talked about now for quite a few quarters, we are constrained on AI capacity. And because of that, actually, we've, to your point, have signed up with third parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity.

For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 feet deals, the repeat purchases, is it possible to eventually see co-pilot penetration rate equally high in office as they will be in GitHub?",80
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2024",2024-07-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3580.0,3204813.0,114140061.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,29,"Yes, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue, you create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec and from a spec, you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot.
And you see this even now -- for example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right? So this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening.
Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it. You can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams.
And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves, what used to be line of business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow and work artifact, all being driven by Copilots.",332

For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC.
So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile.
But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X Cloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building towards. And that was strategy behind Activision as an asset.
