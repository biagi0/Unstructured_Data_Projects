It's a pleasure to be joining you for my first earnings call. I've met with many of you over the last two months and during my prior role with the Microsoft, and I look forward to spending time with many more of you in the months ahead.Over the course of my career, both inside and outside of Microsoft, in good economies and bad, I have learned that there are a few constants that persistently translate to success: Working with great people and relentlessly focusing on creating value for customers, employees and shareholders. I'm delighted I have the opportunity to do that in my new role, building on our current momentum and driving future growth.Now let me share some thoughts on our second quarter results. We reported record revenue and a record profit. These results were driven in large part by strong consumer demand for Windows 7 and PCs. While consumer demand remains healthy, we have not seen a return of enterprise-spending growth.Meanwhile, our ongoing work in managing expenses and aligning our cost structure to the highest priorities have enabled us to drive earnings growth ahead of revenue growth. We also returned $4.8 billion of cash to investors through dividends and stock repurchases.As we have previously discussed, we are just starting our strongest product cycle ever. This quarter was highlighted by the successful launches of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Exchange 2010 [Microsoft Exchange Server 2010]. We released Office 2010, the Beta, and introduced more Bing innovations this quarter. Bing has now gained market share each month since its launch.We also announced upcoming releases of two very important and compelling offerings that will drive growth into the future: Windows Azure and Natal [Project Natal]. Azure is our cloud platform, which is providing developers, partners and our customers a smooth transition to the cloud with tools and processes they already know. Natal, which is based on our natural user interface work, will energize this generation's gaming and entertainment experience starting this coming holiday season.So in summary, I'm very pleased with our progress this quarter. We have momentum with products and market, we have an exciting pipeline of new products and we delivered strong financial results. I'll now hand the call back to Bill to give you some additional details on the quarter, and then come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook.",399
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2340.0,47683.0,3639623.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Peter. I'll start with the company overview and then go through revenue performance for each of our business units. I will then review the rest of the income statement. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year, unless I specify otherwise.As Peter mentioned, we had an exceptional quarter with record revenue and profit. Overall, revenue grew 14% to just over $19 billion, primarily driven by strong Windows 7 consumer demand. Net income and earnings per share were $6.7 billion and $0.74, respectively. Excluding the $1.7 billion of revenue recognized from the Windows 7 upgrade program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability, revenue grew 4%. Foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on revenue during the quarter. Our product billing mix in the second quarter was roughly the same as last year with 30% annuity, 30% OEM and 25% license-only with the balance coming from our other businesses.Now let me dive deeper into the overall revenue mix. Geographically, emerging markets grew mid-teen while mature markets grew single digits. In terms of segments, consumer demands continue to be the driver of growth. While we saw a stabilization in the business segment, as Peter mentioned, we have not seen a return of enterprise-spending growth today.Enterprise Agreement sales cycles have lengthened and multi-year annuity revenue was flat year-over-year. Unearned revenue was $12.5 billion, down slightly from last year. On a sequential basis, unearned revenue was down primarily due to this quarter's recognition of the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 revenue that I referred to earlier. Our contracted not billed balance was approximately $13 billion, down slightly from last year.Now for the PC market. PC hardware shipments grew substantially during the quarter fueled by demand for Windows 7 and innovation from our OEM partners. The combination of Windows 7 and the unprecedented variety of hardware choices, form factors and price points makes it a terrific time for customers to get exactly the PC they want. Year-over-year, we estimate the PC market grew 15% to 17%. More specifically, we estimate consumer PCs grew more than 20% while business PCs were roughly flat. This quarter, netbooks represented about 11% of the total PC market roughly flat compared with last year and last quarter.Now with that back drop, let's move on to revenue and business drivers by segment beginning with the Windows and Windows Live division, which I will refer to as the Windows division. All of my comments related to the Windows division are adjusted to exclude the $1.7 billion of Windows 7 revenue I referred to earlier. Keep in mind that this is a non-GAAP view and all GAAP, non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our slide deck which is posted on website.Overall, the Windows division had a phenomenal quarter with record quarterly revenue of $5.2 billion, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was mainly driven by increased OEM unit sales of 22%. OEM revenue increased 21% and grew faster than PC shipments for the first time in eight quarters. As in the prior quarter, we have included a slide that bridges the difference between the PC market growth and OEM revenue growth.Changes in segment mix represented a nine percentage point headwind to OEM revenue. This was caused by two factors: A higher mix of consumer PCs than business PCs and emerging markets outpacing mature markets. Windows Attach [VHD Attach] and Inventory [Microsoft Software Inventory Analyzer] drove 10 percentage points of OEM revenue growth. Attach accounted for about half the increase. Year-to-date, we saw solid Attach gains across all regions, channels and form factors.Inventory, accounting for the other half of the increase was a result of OEMs rebuilding inventory to exit the quarter at normal levels as we discussed in the last quarter's call. Windows 7 up sell and Channel Dynamics [Microsoft Dynamics Channel] drove six percentage points of OEM revenue growth, reflecting consumer demand for Windows 7 Home Premium and demand for Windows 7 on netbooks. The commercial, retail and online portion of the Windows division grew 55%, primarily driven by the retail launch sales of Windows 7.Now let me give you some additional Windows data points. Through the end of the second quarter, we sold more than 60 million Windows 7 licenses, making it the fastest-selling operating system in history. Windows is attached to more than 90% of netbooks, with Windows 7 accounting for well over half of that. Windows consumer licenses grew more than 35% year-over-year. And finally, Q2 was another record quarter, representing the highest number of Windows licenses sold in one quarter ever. In fact, Q2 beat the previous records set last quarter by 20%.In summary, it was an exceptional quarter for the Windows division. With Windows 7, we have terrific consumer momentum and a great product for the business PC market when it recovers.Now let's move to Server & Tools. The server hardware market was stronger than expected for the quarter, although still down slightly year-over-year. Our OEM and license-only revenue continued to outperform underlying x86 server hardware market shipments while annuity revenue grew low single digits.This quarter, we released the Windows Server 2008 R2. Customer adoption for this and our virtualization and management offerings continue to build momentum. Revenue from our virtualization offerings, such as premium editions of Windows Server and System Center grew double digits.At PDC [Professional Developers Conference], we provided an update on Windows Azure including the anticipated commercial availability next month. In addition, we recently announced the three-year agreement with Hewlett-Packard. This partnership offers customers' comprehensive solutions whether for data centers or public clouds. We are also very excited about the upcoming May release of SQL Server 2008 R2, which will further expand our capabilities in business intelligence and data warehousing.Now for the Online Services division. While search revenue grew, display revenue was hampered primarily by international rate decline. We continue to be pleased with Bing's momentum to date, including seven consecutive months of share gains in the U.S. Regarding our Yahoo! partnership, we are still working through the regulatory review process and continue to be hopeful the deal will be approved early this year.Now onto the Microsoft Business Division. In general, the conditions from last quarter remain unchanged. Revenue was down 3% as enterprise spending remains soft. Business revenue was down 6% due to weak business PC sales. The non-annuity component of business revenue was pressured in advance of the next product cycle. Annuity revenue was roughly flat as expected. Consumer revenue, which includes the OEM and retail portion to this business increased 12%. This growth was primarily due to better-than-expected consumer PC shipments although it still lags the overall PC market.Within MBD [Microsoft Business Division], we continue to see double-digit growth of our SharePoint, Office Communications Server and Dynamics CRM products. During the quarter, we released the Beta of Office 2010, which has been downloaded over 2 million times.In the Entertainment and Devices division, revenue was down 11%. During the quarter, we sold 5.2 million consoles, a year-over-year decline of 13%. Due to the favorable mix shift to Elite and Special Edition consoles, console ASPs were down only slightly following the Q1 price cuts. While our software Attach rate continue to grow and lead the industry at 8.8% Attach revenue declined as we faced difficult comps with the prior year.Xbox Live continue to contribute to the quarter's performance and now has 23 million members, over 35% growth from a year ago. We also continue to make progress in the mobile space, and you will hear more about that at Mobile World Congress in February.Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold decreased 7% to $3.6 billion, driven primarily by lower Xbox 360 volume and console costs. These savings were partially offset by increased traffic acquisition and online costs.Operating expenses increased 1% to $6.9 billion and included approximately $290 million of legal expenses. We continue to execute on our resource management plan, and during the quarter, eliminated an additional 800 position. Year-over-year headcount declined 8%. This quarter, cash flow from operations was $5 billion and we repurchased $3.6 billion of shares, and paid $1.2 billion of dividends.So to wrap up, while we have yet to see a return of business spending growth, the Consumer segment performed better than expected, and we couldn't be more pleased with the reception of Windows 7 by our partners, developers, and most importantly, our customers. We continue to be excited by our momentum and believe we are well-positioned for the future. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.",1435

Now I'll discuss our expectations for calendar 2010.From a macro perspective, IT spending should improve from the recessionary levels of 2009. Taking into account second quarter results, we are incrementally positive towards the PC and server hardware market. As we've been saying, we expect the business hardware refresh cycle to begin this calendar year, occurring gradually over a couple of years. When thinking about the remainder of fiscal 2010, keep in mind that our third quarter tends to be seasonally weaker than our second and fourth quarters.Now addressing each of the divisions individually. In the third quarter, we expect Windows division revenues to be roughly in line with the overall PC market growth. Attach gains, the Inventory rebuild relative to the prior year, should offset macro trend of consumer PCs growing faster than business PCs and emerging markets growing faster than mature markets. When thinking of sequential trends in the third quarter, keep in mind Q2 included a large retail launch impact.For the full year, we expect the Windows division revenue to grow in line with the overall PC market growth. The Microsoft Business Division's revenue in the third quarter should largely demonstrate same dynamics within the first half. Consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, will face ongoing pressure in advance of the next product cycle, and that such should lag overall PC shipments until Office 2010 becomes generally available in June. We expect annuity revenue, representing 60% of total revenue, to be broadly flat for the full year.The release of the Office 2010 Beta this quarter was an important milestone. We received terrific feedback from early adopters about the flexibility and powerful new ways to stay productive across the PC, browser and phone.  As you think of the fourth quarter financial impact of the Office 2010 release, keep in mind the timing of the launch is late in the quarter, and the financial impact should be seen starting in FY '11.The Server & Tools business, is most closely aligned the server hardware shipments and business IT spending. We expect server shipments to show year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 for the first time in several quarters. We expect non-annuity revenue, which is approximately 30% of the total, to generally in line with it. Annuity revenue should grow mid-single digit, while services should be roughly flat for the year.For the Online Services division, the outlook for online advertising appears to be improving. Excluding the impact of our legacy Access business, we expect revenue to be roughly in line with the market to the third quarter and full year. In the Entertainment and Devices division, revenue should directionally track with the overall gaming market and we maintain our view that full year revenue should be roughly flat.  The past two quarters, we have made good progress containing our cost of goods sold, despite the upward pressures of increased traffic acquisition costs in our Search business and growth of our Online Services. As a result of our operational initiative, improved Xbox 360 console costs and an increasingly favorable revenue mix towards Windows, we now expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue to be roughly flat for this fiscal year.With regard to operating expenses, we remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and aligning resource. In the full year, we reconfirm our guidance of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. This takes into account our second quarter performance, the impact of one-time costs, including the Yahoo! partnership integration expenses, and higher revenue-driven selling expenses.We also reconfirmed that our capital spending for the year will be no more than $2 billion, and our effective tax rate should be approximately 25%. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and we'll return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases over the long run.So in summary, we delivered very good financial results and are well-positioned for future growth. We have great momentum in the market with Windows 7, in the upcoming launches of Office 2010 and Natal.Heading into 2010, we are encouraged by the possibility of improving market conditions, converging with the strongest wave of products in our company's history. Although the timing is uncertain, we are well-positioned to capitalize from the business spending recovery when it occurs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and answer some of your question.",727

If you look at the average selling prices in the quarter, they improved sequentially and obviously, you're seeing both mix help that in the consumer side. But as we get a little bit deeper into the corporate upgrade cycle, you're going to see a lot higher dollar value. How should we be thinking about average selling prices? Should we see steady sequential improvement there, or some of the puts and takes around where you're seeing growth in the PC market going to offset that?",91

And the timing of that remains uncertain. We maintain our general view, which we've had, that, that will start to occur this year and occur gradually over the next couple of years. So what that does, that obviously has an impact on our average selling prices. What we saw this quarter, on the consumer side, with a great adoption of Home Premium, as well as Windows 7 on netbooks, which is driving that upsell that Bill talked about, for those two things combined will be the drivers and it just really depends on the macro.",113

So there still seems to be some debate on the street as to how tighter reign you'll keep on costs, even though you guys have done a phenomenal job thus far. So I know you're not guiding for fiscal '11 on this call, but could you maybe just philosophically talk a little bit about the growth rate? I think you've messaged a low-single-digit inflation type rate. And then just on the COGS side, flat for this year is a great outcome. But for next year, as Azure and so on kicks in, I'm assuming we should assume gross margin continues to come down.",112

So I've been focused on, even before taking this role, working with Chris and the leadership team on that, and feel great that we've got a thoughtful plan that we've come up with and we're doing what we said in executing against that.

I'm just curious on the consumer side and on the business side. What are you hearing? Can you give us some anecdotal data or revenue that you're seeing from so-called shrink-wrap purchases on the consumer side and maybe on the business side as well? The threshold, you don't need to buy a brand new PC but I guess, you could deploy Windows 7 on existing hardware. What are you seeing on the business and consumer market in regards to that?",112

So that dynamic that you highlighted is actually happening. People are going to retail and buying shrink-wrapped Windows to put on their PCs. On the business side anecdotally, a lot of interest. Businesses are incredibly enthusiastic about deploying. And so we'll hope to see that flow through over the coming year. So in both cases, a lot of positive momentum as you indicate.",86

I would definitely say it's stabilized. The mix has stayed stable, our attach [attach rate] is very high over 90%, and as Bill said, over 50% percentage of that is Windows 7. And so what we're finding is, people want Windows 7 on all devices and all form factors. And that's really what's been driving the quarter and the success of Windows 7. And we've worked closely with all of our OEM partners to deliver the broadest range of devices, PCs, notebooks, whatever you have. Whether it's netbook or a laptop or notebook or a desktop, Windows 7 is on them. So that's very positive for us.",108

And in E&D, if you need to separate mobile from the entertainment side of the Xbox side. The Xbox is in a very good position right now. We've got a great installed base of engaged users. We've got the Xbox Live asset, we've got Natal coming out, we're working through the profitability on the console costs. So a ton of momentum and a really exciting year coming up. On the Mobile side, our strategy remains the same. As we've been saying from a product perspective, we're working very hard on the next version of Windows Mobile, as Bill indicated, we'll be talking more about that in Barcelona in a few weeks. But I wouldn't think of the organization changes that's fundamentally changing the strategy. It just puts us in a better position to continue to execute against what we're doing.",153

There's the Yahoo! integration expenses which is a one-time new expense that we didn't have last year. And then given the increase to the revenues that we'll see over the recessionary levels that we saw last time, there's just some variable sales costs to go along with that and those drive year-over-year increases and those are the two biggest things.

With the launch of this, is that Delta [Microsoft Delta] was like 8% to 10%. And I'm just curious because there was some decent reviews on Vista when it came out, but there's really -- there were some questions at that point and in the end, it really looks like Windows 7 is going to be much greater success for you. I'm just curious if you think you can see some more, I guess, I know there's a lot of things that affect that, but inventory build in the launch of a new OS seems to have a big effect. And where the inventories are today, do you think you can see even more benefit in the following quarter?",142
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2340.0,47683.0,3639661.0,Answer,Peter Klein,,Executives,42,"Well, two things. Inventories, they are about a normal level. So we feel pretty good in all the checks we've done on sell-through, inventories at normal level. In terms of the comparison to Vista, it's a different world now, right? We have some headwinds that we may not have had then in terms of the mix, the sort of segment mix that Bill talked about in terms of consumer and emerging market which is really some headwind. And so if you break it out that granularly, and you look at the attach in inventory gains of 10%, half of that being attached, that's a good result. And as I mentioned before, for us to continue to grow in line with the PC market given those headwinds of the segment mix, we're going to continue to have do better on attach and inventory and some of the upsell as well.",149

We've got Natal coming out this year, so you should think of it beyond the rest of the fiscal year. And then, how we go up and down depends on timing of software titles.

Our third quarter results reflect our strong product momentum, continued focus on controlling costs and the beginning stages of a return in business hardware spending. This quarter, we generated record third quarter revenue and operating cash flow. In addition, as a result of revenue growth and our ongoing focus on cost management, when adjusting for the impact of the Tech Guarantee programs this year, we had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. 
Strong demand for Windows 7 was the primary contributor to our performance. As evidence of that strong demand, both internal and external check show that over 10% of all PCs worldwide are already running Windows 7. While reaching this level of penetration in six months qualifies Windows 7 as our fastest-selling operating system ever, it also illustrates how much opportunities still remain. As I have met with investors, I've commented on the tremendous product momentum we have, which was evidenced this quarter across all our business. 
Bing achieved 10 consecutive months of market share growth since its launch. And both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission cleared our search agreement with Yahoo! Azure, our cloud development platform, became commercially available in 41 countries. In the mobile space, we announced Windows Phone 7 KIN. And last Friday, we released Office 2010 to manufacturing and are looking forward to its launch in June. All of this was achieved while continuing to focus on managing costs and prioritizing our investments. As a result, we delivered operating income and earnings per share growth ahead of revenue growth, with earnings per share up 36% over last year. We also returned $3.1 billion of cash to investors through dividends and stock repurchases. 
So in summary, I am pleased with our continuing performance this quarter. We have great momentum with current products in the market, we have a very exciting pipeline of new products to come and we continue to deliver strong financial results. I'll now hand the call back to Bill to give you some additional details on the quarter and then come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.",367
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,60.0,58609.0,4419305.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. As I review this quarter's performance, keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding quarter of last year unless I specify otherwise. 
As Peter said, we had another strong quarter. Overall, GAAP revenue grew 6% to $14.5 billion. During the quarter, we deferred $305 million of revenue related to the Microsoft Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program. Adjusting for this amount, revenue would have been $14.8 billion, 8% growth over the prior-year period. GAAP operating income grew 17% year-over-year, while EPS grew 36%. Operating cash flow this quarter was $7.4 billion, an all-time record for the company. Foreign exchange had a positive impact to revenue of about $200 million this quarter. 
In terms of overall revenue mix, geographically, emerging markets grew more than 20%, while mature markets grew mid-single digits. While consumer demand continued to be strong, we saw renewed strength from small- and mid-market customers with year-over-year growth of more than 15%. Within the enterprise customer segment, we saw the beginning of a recovery in IT hardware spend. But as we've discussed on past calls, we continued to see lengthened sales cycles. Enterprise Agreement renewal rates, taking into consideration the extended sales cycles, are within our historical range. 
Unearned revenue was $12.3 billion, down sequentially as is typical, but better than last year's seasonal trend and roughly flat year-over-year. Our unearned revenue balance would have been up more than $100 million or 1% year-over-year when considering the recognition of undelivered elements, primarily associated with our prior Windows XP sales and the revenue deferrals from our Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program. 
Multi-year annuity billings were up mid-single digits year-over-year. This quarter's growth from volume licensing is beginning to offset the unearned revenue declines we've seen over the past several quarters as we rebuild our unearned balance. 
Now for the PC market. Windows 7 and the innovation from our OEM partners continued to fuel demand for PCs. We estimate the PC market grew roughly 25% year-over-year. Within that, we estimate consumer PCs grew almost 30%, while business PCs grew 14%. This quarter, netbooks represented approximately 10% of the total PC market. 
Let's move on to this quarter's performance by business group, beginning with the Windows and Windows Live divisions, which had another exceptional quarter. We continued to see very strong consumer demand for Windows with consumer license growth of 35%. We also saw a return in demand for business PCs with licenses up more than 15%, leading us to believe the business PC refresh cycle has begun. 
OEM units increased 30% year-over-year and outpaced PC shipments. OEM revenue increased 29% for the second quarter in a row and also outpaced the PC market. As with prior quarters, we have included a slide that bridges the difference between the PC market growth and OEM revenue growth. We experienced a nine percentage point headwind, primarily caused by emerging markets outpacing mature markets and consumer outpacing business. 
Windows attach and inventory drove eight percentage point of OEM revenue growth. Conditions from the prior quarter remained largely unchanged with inventory exiting the quarter at normal levels. Windows 7 upsell and channel dynamics drove five percentage points of OEM revenue growth reflecting adoption of Windows 7 on netbooks and adoption of premium versions of Windows 7 on business and consumer PCs. The commercial retail and online portion of the Windows division grew 26%, primarily driven by retail sales of Windows 7. 
Now let's move to server tools. We estimate server hardware shipments strengthened considerably with year-over-year growth in the high teens. The OEM and license-only revenue, which represents 30% of the business grew high-single digits, an improvement from prior quarters. Within that, Windows Server revenue grew mid-teens, while SQL Server and developer tools experienced slower growth in front of new product launches. 
Annuity revenue, which is approximately 50% of the business, was roughly flat. Enterprise Services grew 5%. Our virtualization solutions continue to be strong. System Center server revenue grew over 20%, and Windows Server premium mix remains over 20% this year. Additionally, our share of new x86 virtualization licenses, which includes Hyper V and Virtual Server is now 25%, up three points year-over-year in the December quarter according to IDC.
We released to manufacturing Visual Studio 2010, announced a new partnership with Citrix that furthers our desktop virtualization offering, and yesterday, we released to manufacturing SQL Server 2008 R2. Clearly, there is very strong product pipeline in Server & Tools. 
Now for the Online Services division. Online advertising revenue grew 19%, primarily driven by Search, which outperforms the market. We continue to be enthused with Bing's momentum, which includes 10 consecutive months of share gains in the U.S. We ended the quarter with U.S. query share of 11.7% according to comScore, 340 basis points higher than when we launched Bing last May. The Yahoo! Search partnership implementation is underway, and we are working towards U.S. completion by the end of this calendar year and global completion by early calendar year 2012. 
Moving on to the Microsoft Business Division. In general, the conditions from last quarter remain unchanged. Revenue was down 6%, but when adjusted for the Office 2010 technology guarantee deferral of $305 million, revenue was up 1%. Within MBD business, revenue was down 1%. As we've discussed previously, the non-annuity component of business revenue has been pressured in advance of the next product cycle, while annuity revenue was roughly flat. 
Consumer revenue, which includes the OEM and retail portions of this business, increased 11% when adjusting for the technology guarantee of strong PC shipments. Last Friday, we released to manufacturing Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010. We expect commercial availability in May, with general availability in June. 
With respect to the $305 million Tech Guarantee deferral, it's important to note that due to varying international availability and fulfillment dates, there will be puts and takes to the unearned revenue balance throughout Q4. However, the Tech Guarantee deferral balance is expected to remain roughly unchanged at the end of Q4. We expect that substantially all of the Tech Guarantee unearned revenue balance will be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. 
During the quarter, we made terrific progress in our cloud offerings. Customers such as Starbucks, McDonald's, GlaxoSmithKline, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Aviva and Swedish Red Cross are all going to the cloud with Microsoft. We now have 40 million paid seats of our commercial online services. Clearly, companies are choosing Microsoft for their cloud productivity solutions, and we intend to build on this momentum. 
Now let's move onto Entertainment and Devices division. Gaming revenue declined 4%, as we sold 1.5 million consoles, a unit decline of 12%, which was roughly in line with the overall market. While our software attach rate continued to lead industry at 8.8, first-party software revenue declined based on typical comparisons to the prior-year launch of Halo Wars. This was substantially offset by the continuing strong revenue and membership growth of Xbox Live. Non-gaming revenue was up 14% reflecting growth in the PC hardware market and increased Windows Embedded revenue. As Peter mentioned, we continued to have good momentum on the product side for Mobile. During the quarter, we announced Windows Phone 7, and last week we announced KIN, which will be available in the U.S. in May. 
Now for the rest of the income statement. Cost of goods sold decreased to 2% to $2.8 billion, driven primarily by lower Xbox 360 volumes and console costs. These savings were partially offset by increased traffic acquisition and online costs. Operating expenses were $6.6 billion as we continued to manage our expenses and prioritize our investments. Headcount declined both year-over-year and sequentially. 
G&A expenses grew due to contractual costs associated with our Yahoo! Search partnership and legal expenses. We repurchased $2 billion worth of shares and paid $1.1 billion of dividends. 
So to wrap up, the Consumer segment continues to drive great results. In addition, we saw the beginning of the business PC refresh. This, combined with our strong product pipeline and our continued focus on execution and cost management, means we are well positioned for the future. With that, I'll hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.",1364

Now I'll discuss our expectations for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year. From a macro perspective, we expect the next quarter to be similar to the third quarter with continued strength in hardware shipments. We are encouraged by the recent uptick in business PC growth and expect that this business refresh cycle will continue over a couple of years. 
Before I get into my commentary by division, remember that the June quarter is the close of our fiscal year. As such, it is historically a seasonal high for our enterprise sale, and we are entering it with a strong sales pipeline. While we've noted early signs of improvement, the business-spending environment and associated sales cycles remain challenging. We will be very focused on closing deals during the quarter, and we expect that unearned revenue will likely return to normal seasonal patterns. 
Beginning with the Windows division. We expect revenue to grow slightly faster than the overall PC market in the fourth quarter. Attach, inventory and premium mix gains should more than offset macro trends, particularly that of emerging markets growing faster than mature markets. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. We are very excited about the launch of Office 2010 this June, as it will provide the best productivity experience across the PC, phone and browser. A combination of Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, Exchange 2010 and Office Communications Server will be the practical platform for IT, delivering anywhere access to your documents and unmatched collaboration. 
For the fourth quarter, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should track towards PC shipment growth, while we expect annuity revenue to be up low-single digits. 
The Server & Tools business generally aligns to server hardware shipments and business IT spending. Similar to many observers, we expect server shipments to show healthy year-over-year growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect that non-annuity revenue should move generally in line with hardware shipments. Annuity revenue should growth mid-single digits, while enterprise services revenue should grow low-single digits. 
For the Online Services division, the outlook for online advertising appears to be improving, and we expect the trends from the third quarter to continue. Excluding the impact of our legacy Access business, revenue should be in line with or better than the market for the fourth quarter. 
In the Entertainment and Devices division, we maintain our view expressed last earnings call that full year revenue should be roughly flat relative to the prior year. This translates into a fairly robust growth rate for the fourth quarter, driven by the uplift from the strong PC market, increased gaming attach revenue and momentum in Windows Embedded. 
Switching to costs. We continued to make good progress containing our cost of goods sold despite the upward pressure of increased traffic acquisition costs in our Search business and growth of our Online Services. As a result of our operational initiative, improved Xbox 360 console costs and a continuing favorable revenue mix, we now expect full year gross margin to expand 1% compared to the prior year. 
With regard to operating expenses, we remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and aligning resources to key priorities. For the full year, we are lowering our operating expense guidance, now expected to be between $26.1 billion and $26.3 billion. 
We estimate that our capital spending for the year will be no more than $2 billion, and our effective tax rate should be approximately 25% for both the quarter and the year. We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and will return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases over the long run, though the amount of repurchases may vary from quarter-to-quarter. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to fiscal year 2011, with more details to follow at our Financial Analyst Meeting in July. From a macro perspective, we expect the business refresh cycle, that I referenced earlier, will continue through fiscal year 2011. This, combined with strong momentum from Windows 7 and the launches of Office 2010, SharePoint 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2, will be significant revenue drivers for our core businesses. 
Switching to online. We expect the online advertising market to be better than fiscal year 2010. Our business should continue to grow faster than the market, excluding our legacy Access business, which will be less of a headwind, as it becomes a smaller portion of the mix. We expect our partnership with Yahoo! will begin to contribute to our revenue the second half of the fiscal year. 
Lastly, the Entertainment and Devices division will be introducing an unprecedented wave of innovation in the first half of the year, including Natal and its launch title, as well as Halo Reach, Fable III and Windows Phone 7. 
Now moving to cost of goods sold. It's important to consider the shift of revenue mix across software, services and hardware. While there are a number of factors to weigh for next year, the single largest variable driving cost of goods sold will be hardware demand in the Xbox business. Additionally, we will continue to pursue operational efficiency as we have throughout this year. 
Switching to operating expenses. We are currently working through our budgeting process and maintain our outlook of $27.0 billion to $27.5 billion. All of this will allow us to continue to generate exceptional operating cash flow, which we will continue to return to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. 
So in summary, we delivered very good financial results for the quarter with strong demand for Windows 7 driving revenue growth, and solid cost management enabling operating income and earnings per share to grow even faster. As we look forward, we are encouraged by improving market conditions taking shape as we continue to launch our strongest wave of products in the company's history. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill and answer some of your questions.",988

It looks like non-annuity revenue grew a little bit slower than server units. And I guess you're seeing an uplift in version mix there, which should be helping the situation.

There's actually two pieces of the Non-Annuity business or the Transactional business, the Windows Server piece and then the other piece of the business. The Windows Server non-annuity piece actually grew mid-teens. So track towards the hardware market. The other products, things like SQL Server and Visual Studio grew slower than that in anticipation of a product release [indiscernible]. So it tends to be less correlated, particularly in quarters where there is a significant growth year-over-year. So that was the issue there. In terms of looking forward, I think we gave the guidance on what we expect for the transactional business, particularly as we launch Visual Studio and SQL Server, tracking more towards the server hardware market.",127

As we near the release, I was hoping you could talk to us about how you're thinking about what the impact should be, what you think about with respect to the average selling price opportunity around Office.

So typically what you see -- since we're launching it in the May/June time frame, typically what you see is several quarters after that, the impact of that. So you should see that in the first half of fiscal year '11. In terms of average selling prices, it's a little hard to talk about that now. So it's going to be a function of obviously mix. But I would just think about it the way the Office 2007 launch was. The one thing I would add to that, where you will see it is in the platform side of the business. So when you see the enterprise cow and how we monetize the enterprise versions of the productivity infrastructure for SharePoint on exchange is where you'll see opportunities for overall revenue growth from an ASP perspective for MBD all a lot [ph].",164

As you look out to Q4, your guidance would suggest actually a sequential decline in the operating margin and yet you should be hitting pretty strong product cycles still on Windows and Office beginning to come into the mix. Why wouldn't we get more margin expansion in Q4? And then as you look at fiscal '11 costs, what are the puts and takes of why costs go up versus what other measures you can do to keep them down?",112
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,60.0,58609.0,4419319.0,Answer,Peter Klein,,Executives,17,"Yes, the biggest thing driving the Q4 expenses is revenue-driven expenses that are associated with primarily our Enterprise Annuity business, which are going to be up a fair amount both sequentially and year-over-year. And so that's the biggest thing you'll see in Q4. The other thing you'll see in Q4 is, as I talked about, the wave of product launches that we've got coming, including Office 2010 and SQL Server. So just what's happening this quarter is sort of not unique, but those are the things that are really driving what you're seeing in Q4. And of course, those have been embedded in our guidance all year long and the fact of the matter is, we've been trying  to manage our costs as softly as possible and bring it down whenever can, which we did this quarter. The dynamics in FY '11, as you know, there's a lot of puts and takes and we're always prioritizing and aligning our investments. But all up, you should think the things that are driving it are similar. There's some revenue driven as we continue to grow revenue. And there's also some sales and marketing associated with some key launches that we'll have particularly in the first half of the year related to the Consumer businesses like Natal and Phone. And I would say, keep in mind, that is a pretty measured increase of only 3% to 5% for the full year.",238

One, that is true, particularly when there's so many products that are launching. So there's a bunch of revenue that's going to come through on the non-annuity side that people are waiting for launches for. And I do think that hardware, if you think about sort of what's happened over the last year, the first thing that got hit and decreased earliest and fastest was hardware. And that's what's coming back first. And I think over time, as we've been saying, and I think most other people are saying, over the course of calendar 2010 and certainly into 2011, you'll start to see the growth in the overall IT spend. For us in particular, from a sales-cycle perspective, Q4 is just seasonally our biggest quarter. And so when you combine sort of the sales cycle and the product cycle, kind of converging on Q4 and beyond, as well as sort of where we are I think in the stage of what businesses are doing in terms of first refreshing their hardware. That kind of converges over the next two or three quarters probably.",189

And certainly, attach and piracy are always going to sort of cycle up and down, depending on where you are. We're working through this year sort of a work down of the inventory from last year, and we're still working that. We're at sort of normal inventory levels. That's been a good year-over-year thing for us. And attach, correct, part of that is piracy related to the launch of Windows 7. All of those things -- so we've given you specific color for Q4, what to expect for the OEM business relative to the PC business. The other thing is just there's just -- overall, I think we've talked about it on prior calls, an overall secular change, which is the multinational OEMs are becoming a more significant portion of the total PC market. And that does good things for our attach relative to the prior mix of our revenue from different PC manufacturers.",165

Now the impact you get from the business segment, obviously is some ASP uplift. And you get the corporate refresh in two ways. You can get sort of buying licensing upgrades or you can get OEM when they buy the PCs, which is the largest piece of the revenue. And that's what we started to see happen and you saw some of that impact this quarter with business PC shipments up 14%. That's the sort of the shape of the opportunity going forward as that continues. And you can see that has an uplift on our OEM revenue relative to the overall PC market.",124

I'm very pleased to share with all of you our strong financial results. We achieved record revenue, operating income and earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
This quarter, our strong revenue performance was both broad and deep, with every business achieving double-digit growth. Strong sales execution closed the year with fourth quarter bookings increasing 27%. For the year, both the Windows division and Server & Tools business achieved record revenue. 
We are equally enthusiastic about the customer and product momentum we've achieved this year across the breadth of our portfolio. Of course, I have to start by noting Windows 7, which has received tremendous market response. With $175 million licenses sold to date, it is the fastest-selling operating system ever and now runs on over 15% of all PCs worldwide. Capitalizing on the recovery of the server hardware market, Windows Server 2008 R2 has enjoyed strong demand and increased Windows Server market share. 
With the launches of Exchange 2010, and most recently Sharepoint 2010 and Office 2010, we delivered key innovations in our productivity portfolio. Equally as important for our long-term growth, we made significant strides in our cloud initiatives by bringing Windows Azure to market and by increasing customer traction with our commercial online services. 
Throughout the year, we continued to update and enhance Bing, which has now achieved 13 consecutive months of market share growth. And finally, we focused on consumers with our new Xbox 360 console and the announcements of Connect and Windows Phone 7 coming to market this holiday season. 
Meanwhile, as a result of our ongoing commitment to managing costs, we held annual operating expenses roughly flat. Our continued revenue strength and cost discipline drove yet another consecutive quarter of margin expansion and record annual profits in the Windows division, Server & Tools business and Entertainment and Devices division as well as the company in total. 
We grew full year operating income by almost $4 billion and generated operating cash flow of $24 billion. Of this amount, we returned about 2/3 or almost $16 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. 
Finally, I'm particularly pleased by our growth in earnings per share of 50% for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year. So it's been a great fiscal year and an outstanding fourth quarter. With those remarks, I'll now turn the call over to Bill to provide more details on the quarter.",415
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2064.0,69551.0,5115044.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. As I review this quarter's performance, keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last year unless I specify otherwise. 
As Peter noted in his opening remarks, we finished the year with terrific financial results. Total revenue for the quarter grew 22% to over $16 billion, a record fourth quarter result. Windows, Online Services, Entertainment and Devices, Server & Tools, the Business division, each of our operating segments grew revenue double-digits this quarter reflecting broad-based strength across all of our businesses. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income grew 49% while EPS grew 50%. 
Looking at the full year and adjusting for the Tech Guarantee, we had four consecutive quarters of margin expansion with the EPS growing faster than revenue every quarter. Operating cash flow was up 46% to a fourth quarter record, $5.6 billion. As for the year, operating cash flow surpassed $24 billion as Peter noted, also a record. 
Customer demand was strong across the breadth of the Microsoft portfolio this quarter as we saw total bookings growth accelerate to 27%. In the Enterprise, businesses continued to invest in and commit to the Microsoft platform. Sales execution and Enterprise Agreement renewal rates have improved as unearned revenue at the end of the quarter was $14.8 billion, up a very healthy 21% sequentially. The contracted not billed balance ended the year over a record $15 billion. 
The small and midmarket customer segments continued to experience robust growth and was up approximately 20%. Finally, continuing a trend this year, consumer demand was fantastic with growth in Windows, Office, Search and Xbox. Geographically, we saw strength across all regions led by emerging markets. Growth in the U.S. improved this quarter, while demand in Europe remained healthy. 
The PC market continues to thrive, and we estimate the market grew between 22% and 24% with both consumer and business growing in the same range. From a geographic perspective, emerging markets remain a significant driver of the PC market with almost twice the growth of mature markets. 
With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the Windows and Windows Live division. Windows revenue grew over $1 billion dollars or 32% this quarter when adjusted for the Windows Tech Guarantee last year. Total OEM license growth was 26% and outpaced the PC markets for the third quarter in a row. Consumer and business licenses both grew approximately 26%. The business PC refresh cycle has accelerated, and we recorded the second straight quarter of double-digit business license growth. 
As in past quarters, to help you bridge PC growth to OEM revenue growth, we have provided a reconciliation slide in our earnings deck. At 31% growth, adjusted Windows OEM revenue outgrew PC shipments by seven percentage points this quarter. The hardware segment mix was a three-point headwind to revenue. As I mentioned earlier, emerging markets continued to outpace mature markets. 
Windows attach and inventory drove six percentage points of growth. We exited the quarter with normal inventory levels and continue to benefit from solid attached gains in both Business and Consumer. 
Finally, up sell and channel dynamics drove seven percentage points of growth reflecting a higher Windows 7 offering mix. Enterprise's option of Windows 7 accelerated and the non-OEM portion of the Windows division grew 36%, driven by an increase in volume licensing to businesses and retail sales of Windows 7. 
Clearly, the Windows franchise is thriving. Importantly, customer satisfaction for Windows 7 is incredibly high at 94% and businesses are deploying Windows 7 in the Enterprise. In the browser, IE8 is now the fastest-growing and most popular Web browser in the market with IE9 coming soon. 
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted 14% revenue growth in the fourth quarter and had a record year with $14.9 billion of revenue. We estimate the underlying server hardware market grew 25% to 28%. Non-annuity revenue grew approximately 20%. Windows Server grew with the market, while SQL Server 2008 R2 and Visual Studio developer tools also contributed to the growth.
Annuity revenue, which is approximately 50% of the business, grew about 15% with improved Enterprise demand. From a product perspective, Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center all experienced double-digit growth. Enterprise Services about 20% of revenue grew 3%. 
Windows Server continues to gain share as businesses replace and procure new hardware in the data center. We estimate Windows server grew its market share over one percentage point while at the same time increasing premium mix to about 25%. Our virtualization suites almost doubled this quarter. 
In addition to the share gains in the traditional Server market, Microsoft is leading the way to the cloud with our Windows Azure services platform. Just last week, at the Worldwide Partner Conference, we unveiled a number of new cloud innovations and partnerships, further increasing the alignment between our on-premise Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center products with the Azure platform. 
Next, I'll move on to the Online Services division, which grew 13%. The Online advertising component of the division grew 19% primarily driven by our Search business, which again outperforms the market. We continue to be encouraged by Bing's ongoing share gains due to the pace of exciting innovation and differentiation it brings to the market. June marks the 13th consecutive month of share gains in the U.S., which is now up over four points since launch. 
Turning to the Microsoft Business division, revenue grew 15%, and Office 2010 is off to a great start. Consumer revenue, which includes OEM and retail, grew 51% following the launch of Office 2010, heading back into the back-to-school season. 
The business portion of MBD grew 8%, non-annuity license sales jumped 15% trending toward PC shipment growth as expected. The annuity licensing portion of the business grew 6% driven by an increase in Enterprise demand. Office and the integration with SharePoint, Office Communications Server and Dynamics CRM had strong demand, and each of these products grew double-digits this quarter. 
The cloud enhances these productivity scenarios, and our customers are purchasing suites of our online services at an increasing pace. 70% of our business productivity online seats represent new business to Microsoft. 
Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, which grew 27%. Gaming revenue grew 30% as we sold 1.5 million consoles, a unit increase of 26% taking share as we grew faster than the overall market. Xbox Live continues to be a tremendous asset with over 25 million members. This year marked the first time that Xbox Live digital marketplace revenue exceeded subscription revenue, illustrating the services' increasing level of customer engagement and monetization. 
Non-gaming revenue was up 23% driven by growth in Windows Embedded and sales of PC accessories that generally align to PC market growth. This quarter at E3, we unveiled Kinect, the Xbox 360 motion sensor, which will enable you to play games and control your music and movies with just your voice or a wave of your hand, no controller required. Earlier this week, we announced product and pricing for the all-new Kinect experience. The Kinect experience, with more than 15 games available this holiday, begins in North America on November 4. 
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Foreign exchange had a 2% positive impact to revenue this quarter. We experienced a headwind from the euro as one would expect, but this was more than offset by our hedging program and the dollar weakening in other currencies. Cost of goods sold increased 23% to $3.2 billion driven primarily by increased online costs, royalties and other charges. 
Operating expenses were $6.9 billion in the quarter under our guidance range, and we are very pleased with the Q4 execution and fiscal discipline. Headcount decreased 4% year-over-year. We repurchased $3.8 billion of shares and paid $1.1 billion of dividends. 
So to wrap up, our product cycle momentum continues with the release of Office 2010 and the breadth of our portfolio which drove record results. Our cost discipline remains strong. In the cloud, we have great momentum and are seeing businesses invest in the Microsoft platform. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.",1360

I'll now share our thoughts on the first quarter and total fiscal year 2011. We are entering the year with great momentum. We are encouraged by the resurgence in business PC shipments and expect the business PC refresh cycle to continue through fiscal year 2011. The recent refresh of our Enterprise product has positioned us well to meet customers' needs and they return to investing in information technology. 
Turning to our outlook by business. We expect Windows division revenue to grow roughly in line with PC shipments for the first quarter and full year, excluding the $700 million revenue impact from the Windows 7 retail launch and $276 million from the Technology Guarantee revenue carried over from fiscal year 2009. For the Microsoft Business Division, consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the total, should continue to track with their PC shipment growth rates for the first quarter and full year. Annuity revenue for the first quarter and full year should grow low- to mid-single digits. 
Moving to the Server & Tools business. For the first quarter, we expect non-annuity revenue to be up mid- to high-single digits as first quarter bookings are sales cycle driven and tend to be the softest seasonal quarter irrespective of hardware shipments. For the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue to generally track with the hardware market. We expect Annuity revenue to grow roughly high-single digits for the first quarter and full year. Enterprise Services revenue should grow mid-single digits. 
For the Online Services division, our online advertising business should outperform the overall online advertising market. Regarding our Search partnership with Yahoo!, we are working closely with them to migrate both algorithmic and paid traffic in North America for this holiday season. 
And finally, I'll cover the Entertainment and Devices division. Based upon the compelling wave of consumer offerings coming to market, we expect revenue will grow in the mid-teens for the first quarter and full year following its normal seasonal skew to the first half of the year. 
Moving to cost of goods sold. Gross margins will be impacted by product mix and particularly by the increase in hardware sales that will drive growth in the Entertainment and Devices division. We remain focused on diligently managing our cost structure and are lowering our full year operating expense guidance to between $26.9 billion and $27.3 billion, which includes our estimate of Yahoo! Search integration expenses. We expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 25%. 
Pushing to the balance sheet, we expect that the first quarter unearned revenue balance will track to normal historical patterns on a sequential basis after adjusting for the impact of Tech Guarantees in the prior year. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 will be about $2.5 billion. This will be the second year in a row in which CapEx spending will be lower than depreciation expense. We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. 
So in summary, I'm very pleased by our outstanding financial results for the quarter and the full year. We have great product momentum in the market with strong business and consumer demand for our most recent wave of products. With the exciting pipeline of consumer products arriving to market this holiday season, we are well positioned to continue this momentum this coming year. 
On that note, I'm looking forward to seeing all of you at our Financial Analyst Meeting next week and I'll now return the call to Bill so that we can begin taking your questions.",599

But obviously, we're super happy with both the sort of state of the PC market and the customer traction for Windows 7. We think tablets are very interesting and remind us that there are always new scenarios and new opportunities, and we're constantly working with our partners and our OEM partners. In fact, I think one of the things that's driven the PC market and Windows growth this year has been the work we've done with our OEM partners on multiple scenarios and form factors and price points in all those. Tablets, I think, are interesting and great because I think they sort of enlarge the overall opportunity; I think they're additive to the opportunity, and again, it reminds us that there are lots of interesting new scenarios that we are continuing to work on. And so we're excited by that.",158

In terms of the Annuity business, obviously, this is in terms of the deferred revenue that we've had the last year or year and a half, has been slow. And so we're kind of digging out of that hole of the recognitions that we have from the deferred revenue balance. And so in the course of this year, we'll be building that back up. And as I said, we expect Q1 unearned revenue to also return to normal historical sequential patterns. So we feel good about sort of the opportunity to continue to drive bookings with Office, but in terms of the Annuity revenue recognized growth, that's impacted by sort of the billings that we saw over the course of the last year. But having said that, we're certainly very optimistic about business uptake of Office 2010.",155

This is an ongoing process, something we think about every day. And so continually as we go through, we're always scrubbing, we're always looking at our plans, we're always looking to make the most effective use of the money.

And also your unearned metric which you reported is well above what it has been, the highest it's been in eight quarters. Yet at the same time, the guidance for the annuity in growth rate, it still sounds like we're in the recession, listening to your guidance on what seems to be low- to mid-single digits. Can you help us understand the disconnect here? It seems to me that you're being a little bit conservative with your annuity guidance for what seems to be two big product lines given the improvement in bookings off balance sheet, on balance sheet. So it occurs to me that as the deferred revenues start to build up, in your words, and there's normal seasonality that you should take your guidance up in the next few quarters. So comments or reactions, explanation would be appreciated.",159

So the recognitions in the Annuity revenue that you're seeing next year in the reported number is a function of sort of the challenges we've had on our deferred balance. And so as we build up over time, you'll start to see the Annuity business do better. So that's what you'll see as you get towards the latter part of next year because this is the first quarter where we really saw that unearned balance take off.",111

And so the reason we like to give you the drivers, it allows you the flexibility to kind of work that through your model as you come up with your product mix.",115

As we talked about -- so on the sort of commercial, you figure the productivity Online Services, as Bill talked about, 70% of those wins have been competitive wins, which has just been really good. So we're really accelerating the traction there. On the Azure side, it's early. We just launched that this year. The productivity Online Services are farther along from a customer perspective, but we've really accelerated the developers and the users we have on the Azure platform. It's not material to the financials now, but we're really sort of establishing a leadership position in that of users. And we've had some, on the productivity side, we've had some great wins. We had the state of Kentucky, which has many, many, 700,000 users. So acceleration and continued progress in leadership in that.",135

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be able to share with you our excellent results for the first quarter, which reflect the ongoing strength and breadth of our product portfolio.
 Demand from both businesses and consumers drove healthy revenue growth. We delivered record first quarter revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
 We continue to control costs while prioritizing our investments into the highest growth opportunities, resulting in another quarter of margin expansion. As we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in July, we have eight core focus areas that we feel have the greatest opportunity to drive shareholder value.
 This quarter, we had exceptional momentum across these focus areas and I want to start today's call by giving you some important highlights.
 First, Microsoft Business Desktop is thriving with Enterprises and small- and medium-size businesses investing in our products and services. Not only are companies adopting Windows 7 and Office 2010 at historically high rates, they are also investing in our Office productivity platform, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics CRM and Lync, the newly rebranded Office Communication server, all of which grew double digits this quarter.
 Server and Database businesses had strong momentum as our data center and cloud offerings remain a top priority for our customers as they continue to adopt the Microsoft platform.
 In addition, Windows Azure had strong subscription growth and we announced a number of platform enhancement this morning at our Professional Developers Conference.
 As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, consumer demand for our products continue to drive terrific results this quarter. In terms of our core focus areas, Xbox momentum continued with our console outselling every competing console in the U.S. for the fourth consecutive month, being used at an all-time high with almost double the number of queries since its launch last year. And consumers continue to show their strong preference for Windows 7 and Office 2010.
 Customer satisfaction across our products remains at record-high levels. We also made exciting progress in the mobile space with the recent launch of Windows Phone 7 in Europe and Asia and the upcoming November 8 launch in the U.S..
 So in summary, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter. We executed well in all of our core focus areas, and are off to a good start for the year.
 With that, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on the quarter's results.

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2216.0,86620.0,8524480.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,4," Thanks, Peter. I'll start today by noting that all of my comments are adjusted for the $1.5 billion of revenue, which was deferred in the first quarter of last year. As you probably recall, this deferral was related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Program and Windows 7 licenses sold in advance of general availability in the first quarter of last year.
 We've reconciled this non-GAAP view to GAAP results in our earnings slide deck. All growth comparisons I make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless I specify otherwise. Okay, now to our results.
 We started this fiscal year with great financial performance. Total revenue for the company was up 13% to $16.2 billion. Operating income and EPS grew 20% and 19%, respectively, again, outpacing revenue growth.
 Bookings for the company were up an outstanding 24% this quarter. Bookings growth over the last three quarters was the highest in the last three years. Operating cash flow passed $8 billion for the first time ever, and was up 34%.
 A number of the demand patterns and trends we saw in the second half of our fiscal year 2010 were sustained through the first quarter of 2011. In the first quarter, consumer demand for Office 2010 and Xbox were outstanding. And we're pleased with the continued adoption and growth of Windows 7 and Bing.
 Sales to small and medium businesses were exceptionally strong with revenue up over 30%. This growth was partially due to a greater level of partner engagement as we had an increase of over 15% in the number of partners selling Microsoft products around the world.
 We also saw strengthening trends in the Enterprise segment despite what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. Our compelling product portfolio across Windows, Server & Tools in the Microsoft Business  is driving increased Enterprise Agreement renewals.
 Unearned revenue at the end of the quarter was $13.9 billion due to the strength in Enterprise Agreements. The contracted net build balance ended the quarter over $16 billion, significantly above prerecession levels. Geographically, emerging markets continue to significantly outperform the rest of the world. Growth in the U.S. and Europe remains stable and healthy.
 We see customers of all sizes embracing cloud services from Microsoft. Organizations are leveraging our Commercial and Educational Online Services to run their businesses and institutions, while consumers are increasingly using services like Xbox Live, Windows Live and Office Web App. Microsoft has significant cloud momentum and we are leading the industry through this transformation.
 Turning to the PC market. We estimate PCs grew between 9% and 11% in the first quarter. Consumer PCs grew single digits, while the business PCs grew mid-teens as the business hardware refresh remain strong.
 From a geographic perspective, we estimate emerging market PCs grew over 3x the rate of mature markets. Regarding netbook trends, we have seen consumer shift from buying netbooks to low-end notebook, and we have not seen a material shift away from low-end PCs due to tablets in the market. Instead, we've predominantly seen consumers increase their number of devices and their usage scenarios.
 Going forward, we see a strong pipeline of innovation from our partners for new Windows form factors. With that PC backdrop, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, which grew 10%.
 Windows 7 drove the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for the division. In the first quarter, Windows OEM revenue, which represents approximately 75% of the Windows and Windows Live division, was up 11%. In our earnings slide deck, we provide the usual bridge, from revenue usual revenue bridge to market, but in summary, the overall dynamics to the market were as expected with strength in business PCs and emerging markets.
 Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted a great quarter with 12% revenue growth. We estimate the underlying server hardware market grew mid-teens. Non-annuity revenue grew approximately 15% with Windows Server growing in line with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue growth was roughly 10% and Enterprise Services grew 9%.
 At the Financial Analysts Meeting in July, we discussed the assets and momentum of our Server & Tools portfolio. Let me provide some additional context to the underlying momentum and adoption this quarter.
 As Peter mentioned, our data center and cloud offerings are top priority for businesses. We estimate Windows Server usage share grew 1.5 points, while at the same time Windows Server Premium mix grew four points. System center revenue growth grew over 20%. And within that, revenue from server virtualization suites grew over 50%. Our virtualization share continues to grow as ID reports Hyper V share of newly virtualized hosts double over the past year to 16.5%.
 Windows Azure is gaining traction and has grown subscriptions 40% sequentially. This morning at PDC, we announced a number of platform enhancements, as Peter mentioned. These enhancements will help customers build new application and migrate existing applications to the cloud and allow developers and ISPs to build unique applications with the richest data set possible.
 Next. I'll move to the Online Services division, which grew 8%. The online advertising component of this division grew 13%, primarily driven by our Search business, which again outperformed the market leader.
 Yesterday, Bing reached a significant milestone with the Yahoo! partnership. Through diligent efforts on behalf of both companies, Bing is now powering Yahoo!'s algorithmic and case search results in the U.S. and Canada.
 Turning to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 14%. In the fourth quarter, I comment is that the markets' reception to Office 2010 has been phenomenal and the first quarter was no different. Consumer revenue grew 26% from continued launch momentum.
 Office 2010's unit sales are 20% ahead of Office 2007 over the same time period. In addition, our three Office Web App now has more than 20 million users since our June launch. This business portion of MBD [ Microsoft Business Division] grew 11% with the non-annuity sales of Office 2010 up almost 50%.
 We've seen strong demand from small and medium customers and PCs has rebounded from the year-ago levels. The multiyear licensing portion of the business grew about 5%. We've spoken with you about the Office productivity platform strategy, which includes Office, SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics CRM and Lync, and we've seen strong momentum and renewal rate with our 2010 offering.
 Let me give you some of the underlying product momentum in MBD. Lync grew 25% and the new version is expected to be available in our second fiscal quarter. Dynamic CRM, which just released a new beta this quarter, grew healthy double digits. Sales of Exchange and SharePoint, which are each $1 billion-plus businesses, also grew healthy double digits. Enterprises are adopting the entire business productivity infrastructure. They now have unparalleled choice when deploying their applications in their own data center or in the cloud.
 During the quarter, we announced a number of significant cloud wins, including the city of New York last week. The number of business customers licensing our cloud services has more than tripled in the last year.
 In education, we now have over 10,000 schools and 11 million students signed up for our Live@edu  service. On October 19, we announced the next generation of our cloud productivity service, Office 365. Office 365 brings together Lync, SharePoint, Exchange and Office Professional plus Desktop software in an always up-to-date cloud service, and is designed to meet the needs of organizations of all types and sizes.
 From a business model perspective, Office 365 creates new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners and enables new scenarios that weren't viable in the past. With Office 365, we can reach more people, we will sell more to each customer and we will increase customer satisfaction. Office 365 will be available worldwide in calendar 2011.
 Okay. Let's move on to the Entertainment and Devices division, which grew 27%, reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. We sold 2.8 million consoles this quarter, a unit increase of 38%. In the U.S., the new Xbox 360 console has outsold all other platforms since its introduction, resulting in a record first quarter shipment.
 Halo Reach also had a solid launch this quarter, reaching approximately $350 million in revenue. The Halo effect extended to Xbox Live, which continues strong membership growth this quarter.
 Windows Phone 7 launched last week in Europe and Asia and we eagerly anticipate the introduction in the U.S. on November 8.
 Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 10% to $3.1 billion, driven primarily by increased Xbox hardware volume and online costs. Operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6%.
 In the first quarter, we repurchased $4 billion of shares, returned $1.4 billion through dividend and increased our dividend rate 23%.
 So in summary, we're off to a great financial start for the year with 24% bookings growth. We've seen strong business spending across Windows, Server & Tools and the Microsoft Business Division in both traditional and cloud offering, and our cloud momentum continued, our consumer momentum continued. And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter who's going to continue to discuss our business outlook.

Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2011. According to many recent surveys, Enterprise IT spend should continue to grow for the remainder of the fiscal year. With the depth and breadth of our offerings, we are well-positioned to grow our share of the IT spending market.
 We expect business PC and server hardware purchasing to remain the high priority for most businesses. The business PC refresh cycle should continue through at least the remainder of this fiscal year. As was the case this quarter, we expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth, and emerging market growth to outpace developed market growth.
 And we're confident that tablets will expand the PC market and we're enthusiastic about our opportunity, along with our partners, to bring Windows to additional form factors and new usage scenario. Windows will continue to provide the choice and value that customers want across devices.
 With that back up, I'll now turn to segment expectation. Windows division revenue should go roughly in line with the PC market for the second quarter and the full year, when excluding the impact of the prior-year Tech Guarantee and revenue attributed to the launch spike.
 For the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, you should exclude $1.7 billion of revenue related to the Tech Guarantee and $600 million of revenue related to the launch spike. For the full year, you should exclude $300 million and $700 million, respectively, the latest of these events.
 Moving on to Server & Tools. For Q2 and the full year, we expect non-annuity revenue approximately 30% of the total, to generally track with the hardware market. Multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 50% of the total, should grow high-single digits for the second quarter and low-double digits for the full fiscal year.
 Services, which is the remaining 20%, should grow mid-single digits for both the second quarter and the full fiscal year.
 Turning to expectations for the Microsoft Business Division. Consumer and business non-annuity revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total revenue, should continue to track the PC shipment growth rates for the second quarter and the fiscal year.
 We also expect revenue associated with multiyear agreements representing 60% of total revenue, to grow mid- to high-single digits for the second quarter and the fiscal year, as we slowly start to recognize the higher growth billings going on to the balance sheet.
 When updating your model, you should remember that next quarter, in addition to the framework I just provided, you will also recognize approximately $220 million of deferred revenue related to Tech Guarantee.
 For Q2 and the full fiscal year, we expect Online Services division revenue to outperform the online advertising market, reflecting continued organic revenue growth, as well as new revenue associated with our Yahoo! partnership. The majority of Yahoo!-related revenue will be recognized net traffic acquisition costs. We expect the benefits of the integration to occur gradually for the next several quarters.
 And finally, in the Entertainment and Devices division, we're very excited about the launch of Windows Phone 7 and we anticipate that Connect will be the guest this holiday season. Considering the momentum and high-level of consumer interest in our offerings, we expect this division's revenue to go roughly 30% for the second quarter and in the mid-20s for the full fiscal year.
 Switching to cost of goods sold expectations for the company, the biggest factor impacting COGS next quarter will be the expected and significant increase in hardware sales due to the upcoming launch of Kinect. Obviously, Xbox consoles and Kinect have a higher COGS profile relative to revenue than the rest of our business and you should consider this impacting your model.
 Turning to operating expenses, we continue to prioritize our investment and remain diligent on cost controls. We are reconfirming our guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full fiscal year. We expect the low interest-rate environment we experienced in the first quarter to continue through the second quarter and the fiscal year, and for investment income to be fairly consistent with the first quarter level.
 We continue to expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be about $2.5 billion. We expect our effective tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the second quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year.
 Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we expect unearned revenue to roughly follow historic seasonal patterns, excluding the $220 million impact of the Tech Guarantees.
 So with that color for Q2 and the rest of our fiscal year, I want to close by saying that we are extremely pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. We executed well in all of our core focus areas. Products and services we brought to market over the past year are being embraced by our customers. And as a result, our product portfolio is as strong as it has ever been. This, combined with our continued prioritization of investment into the highest growth opportunities will help us drive long-term revenue and earnings per share growth.
 With that, let's take some questions. Bill?

And obviously, the business hardware refresh is a great underlying driver for that business, as well as excitement around the product. And in terms of Office, I think the thing that's most encouraging for me is the breadth of the strength around and across all customer segments, whether that was small- and medium-size businesses and Enterprises. In terms of the integration story, Bill touched on the strong growth across all of those businesses and I think you're really starting to see that resonate very well with customers. And in fact, as we had anticipated when we were talking about anticipating off of 2010, and that was going to be a key part of the story and I think we're starting to see that play out early days, which I think can sustain for a while.

One, just in terms of Enterprise's desire to upgrade, very strong, sort of high level. I think what we're seeing is people actually doing their deployments a little bit faster than I think we expected than we'd seen in the past. In terms of the overall business, obviously we're seeing Enterprise and businesses refresh their hardware, which is obviously a great thing in terms of the Windows 7 business.

Obviously, one is just macroeconomics and businesses investing in IT again. And I think the other is that our product portfolio, and through the combination of those two things has gotten Enterprises really wanting to invest both in their IT infrastructure and in our portfolio of products. And so as we had hoped in the course of the last year, we thought those two things might come together. The last thing I'll say is the accelerated interest in the cloud. It's when you add on top of it where we've come in terms of our cloud offerings and what that means for Enterprises as they think about investing for the long term. They want to invest with somebody who can make the transition from their own premise infrastructure to the cloud as soon as possible. And I think you're seeing that as well. So the conversations that we're having always included our new product portfolio, as well as our cloud offerings. And I think that taking into account the better macroeconomic environment has all come together to really drive a better environment.

My question is about growth. I just want to answer this from a quantitative standpoint. Incrementally rounded to the last two quarters, what's your confidence level in your growth there? I just noticed some of the forward-looking indicators, your business tends to lag with all the spending because you have this annuity model for the most part. Look at the unbilled portion, and that's at a record high. You're renewals, you better priced better than before. The first half have given nicely. What is your incremental confidence with respect to your revenue growth rate considering expenses tied up, I would assume that there's a lot of operating leverage for that incremental revenue.

So I think you're now at 29%. And I believe that at least a few quarters back, Microsoft has suggested that it would be difficult to get this above 30%.
