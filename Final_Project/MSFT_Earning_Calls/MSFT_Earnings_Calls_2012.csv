I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Despite a challenging PC market, we delivered solid financial results. We saw a strong demand for our business products and services and had a record holiday season, driven by the unique entertainment experience we have built with Xbox 360.
This quarter, the strength of our product portfolio enabled us to grow revenue 5% to $20.9 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for a big launch year, we delivered record earnings per share of $0.78. 
Similar to prior periods, we saw a broad-based growth across geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division had another good quarter as businesses and consumers around the world look to Microsoft to meet their productivity needs. Six quarters post-launch, Office 2010 continues to exceed our expectation, with increased consumer and business PC Attach worldwide. 
We saw double-digit revenue growth across our key business application workloads, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics CRM and ERP. As businesses large and small look to the cloud to lower costs and enable new ways of supporting a distributed workforce, they are turning to Microsoft. With Office 365, we give customers powerful productivity and collaboration tools at great value. Today, more than 100,000 businesses have made the commitment to our Online Services. Whether on-premise or in the cloud, Microsoft remains the top choice for productivity. 
The Server & Tools Business delivered another strong quarter, as we continue to execute on our strategy of cloud optimizing every business. CIOs are increasingly turning to our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center as they look to Microsoft for the security, flexibility and manageability they need to build world-class private clouds. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Windows Server Premium revenue and the 11th quarter of double-digit revenue growth for System Center. 
On the data platform, we remain the worldwide unit share leader with SQL Server. Consistent with our strategy, we are growing our revenue share with marquee customer wins on mission-critical workloads and business intelligence capabilities.
This year, we will bring to market the next generation of our server offerings, including Windows Server 8, SQL Server 2012 and System Center 2012, which deepen and broaden our platform for the private cloud. Combined with the power of Windows Azure for the public cloud, our offerings give enterprises the identity, virtualization, application development and management tools they need to efficiently progress into the new era of hybrid IT.
The PC market was challenged this quarter, with particular softness in the consumer segment. However, Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continued and today, over 1/3 of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7. And with the future release of Windows 8, we believe the ecosystem will benefit from the new range of capabilities and scenarios that it enables.
In Search, we saw improvements in RPS this quarter as we partnered closely with Yahoo! to address the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are pleased with the progress and are working hard to continue that trajectory.
In the years since Windows Phone launch, we have worked diligently alongside our partners, including Nokia, to bring a differentiated experience to the mobile platform. Earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show, we showcased the latest innovation in Windows Phone to very positive reviews. With these new devices, we are increasing the choices for consumers around the world to find a Windows Phone that is exactly right for them.
As I mentioned, Xbox 360 had a record holiday season as we continue to differentiate home entertainment. Whether it's using Bing Voice Search on Xbox to quickly find the movies and shows you want to watch or enabling more interactive TV as we demonstrated at CES with Sesame Street and Elmo, Xbox and Kinect are bringing together our technologies to redefine the living room experience. Beyond gaming and entertainment, with the Kinect for Windows program which launches February 1, our technology will further innovation and creativity across industries.
During the quarter, we started the integration of Skype's world-class communication products and global network platform into our portfolio of products and services. While it is still early, we are excited by the momentum we have seen thus far and by the opportunities to redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world.
As I have consistently mentioned, operating expense management is a priority for Microsoft. Reflecting our ongoing discipline and prioritization of investments, operating expenses grew just 4% this quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results despite a challenging PC market. The strength of our product portfolio drove solid top line growth, we delivered record earnings per share and we are well positioned for future growth. 
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results.",823
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2416.0,208931.0,12268305.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was a record $20.9 billion, up 5% or $900 million year-over-year. Operating income was $8 billion, cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion and earnings per share was $0.78. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter.
Enterprise demand remains strong as our customers continue to add both product and seats to their Enterprise Agreement, and our renewal rates remain solid. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.3 billion, and our contracted not billed balance was approximately $19 billion.
Turning to the PC market, as I mentioned last week, it was a challenging quarter for the industry. Factors such as the flooding in Thailand, macroeconomic uncertainty and competing form factors resulted in an overall market that we estimate declined 2% to 4%.
In the PC market, it appears that the impact of the hard drive supply chain constraints were not limited to a specific region or OEM type. While absolute volumes were impacted, we did see the following trends continue: PC sales to emerging markets outpaced developed markets; the business PC refresh cycle continued with business PC growth of 2%; the decline of netbooks negatively impacted consumer PCs which were down 6%. Netbooks, which a year ago represented about 8% of the PC market, now represents only 2%. Excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 2%. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was down 6%. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The primary differences between the PC market and Windows revenue were the continuing growth of emerging markets faster than developed markets and inventory drawdown from the prior quarter. 
We have now sold 525 million Windows 7 licenses since launch. And as Peter mentioned, we are seeing sustained momentum on enterprise deployments. In December, we announced that Windows 8 beta would be available in late February, and we also previewed the Windows Store, which will be the hub where users can discover and download applications. For developers, the Windows Store represents a significant opportunity given its broad reach, flexibility and favorable economic terms.
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 3%. Recall in Q2 last year that we recognized $224 million of revenue for the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee Program. And if you exclude that, revenue grew 7% for the quarter. 
Consumer revenue declined 17% year-over-year and declined 2% when factoring in the impact of the Technology Guarantee Program that I just mentioned. The outperformance relative to the overall PC market was driven by Attach games, which continued despite being 18 months since the launch of Office 2010.
Business revenue grew 9%. And within Business, multiyear licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew 3%, driven by strong Attach worldwide.
We continue to see strong growth in our productivity solution offerings. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange each grew double digits. We've previously shared with you the opportunity that we see for unified communications, and we are beginning to realize that potential. Lync revenue grew over 30% as customers such as Volkswagen and LA Fitness chose Microsoft to be their voice and video solution.
This quarter, Office 365 became this first major cloud provider to comply with leading EU and U.S. standards for data protection. Meeting these high standards enables businesses to more fully realize the potential of the cloud. We also had our first major service enhancement to Office 365, which extends the company's next-generation cloud productivity service to reach businesses in 22 additional markets. 
During the quarter, companies such as JetBlue, Campbell Soup, Patagonia and Wunderman chose Office 365 to enable their employees and customers to work together in the cloud. We are also pleased with the momentum and cloud services for education, where we now have more than 22 million users, a 100% increase over the prior year.
Our Dynamics business continued its momentum, where revenue grew double digits both in CRM and ERP. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. Dynamics CRM had important competitive wins this quarter against Salesforce.com and Oracle, such as Safety-Kleen Systems and the American Heart Association. The common theme among switchers was that Dynamics CRM has a familiar user interface, which improves productivity while delivering lower operating costs than the competition. 
Now let's move on to Server & Tools where revenue grew 11%, driven by multiyear license revenue that was up mid-teens in Enterprise Services. We saw broad-based strength across our products. In our data platform business, SQL Server grew low double-digits, outpacing industry growth due to the strength of our premium edition. This quarter, we saw competitive database wins against Oracle such as U.K.-based retailer, The Co-operative Group, which switched to SQL Server because of its advantages in business intelligence, security, flexibility and cost. We also saw a strong market anticipation for SQL Server 2012 with over 100,000 downloads in the 2 months since the release candidate was made available.
In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew over 20%. On Tuesday, we announced System Center 2012 which brings many of our Azure cloud capabilities to an integrated private cloud management solution for the first time. We also announced great competitive wins against VMware with accounts such as T. Rowe Price, Unilever and Lufthansa Systems. 
System Center 2012 integrates each separate component products into one unified solution, streamlining installation and reducing the time it takes to deploy from days down to hours. Additionally, we've provided a clear path to Windows Azure for customers who are looking for a public or hybrid cloud solution.
In the public cloud, our December release of Azure enhanced ease-of-use and simplified deployment, as well as delivered new open source capabilities with Hadoop support. We are seeing strong growth in the number of large customers signing up to use Azure. One such example is Sony Pixar's Crackle online content service, which has moved to Azure due to the cost savings, agility and performance it provides. 
Now I'll move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 10% and operating performance improved for the second consecutive quarter. Online advertising revenue was up 13%, driven primarily by Search. The increase in Search revenue was driven by both rate and volume improvement. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 15.1%, up 40 basis points this quarter and over 300 basis points year-over-year.
Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division, where revenue grew 15%. According to a third-party research, Xbox was the #1 console in the U.S. during calendar year 2011 and had 46% of U.S. console sales in December. During the quarter, we sold 8.2 million consoles, which was up over 25% despite a soft gaming console market. Kinect continues to impress customers with 18 million Kinects having been sold since launch just over 1 year ago. Xbox LIVE members grew 33%, with 40 million users now enjoying Xbox LIVE.
In December, Xbox released the new Metro style dashboard and added dozens of new entertainment applications and content partners to the platform. While it is early, engagement has been quite impressive as the number of people using entertainment apps from November to December increased by almost 50%.
We continue to make progress with Windows Phone. During the quarter, Nokia began to bring some of their great new devices to market, which adds to the growing list of compelling phones available from our OEM partners. At CES, the talk of the show was the new LTE Windows Phones from Nokia and HTC that will be available on AT&T in the coming months, joining the Lumia 710, which is now available on T-Mobile. 
In October, Skype officially joined Microsoft. This quarter, over 200 million people used Skype to communicate with family, friends and businesses. For calendar year 2011, over 300 billion minutes of calls were made over the Skype network, an increase of 50%. The teams are working closely on the integration across Microsoft, and we will share more as we get further along the road map.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 17%, driven by the following: first, we saw an increase in costs resulting from the strong Xbox console sales and increased Xbox royalties; second, Enterprise Services continue to grow rapidly; and third, Online Services and traffic acquisition costs increased. 
Operating expenses were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4%, driven primarily due to compensation, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. This quarter, we've returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
So in summary, we saw a strong demand from our business customers, and our Xbox platform delivered a record holiday season. We were able to navigate a challenging PC market to deliver solid top line and earnings per share growth. 
With that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.",1510

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year.
Beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Division. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to the past several quarters. PC growth in emerging markets will outpace developed markets, and business PC growth will outpace consumer PC growth. We also expect the hard disk drive shortage to continue to challenge the PC market to at least the next quarter.
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. And multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. 
Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenues comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market, multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double-digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow high teens.
Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business and are looking for ways to increase RPS and streamline costs. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue to show year-over-year improvements in RPS. 
Moving on to the Entertainment & Devices Division. We continue to be very pleased with our share of the worldwide console market. However, the console market is softer than we previously expected, and as a result, we now expect revenue to grow high single-digits for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year.
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing mix of revenue as we have seen the past few quarters. We expect COGS to grow about 8% to 10% for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. 
As a result of our focus on operating expense management, we are lowering our fiscal year guidance. We now expect operating expenses to be $28.5 billion to $28.9 billion for the full fiscal year, including the impact of Skype. This represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6%. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the third quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year.
For the third quarter, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double-digits compared to the prior fiscal year.
As we look forward, we have the strongest product pipeline we have ever had. We're pleased with the early enthusiasm around our upcoming wave of products that enable CIOs to cloud optimize their business. And we are excited by the opportunity to unify the consumer experience across our phones, PCs, tablets and TVs with our new Metro style design.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill and we'll take some questions.",536

As we've been saying, the key to profitability in that business is to grow our top line because it scales really well. The marginal impact of that is very high because it's a high fixed cost business. We have been, as we've been growing share and improving our RPS especially this quarter, holding the line on operating expenses and really streamlining. The most important thing long term, as we’ve said, is to continue to grow that share and grow the revenue per search, so we're pleased with that trajectory and want to keep on that. And we are watching the cost very carefully so that, that revenue marginally goes to the bottom line. And that's what you saw happen this quarter, and that's the trajectory we hope to stay on.",131

It looks like you called out the Nokia payments as part of COGS as a driver. And I'm wondering, you've been pointing us to mix of revenue types as mainly the driver there of COGS. Could you help us out with how meaningful those payments were? And how should we expect those to continue to track as we move into future quarters?",70

There were several things impacting the gross margins in the E&D business. Obviously, one is just the volume of consoles and the mix of consoles, high end versus low end, the mix of software whether it's first party or third party that has a different margin characteristic. And so that's the biggest piece in E&D. Then the Nokia piece is also another piece that plays into that. But the biggest piece is the mix of business in the E&D business and then Nokia is also another driver of that.",94

You guys have said down 2% to 4%, and they helped reconcile that, suggesting that there were some issues in terms of the pipeline of products. And if the inventories were reduced in the pipeline, that might reconcile why the 2 of you are viewing the industry somewhat differently. I'm just curious if you think that's going to continue into the next quarter. I know we're going to see an impact in this next quarter. I'm just curious whether you and Gartner might be more in line with each other going forward? Or if there's more inventory reduction in that pipeline that might be an ongoing impact above and beyond perhaps what we're seeing from the numbers that Gartner and IDC are giving us?",145

I'd say obviously, for this quarter, we obviously are very confident and comfortable with the estimate as we said during the remarks. We expect the impact to continue on at least to the next quarter. And I think the best thing to do is at the end of that, we'll probably all have a better view and we kind of assess where we are and what it looks like going forward. I'd say just generally on the inventory as well, obviously, as I've said in my remarks, there was an inventory drawdown to end the quarter. I think there was an overall -- I think both IDC and Gartner have also talked about the fact that the overall supply chain for PCs is obviously leaner than it was 3 months ago. So we'll have to see how fast kind of people ramp back up, how fast the PC ecosystem rebounds, and that will obviously impact, as Peter mentioned, inventory at the end of the quarter as well. So good question.",176

We've had a lot of good momentum and obviously, one of the things that drive -- you up the sort of margin scale -- is getting the economy to scale with volume, and we talked about some of the numbers, the 100,000 businesses the great sort of demand we've had for sort of the Office business all up including Office 365. So I'd say that's probably farthest along, followed closely by Windows Azure as we sort of add new enterprise customers, new ISVs, new developers to that. But certainly, Office 365 is accelerating at the ramp.",105

And as Peter mentioned earlier, I think in one of the questions, it obviously has achieved scale. And as a result, kind of every incremental kind of search ends up becoming 100% margin. So we are -- we're at different stages, I think, within some of the different business products. But certainly around running a cloud infrastructure, we feel like we've got quite good handle on that from -- primarily from our Search business.",95

It has to do with the Windows OEM revenue bridge. Just curious on some of these items, how they fit today. For instance, and I believe, Bill and Peter, you take account for that inventory changes in the Windows Attach and inventory line. And last quarter, it added about 5% to the quarter. This quarter, it was a 2% hit. And Bill, you noted the inventory drawdown had an effect there. Can you give us a sense on where you think channel inventories are today relative to what you might call normal levels? And then also just quickly on that last line in that bridge, the OEM revenue adjustment, when is this stop -- going to stop being negative? It's been slightly negative for quite some time now. And shouldn't it have stopped like 3 years after the Vista launch because it -- wasn't it related to XP and having Internet Explorer as part of that as a meaningful part of that versus for Vista?",171

Next year, that should go away. So to answer your question, yes, that's what you would expect and that's what will happen. On your first question on inventory, at any given quarter, inventory is going to be -- sort of go up and down depending on what's going on in the channel. As you noted, sometimes, it's a tailwind, sometimes it's a headwind like it was this quarter. It's hard to say precisely what sort of -- where it stands and what it's going to be like next quarter. We'll sort of look at it when we get there.",106

How much of the year-over-year decrease in the consumer revenue on the Offices product is due to licensing, licenses specifically included in OEM sales of PCs as compared to stand-alone Office sales to the consumer market?",39

I mean, the driver that we use for that part of the MBD business is specifically tied with the PC unit growth of consumers.

When you think about the impact of Windows 8 coming out theoretically, obviously, the second half of this year, how do you think that's going to impact build plans amongst the OEMs but also inventory levels when we get to the summer?",51

I think we need to get closer to it. So the thing I would say is just from an ecosystem perspective, there's an incredible amount of excitement and innovation going on across vendors like the chip vendors and all the OEMs. You actually see that starting today with the Ultrabooks that you're seeing with Windows 7. And so the fact of the matter is there's a ton of innovation happening today for Windows 7. There's a ton of excitement for enterprises for both Windows 7 and looking forward to Windows 8, and what that gives them in terms of an end user experience and IT manageability. So I don't think about it so much as looking forward. There's a ton of innovation going on today. You see it in Ultrabooks. You see it in what both the ARM and x86 chip vendors are doing, and so that sort of continues sort of on a regular pace.",163

As you come out of this tough cycle and start to get into this, the next sort of launches, should we think about the gross margins as starting to go in the other direction just based on the -- what looks to be better mix between your Windows -- just typical software businesses as you get into launch year? Part of me it says maybe the margins are bottoming here. Of course, I completely respect the fact that you've got sort of another mix issues that are more longer term as you have Entertainment & Devices business, the cost there, et cetera. But shouldn't margins start to go back up as you head into launch year?",152

Certainly, margins are a function of mix. And to the extent there’s a higher mix and higher margin products, that will have a positive impact on margins. And it's not unrealistic to think that in a launch year, you can see a higher growth in higher-margin products. So it will depend on what the mix is, but I think it's a very plausible scenario.",65

We saw a particular strength in emerging markets, particularly what we call the BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India and China. That was really a driver of growth for us. And that's exciting for us because we've had got strong and growing positions there, and that's where kind of disproportionate economic growth is happening sort of worldwide.

Subscription businesses aren't that much different from our existing multiyear licensing business in the sense that it sort of bills upfront and then recognized over time, just like our multiyear licensing agreements.

I'd say -- the one thing I'd say is the overall business environment sort of remains very strong for us. And so sort of all of our sort of macro indicators for business spending on IT remain good, unearned revenue, our renewals for enterprise licensing agreements and sort of enterprise deployments of Windows 7. In terms of PCs, as we said, there's still growth and we're still in the refresh cycle.

In terms of the seasonality, I don't think there's anything that indicates it's sort of more or less seasonal than we've seen in the past. Like many consumer businesses like this, it will always be relatively stronger at the holiday season. And in terms of some of the mixes, some of it's a function of product cycle. If you think about that Kinect centers and how we sold those into our installed base, and now we're selling more bundles, those kinds of things. Its seasonality hasn't marginally -- hasn't materially shifted.",134

I would say one of the things that Tammy [ph] talked about at CES last week was just how important it is for us to work on and with developers to create a really vibrant developer ecosystem. And so one of the things we also talked about with the beta release was the Windows Store, really making sure we're going to have quite a few apps that are going to be up on the Windows Store at beta. Obviously, one of the things she and Steve both talked about last week is that any Windows 7 PC could run Windows 8. But obviously, there’ll be kind of some new and interesting form factors that are going to come out here as we get further on down the road. So I don't know that I would think about it except, as we said earlier, we're on track. We feel really good about where we are on the product, and this next super important milestone is the beta release and having a really great developer ecosystem that kind of surround that. So great question.

I'm pleased with our performance as we delivered another quarter of solid financial results. Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services drove revenue growth of 6% to a third quarter record $17.4 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for one of our biggest launch years, we delivered operating income growth of 12%. 
Let me provide more color on the business. Our Business Desktop offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. This quarter, businesses continued to refresh their hardware. And as a result, we saw healthy growth in business PCs around the world. As they purchase new PCs, businesses are also deploying Windows 7 and Office 2010 to increase productivity and manageability while reducing their total cost of ownership. Today, approximately 40% of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7, and we see continued momentum as the remaining desktops upgrade from Windows XP over the next 2 years. 
As CIOs look to address the needs of a more social and mobile workforce. Our productivity services such as Office 365 have become an important solution. Our communication and collaboration offerings such as Exchange, SharePoint and Lync all grew revenue double digits and are well positioned in this growing market. 
On the infrastructure side, the Server & Tools Business delivered double-digit revenue growth, with SQL Server leading the way. We've now launched System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012, and the new versions of Windows Server and Visual Studio are on the horizon. Our product roadmap and vision are driving new customer wins and strong Enterprise Agreement renewals. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to address the needs of CIOs as they strive to efficiently manage private and public clouds. 
Establishing a vibrant Windows Phone ecosystem is a priority for us, and we are working with our partners, including Nokia, to enable more features, markets and devices. We are pleased with our Nokia partnership and the pace of innovation across devices, including the Lumia 900, which recently launched on AT&T's 4G LTE network. 
In gaming and entertainment, while industry console sales were softer than our expectations, we continue to maintain our shared leadership position. With Xbox LIVE, we are adding more content and partners as we expand the entertainment experience and build on our leading position in the living room. 
And in Search, we are focused on addressing RPS and operating performance. We are seeing our hard work pay off with year-over-year improvements in both areas. 
In summary, solid revenue growth, and our ongoing commitment to fiscal discipline delivered strong financial results. We are enthusiastic about the market reception to our products and services as we continue to execute well, heading into our launch wave. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results, then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.",497
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2281.0,286307.0,14076012.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. 
Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 16% or roughly $1 billion. Operating income was up 12% to $6.4 billion, cash flow from operations was a record $9.6 billion and earnings per share was $0.60. Remember, in Q3 last year, we had a $461 million or $0.05 per share benefit related to a partial tax settlement with the IRS. And if you exclude that, EPS grew 7% for the quarter. 
Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter. From a geographic perspective, developed markets remained healthy, and we saw strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. Businesses continue to make long-term investments in the Microsoft platform, and as a result, multi-year licensing, as a percentage of our total revenue, grew to approximately 40%. 
This quarter, we saw strong Enterprise Agreement growth in both new business and renewals. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.2 billion, up 17%, and our contracted not billed balance was over $19 billion. 
Moving on to the PC market. We estimate the worldwide PC market grew 2% to 4% this quarter. Business PCs grew 8% as businesses continued to upgrade their hardware and software to Windows 7. When excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 6%. We are pleased with the early demand for Ultrabooks as they reinvigorate personal computing with innovative design, high performance and enhanced battery life. 
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 4%. As in past quarters, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, Windows revenues slightly outgrew the underlying PC market due to the strength of the business refresh and attach gains in several geographic regions. 
In late February, we made the Windows 8 Consumer Preview available. It is important to note that the development of Windows 8 on both Intel and ARM is proceeding on our schedule. 
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 9%. Consumer revenue increased 2%, while business transactional revenue grew 5%, again, outperforming our historical trends. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 13% as customers continued their commitment to our productivity services. As businesses embrace social enterprise scenarios, they are turning to the combined power of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync to enable their presence, collaboration and communication needs. This quarter, Exchange and SharePoint both grew double digits, while Lync revenue growth accelerated to over 35%. 
During the quarter, we launched the technical preview of the next version of Office, codenamed Office 15, with public beta coming later this summer. Our Dynamics business continued its momentum and revenue grew double-digits. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30% with more than 2.25 million users and 33,000 customers who leverage Dynamics CRM every day. 
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted another solid quarter with 14% revenue growth and over 20% bookings growth. Transactional revenue grew low single-digits, roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market growth. Multi-year licensing revenue was up high teens, and Enterprise Services once again grew more than 20%. 
Our growth and market success this quarter demonstrates that our customers really value our unique ability to deliver a solution which spans the private and public cloud. In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew more than 20%. We launched the beta version of Windows Server 2012 and announced the general availability of System Center 2012, which will help customers progress beyond virtualization to build efficient and secure hybrid cloud. 
In the public cloud, we recently announced strategic partnerships with leading service providers, Accenture and Hitachi, to offer enterprise-ready cloud solutions on our Windows Azure platform to accelerate application deployment and migration. We are the only company which can deliver a common identity, virtualization, management and development platform to our customers across both private and public clouds. 
In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew high teens while SQL premium revenue grew more than 30% as customers increasingly selected the premium edition to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workload needs. In early April, we announced general availability of SQL Server 2012, which now enables businesses to scale on-demand and create flexible hybrid deployment. Hundreds of global industry-leading customers such as Mitsui, Volvo, Revlon and LG Chemical have already deployed SQL Server 2012 for production use to leverage its enhanced performance, reliability and high-availability features. 
We also recently announced the second preview of Hadoop-based services with customers such as Webtrends using it to glean simple, actionable insights from complex data sets hosted in the cloud. Hadoop integration, along with the powerful analytic capabilities in SQL Server 2012, position us well to capture the full potential of big data growth. 
With major releases in each of our server product offerings, we continue to strengthen our enterprise portfolio and empower businesses to be both more agile and efficient. 
Moving on to the Online Services Division, revenue grew 6% and operating performance improved by $300 million. This quarter, online advertising revenue was up 9%, driven by volume and rate improvements in our Search business. 
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 16%, reflecting the soft gaming console market. Xbox maintained its share leadership in the U.S. this quarter, and we continue to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE with the release of 3 new major entertainment applications: Comcast XFINITY TV, HBO GO and MLB.TV, all with Kinect integration. 
We are working to bring Windows Phone to more people. Our progress can be seen with the April launch of 4G LTE phone through AT&T, our launch in China with multiple OEMs and the enabling of sub-$200 phones with more silicon support. With this work and with the building enthusiasm around Windows Phones, we have seen the number of apps published in the marketplace increase by 50% over the past 3 months. 
Turning to Skype, we continue to be pleased with both the pace of the integration and the rapid growth of the business. This quarter, Skype users made over 100 billion minutes of calls over the Skype network, an increase of 40% from the prior year. 
I will now cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1%, reflecting changes in the mix of products and services sold. Operating expenses were $7.1 billion, an increase of 4%, mainly due to higher people costs. Operating income increased 12% to $6.4 billion.  And this quarter, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. 
To summarize, we saw strong enterprise uptake for our server and Office products and continued business demand for PCs, leading to healthy top line growth. Along with our revenue growth, we were able to drive margin expansion with our strong focus on cost management. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.",1164

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high-level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2013. 
Let me start with the fourth quarter. Within the PC market, we expect growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs and growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets. In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. Transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. 
Within Server & Tools, approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multi-year licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the server hardware market, and multi-year licensing and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow high teens. 
In the Online Services Division, we will continue to focus on RPS improvements, as well as operating efficiencies. For our Entertainment & Devices Division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits. We expect COGS to grow 8% to 12% for the fourth quarter. As has been the case in the prior quarters, the mix of revenues will continue to impact this number. 
We are revising our operating expense guidance downward to $28.3 billion to $28.7 billion for fiscal 2012. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth pattern. 
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to fiscal 2013, which will include an unprecedented refresh of our major products. With Windows 8 and its availability on both x86 and ARM, we believe the ecosystem will capitalize on the new range of capabilities and scenarios Windows 8 enable. 
In the enterprise, the addition of Windows Server 2012, combined with the momentum of SQL Server and System Center, position us to take share as businesses increasingly look to cloud-optimize their IT infrastructure. And in productivity, we believe Office 15 will help people work, collaborate and communicate smarter and faster than before, driving growth in the Office business. Consumers will see ongoing innovation in Xbox, Skype, Windows Phone and Bing. So as you can see, there is a lot to look forward to next year. 
We expect fiscal 2013 operating expenses to be $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion, which represents growth of 6% to 8% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2012 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses against the backdrop of a big product release year. 
In closing, our product portfolio is stronger than it has ever been, and customer satisfaction with our products and services is high. And with our latest wave of innovation, paired with the ongoing operating expense discipline, we are well positioned to continue delivering value to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.",517

The same basic dynamics continue, right? We need to do 2 things: we need to grow our share, we need to grow our RPS. So really improve our monetization. At the same time, it's managing the operating performance, which we've been doing. So the same characteristics apply. We are making progress on both counts, as Bill indicated. We saw gains in both volume and rate, and we need to continue to do that sort of monotonically sort of quarter after quarter and year after year.",88

We do view our Search asset as a pretty strategic asset for the company. The capabilities that it offers are leveraged across our -- we think can be leveraged across our whole product set. So I do think our strategy has evolved from whatever conversation you had a couple, 3 years ago because we see the opportunity to leverage the asset being even more powerful than maybe we did at that point.

We feel really good about both our sort of market position and our strategy. If you think about what we've done over the last couple of years, we've really staked out a unique value proposition and a unique strategy when it comes to not just the gaming console but also the UI technology with Kinect, and importantly, our Xbox LIVE and all the entertainment content that comes with that, which we view as a persistent long-term revenue stream, both from a subscriber perspective as well as a transactional perspective. And so we feel great about our leadership position. We've been the #1 console for the last 15 months or so. We feel great about our unique value proposition and the growing business we have with both Kinect and LIVE, and we think that's really persistent. If you look at the engagement that our subscribers have, the amount of time they spend doing entertainment as opposed to gaming is increasing all the time. And so I think the strategy and the value proposition there plays out very well over the next several years.",184

Yes, it was all segments, but I would highlight the enterprise, and it's really broad-based. I mean, businesses are investing in data centers. They're investing in their desktops because they see technology as a way to really both cut costs and improve their strategic positioning. For a while, CIOs have been saying Microsoft is a top priority, and we're really, really starting to see that both on the infrastructure side and the desktop side. We feel great about our product lineup, particularly in Server & Tools. If you think of what we've done with System Center and SQL Server and the upcoming release of Windows Server 2012, we kind of have a unique value proposition for enterprises, which is all about the hybrid private and public cloud which nobody else really has. And we've seen growth across both of those things. Similarly on the Business division side, we've broadened the Office business in several important ways over the last several years. One is in the experiences and workloads that people are getting in communications and collaboration, and that's been a huge growth driver. And secondly, again, it's cloud services and how that expands from helping people understand our roadmap from where they are today to how to get to the public cloud. I think those things taken together across-the-board have allowed us to take share and allowed us to grow both of those business, and you're really starting to see that take hold. And we're really excited about the product lineup that's coming in the next 6 to 9 months.",262

"" And as Peter mentioned, we're in both. I mean, we have high growth rates in both and we are, as Peter said, really the only company that's got that breadth of offerings and the growth rate on both the private, the public and then importantly, we've kind of coined this term, of hybrid IT where you can have a roadmap as you kind of want to use both to manage your IT infrastructure. So yes, we feel really good about where we are and the share that we're taking in the marketplace for sure.",128

And so it's important to really understand the roadmap. And that's where the pipeline really helps, and that's really been, I think, a big driver so far. And that applies not only to the workloads and the capabilities and the products themselves, but as Bill just mentioned, the private and public cloud roadmap because people really are starting to think about long term, how do they make that transition from where they are today in their data centers to a public cloud world. So having that roadmap and having that pipeline really impacts our current period Enterprise business, and I think that's what you saw, not only in Server & Tools but also in the Business division as well.",165

We love what they're doing. We think that's an interesting thing.

But even when you adjust for the more recent PC unit shipment data and something in line with what you guys said, I think PC, I think Gartner and IDC were at least in the neighborhood there. Maybe when you make those adjustments, the Windows business was even stronger than what we would have expected anyway. And I guess I'm just trying to try to get a little more color on that or figure that out. I guess a question maybe on the OEM revenue bridge, you got plus 2% from attach and inventory. Bill, I think you said that business refresh in attach was strong in some regions. But I think -- I would think anyway that given that PC shipments are much stronger in emerging markets, even if some emerging markets were a little bit better than normal, you'd still wouldn't necessarily get an aggregate attach that would be stronger. So I guess the question is, was there a meaningful move in inventory, OEM inventory that helped a bit this quarter? Because those numbers are stronger than they I would've thought.",203

I know -- it's actually a couple things. One, yes, on emerging markets. The business PC is what really drove the Windows business. And so if you think about the Windows revenue growth being really on the high end of our estimated PC shipment range, it's really a function of: one, business PC is really doing well relative to consumers. And again, that's consistent with the theme we've seen on businesses investing in their technology. And in addition to that, we had -- we did see some attach gains. I mean, and that's just reductions in piracy kind of broadly, not in any one place. That was a tailwind this quarter. As you know, sometimes that's not always a tailwind. In general, in the long term, that tends to be on the uptick. But this quarter, that attach and inventory gain is really partially attach.",146

If you think about how large enterprises plan their information technology spend, they sort of have a long-term roadmap. They're on it. They execute against it when they do. Obviously, our long-term roadmap, as I've said, impacts that.

But the question broader is do you think you have enough spend baked into that model to account for the big push you're going to need to make around perhaps on the smartphone side, given that, that's an area where you're coming from behind, given all the other products that you're going to be releasing and obviously consumer push in some of the new enterprise products?",113

Obviously, over the last several years and even longer, we've really been focused on making sure we're prioritizing our spend to the highest value areas, so you asked a good question. And our approach is exactly the same. Like we've done the last couple of years, we're really looking at next year and saying, ""How can we most effectively and most efficiently allocate the resources to the areas that drive the best long-term results?"" And we think we've got a good balance there as we've had in the past. We've tried to be transparent and consistent in that, really predictably execute against that. And I think what we've got next year is a good balance between the exciting launches that we have that really drive both short- and long-term growth, as well as hopefully a good financial result.

We started the fiscal year with good momentum and closed with a solid finish. Throughout the year, we delivered top line growth and remained disciplined on cost management while continuing to execute on our product roadmap.
Our enterprise products and services remain a top priority for CIOs as they navigate macroeconomic challenges. They are adopting our solutions for increased productivity, manageability and security at an overall lower total cost of ownership.
Windows 7 and Office 2010 both reached new milestones, as enterprises benefit from our business desktop offerings. Today, over 50% of enterprise desktops worldwide are running Windows 7, and software assurance attach rates are at an all-time high. And even 2 years after launch, Office 2010 attach continues to grow as businesses make long-term commitments to the Office platform.
Our productivity server offerings continued to perform very well with double-digit growth. Our newest server offering, Lync, grew over 45% this quarter, and we are excited about the unified communication scenarios that are enabled by new voice, video and social capabilities.
Office remains the #1 productivity application and today is on more than 1 billion PCs worldwide. On Monday, we released the customer preview of the new Office, which puts mobility, social and cloud at the forefront. Combined with the power of Windows 8, we are enabling a new platform of computing that gives the end user unparalleled choice for consumption and productivity.
Our Server & Tools products deliver on the vision of the modern data center by enabling multi-tenancy, scalability and continuous services, all while using a single pane of glass for management. No other technology company can offer the hybrid cloud solutions that give customers the ability to manage and scale their applications, data and processes across both public and private clouds.
As I look back, when I first became CFO of Server & Tools in 2003, it was a $7 billion business. Since then, it has grown to nearly $19 billion in revenue, and the opportunity for future growth has never been better.
Xbox continued its evolution as an entertainment platform and has solidified its place in the living room. With the help of Kinect and Bing, discovering and accessing content has never been easier. And with the recently announced Xbox SmartGlass, we look to make entertainment smarter, more interactive and more fun.
Moving to the Online Services Division. We continue to grow share, increase revenue per search and improve operating performance. Despite this progress, our expectations for future growth and profitability are now lower than we previously expected. As we announced earlier this month, we took a write-down on the goodwill that arose mainly from the aQuantive acquisition. We continue to believe that search is a strategic asset for Microsoft and are prioritizing our resources into the areas we believe drives the most business value.
With Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, we see a great opportunity to benefit from the trend towards smart mobile devices. We feel that we are uniquely positioned to address the security and manageability challenges that CIOs are dealing with today as a result of this trend. And for users, we offer compelling experiences across devices, with data and services that are connected seamlessly via the cloud.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results while embarking on the largest launch wave in our history. We are pleased with the long-term commitment that enterprise customers are making to our offerings as it demonstrates a high level of confidence in our product and service road map.
Importantly, customer satisfaction is at an all-time high. This past year, we delivered significant product releases such as SQL Server 2012, Systems Center 2012 and updates from Azure, Bing and Xbox LIVE. And enthusiasm is building for the coming year that includes important releases from Windows, Windows Phone, Office and Windows Server.
With those thoughts, I'll hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results. And then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013.",680
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2475.0,328025.0,15854310.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment.
Revenue for the quarter was $18.6 billion, up 7% or $1.2 billion. Operating income was $6.9 billion, up 12%. Earnings per share was $0.73, up 6%.
Cash flow from operations was $7.7 billion, up 29%. And for the full year, it was a record $31.6 billion. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter. From a geographic perspective, developed markets grew mid-single digits, and we saw continued double-digit growth in emerging markets.
We delivered solid financial results despite a tough economic environment, which demonstrates the strength and breadth of our businesses. Our compelling product portfolio across Windows, Server & Tools and the Microsoft Business Division is driving strong demand from small businesses to the largest global enterprises.
Multi-year licensing revenue grew 14% and made up over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Unearned revenue was a record $19.5 billion, up 14%, and our contracted-not-build balance was over $19.5 billion.
Turning to the PC market, we estimate that the worldwide PC market was roughly flat this quarter, with approximately 85 million PCs sold. Business PCs were up 1% and consumer PCs were down 2%.
Next I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was generally in line with the PC market. As in past quarters, you will find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Adoption of Windows 7 remains strong, especially among enterprises, which are benefiting from the security and management capabilities that come with the operating system. This quarter, volume licensing revenue grew double digits.
During the quarter, we launched the release preview of Windows 8 to a positive reception, and we recently announced that Windows 8 will reach general availability on October 26. Windows 8 represents a significant opportunity for developers, OEMs and other partners to extend a new range of form factors, capabilities and scenarios to billions of people around the world.
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 7%. Business revenue grew 9% and, within that, multi-year licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew 2%, driven by higher attach worldwide. Consumer revenue declined 4%, reflecting consumer PC dynamics in developed markets, which was partially offset by higher attach rates.
We saw strong growth in our productivity server offerings with Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively growing double digits this quarter. CIOs continue to invest in our application road map and new productivity scenarios. As Peter mentioned, Lync revenue growth accelerated to over 45% as enterprises chose our unified communications platform. We believe unified communications is a huge market opportunity, and we are pleased to see these results.
Just a year ago, we introduced Office 365. It is now offered in 88 markets and 32 languages. In just 1 year, some of the biggest global brands have embraced Office 365 to share information and connect with customers and partners. Global brands such as Lowe's, Qantas, Japan Airlines and Hallmark Cards have adopted Office 365 to unify their communication and collaboration experience with a secure, trusted platform.
Just earlier this week, we released the customer preview of the next version of Office. It features an intuitive design that works great on Windows 8 with touch, stylus, mouse or keyboard. It is available as a cloud-based subscription service and includes Skype Credits and extra SkyDrive storage. With SkyDrive integration, content is always available across all types of devices. It enables modern scenarios such as digital note-taking, reading and markup. It is social and makes it easy to connect with people and information. With People Card, there's an integrated view of contacts from LinkedIn and Facebook.
And speaking of social, this morning, we announced that we have closed the Yammer acquisition. Yammer adds best-in-class enterprise social networking to our portfolio of cloud-based productivity services.
Dynamics revenue grew 7% and, within that, Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 25% and added 360,000 users this quarter. We now have more than 2.7 million users and 36,000 customers who use Dynamics CRM to get a consistent and familiar experience inside Office.
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted another solid quarter with 13% revenue growth. Transactional revenue declined low-single digits while multi-year licensing revenue grew more than 20%, fueled by the wave of our new server products. Enterprise Services grew 15%.
In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew double digits. With greater scalability, improved performance and cost efficiencies, Hyper-V continues to win share against VMware. In anticipation of what is coming in Windows Server 2012, we are already seeing customers like Unilever move from VMware to Hyper-V.
Systems Center revenue grew roughly 20%, and we continued building momentum and demand for our private cloud capabilities. With the release of Systems Center 2012 and our leadership in Windows Server Active Directory, we have a compelling device management and application delivery platform.
In the public cloud, we launched a major release of Windows Azure, which enables infrastructure-as-a-service capabilities, adds 48 countries, offers media services and brings new capabilities to developers. We are excited that Windows Azure Media Services is being used to deliver Olympics coverage in high definition. This quarter, Windows Azure had significant customer and partner wins, and we added roughly 800 new enterprise customers.
In our Data Platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 20%, outpacing industry growth. Every week, we see customers moving to SQL Server because of its superior business analytics, security, flexibility and cost effectiveness. SQL Server Premium revenue grew more than 30% as enterprises continue to deploy it for their mission-critical workloads and business intelligence needs.
High-performance and BI capabilities offered by SQL Server 2012, along with Hadoop integration, will enable our customers to capture the full potential of big data. As I look back at the year, SQL Server revenue grew more than $0.5 billion. And with the technology advancements in SQL Server 2012, we are well positioned for future growth.
Next I will move on to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 8%, and operating performance improved by $266 million or 36%. Online advertising revenue was up 12%, driven primarily by rate improvement in our search business. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 15.6%, up 120 basis points year-over-year.
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue grew 20%. Despite the soft console market, Xbox continues its leadership position and had 47% share of the U.S. market in June. Additionally, Xbox LIVE membership increased by more than 15%, driven in part by the new content partners we have brought to Xbox. We also announced Xbox SmartGlass, which will connect phones, PCs and tablets with the Xbox 360 console to enable more interactive and engaging entertainment.
For Windows Phone, there are now approximately 100,000 apps in the marketplace, and Windows Phone unit sales grew more than 50% sequentially. In June, we announced that Windows Phone 8 will arrive later this year. Windows Phone 8 is based on the same core technologies that power Windows 8, and it will unleash a new wave of features for consumers, developers and businesses.
Moving on to Skype. We continue to progress with the integration, and you got a taste of that with our Office announcement this week. This quarter, 115 billion minutes of calls were made on the Skype network, an increase of over 50% from the prior year.
I will now cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 12%, primarily due to Nokia platform payments, inclusion of Skype costs and growth in Enterprise Services. Operating expenses were flat at $7.5 billion. Operating income increased 12% to $6.9 billion. This quarter, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
So to wrap up, we saw strong demand from our business customers, leading to solid financial results. Along with our revenue growth, we were able to maintain strong cost discipline and drive operating margin expansion.
And with that, I will hand it back to Peter, who's going to discuss our business outlook.",1351

For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013.
As we look forward, we expect many of the trends in 2012 to continue. Companies will prioritize the transition to the modern desktop. CIOs will continue to invest in cloud solutions to deliver productivity and scalability to their business. Consumers will increasingly leverage cloud services to ensure their content is always available across any of their devices. Rapid innovation will continue in hardware, services and the underlying infrastructure that is needed to support mobile computing. With our current portfolio and road map, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends.
Now turning to our outlook by business.
For Windows. In the first quarter, we expect to defer $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion related to the Windows Upgrade Offer and presales of Windows 8 to OEMs prior to general availability. Just a reminder that amounts deferred for the Windows Upgrade Offer will get recognized upon the earlier of redemption or the expiration of the program on February 28, 2013.
We expect the current dynamics of the PC marketplace to continue in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the deferrals associated with the Windows Upgrade Offer and presales, we expect Windows revenue to slightly trail the PC market for the quarter.
With new touch-enabled features of Windows 8 and new form factors hitting the market this fall, we expect Windows 8 to drive the PC ecosystem forward. Excluding the deferrals from fiscal year 2012, for the year, we expect Windows revenue to be roughly in line with the PC market. Note that this does not include the impact of Surface PCs, which we will update you on in the coming months.
In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double digits for both the first quarter and full year. Transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should lag the overall PC market until the launch of Office due to the normal cyclical slowdown in advance of the next version and then slightly outperform the PC market post-launch.
Within Server & Tools, our customers are moving from transactional licensing to multi-year licensing agreements. This impacts our mix of revenue and, for next year, we expect multi-year licensing to be approximately 60% of the division's revenue, transactional licensing to be 20% and Enterprise Services to remain at 20%.
With the shift to multi-year agreements, we expect transactional revenue to slightly lag the overall server hardware market for the first quarter and full year. For both the first quarter and the year, we expect multi-year licensing revenue and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow low teens.
In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization, with focused investment in the highest value areas.
For our Entertainment & Devices Division, while we have been maintaining our share of leadership position, the console market has been showing year-over-year decline. For games, Halo 4 will launch in Q2, while Gears of War was a Q1 title last year. With these considerations in mind, we expect revenue to decline high teens in the first quarter and to be roughly flat for the full year.
We expect COGS to grow high-single digits in the first quarter due primarily to the Nokia payments, addition of Skype and growth in Enterprise Services, partially offset by lower console volumes.
We are reaffirming our guidance for operating expenses of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2013. And as you create your models, you should expect higher expense growth rates around the timing of launches.
As a reminder, other income includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset, absent one-time events.
For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% and capital expenditures to be slightly over $3 billion. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer and presales, we expect unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth patterns for the first quarter.  
In summary, we delivered solid financial results in both the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. We enter fiscal 2013 with great momentum and are excited about our upcoming launches.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.",752

Obviously, we said it was going to lag a little bit in the first quarter prelaunch, and for the full year would be roughly in line. So obviously, that means, for the remainder of the year, slightly ahead. And also, think about sort of emerging markets versus developed markets and what that means for the overall growth of Windows relative to the hardware market.

We've been very encouraged by the improvements that we -- the year-over-year improvements we've seen over the last several quarters. And to be honest, 100% of our focus right now is on making sure we continue to drive those gains, which will benefit both parties of the partnership and make sure that's successful for both companies, because it's obviously very strategic for both of us.",85

The biggest piece of that we're seeing is SQL, and we're getting so much great traction with big enterprises. We're really starting to make progress in Tier I applications. And what we're seeing now is many more long-term multiyear agreements for SQL, which used to be more of a transactional business. But now, as bigger companies are making the commitment to our data platform, putting their mission-critical applications on it, they are signing more of a new kind of licensing that we have just for SQL, for multi-year licensing agreements. So by far, the biggest impact is in SQL, and yes, with the new version of SQL Server 2012, we expect that to continue.",115

I know we're accustomed to looking at that with the unearned number. But it looks like that number, if I look at the sequential trend there, it was a little light of what we've seen on similar Q4s, where you've seen a more robust quarter-over-quarter growth. I'm just wondering, was there something about the shape of the enterprise annuity business or what you saw in the quarter that caused that?",87

And taken as a whole, we're obviously very pleased with what we're doing, we're pleased with the performance we've had with our customers. We're pleased with the renewal rates, we're pleased with the trend that we just talked about with SQL. So I wouldn't highlight anything unusual there.",74

You talked about a relatively flattish revenue. You gave a lot of color on the mix in terms of the revenue contributions there.

You've seen us really add the content partners that we have and grow the Xbox LIVE business. And so historically, the profitability has been largely sensitive to the console market, and that's still a big piece of it. But as we broadened the business, we now have different revenue streams. And obviously, the other thing I would say is with Halo 4 coming later this year, having a really hot first-party title is always a great thing from a profit perspective. So when I think about the business model going forward, I feel great about some of the content that's coming. I feel great about the subscription business with Xbox LIVE and some of the access and discoverability we have with Kinect and Bing as well.",147

As that business has really accelerated and shown great revenue growth, we're obviously getting the benefits of the scale that you get, right? Because a lot of the expenses are R&D expenses, and so we've really been able to improve those margins at the same time that we've been building out both the public and private cloud assets as well.

I think as -- when Satya spoke at one of the conferences this past year, I think he just talked about the fact that our road map there is something that enterprises are really buying into because it is -- I mean, he used this term, ""hybrid cloud"", and he talked about, this is a strategy of working with enterprises to focus on their on-premise capability, as well as their public cloud capability and being able to offer the opportunity for people to kind of manage that interchangeably. And we really feel like we've got just a unique set of capabilities there.

Let me take that. So there's a whole bunch -- I mean, I think people Peter talked about this a second ago, but there's just a whole bunch of kind of moving pieces in there. As he talked about, there's emerging markets that are growing faster than developed markets. Obviously there's a different pricing -- we have different prices in emerging markets than we do in developed markets. Obviously, there's also some upgrade revenue that will be -- that we'd be recognizing during this year. I think Kash, to your point, there could be some tablet growth. I mean, look, to be honest, it could grow faster but, at the same time, the best estimate that we have is that we're going to grow in line with all the information that we have available.",135

I guess, when I back into what the transactional business is, I guess the quick question is, did it decline this quarter? And when I look at the guidance you're giving, Peter, why would the transactional business slightly lag the hardware market?

No, you're right. It's not that we're losing share, it's that it's transitioning to the multi-year licensing business for both Windows Server and SQL Server. So that's really what we're seeing, and Bill gave you some of the numbers when he was talking about some of the growth in SQL Server revenue and just all-out multi-year licensing business for the Server & Tools Business.

Is it -- so if you try to model the financial impact, do we need to be aware of a slight delay there compared to previous cycles?",86

And the general answer would be, like in previous launches, we're incredibly excited about the capabilities, probably actually more excited about what we're doing with Windows 8 and reimagining what you can do with Windows and, in particular, what we're doing and what our OEM partners are doing to deliver really cool devices in really exciting form factors.

Certainly the product roadmap and the new capabilities that we have across the board, whether that's Systems Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012, which is now, and what's coming in Windows Server later this year, as well as the public/private cloud story which really, really resonates. So what people are investing in is that road map, because they see where they're going long term, and they're partnering with us to get where they need to get long term through the increased capabilities in our technology.

It's -- the reason it's growing so fast is because of the capabilities that it provides, as well as the cost savings it provides for companies. It's really compelling, and is really -- it resonates well with customers. It's a lot of new implementations, some of it's competitive, some of it's just new applications as people think of really reimagining how communication happens. We're really excited. This is one place where the Skype acquisition plays in and kind of what we showed a little bit this week with how we're really reimagining communications broadly for all of our customers. And that story really resonates very well. It's very easy to sell, it's very easy to see, the capabilities are very easy to show. So that's just a great product, a great set of capabilities, a great value proposition for CIOs and end users alike. And as Bill said, we think unified communications is a really big market opportunity for us, and we've felt that for a long time, and we're really starting to see it with this version of Lync and what we're doing going forward.",202

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2521.0,366829.0,17519769.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Klein,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Our first quarter revenue was flat year-over-year at $17.4 billion, reflecting solid growth in multi-year licensing but a slowdown in transactional revenue. Our transactional revenue, which includes our OEM business, was impacted by a challenging PC market, normal purchasing slowdown in advance of upcoming product launches and tough economic condition, particularly in Europe. This impact was offset by growth in multi-year licensing revenue, which benefited from healthy renewal of enterprise agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform. 
Our productivity and infrastructure offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. In productivity, our collaboration and communication solutions continued to perform well, with double-digit revenue growth this quarter. In the data center, our virtualization capabilities and hybrid cloud scenarios are enabling enterprises to move to the modern data center on their term. And on the data platform, we are well positioned to take share as customers increasingly turn to SQL Server 2012 for their mission-critical workloads and business intelligence needs. 
As part of our ongoing focus to increase the overall value we bring to our customers, we are enhancing our unique hybrid IT capabilities with targeted acquisitions like StorSimple and PhoneFactor. Acquisitions of industry-leading solutions like these accelerate our ability to help CIOs better manage their environments. 
As I mentioned earlier, the PC market was challenged this quarter. In addition to a tough economic environment and competitive pressures, OEMs drew down their Windows 7 inventory as they began the transition to Windows 8. Our partners are building an incredible breadth of hardware. To date, we have certified over 1,000 unique Windows 8 systems, including beautiful new tablets, convertibles, laptops and all-in-ones, and there will be more to come. 
As I look at where we are, we have kicked off the largest launch wave in our history, and in the 12-month period, we will have refreshed nearly all of our major products. With these launches, you are seeing the investments we've made over a number of years converge. And more importantly, you are seeing us execute on our commitment to deliver devices and services that people love and businesses need. 
Whether we build our own devices, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Surface, or work with our partners to develop stunning new Windows devices, we will continue to offer consumers and businesses wide-ranging choices so that every user can get exactly what they want at the price that is right for them. With Windows 8 and our cloud services, we will delight users with an integrated experience across their devices. Right out of the box, Windows customers will be connected to unique communications, productivity and entertainment services from both Microsoft and our partners. 
Services like SkyDrive, which allows users to store and manage their data online, or the recently announced Xbox Music, which brings entertainment to the forefront, users can access their content seamlessly from any device at any time. With the new Office, which will be made available in the coming months, we will enable productivity scenarios that take full advantage of the hardware coming to market, including new mobile form factors with touch and pen capabilities. And with Skype, Yammer and other services, we put social directly into productivity and collaboration. 
Within the enterprise, CIOs are using technology to drive their business strategy forward. Whether it's making employees more productive, unlocking key business insights or managing a growing number of devices, we are uniquely positioned to address their needs. Our products are scalable and flexible and provide the lowest total cost of ownership. 
As we enter this new era at Microsoft, there's incredible opportunity for our partners, developers and customers, and we are well positioned for sustained profit growth in the future. 
With those thoughts, I'll hand it back to Bill for more details on our results, and then I'll come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013.",662
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2521.0,366829.0,17519770.0,Presenter Speech,Bill Koefoed,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was flat at $17.4 billion. Operating income was $6.7 billion, down 7%. Earnings per share was $0.65, a decline of 4%. Cash flow from operations was roughly flat at $8.5 billion. Foreign exchange had a $257 million or 2-percentage-point negative impact to revenue this quarter, but the impact to net income was immaterial. 
From a geographic perspective, this quarter we saw tough conditions in Europe where revenue declined mid-single digits. In emerging markets, PCs were roughly flat as significant deceleration from the growth rates we had been seeing previously. Our enterprise business in emerging markets continued its double-digit revenue growth. 
When looking at our revenue mix, consumer and business transactional revenue declined, which is typical ahead of launches. Multi-year licensing revenue remained strong with 15% growth, representing roughly 45% of our total revenue for the quarter. When adjusted for the $1.9 billion cumulative impact of the Windows and Office revenue deferrals, unearned revenue was $17.7 billion, up 13%. Our contracted-not-billed balance was roughly $20 billion.
Now let's move on to the PC market. We saw the overall PC market decline this quarter in advance of the launch of Windows 8 and in part due to competitive pressures and the challenging macroeconomic climate I noted earlier. Business outperformed consumer, and emerging markets outpaced developed markets, although at a reduced rate. 
Moving to the results for the Windows Division, revenue declined 9% and lagged to the PC market due to OEM inventory drawdown prior to the Windows 8 launch and the ASP dynamics of emerging markets relative to developed markets. We have discontinued the bridge to the PC market as Windows 8 will be a platform across a broad set of form factors. As we go forward, we will provide updated information and metrics about our business performance in the new context.
The shape of Windows revenue this quarter was nonlinear as revenues slowed down dramatically in the first 2 months, driven by the weak PC market dynamics. Revenue accelerated in September as OEMs started to build up for Windows 8 launch demand. Windows 8 OEM presales revenue was roughly $800 million, approximately 40% higher than Windows 7 presales revenue in the comparable launch quarter.
This quarter, volume licensing revenue grew double digits, and our Windows 7 enterprise deployments continued to grow, though at a slower rate than last quarter. 
On Tuesday, we announced pricing, market availability and open pre-orders for Surface. Next week, on October 26, we will launch Windows 8 and Surface. With a modern user interface, ability to support multiple form factors and a rich platform to build apps, Windows 8 opens up significant opportunities for partners, developers and customers.
Now we'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 1%. Business revenue grew 3%, and within that, multi-year licensing revenue grew 8%. Reflecting the PC market dynamics, consumer revenue declined 8%.
Last week, we released to manufacturing the new Office and announced it will be generally available in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. The new Office has a fresh look and touch-friendly interface that lights up on Windows 8 devices. Since the customer preview in July, millions of people have downloaded the preview or signed up for the service, and we feel great about the feedback and positive response from users. The new Office is also in the cloud and features social enterprise capabilities with SharePoint, Yammer and Skype. It is our most comprehensive Office release ever.
Our productivity server offerings continue to perform well. Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively grew double digits again this quarter. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of over 40% as enterprises chose our unified communications platform for their communication and collaboration needs.
Dynamics revenue grew mid-single digits, and within that, Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. This quarter, we announced key milestones to our ERP portfolio with updates to Dynamics GP and NAV. Both these releases deliver great value to customers and partners through faster and more efficient implementation and compelling application functionality.
Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted another solid quarter with over 20% bookings growth and 8% revenue growth. Enterprise Services grew 13%, and multi-year licensing revenue grew 19%, driven by new customers who are investing in our product wave. Transactional revenue declined this quarter, driven in part by a slower server hardware market and customers switching to multi-year licensing. 
In the data center, we are seeing strong adoption of our platform across cloud, on-premise and hybrid scenarios. System Center revenue grew more than 20%, and we launched Windows Server 2012 in September, with increased management and virtualization capabilities. Customers like Acer, Equifax and Volkswagen Financial Services are already using its robust set of technologies and features, including network virtualization, live migration and continuous availability. 
We continue to gain virtualization share, as customers like PALA and the City of Barcelona switch from VMware to Hyper-V at System Center to build private clouds with increased efficiencies and higher savings. In the public cloud, we continue the pace of innovation and announced the release preview of Windows Azure Mobile Services, which connects Windows 8 apps to the cloud back-end hosted in Windows Azure.
As Peter mentioned, over the past few weeks, we announced the acquisitions of StorSimple and PhoneFactor, which will enhance our position in data storage and device management. 
In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue continued to grow double digits. SQL Server Premium revenue grew more than 20% as customers continued to deploy it for their mission-critical workloads and business intelligence needs. By combining the power of SQL Server, SharePoint and Office, CIOs can create scalable, self-service BI platforms. Users can leverage these platforms to analyze and interact with data in bold, new ways, make real-time decisions and gain insights from big data. We are seeing how SQL Server 2012 has raised the bar and positioned us to grow faster than the competition.
Next, I will move on to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 9%. Online advertising revenue was up 15%, driven primarily by rate improvement in search offset in part by a decline in display revenue. Operating performance improved by $150 million or 29%. Increasingly, users are finding better search results at Bing. In blind tests, nearly 2 in 3 users chose Bing's Web search results over Google's results, and over 10 million users have visited the Bing It On Challenge, where they can compare Bing and Google head-on.
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 1%. While the console market was tough, Xbox maintained its strong share and had 49% of the U.S. market for the quarter. This holiday season, we have a great lineup of games, headlined by Forza Horizon and Halo 4 and complemented by a rich catalog of Kinect games. We continue to see strength in Xbox LIVE where membership grew over 15%. 
This week, we announced Xbox Music, which leverages the cloud to integrate the music experience across the tablet, PC, phone and TV and has a worldwide catalog of over 30 million songs. Xbox Music is the most comprehensive service available. It provides users unlimited streaming music on Windows devices, lets them play music based on similar artists and styles and allows them to purchase songs and albums. There's no other music service out there today that matches the capabilities of Xbox Music. 
We are excited about the upcoming launch of Windows Phone 8. We have a strong device lineup and breadth of operators across key markets. We will share more about Windows Phone 8 at our event on October 29. 
Moving on to Skype. This quarter, 120 billion minutes of calls were made on the Skype network, an increase of 58%. We continue to make progress with the integration of Skype into our portfolio of products and have announced the upcoming federation between Lync and Skype, which will allow users to access their contacts through a common interface. Skype is also central to communications in the new Office, and Skype calling is included in the upcoming Office 365 subscription service.
I will now cover the remainder of the income statement and share some expectations going forward. Cost of goods sold increased 10%, primarily due to Nokia platform payments, inclusion of Skype costs, growth in cloud infrastructure and Enterprise Services. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect COGS to grow high single digits for the full fiscal year.
Operating expenses grew 2% to $6.5 billion. For the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our guidance for operating expenses of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. Other income this quarter was $226 million, driven by the gain from the MSNBC sale. Other income includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset for the remainder of the year. 
This quarter, our tax rate was approximately 19%. For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows Upgrade and Office Offers, we expect unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth patterns for the second quarter.
We expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be roughly $3.5 billion. This quarter, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buyback and dividends and raised the dividend 15% to $0.92 per share annually. 
Now I will turn it back to Peter for our revenue outlook.",1599
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,2521.0,366829.0,17519771.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Klein,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our revenue expectations for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013. Starting with Server & Tools. Product revenue, including transactional and multi-year licensing, is about 80% of the division's total revenue, and Enterprise Services is the remaining 20%. 
As we noted last quarter, our customers are moving from transactional purchasing to premium products and multi-year licensing agreements. We expect product revenue to grow high single-digits for the second quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year, and we expect Enterprise Services revenue to grow low double-digits for the second quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. 
In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double digits for both the second quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should grow low single-digits in the second quarter and mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. 
As a reminder, when updating your Q2 models, you should defer between $850 million and $950 million of revenue related to presales into the channel and the Office Offer. Amounts deferred for presales will be recognized upon general availability, while amounts deferred to the Office Offer will be recognized upon delivery, redemption or the expiration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. 
Moving on to Entertainment & Devices Division. While we have been maintaining our share leadership position, the console market continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect revenue to decline low teens in the second quarter but to grow low single digits for the full fiscal year. 
In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamic seen in the first quarter. 
In the Windows Division, as a reminder, second quarter growth will reflect the recognition of $800 million of revenue from first quarter presale partially offset by roughly $100 million of additional deferred revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. Remember that the Upgrade Offer expires at the end of February, at which time we'll recognize all remaining deferred revenue. 
Looking forward, we eagerly anticipate the launch of Windows 8. We are bringing a new range of capabilities and scenarios to Windows. And with support of system-on-chip architecture, we are moving beyond the traditional PC to the widest range of Windows hardware we have ever seen. New hardware will debut next week and will broaden over the coming months.
With Windows 8, we are giving developers a modern platform in which they can build rich, immersive apps unlike any the Windows ecosystem has seen. The Windows Store offers developers attractive financial terms and broad reach. And with its grand opening next week, the Windows Store will have a strong lineup of apps. Just as with the hardware, the lineup of apps will become more robust over time. 
In addition to delivering Windows 8 next week, we will also launch Surface. Designed to be the ultimate stage for Windows, Surface allows users to seamlessly transition between consumption and creation and is an example of the substantial innovation that is enabled by Windows 8. We are hard at work manufacturing the devices and will ramp production over time. 
October 26 only marks the beginning of a journey we will take together with our partners and developers. Our collective success will be evident over time as we change the way people experience the power of technology. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.",618

You just said you'd recognize all remaining deferred revenue. Can you just help us understand what the variables are that we should be thinking about other than what the PC market grows out? And by PC market, I think we need to define that as all Windows 8 compatible devices, including tablets. So are there mix shift issues, the price you realize on a tablet versus traditional notebook? What are kind of the variables we should be thinking about in terms of how to model Windows & Windows Live revenues for the year?",107

That's exactly right. I mean one of the exciting things about Windows 8 is how it really redefines sort of how people think about devices and the experiences they get across those devices. And up until now, it's sort of narrowly been defined as, say, PCs or tablets, and customers have been forced to choose and make trade-offs frankly of what they get. With Windows 8, you can kind of get whatever you want at whatever price point you want. So if you want a convertible with touch and pen and integration with your line of business apps, whether you want a tablet for great information and communications and entertainment, whether you want a touch Ultrabook, all of those things come into play and all those things are available with Windows 8. And I think over time, we're going to see how that plays out and that's the opportunity for us. And it's really a factor of thinking about how all those are going to play against each other.",170

The billings were a little bit better than we thought, but the recognized revenue in the forward guide was a little bit lighter than we had been looking for.

Do you still think you can outpace the transactional piece in terms of your business? And what should we be thinking about in terms of the convergence of billings and recognized revenue?",95

What we are continuing to see is that the migration from transactional revenue to multi-year licensing agreements, which is great because it's one of the things that's driving the business, which is the vision we have for the roadmap, the resonance that has with our customers, and so they're making long-term commitments to the platform. And so it’s is one of the reasons we gave you the bookings number and the multi-year licensing revenue number of 20% and 19% because that's what you're seeing. And so as that's growing faster than the transactional, you'll see the bookings and the backlog grow and the recognized will follow over time. So that's really the thing to watch for in Server & Tools, and we're continuing to be very bullish on that opportunity sort of across the board, whether that's through Windows Server, System Center, what we're doing in the private cloud and public cloud and certainly with SQL Server. So that trend that we're seeing in the migration to the multi-year licensing agreements is driving that business both now and for the long term.",183

When I talk to CIOs, for example, in enterprises, one of the things they're really excited about is that Windows 8 devices give them a chance for their employees, the users of the technology, to have the devices they want and bring to work, that they get the kind of manageability, security, integration with their line of business apps that they want. So I think there's a big differentiation in the enterprise across all the form factors, especially tablets that are increasingly coming into the workplace. On the consumer side, I think there's a range, not only a range of price points and different kinds of form factors, but also unique and differentiated set of services and experiences that come with the device, including Office, including SkyDrive, including Xbox Music. So I think across the board, you see similar differentiation both in the enterprise and on the consumer.",169

I guess can you talk a little bit about that, what we seeing there? Is this tied to multi-year deals in this business now or is it something you do with some of these adjustments maybe we're not accounting for correctly?",83

It's -- it actually is that. It's multi-year licensing deals growing double -- continuing to grow double digits, so that's what's driving the deferred there. So it -- that's one sort of example of how enterprises are continuing to see value in adopting Windows.",47

It sounds like a lot of that was just driven by the rotation of multiple-year contracts. But can you talk about the marketplace right now? And if the marketplace is weakening, do you find that to be an advantage given the cost preferences in that line?",75

Irrespective of weak market, strong market, we've got a great value proposition. It does play very well in tough macroeconomic times because one of our great value propositions is the savings and efficiencies people get from using integrated technology across their stack at a really good price performance characteristic. So I would say we feel great about our value proposition, in any environment, does play well in a tough macro environment. But what we're seeing now in the financials -- this is why we highlighted the bookings growth and the multi-year licensing growth -- is related more towards the migration from the transactional business.",112

Just kind of a high level, don't want to know the exact margin percentage, but how did you sort of price Surface relative to BOM? I mean, obviously, you guys have talked about and sort of including implied revenue amount for Windows license, did you also take into account sort of a, call it a weighted-average attach rate of Office for a device, and then you add on a gross margin for the hardware? Just kind of how you built up to that? And then just kind of at a high level, what was sort of the pricing thoughts behind Surface? Was it to drive just adoption of the platform? Was it to actually make this a business? And does it change at all kind of near term versus longer term?",142

As with any pricing decision, it's really about the value proposition you have for your customers and the degree of capabilities and value you're delivering to them at a variety of price points for what they want. And that's really fundamentally what drives all of our pricing decisions. Do we have a really compelling value to offer our customers for the capabilities that we're delivering? And that's what we do across all our business, and that's what drives our economic performance.",82

But we're having people that are making longer-term commitments to Microsoft, and that shows up in our annuity business in Server. It shows up in things like Office 365 where people are having a subscription service. It shows up in things like Xbox LIVE, which you've seen happening over the last couple of years. So, Ed, I think you've got it right that we're seeing a lot more people that are committing to a longer-term relationship with Microsoft, which is clearly what we're striving toward.",114

In general, there's 2 things that impact the transactional business of MBD. One is the PC market and the other is product cycles. So one of the things we also see right in the period right before a launch of a new product from the transactional side and businesses is a slowdown, and also it does track the PC market. So those are the 2 things to keep an eye on.",72

Now this time around, it's obviously different form factors that are playing in, and consumers need to get used to it. How do you think about the momentum we should see in terms of the first quarter out, the second quarter out, et cetera?",67

I think I'm encouraged by what we saw from the Windows 8 sell-in that we've seen so far that 40% growth over the comparable period last time. So we'll just keep an eye on that and watch as we get further into the launch.",81

Over the past several months, many of those reviewing Windows 8 for PCs, while praising the significant innovation behind the OS, have also continued to focus on the dual interfaces and the adjustment that users will have to make. Is that something that causes you concern just when it comes to initial adoption levels of Windows 8? Just wondering how you think about that.",74

I hear the feedback, and as a user, we sort of have gotten used to it very quickly. At Microsoft, when we do innovation historically across our products, often times there's new things that come. And I understand initially, people look at those things. And what we've seen over time is that those innovations have delivered way more value, way more productivity and way more -- better usability. And so I'm very confident that, that is even more true with the great technology and capabilities and experiences that we have with Windows 8.",96

And again, for those of you who will be hopefully using it early, you'll see that show up in your experience as well.
