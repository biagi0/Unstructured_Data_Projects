Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on today's call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. 
At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change in our segment reporting groupings, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.
Please note that we have recast certain prior period items to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flow. Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but excludes the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included on a live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 27, 2017.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",519

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Amy and I will share the results of our second quarter and look ahead. Overall, this quarter we had solid performance and more importantly, drove growth in areas that are key to our future. We delivered $25.7 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $7.9 billion. We continue to advance towards our goals for fiscal year '18. Our Commercial Cloud run rate surpassed $9.4 billion, up over 70% year-over-year and almost halfway to our goal of $20 billion. We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months. 
We also made progress towards our goal of more than 1 billion Windows 10 monthly active devices, we crossed the 200 million milestone, and Windows 10 is outpacing adoption of any of our previous operating systems. In fact, adoption is nearly 140% faster than Windows 7. I appreciate the incredible work and focus of both Microsoft team members and our partners to deliver these results.
Now let's get to the specifics for each of the 3 segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. As we seek to help people get more out of every moment, we're delivering new innovation and seeing new opportunity with Office 365. Consumer response to Office is strong. Office attach rate is up, Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time, and consumer subscriptions are up to more than 20 million. 
We're also enthusiastic about how people use Office on other platforms. On iOS and Android, Skype has more than 900 million downloads and Office apps surpassed 340 million this quarter. There are also 30 million iOS and Android active devices running Outlook. Office 365 commercial revenue grew nearly 70% in constant currency while seats grew 59%. It is clear customers value the ongoing innovation we're delivering in Office 365, and this allows us to advance further into markets like voice and information protection.
In December, we released a major update to Skype for Business, which drives productivity up and cost down. Our customers can now use Skype for business to get a dial tone without the need of their own PBX and conduct online meetings for up to 10,000 attendees. 
Security is both a mandate and an opportunity for Microsoft across all our segments. As customers look to protect themselves, we are creating new demand for all of our security solutions. The number of people using our information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased 25% quarter-over-quarter. At the same time, we released new capabilities like Advanced Threat Protection, advanced e-discovery and customer Lockbox. These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration SKU, E5, which we released last month. 
Our Dynamics business is also contributing to our growth in the cloud. This quarter, we released major updates to Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM, both of which deliver enhancements in mobility, insights and organizational productivity as well as deeper integration with Azure and Office 365. 3 out of 4 of our CRM customers are choosing to deploy in the cloud, which is driving continued triple-digit paid seat growth for CRM Online in the enterprise. 
Our momentum with Office 365 and Dynamics creates a compelling case for developers. This quarter, we exposed the data APIs, which capture the relationships between people, conversations, projects, schedules, processes and content. We call these APIs the Microsoft Graph. The ability for developers to build on the Microsoft Graph presents a strategic opportunity for our customers and partners. Smartsheet has already taken advantage of these APIs. Oracle plans to use Microsoft Graph to enhance their line of business applications like Oracle Sales Cloud and many innovative startups are extending it to create new generation of productivity applications.
Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in. Last quarter, I reflected on how we are now 1 of the 2 leaders in this space. At the same time, we are the only one in this market providing SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and hybrid cloud at scale. We are growing in each of these areas simultaneously. 
Our unique approach is resonating. Our cloud architecture reflects real-world distributed cloud computing needs and services that enable businesses to convert data into intelligence and drive business transformation. Azure revenue grew 140% this quarter in constant currency, with revenue coming from new and existing customers. 
We saw organizations like NTT Docomo, Honeywell, NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs, Dow Chemical and the UN Development Programme deploy innovative solutions on Azure. We see that Azure customers who also purchased Office 365 consume 8x more Azure than other customers. More than 70% of the Fortune 500 have at least 2 different Microsoft Cloud offerings, up 13 points year-over-year. 
And now, we're continuing to grow in new ways. Together with Red Hat, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, we will increase our ability to address real-world infrastructure needs. These partnerships give customers the flexibility to connect their existing on-premise infrastructure or Linux-based applications with our cloud. 
We are leading innovation in new agile and dev ops workloads as well, with Azure App Service's power apps and Visual Studio team services, where we surpassed 3.8 million developer subscriptions. We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and gas, finance, e-commerce, consulting and health care. 
As we expand into new markets, our revenue from premium services like security, mobility management and analytics nearly tripled year-over-year. Enterprise Mobility solution customers have more than doubled year-over-year, and we have nearly tripled our share among Fortune 500 in the last 12 months. 
Security is now a major driver of the cloud adoption. As threats become more frequent and sophisticated, Azure's unique technologies like machine learning empower customers to adapt to these new realities. This quarter, we organized the enterprise cybersecurity group to help customers prepare for and respond to attacks. We unveiled plans for new data centers in Germany and the U.K. that address customers' data access and sovereignty needs. And we continue to release new capabilities like Advanced Threat Analytics as part of our $1 billion product innovation and security, spanning Azure, Office 365, Windows 10 and our Enterprise Mobility Suite. 
At the heart of every business in the future will be systems of intelligence, powerful AI that helps people understand the past and predict the future. Cortana Analytics is the building block for these systems of intelligence. We released Cortana Analytics last July. It's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people, places and things and converts them into intelligent insights and automation. 
Coca-Cola, Russell Reynolds and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System already use Cortana Analytics to dramatically change the way they market products to customers, uncover talent in the workforce and offer patients predictive and more personalized health care. Our goal is to make it possible for every company in every industry and every country to take advantage of this new artificial intelligence to transform.
In the More Personal Computing segment, I'm encouraged by our progress to unify our installed base on Windows 10 and to create new opportunities for Microsoft and our entire ecosystem. As of this month, we crossed 200 million active devices running Windows 10. 
Near term, in what analysts predicts will be relative flat market over this next year, we are focused on 3 ways to drive growth for our partners and for Microsoft: first, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers, who need advanced productivity, security and device management; second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform; third, continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me briefly expand on each.
First, in November, we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios: security, manageability and ease of deployment. More than 76% of our enterprise customers are in active pilots, including organizations like Kimberly Clarke and Alaska Airlines, and 22 million enterprise and education devices are already running Windows 10. We are well positioned to grow our commercial device footprint in the second half. 
Next, as we unify and grow the Windows 10 platform, we grow new monetization opportunities with the Windows Store search and gaming. This holiday season, we doubled Windows Store paid transactions from PC and tablet customers. This increase is an outgrowth of Windows 10 monthly active devices all up and the addition of new Windows 10 applications. 
This quarter, Netflix, Pandora, Uber, Wall Street Journal, NPR released new apps designed to take advantage of Windows 10 experiences. For example, you can ask Cortana to recognize a song in Shazam, play a movie on Netflix or book a ride via Uber. 
With Search, the clearest indicator of our progress is U.S. search share, where Bing now exceeds 21%. Nearly 30% of our search revenue in December came from Windows 10 devices, partly as a result of user engagements with Cortana. We are seeing increased search engagement and monetization on Windows 10 over previous versions. 
This holiday, we saw record engagement on Xbox LIVE. Active users grew to an all-time high of 48 million across consoles and PCs. On December 28, we had more fans using Xbox LIVE than any other day in the Xbox history. Clearly, with Xbox One now upgraded to Windows 10, a vibrant community joined the Windows ecosystem.
Our games also performed strongly this quarter. We doubled the number of Xbox One gamers playing Microsoft published titles year-over-year. Minecraft concluded the holiday as the top paid app globally on Windows 10, iOS and Android, and we grew monthly active users by 18% year-over-year.
Lastly, we're innovating in new device categories and driving growth. With Surface, we created a new type of device, the 2-in-1, and partners are now bringing similar devices to market with success. At the same time, this was the best quarter for Surface ever with over $1.3 billion in sales, driven by the launch of Surface Pro 4 and the initial rollout of our brand-new Surface Book. 
We see more opportunity ahead with Surface Book coming soon to China, Japan, the U.K., France, Germany and other markets in Europe and Asia. We believe in our ability to grow the Windows ecosystem. Near term, we are taking the right steps. We are also clear that long-term Windows growth and vibrancy rest on our ability to reinvent personal computers and personal computing. We accept that challenge as we see it as one of the greatest opportunities to prudently expand into new markets and generate shareholder value. 
Before turning over to Amy, I want to briefly reflect on the past few months. I've had the opportunity to meet with customers from all over the globe and observe the effects of the macroeconomic trends impacting business today. Of course, any macroeconomic uncertainty will create pressures for our business. 
But increasingly, I think it also creates opportunity for us. Every organization is looking for ways to gain efficiencies, insights and ultimately transform. This is at the heart of our mission. I believe Microsoft is uniquely positioned to empower them to find new growth areas while finding new growth for ourselves. 
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.",1922
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3552.0,943096.0,40157837.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $25.7 billion, down 2% and up 3% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly, but was up 5% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 3% and 13% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.78, growing 11% or 23% in constant currency.
We achieved strong results this quarter through targeted investments and innovation and consistent execution. From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as expected. The key markets like Brazil, China, Japan and Russia continue to be challenging. 
Our commercial business once again delivered solid results as we executed well in a large quarter for annuity renewals. Commercial bookings increased 12%, up 19% in constant currency, and commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $19.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. 
In addition, our contracted not billed balance reached an all-time high of $25.5 billion. With our continued cloud growth, our commercial annuity mix reached 83%, up 5 points year-over-year. This quarter, more than 60% of customers with enterprise agreements attached Commercial Cloud services, up 15 percentage points year-over-year. 
Additionally, we continue to make progress in improving our cloud gross margins. In Q2, total Commercial Cloud gross margin was 46%, an increase of 9 points year-over-year, driven primarily by improvements in both Office 365 and Azure. 
Last quarter, I provided the expected foreign currency impact on total revenue as well as across each of the reporting segments. In Q2, the FX impact came in nearly as anticipated though the U.S. dollar trended stronger-than-expected in December. This resulted in less than 1 point of additional negative impact to total revenue as compared to expectations, rounding up to 5 points. 
Consistent with Q1 and as Chris explained, we are not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses, and therefore, segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 3% on operating expenses at the total company level. 
Now let's turn to each segment's results. This quarter, our productivity and business processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.7 billion in revenue, declined 2%, but growing 5% in constant currency. 
In Office commercial, revenue declined 1%, but grew 5% in constant currency, driven by ongoing strength from Office 365 while revenue increased nearly 70% in constant currency. 80,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers, and our installed base continued to expand across Office, Exchange, SharePoint and the Skype for Business workloads. 
Office consumer revenue declined 14%, down 8% in constant currency, ahead of the consumer PC market. Subscribers increased to 20.6 million, attach rates grew and recurring subscription revenue continued to more than offset the impact of the customer transition to the cloud. 
And our Dynamics business grew 3% or 11% in constant currency, with triple-digit installed base growth for Dynamics CRM Online for the fifth consecutive quarter. We look forward to the upcoming launch of Dynamics AX, our ERP cloud solution built on and for Azure, that increases the breadth of our offerings in the business process market. 
Segment gross margin declined 6%, up 1% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined, reflecting the increasing mix of cloud services within the segment. Segment operating expenses decreased 3%, and we repositioned resources to align with our highest growth opportunities. And as a result, operating income declined 8%. 
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered over $6.3 billion in revenue, slightly ahead of our expectations and grew 5% and 11% in constant currency. Our enterprise customers continued to choose, adopt and use our hybrid cloud platform offerings, which resulted in server product and services growth, revenue growth of 10% in constant currency. Additionally, Enterprise services revenue increased 10% or 16% in constant currency, driven by our premier support services.
Segment gross margin grew 4% or 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat. As the rapid and continued growth of our cloud mix offset margin improvements in Azure and Enterprise services. Given the addressable market opportunity and enterprise customer demand, we continued our investment in research and development as well as sales and marketing resources. This quarter, operating income declined 1%.
Now to our last segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $12.7 billion, down 5% and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 5% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 3%, outperforming the consumer PC market as we expected. 
Driven by a higher mix of premium and midrange devices, which led to higher average revenue per license than the prior year. OEM Pro revenue declined 6%, slightly better than the commercial PC market. Pro license inventory is slightly above historical levels, which we expect to work through in Q3. 
Windows volume licensing grew 3% in constant currency, with annuity growth partially offset by transactional declines. IP licensing declined, impacted by both the decrease in total unit volume and the higher mix of low royalty units. Our Search business performed well again this quarter. With higher revenue per search, higher search volume and U.S. market share growth, which resulted in continued profitability.
Devices revenue decreased 26% or 22% in constant currency, primarily due to phone, where revenue declined 49% in constant currency, reflecting our change in strategy announced last July. Surface revenue increased 22% or 29% in constant currency, with the launch of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, with continued channel expansion and growing commercial sales.
On a constant currency basis, device gross margin dollars declined 18% and gross margin percentage improved, driven by a shift in revenue to our higher-margin Surface portfolio. As Satya referenced, we had a good holiday for Xbox. Gaming revenue increased 5% or 9% in constant currency, driven by record Xbox LIVE transactions as well as first-party game releases. 
As expected, hardware revenue decreased due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Segment gross margin declined 1% or increased 5% in constant currency. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily due to reduced expense in our Phone business as well as a successful transition of display advertising sales to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 35%. 
And now back to our overall company results. Customer adoption and usage of our cloud services continues to accelerate globally, and we are investing capital into our data centers and servers to respond to this demand. This quarter, we invested $2 billion, up sequentially from the $1.5 billion invested last quarter. 
Other income was negative $171 million due to interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividend and interest income and net recognized gains on investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations, with the year-over-year decrease primarily due to an IRS audit adjustment in the prior year and lower nondeductible operating losses in the current. This quarter, we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders, an increase of 42%. 
Let's move to the outlook. I want to preface my remarks with 3 overall comments and then move to more specific comments by segment. First, FX. I previously stated that we expected the FX impact on total revenue to be about 3 points in H2. For Q3, given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect an overall impact of 4 points. 
By segment, we expect 5 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 4 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. And we anticipate continued lessening of FX impacts by segment and on total revenue in Q4, assuming current rates stay stable. 
Second, our Commercial business. We expect our Commercial business to remain healthy, with ongoing shift to annuity as new and existing customers adopt and use our commercial cloud services. Therefore, even with continuing currency headwinds, we expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $18.8 billion to $19 billion. 
Our Commercial Cloud run rate trajectory remains on path, with continued focus on gross margin improvement across each of our key services. Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online -- though the total commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be impacted by the mix of revenue. 
Third, we will continue to meet global customer demand for cloud services and will increase our investment in data centers and capital equipment in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Now let me share some additional commentary on each segment. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, which reflects 5 points of negative FX impact. This represents 6% year-over-year growth in constant currency, driven by Office 365 momentum and Dynamics Online. 
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, which reflects 4 points of negative FX impact. Continued customer preference for our hybrid solutions will drive sustained growth in server products and cloud services and robust demand for Enterprise services. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits as it has throughout the first half of our fiscal year. 
For More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion, which includes 3 points of negative FX impact. As this segment has both devices and software, I'll provide a bit more detail. 
First, Windows. As I mentioned earlier, we will return to normal levels of Pro inventory in Q3, and we expect non-Pro revenue to align more closely with the consumer PC market. In Search, Bing will continue to gain share and will remain profitable. For Phone, we expect similar year-over-year revenue declines and the gross margin percentage for Q3 to look similar to Q2. 
After a solid launch quarter with Surface Book and Surface Pro 4, we anticipate continued momentum and growth, with Surface Book expanding into additional countries. And in gaming, we expect normal post-holiday seasonality. 
We expect COGS to be $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion, with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. And for the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion as we continue to improve efficiencies and invest in key growth opportunities. We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q3. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense, offset by dividend interest income. We expect our Q3 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.
In closing, our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook demonstrate our execution discipline and our investment in strategic areas to sustain long-term growth. We remain focused as we both create new markets and take share in existing ones. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.",1791

I mean, Commercial Cloud, as you mentioned, the run rate was up $9.4 billion. I mean, that's up $1.2 billion quarter-to-quarter, 70% year-over-year. That's higher growth rate than even last quarter, Azure a similar thing, accelerating growth versus even last quarter. A question, Satya and I'll follow up for Amy. So Satya, when you look at the growth rates there in Commercial Cloud and particularly Azure, you talked about new customer wins, but also existing customers transitioning more workloads to Azure. I hope you could give us may be some more color there as far as what you're seeing and kind of how you're thinking about the growth going forward there. And then Amy, based on our calculations, it seems like Azure had a pretty meaningful improvement in just the gross margin year-over-year. I wonder if you could help us with sort of the 2 curves in that business, and sort of where we are in Azure's, call it,  gross margin life cycle, you’ve got the fixed costs and the variable costs and how you're thinking about that.",190

The way we think about Cloud is how I described it in my remarks, which is it's the combination of the work we're actually doing in the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and also our hybrid cloud layer, because we don't think, for example, of our servers as a distinct part, but it's, in fact, the edge of our cloud and we're building for that with things like Azure Stack. So we think what we have done here by bringing these things together as one architecture for distributed computing and how people will consume applications and build applications in the future, we speak to more of the real-world needs, I think, of an IT organization or a business organization that's trying to transform through digital technology. I mean, if you put yourselves as a CIO of an organization -- in a multinational organization, and you want to operate in multiple geographies with different regimes for data sovereignty, and then you want to be able to take some workloads, move them all to the cloud, some you want to be able to tier with the cloud. That's the kind of flexibility we provide. And we also see network effects between -- if you're using Office 365, you want to extend the data in Office 365 by building applications that join it with some other data inside of our Data Lake service in Azure. Obviously, Azure becomes a natural choice for such application development, and we're increasingly seeing that. So that's really our strategy. Our strategy is not to compete in these constituent parts independently with different competitors. It is to bring one architecture and really drive the value for our customers because of that.",286

You're right. We did actually make significant progress in both Azure as well as Office 365. And then the mix of those obviously impacts the overall commercial cloud gross margin. What's important, the dynamic's actually quite similar even though the services are quite different. There are really 2 fundamental components to gross margin improvement. Number one is obviously scale efficiencies and where we are in that curve, which we are doing and continue to make consistent improvement in. The next obviously is the mix of premium services. And Satya talked about some of the increasing mix of premium services in Azure. That's been encouraging, especially in existing customers over time and through adoption curves. And Office 365, as you know, we continue to be excited by our premium mix in the Commercial segment. So those 2 combinations each quarter impact it as well as the overall.",158

It's like essentially an ISV win in the client/server area, where you could get someone to build on your core infrastructure, they build their first application, and it turns out that once you've done that, you would want to look at our infrastructure for a second workload and third workload. So that's one side of what's happening with the expansion. The other side of the expansion is what I also referenced, which is if you're an Office 365 customer, you have data in Office 365. You want to build applications that tap into that data, then you use Azure. So that's the other piece. The EMS growth is also very much related to that, which is if you deploy Exchange Online, you have Azure AD and then the natural expansion from there is the full EMS suite with device management for all your mobile devices and also Advanced Threat Protection and what have you. So we see those -- both those trends of -- from an application workload development synergy as well as infrastructure from identity management, device management workout.",218

The geos I specifically called out obviously, are where we are the most impacted and they are the bigger geos. But really I think the focus that we have here is how we can best execute no matter what the macro environment turns out to be, focus on our own execution, focus on continuing to drive cloud services, focus on continuing to drive annuity mix. Those movements actually, and as we help customers transform, is really the best plan in the face of any uncertainty, which you're clearly asking me about. But I tend to probably focus more on what we can control versus the external environment and how we can best react to that.",120

But you mentioned strong growth in compute and SQL usage on Azure being up, I think you said 5x. I was just wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads. I mean, is it right now more new workload growth and there's -- it's very little existing workloads moving over. I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over. And I'm also wondering if you see it helping with share. You mentioned it's kind of like a design win or an ISV win. Wondering if you could share with us how this might be impacting your share versus say Linux or versus other types of infrastructure platforms.",151

The thing, Heather, the move to the cloud has done for us is expanded the market opportunity that we have had more than ever before. In some sense, if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as Intelligent Cloud, we are operating in a much bigger market. And that's because, first of all, the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories, as well as take something that you mentioned, which is Linux. We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20-plus percent of Azure is Linux workloads, which is sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud, which we didn't have previously. And even take something like EMS, which is a service, you could say in the past, we participated with Active Directory. But we -- and some amount of System Center. But now, with the growth of actually mobile devices and SaaS applications, our opportunity with EMS is much bigger than anything that we had in the client/server era. So clearly, we are migrating some workloads, and structurally, some of that helps us because we had that position in the client/server space. But when we look at what we are doing in the cloud, it's mostly about attaching to one of the secular growth trajectories going forward, be it open source Linux development, mobile use and SaaS applications. So those are all things that we participate in, which we didn't participate in the past.",257

Satya, following up on the cloud discussion, recognizing that SaaS, PaaS, Infrastructure as a Service, hybrid are all related, but as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business, how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PaaS versus Infrastructure as a Service? PaaS is much smaller industry-wide today, but is the opportunity big, bigger? How should we think about that? And then I have a follow-up for Amy.",93
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3552.0,943096.0,40157854.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,20,"The opportunity, I believe, in both cases is high because it just comes in different forms. IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS. So I think that depending on what -- if you're bringing something over, your IaaS will be heavy first and then PaaS will grow. If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine. So I, myself, in fact, one of the things that Amy and I do is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all these layers together. In fact, we amortize our CapEx across all of these, and we pay attention to margin and premium mix because what we have come to understand is customers, depending on where they start, how they start, have different mix profiles. So it's the all-up as long as we're growing our premium services attach and margins for those remains strong. We feel that the mix can be different and it's okay. And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have.",241

Yes, you're absolutely right. That was one of our biggest strategic objectives was to get active devices and with store integrated into the install base and in the user experience so that we could increase the success for developers. And we're seeing good early signs. In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers, like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others. And as you can imagine, our share is today in desktops, in emerging in tablets, in 2-in-1, and of course, now with Xbox as well, which has got great attraction to gaming developers. And so those are the natural places, where you will see us gain more developers and gain more traction. We are big believers in a unified developer platform and a unified store. And then as Windows 10 monthly active devices increases and the store usage increases, we'll see more and more developers take advantage of it.",179

A couple of things, Walter, which I know you recall. We do have a bit of lumpiness in our explorations, as I said on the call. This was a big exploration quarter for us. And so on occasion what that does even with the negative currency impact on C&B is have a bit of lumpiness over time. Now that being said, I want to point to the core, which is that renewal rates were very good in a big quarter. There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. So aside from a bit of the lumpiness that you do note and we have from time to time, the execution in the quarter was very strong.",130

And so some of that weakness frankly is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads.

In Q2 -- let me talk about 2 key ones. Number one is really the device launches. We actually launched a very broad portfolio of devices into the quarter, with Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. And so between all of those hardware products as well as our gaming performance, and other sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches. Now when you launch mid-quarter, there's always some timing aspect to that. But I feel very good about the execution of those, and that is a meaningful component of that outperformance. The second one, which I talked about, is OEM Pro. We did a little better in the quarter than I expected, but inventory levels are a little higher. I expect to work through that in Q2 -- I mean, Q3. And that was a couple of points of impact, for example, on OEM Pro in quarter.",167

And then, Amy, for the third quarter, your guide for that business is also pretty good. Is that due to some of these similar factors?

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3552.0,943096.0,40157871.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,37,"Well, it's similar drivers. In that segment, there's also some topics I tend to not get asked about in Q&A. Let me take the opportunity to talk about them, which is one, our search performance continues to be very good. Frankly, our display business has been quite good. And if you go beyond that, I feel good about our gaming business sequentially. I feel good about the hardware, especially the Surface performance as we launch into more geos. And so if you think about all those components, which actually were very similar to Q2 in terms of their strength. You see them again in Q3. And so I'm not sure there's anything ""new"", Karl, I would say other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3.",134

I thought the upgrade momentum, the fact will we crossed 200 million active devices, we feel very, very good about that. And the pilot, the most -- the place, which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us, is the enterprise deployment. And that's where I think there's real excitement because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability that I think is going to create great value for enterprises and that's showing up in all the pilots. And the accelerate -- I've never seen a Windows release in the enterprise with this level of accelerated deployments -- deployment plan. So we obviously need to do a great job in continuing to push that, and we are focused on it. As far as Surface, Surface is playing an increasing role for us in both consumer as well as in the enterprise market. And also, we just -- we created a new category of 2-in-1s, where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface. And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.",233

We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user. And second, I believe, is that we also expand out into new usage patterns. If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement with the browser or things like Xbox LIVE, with the store or new device categories like the 2-in-1, all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios.

I mean, I think that's right. Last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow. In fact, there is always, I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then -– or subscriptions sold, and then there's deployment and there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate. And we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. But I feel very, very good in the growth of that. And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital, because if you look at what we do is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure and you see that increasing. And then in terms of the margin profile, I mean, the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5, that's the thing that Amy talked about, which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products in Office 365 that's most evident with E3 and now E5. Even in Azure, we have things like EMS. We have our data services, even our developer services. So I think all of -- both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on, and we see in our results.",277

But overall the way we have thought about it is, we want to make sure the Office subscription both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers is valuable across all of their devices because it speaks to the vision that we have, which is the cloud is what enables the mobility of the human experience across all of the devices in your life, because increasingly, there will be more devices. And we want to make sure that we are adding value and if we add value in that context, you will be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription. So that's been our goal, and that's working well and it sort of shows up in our all-up growth. And similarly with Azure, we are making sure that as people are tapping into the cloud and moving to the cloud, we can get all workloads to be as first class as on Azure so that's why we've done the deals with Red Hat. We even did previously deals with Oracle. So Azure is a complete open platform where, of course, you can run all the Windows workloads, the .Net workloads, but we are increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you and more interestingly the mix of all of them because it's -- the enterprise is heterogeneous, it has been heterogeneous. We participated only in a portion of it. Whereas with Azure, we can participate as the total open platform. And that's how we thought about it, and that's what we're executing on.",297

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you could find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results. 
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change to our external reporting segments, we aren't able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently, cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.
Please note that in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted a new standard issued by the FASB that made certain changes to accounting for stock-based compensation. One of the more significant changes required that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. Adoption of the new guidance requires us to reflect adjustments as of July 1, 2015, and hence, impacts our previously reported quarterly results for fiscal 2016. You can find additional information in the financial summary slide deck and in our 10-Q filing.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask the question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 21, 2017.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",548

Overall, we had a solid quarter. Amy and I look forward to sharing more about the results and what's ahead. 
We delivered $22.1 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $6.8 billion. We exceeded $10 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate. We are halfway to our FY '18 goal of $20 billion. This quarter, we surpassed 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. We're proud of our progress and look forward to making more as enterprise deployments accelerate. 
Now let's get to the specifics of each of our 3 segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. We set out to reinvent Productivity and Business Process because we believe that people should get more out of every moment, and organizations should be able to reach new levels of effectiveness. 
This approach is opening up new growth opportunity for Microsoft in 3 ways: We can reach more users, enter new markets and build a developer platform. Let me talk through each. First, we are reaching new users and strengthening our productivity platform. Consumer subscriptions of Office grew to more than 22 million. Devices with our mobile apps grew approximately 4x year-over-year. Commercial Office 365 customers surpassed 70 million monthly active users and we grew seats by 57%. 
Second, we are expanding into new markets such as security, analytics and cloud voice where we see an opportunity and where we can differentiate. For example, the cybersecurity market is expanding rapidly and it's a place where we have unique capabilities like Advanced Threat Protection, cloud app security and advanced e-discovery. This combination drove a 35% quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of our premium information protection services in Office 365. A key driver of this growth is our new premium Office 365 Suite, E5. 
Lastly, we're making Office 365 more than a world-class productivity and communication service. It's becoming a growing platform for developers. There is an incredible amount of value developers can deliver by harnessing the data in this platform. It can be as simple as Starbucks enabling somebody to e-mail a cup of coffee or it can be as sophisticated a doc you signed, streamlining processes for digital signatures based on the understanding of people's availability and organizational hierarchy. 
We continue to make advances in our developer platform by expanding Microsoft Graph APIs and opening Skype to developers. This is generating developer momentum. In fact, active apps calling on Microsoft Graph APIs are up month-over-month. 
In business process application, our Dynamics product line is expanding to include new scenarios such as IoT field service, customer self-service and built-in business intelligence and advanced analytics. For example, Ecolab uses CRM Online with Azure IoT not only to help their customers use water systems more efficiently but also to predict equipment failure and direct field engineers to respond. 
And Just Eat in the U.K. uses Dynamics AX to make it easy for millions of people to order food for takeouts online. These scenarios are driving new growth. Dynamics CRM Online speeds to more than double this quarter, with over 80% of our new CRM customers deploying in the cloud. We grew Dynamics AX revenue double digits. 
Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The cloud is being built into every organization's quest to optimize and grow. With our results this quarter, it remains clear we're 1 of the 2 leaders in this market. Azure revenue increased 120% in constant currency, with revenue from premium services growing triple-digit for the seventh consecutive quarter. 
We are innovating in new areas to help organizations digitally transform. We are expanding our competitive strength in hybrid computing. We're generating opportunity for developers and partners. To start, we added more differentiation to high-value services in Azure this quarter in 3 areas that are top of mind for our customers: artificial intelligence, IoT and business analytics. 
We expanded Cortana Intelligence Suite, our Big Data and analytics service that transforms data into predictions and intelligent action. It now includes over 20 cognitive services ranging from object and emotion recognition to text and linguistic analysis. 
The IoT market is expanding as companies look to deliver new services and value. Our new Azure IoT Suite streamlines the process of building IoT applications and acts as the hub for managing and monitoring millions of assets. Each week, more than 2 trillion IoT messages are processed by Azure. 
And analytics is another rapidly growing market, where Power BI has more than 200,000 customers and 5 million users. Companies like Toyota, BMW, Johnson Controls are all using Cortana Intelligence Suite, Azure IoT and Power BI to transform themselves as well as their industry. Siemens is also using Azure to connect and analyze data for medical imaging systems around the world, helping provide us in their effort to transform health care. 
We're the only cloud provider that helps companies embrace the cloud on their own term. And we continue to innovate in areas that make it easier for our customers, including the recently released preview of Azure Stack and by bringing SQL Server to Linux. 
A critical part of this flexibility is giving customers tools to secure their data wherever it is, on-premise, in the cloud and across all their devices. We continue to grow in this market, with Enterprise Mobility Suite customers more than doubling to over 27,000. This is 3 consecutive quarters of triple-digit customer growth. 
This growth is driven by strong adoption across cloud services. For example, more than 1/3 of our Office 365 enterprise suite installed base has also purchased Enterprise Mobility services. And as I said earlier, perhaps the biggest impact we can make is to empower developers. To this end, we are making Windows and Azure the very best environment for developers who want to build applications that run across multiple platforms. Our acquisition of Xamarin and the inclusion of Bash in Windows 10 will make it easier to build intelligent experiences and app that leverage our cloud and run natively on Windows, iOS and Android. We are excited to announce a build that we are making Xamarin freely available as part of Visual Studio. 
Now let's move to More Personal Computing segment. We are reinventing personal computers and personal computing for the mobile-first cloud-first world. In this world, what matters most is the mobility of a person's experience, not any one single device. 
As I shared last quarter, we think about our strategy along 3 lines: first, we will deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customer; second, we will grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform; third, we will innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. 
First, let me talk through the innovation we are delivering that brings new levels of ease-of-use, trust productivity to Windows and specifically, more value to our enterprise customers. What we hear most frequently from these customers is how much they value the advanced productivity, security and device management capabilities in Windows 10. In fact, this is what led to one of the most security-conscious organizations in the world, United States Department of Defense, to upgrade all of their PCs and mobile devices to Windows 10 this year. We see this trend across our enterprise customers, with 83% of them in active pilots to date. 
We believe enterprise deployments will continue to drive up the over 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The number of Windows 10 devices is twice that of Windows 7 over the same time period since launch. 
At build, we gave people more reasons to upgrade with the announcement of new features in ink and touch interfaces as well as Windows Hello biometric security and deeper integration with Cortana, all coming this summer with the Windows 10 anniversary update. 
Second, we're seeing new monetization through services across the Windows platform. Windows Store received more than 5 billion visits. We are excited about compelling new apps coming from Disney, Square Enix, Bank of America, King, Instagram and many others. 
We grew the number of universe of Windows app developers 60% this quarter. In search, developers have already built over 1,000 apps designed for Cortana. These new third-party experiences and the 6.3 billion questions people have asked are helping make Cortana smarter and driving search engagement. Over 35% of our search revenue last month came from Windows 10 devices. 
In gaming, monthly active users of Xbox LIVE grew 26% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Xbox One and Windows 10. Xbox One continues to outpace prior generations in both reach and engagement. At the same time, we continue to create synergies between Xbox One and Windows 10 devices. Bringing top Xbox One titles to Windows Store helped grow gaming hours on Windows 10 by 50% over last quarter. And starting this summer, universal Windows app will run on Xbox One, making it easy to build applications and games that work across devices.
Third, we continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEM. We are pleased with the results from Surface this quarter. This is our second billion-dollar revenue quarter for Surface in a row, and it's the first outside of a holiday period. Revenue grew 61% in constant currency, driven by Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Certainly, consumers value these devices, but where we see the strongest momentum is through adoption in the commercial space, with particular strength in financial services, manufacturing and health care. 
Our OEM partners are also innovating in new device areas for consumers and business customers. In particular, they too are seeing growth in the 2-in-1 device category. As you can see, we think about renewing growth of Windows. We think broadly about where growth can come from. We see early signs of success in Windows driving increased engagement and monetization of services like search, store and gaming as well as new sources of revenue from Surface. As we build premium devices and premium categories, we're also stimulating demand across our entire ecosystem.
Ultimately, the largest potential for Microsoft's growth will come through reinvention of personal computers and personal computing as well as the new platforms we create. This broader mobile-first cloud-first opportunity cuts across all of our financial segments and technology ambition. And this is what we shared with developers at Build and with business leaders at Envision a few weeks ago. I hope you have had the chance to watch these events as well. 
We're creating entirely new ways for people to interact with technology and also new ways for them to build technology. HoloLens developer kit is one such example. Organizations around the world like Volvo and NASA are using HoloLens to redefine what it means to build and explore and Case Western Universities redefining how students learn to be world-class surgeons. 
Conversational interface is another example. We envision a world where people will more naturally interact with their devices in the future through conversations. Imagine simply asking Cortana to book a hotel or being able to order a pizza through instant message in Skype. Conversations will be a new platform that every business, every app and every website will begin to embrace, and we're at the forefront driving this platform shift. 
We are building out cloud services and platform to enable every business across every industry to digitally transform themselves, and in turn, build their own capability to create more digital technology. Empowering people and organizations to thrive in this digital world is central to Microsoft's mission. I'm proud of our execution so far and what we have achieved, and I'm also grounded in the work ahead of us. 
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions.",1980
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3625.0,996183.0,42096756.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.1 billion, up 2% and up 5% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly, but was up 4% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 1% and 10% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.62, flat year-over-year and up 10% in constant currency. Our effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we anticipated, which impacted our EPS. 
From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as anticipated. However, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa were more unfavorable than we expected. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy fundamentals, which led to a solid quarter of results. Commercial bookings increased 7%, up 9% in constant currency. Our total commercial annuity business had double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, and commercial annuity mix reached 86%, up 4 points year-over-year. 
Commercial unearned revenue grew to just under $18.8 billion, up 3% and 8% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to a higher mix of contracts with more in-period recognition and some deal weakness in the geographic markets mentioned earlier. 
Our contracted not billed balance again exceeded $25 billion. Most important, as Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $10 billion. This quarter, more than 65% of customers who signed enterprise agreements attached our commercial cloud offers, up 15 points from last year. 
Our customers continue to make long-term commitments based on our compelling road map. Our commercial cloud gross margin was 45% this quarter, declining year-over-year. This decrease was driven by a higher mix of Azure revenue, our ongoing investment in data center capacity and geographic expansion and the small FX headwind. 
As I mentioned last quarter, even as we are focused on gross margin improvement within each of our key cloud services, our total commercial cloud gross margin will reflect the dynamics of changing revenue mix and targeted investment. 
In Q3, the FX impact of 3 points on year-over-year revenue growth was generally in line with the guidance, as the recent weakening in the U.S. dollar created less than 1 point of impact overall and across segments. As Chris explained earlier, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 1 point on operating expenses at the total company level. 
As expected, our company gross margin percentage declined this quarter, driven by our accelerating mix of cloud services and our Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segment, offset by higher gross margin percentage performance from products within More Personal Computing. 
Now to our segment results. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.5 billion in revenue, increasing 1% and 6% in constant currency, with higher annuity mix, offsetting lower transactional weakness results due to a weaker PC market.
In Office commercial, revenue was flat and grew 7% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Office 365 with installed base growth across Office, Exchange, SharePoint and Skype workload. Our channel again expanded this quarter as more than 85,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers. 
Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency due to an increasing base of subscribers and recurring subscription revenue. And our Dynamics business grew 4%, up 9% in constant currency. We more than doubled CRM Online seats for the sixth consecutive quarter. 
Segment gross margin dollars declined 4%, up 1% in constant currency. As we've discussed, gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud services revenue mix within the segment. Operating expenses decreased 1% even as we continued engineering investments in our Office 365 and Dynamics businesses and prioritized spend in growth areas like E5, security and voice capabilities. As a result, operating income declined 7%.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.1 billion in revenue, which grew 3% and 8% in constant currency, just at the low end of our guidance range. Our total server products and cloud services revenue was flat year-over-year and increased 5% in constant currency. Against the prior year comparable, we had 16% constant currency growth. 
This quarter, our enterprise server customers continued their commitment to our hybrid cloud platform offerings, which resulted in double-digit annuity revenue growth in constant currency, including over 100% growth in Azure. That growth was partially offset by a larger-than-expected decline in our transactional on-premise server business, which impacted the in-quarter results. Enterprise services continued to perform well, with 11% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency, driven by customer demand for our support services and solutions.
Gross margin declined 2% and grew 3% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage declined as cloud mix accelerated, offsetting margin improvements in Azure and Enterprise services. In response to enterprise customer demand and to increase our share in the cloud market, we grew operating expenses by 13% through Azure-focused investments across engineering, additional sales and marketing capacity and the acquisition of Xamarin. This quarter, operating income declined 14%. 
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $9.5 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 2% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market, which was weaker than we expected. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by a higher-than-expected mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue underperformed the commercial PC market, declining 11% due to the higher inventory level in Q2 that I mentioned in my last earnings commentary. 
Windows volume licensing grew 6% in constant currency, and IP licensing continued to decline, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and a higher mix of lower royalty units. As expected, devices revenue decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 11% or 9% in constant currency, primarily due to phone. Revenue declined 46% in constant currency. 
Additionally, sell-through of our Lumia products was weak, and we exited the quarter with relatively high channel inventory. As Satya mentioned, momentum in our Surface business continued as revenue increased 56% or 61% in constant currency with strong commercial and consumer demand for our service lineup. Overall, device gross margin dollars grew and gross margin percentage improved, primarily driven by a shift to our higher gross margin Surface portfolio. 
Our search business remained strong this quarter, with growth driven by higher revenue per search and higher search volume. We again had U.S. PC share growth and search continued to be profitable. 
In gaming, revenue grew 4% or 6% in constant currency, with continued progress in the monetization of our installed base. We saw higher revenue from Xbox LIVE, driven by both higher volumes of transaction and higher revenue per transaction as well as an increase in revenue from our gaming studios. As expected, Xbox hardware revenue declined, mainly driven by lower Xbox 360 consoles sold and lower Xbox One pricing. 
Segment gross margin increased 2% or 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily through our actions in phone and the transition of our display business to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 57%.
Now back to our overall company results. As planned, we accelerated our data center and cloud services investments to meet growing global demand. This quarter, we invested $2.3 billion in total capital expenditures, including an increase of 65% year-over-year primarily for data centers and servers. Other income was negative $247 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividends, interest income and net recognized gains on investments. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we expected, which reflected the changing mix of revenue across geographies as well as an accelerating shift in revenue from software licensing to cloud services. The rate for the quarter included a catch-up adjustment from Q1 and Q2, reflecting the new full year -- the new expected full year non-GAAP effective tax rate. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let's move to the outlook. First on FX. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we still expect FX to negatively impact year-over-year growth in Q4 by 3 points. By segment, we expect 3 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points in Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing. 
Second, our commercial business. Our commercial business will be on pace for continued strong annuity growth as both new and existing enterprise customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of cloud services. Even with projections of tightening global IT spend and currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be $24.3 billion to $24.5 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We remain on track toward our $20 billion commercial cloud revenue run rate goal as we grow revenue, drive consumption and focus on gross margin improvement in Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online.
Finally, we will continue our investment in data centers in capital equipment to address customer demand for our cloud services. With that, let me share our view by segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to be $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, with continued annuity shift to the cloud offsetting the impact of a weaker PC market on our transactional business and our consumer and commercial segments. 
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, driven by annuity growth, offset by continued transactional weakness. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. 
Here's a bit more detail on its individual components. In Windows, we expect our OEM Pro revenue to be largely in line with the commercial PC market. Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, similar to what we saw in Q3, primarily due to continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices. In devices, we anticipate continued momentum and growth for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, particularly with business customers. For phone, we expect year-over-year revenue declines to steepen in Q4 as we work through our Lumia channel position. In search, we will continue to show healthy revenue growth with full year profitability.
Finally, in gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform and we look forward to E3, where we will announce new titles for the upcoming fiscal year. We expect COGS to be $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, and we expect operating expenses between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion. Our full year guidance is now down to $31 billion to $31.1 billion as we concentrate our investments in engineering and technical sales to accelerate our cloud growth heading into the next fiscal year. 
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $200 million in Q4. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense, offset by dividend and interest income. For tax, based on trends reflected in this quarter's full year catch-up adjustment, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be 21% and 23%. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to share a few directional comments on fiscal '17. This year, we saw strong growth in our commercial cloud portfolio, and we grew our annuity penetration across our commercial business. We anticipate those trends will continue next fiscal year, driving our revenue growth and impacting our gross margin percentages. 
As we continue to unify and modernize our Windows installed base across our consumer and business customers, we will advance our progress and our postsale monetization scenarios and execute on the Windows 10 enterprise deployment opportunity. 
Throughout fiscal '16, our significant investment in engineering, sales and marketing has positioned us to support our customers' digital transformation and to innovate in device form factors like Surface and HoloLens. In fiscal '17, we expect to continue that investment and reallocation process. Therefore, total operating expenses should be flat to up slightly.

It's really, as we talked about, transactional weakness in Productivity and Business Process. We're continuing to expect strong annuity growth. We're continuing to expect a strong mix of the cloud. We're continuing to expect ARPU increases, premium mix increases and installed-base growth. So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment. In Intelligent Cloud, it's a very similar dynamic. We're expecting renewal rates to remain strong as they've been. We're expecting the mix to Azure to continue to grow. We're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth. And again, it's the transactional weakness that you're seeing overall as well as some -- the very specific geo weakness we saw, which I called out earlier. And in More Personal Computing, the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone. So I would really focus on that in that segment. The rest of it frankly is quite good.",157

Obviously, you called out Office 365 commercial seats growing 57% year-over-year, so very consistent with what last quarter was. And Satya, you mentioned the mix shift as well with the release of E5. Wondering if you could just provide some color there, sort of, I guess, a grade of kind of where you are right now, and then as you're contemplating your guidance for Q4 and then kind of thinking about 2017, how should we figure how are you guys thinking about sort of that Office 365 transition there, sort of units and pricing?",103

Overall, the thing that we are most focused on with Office 365 is how do we make sure that we have the Office 365 endpoints everywhere and good usage. And I talked about how the mobile endpoints has been growing and the mobile usage has been growing. I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office. So we feel very good about that, which is users both in terms of coverage and usage. The next place where we are very focused on is really the new scenarios. And E5 is obviously a big element of it. I talked about it in some detail. The security value proposition, that is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice. So we're in the very early innings of E5, but the value proposition and the TAM or the total addressable market of those 3 scenarios is huge, and so we remain very excited about it. The other thing that I'm also sort of excited about when it comes to Office 365 is for the first time, we're opening up Office 365 not just as a end user and a enterprise tool in the service but as a developer platform. In its own right, we think of Office as perhaps one of the most strategic developer assets we have. And with the Microsoft Graph API and what we see as activity around it, we think about the platform effects of that is also being very key. So that's, at least at the macro level, how I look at it and Amy, if you want to talk a little more about...",288

You'd expect to continue to see installed base growth. As even some of the items Satya talked about have more relevance and continue to make us, the value prop higher even in small business, which is where you've seen the user adds. I would continue to expect to see ARPU growth as we see E5 have its impact through the year. And so think about these same dynamics fill for us where we focus on new users and ARPU increases as we shift to Office 365. Those are trends I'd expect to see obviously as we look into '17.",126

I mean, Amazon gives us operating margins, but I guess, I'm wondering, is there a reason you shouldn't be able to reach similar operating margins with Azure at a similar scale if we went back and looked at the progression that Amazon's been disclosing?",99

Thanks for the question. First of all, when Amy and I think about both our CapEx as well as our OpEx, both on the engineering side as well as on our sales and marketing side, we think about they're still at Microsoft Cloud level, just because if you take something like Enterprise Mobility Suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, that attach to Office 365, essentially an infrastructure service that has SaaS-like margins or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to Office developer experiences. So we think about this more holistically and same thing with Dynamics. But having said that is to your specific question of where our differentiation lies. The first one is hybrid. Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server. We obviously support that with all of our service. Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment right, whether it be SQL, whether it be Windows Server, and you will see that increasingly even in this next wave of servers. But we also think of, in fact, our servers at the edge of our cloud. That I think is where the world is going to go to, where distributed computing will remain distributed. So Azure Stack is completely unique to Microsoft. No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of capability. So I would say that's another point of differentiation. So to your point about margins, I feel that we actually will have software licenses with hybrid rights. That's a different margin structure. We will have IaaS services, and you talked about the existence proof at least from Amazon about what margins at scale can be achieved there. We have PaaS services in infrastructure like EMS that have SaaS-like rev margins. And then, of course, we have SaaS services in Office 365. So I think the mix of our growth -- rather, that mix will define our long-term gross margin and operating margin for our cloud services. But the mix will also shift each quarter just because the mix is not a stable mix. We'll see growth in different parts at different times.",372

And how much of that comes from perhaps demand being reallocated towards Infrastructure as a Service offerings that you guys have in Azure? Is there something like a cannibalization taking place within that transactional business today?",73
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3625.0,996183.0,42096773.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,20,"Keith, it's a good question. Let me go through a number of factors that really impact transactional business. First, you're right. There's clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business. Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets where we have a higher percentage of non-annuity business, transactional business. Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment. And specifically, some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place. And so you're certainly seeing the macro impact in the Intelligent Cloud segment and the server weakness is there. And because frankly, we saw that macro weakness, you've even seen it in terms of server shipments, right? If you look at server shipments, you'd say that's actually a macro statement. We didn't see it in any one particular workload. It's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint. And so I actually think between those 2 items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter. And I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these 2 quarters. So I think less about it being cannibalistic because so many of the scenarios in this time period we've seen the growth we expected. We've seen it across our premium services as well as core compute. I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself to again some of those pressures. We also saw, and I would expect, annuity shifts there, which is the final component. Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud. And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances. And so for me, I do tend to think it's a bit more of the macro pressure and budget impacts than it is frankly any other statement or execution.",335

I wouldn't mind asking about the gross margin guidance. If I take the midpoint of your revenue guidance, midpoint of your COGS guidance, it looks like you're guiding to another roughly 200 basis point decline in gross margins in the June quarter, which is about what you did in March. So if we look out to fiscal '17, I know you touched on it a little bit, but just to be clear, it feels like you're guiding to a further year-over-year decline in gross margins, but sounds like that'll be offset in part by continued good OpEx control. So is that the right way to think about it? And is there any way that you could sort of bracket what the gross margin percentage decline might be in fiscal '17? You probably don't want to give specific guidance, but maybe some high-level color.",148

And you're right. In general, let me spend a few seconds on that. You're right. We saw about 200 basis point change this quarter. It's entirely due to the shift to the cloud, both in our Productivity and Business Process segment as well as the Intelligent Cloud segment. Those are the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4. And I would expect stability as we've seen it in our More Personal Computing segment. And so as you think about '17, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would expect to see those same pressures continue to exist. And you're right in that our strong operating expense focus, because really this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now, us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering sales and marketing. And you're right, we do expect to see and continue to do that as we lead into '17 within the overall envelope I discussed.",193

I think we've seen you give very conservative guidance, say for the first half of this year. And in Q3, you ended up sort of, put it all together, at the lower end of your guidance. And I'm wondering, your posture just generally around guidance, if it's changed at all that you're factoring things differently and we should think about that range going forward, should it be more like it's been in the past where you've had very conservative assumptions or more like what you just did here? And then the second part is if you look forward maybe towards longer-term guidance and the prospects of giving longer-term guidance because I don't think I've seen an estimate spread on a company as large as this in a long time, how are you thinking about possibly giving long-term guidance? What are the factors that are influencing your comfort in doing that? Or is it more philosophical and it's something you're just -- you're not going to do that's not necessarily dependent on your view of the business?",190

My philosophical position doesn't change much. I give the guidance that I expect for the quarter, and I do it on the earnings call to the best of my ability. What you've seen this quarter is, in fact, the biggest in-quarter delta for us all the time is the non-annuity performance. And in our -- all of our segments, that is transactional business. That is the most impacted in quarter by budget changes or macro changes. And so the inherent volatility that you are talking about really is about changes in in-quarter that we see and the impact of that. So I don't think it's a philosophical shift. It's just where you see volatility in quarter has always been in the transactional side of our business. The guidance we gave and our annuity positions in terms of renewals and where we saw them were exactly frankly what we expected, with the small exception of the geos that I called out. So I tend to think -- I'll talk a little bit about '17 as I always do, come July, give you all more of a shape to that. But I tend to think -- I'd like to focus on where the company is going, which is cloud mix shift, annuity growth and overall world view of bringing Windows and the ecosystem grow through MPC.",226

We did see that deceleration in server product growth. But the comp was very tough and as you commented, your annuity was up and your deferred growth accelerated. That server product line has grown about 5% constant currency in the last 12 months. I guess the question is, is there any structural reason why, going back to Keith's question, why that would decelerate more ex macro? And then another question I just had is related to this. Can you just remind us, in the server product ex Azure line and in the commercial Office traditional non-365 line, how much is transactional in those 2 segments?",116
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3625.0,996183.0,42096782.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,29,"Sure, Ross. Let me try to take those -- the first question around, is there anything structural or different in that server product line? Really it has been and is that transactional component. You're right, we continue to see the annuity growth. We continue to see the growth through Azure and the offset to that has been the transactional business. I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason other than this change in my world view other than maybe the budget in macro pressure tends to exert itself on that transactional business. But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continuing to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change outside of that component we discussed. In terms of overall rough orders of magnitude, the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%. But that 20%, right, lends itself in quarter to the volatility you see. The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure just because it has both the consumer and the commercial Office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PC. So it's slightly higher all up.",209

Amy, you've been able to grow your op income on constant-currency basis nicely double digits as you've been investing in the cloud. As you look at the results this quarter and as you pointed out the op margins in Intelligent Cloud and business process productivity were impacted due to the shift to the cloud. Do you think that as you look into next year, that the cloud business is at scale that it continues to grow and take share relative to overall revenue? The transaction business, who knows? It could be a bit of a macro pressure. Do you think we're at a point where we could continue to entertain a scenario that op income could still continue to grow nicely as it has in the last 3, 4 quarters? Or is there some other structural change with respect to the margin of the cloud business or maybe the transaction business drops off a lot more dramatically that it may be hard to sustain this nice double-digit op income at a very high level without going into the details?",183

The opportunity for us across what the cloud mix that's possible for our commercial business and this moment in time that I'm a believer in of where companies are going to change their businesses to rely more deeply on technology than they ever have. I believe that our setup for that is the investments we've been making for the past couple of years as well as the investments we're going to make for the next couple. I mean that both in the capital concept but also in my operating expense line. We've managed to do that by continuing to pivot to what I believe are these very high ROI opportunities and pivoting away from opportunities where we've had a chance to become more efficient and where the returns are not going to be as high or the structural growth isn't there. And so for me, to your point, at a high level, I think we can continue to drive revenue, especially annuity and cloud revenue. I think we can continue to improve gross margin percentages in the cloud across all the core cloud services. I think that we can grow profit dollars. And I think that we can do that in the OpEx guidance I gave you for '17 as we continue to pivot to that opportunity. So I think this is one where my optimism frankly for the structure of the market in the segment you chose and my optimism for positioning within that market is reflected in that investment number that you have seen. And so I would continue to expect to see us do it.",281

So the decision logic was driven primarily by what I'd say the increased competitiveness of SQL Server. If you think about where SQL Server now with this new release, SQL Server 2016, it's become a fantastic database for many, many of the workloads, everything from OLTP to data warehousing to BI to advanced analytics. For the Tier 1, this is a capability that's been multiple decades in the work, but here we are with very competitive total cost of ownership, price competitiveness but with a technology that is, in many cases, as Gartner talks about, at the top of the charts when it comes to all of these workloads. So now that we find yourselves with that capability, we're saying, ""Look, what's the way to think about market -- all the markets that we can, in fact, take this product to."" And the Linux operating system database market is not something that -- which is mostly primarily a Tier 1 segment, is something that we never worked in. And so, therefore, we look at that as an expansion opportunity so we take that. We've already made the call that Azure Linux's FirstClass. We already have 20-plus points of -- or 20-plus percent of VMs in Azure or Linux and we'll all increasingly have Linux via big share of percentage of what is happening in Azure. So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about that entire data estate across Windows and Linux. People don't really move between operating systems. Those choices have been made. But at the same time, now they have a choice around database. And so we think that, that's a very good incremental opportunity for us.",292

Kirk Materne,,Analysts,38,"Satya, I wanted to talk a little bit about just the ISV ecosystem on top of Azure and where you think that is today and where you'd hope that potentially to be in 12 months when we think about the opportunity around sort of Platform as a Service and building out more enterprise apps. I think you made some comments around some IoT applications that are now sitting on Azure. What's sort of a good -- what should we be looking for in terms of new partners from survey ISV perspective? You've had companies like Blackbaud sort of replatform. I'm wondering, do you expect that sort of momentum to potentially accelerate as we get in further into the calendar year?",120

I mean, I think, overall for me, across all of our product lines, whether it be Windows or whether it be Office 365 or Azure, developer momentum, ISV momentum, is super important priority for us, both in terms of our developer evangelism, our product engineering teams as well as everything that we will do to even create success for our partners through our field sales organization is a top-of-mind priority, and this is something that Kevin Turner, myself and Amy and all of our leadership team is very focused on. So you will only increasingly see us deliver more design wins there. In fact, I'm looking forward to our partner conference to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year to drive more success for our partners, and in particular, ISVs. The thing that I'm seeing a lot of is we've had traditional strength with SQL as well as .NET. They're moving a significant number of them to the cloud, and in fact, re-platting to be even more multi-tenant and cloud native. At the same time, we're also seeing a lot of open-source ISVs also be part of the Azure marketplace. if you go up to the Azure marketplace today, you'll see that. So we're not only bringing people who have traditionally worked with us, helping them re-plat to a completely new model, but we're also bringing a lot of new ISVs into the fold as well, and that's pretty exciting to see.",256

Today, I'll share the results for the first quarter and discuss how we're innovating in -- to grow in each of our segments.
Overall, we're off to a good start in FY '17. We delivered $22.3 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% in constant currency. I'm proud of the continued progress. Our platforms are leading profound digital transformation outcomes for both people and organizations. 
At our IT conference, Ignite, I talked about how we're innovating in AI across the entire tech stack and how AI will be infused into everything we do. To accelerate our innovation, we have created a dedicated organization to focus on artificial intelligence.
As I turn to the progress we made by segment this quarter, I'll highlight how these investments we are making in AI fuel innovation across all of our ambitions. Let's start with productivity and business process. We are helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar Office apps they use every day. We recently introduced cloud-powered intelligence within Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook that uses machine learning and advanced natural language processing to help automate tasks, Surface-related content and connections, focus your inbox and more easily create compelling content. 
We're also building intelligence into our apps to provide advanced security for customers. This quarter, we announced Office 365 Threat Intelligence, which analyzes billions of signals across Office, Azure Windows and external data sources to give customers broad visibility into attack trends and proactively recommend security policy adjustments. 
We're extending intelligence to compliance with our new data governance service, which helps customers achieve organizational compliance and automate data retention. These advancements are part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen security for our Office 365 E5 customers. 
We are seeing broad momentum with customers across enterprises, small business and consumers. Monthly active users of Office 365 commercials are now over 85 million, up more than 40% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial seats were also up 40% year-over-year and revenue, up 54% in constant currency.
Across industries, customers such as eBay; European airline, easyJet; global pharmaceutical company, Allergan; the Fortune 100 companies like the energy leader, Exelon; and Liberty Mutual insurance, are choosing Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and secure. 
Customers love the power of Office on any device. We now have more than 45 million Outlook monthly active devices on iOS and Android, a more than 70% increase year-over-year. Last week, we unveiled a new class of purpose-built intelligent apps in Dynamics 365 designed to remove any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration and business process. Using advanced analytics and machine learning, these new apps glean insights from previously siloed data to transform how people work across finance, sales, marketing and customer service. They monitor customer relationship health, reveal connections, forecast demand and predict risk. And the deep integration with Office 365 makes it easy to take action, communicate and collaborate in real time or schedule a follow-up. 
Our innovations in Dynamics 365 build on our existing momentum. Dynamic CRM Online paid seats more than doubled year-over-year, and customers increasingly prefer our cloud solutions, with more than 70% of the new Dynamics CRM and ERP enterprise customers choosing Dynamics Online. Companies like HP Inc. are replacing their existing CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence in our latest release and transform engagement with customers and partners. Overall, we are well positioned to compete and grow our share in this large and growing market. 
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Customers continue to choose the Microsoft Cloud to help transform their businesses and organizations. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $13 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year '18. 
Once enterprise customers choose one of our cloud services, they continue to adopt more services. More than 60% of the Fortune 500 now have at least 3 of our cloud offerings, up 20 points year-over-year. And as with last quarter, we continue to grow our commercial annuity mix, which is now at 88%. 
Customers choose Microsoft for 3 reasons: they want a trusted global hyperscale cloud provider to meet the enterprise-grade needs; they want hybrid support that is architected into both the hyperscale service and the cloud servers; they want higher-level services to help them build their own digital capability, inclusive of dev ops productivity, new IoT and enterprise app development, advanced analytics and machine learning and AI capability. 
These differentiated features are leading our cloud infrastructure growth. Azure revenue once again grew triple digits, 121% in constant currency, with Azure compute usage more than doubling year-over-year. We continue to invest in and expand our data center footprint, which now totals 38 regions, including the announcement of our planned expansion into France and the recent opening of data centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. 
Enterprises like Renault-Nissan Alliance, Accor Hotels as well as public sector customers such as the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, the Ireland's Health Service Executive are choosing Azure to transform their organizations while meeting European data sovereignty, security and compliance needs. 
Security and compliance remain paramount for enterprise customers. Azure is already the most trusted, most compliant cloud with 49 certifications, more than any other cloud provider. And our U.S. government cloud has the highest number of certifications and dedicated data center regions in the industry to meet the stringent requirements of our public sector customers. We are applying AI to security with the new Azure Security Center, which leverages advanced analytics and machine learning to detect threats and help enterprise customers respond with comprehensive cybersecurity and management.
Looking beyond infrastructure services, across industries, customers like Daimler Trucks North America, Uber and Lowe's are using Azure's intelligent services to build powerful new offerings for their customers. 
More than half of the Fortune 500 have our Enterprise Mobility services, up more than 20 points year-over-year. This quarter, we released a premium version of our Enterprise Mobility service, that includes advanced security management for SaaS applications, automatic document classification and encryption, advanced identity protection. And we crossed 0.75 billion unique user identities in Azure Active Directory. 
This quarter, we announced a number of key partnerships. Adobe and SAP recognized Azure's leadership in the cloud and are bringing their industry-leading marketing and human resource solutions to our platform, giving our mutual customers powerful new ways to transform their business.
Customers and developers are also choosing Azure for its openness. Enabling digital transformation for everyone means supporting the widest range of platforms, frameworks and tools. This quarter, we announced that we have open-sourced Windows PowerShell, our industry-leading infrastructure management tool and made it available on Linux. 
We continue to see strong interest in the preview of SQL Server on Linux with 19,000 customers registered, including more than half of the Fortune 500. It's opening conversations with customers spanning their entire data estate, both on-premise and in the cloud. Azure service fabric on Linux enables developers to build and manage high-scale micro-services and cloud applications.
And we announced that our new FPGA-powered platform in Azure, capable of exascale compute, will support Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch and our own CNTK frameworks for deep learning. 
Finally, we are building our server products to become the edge of our cloud to support true hybrid computing. The new Windows Server 2016 gives IT professionals new layers of security and brings Azure-inspired innovation for infrastructure and cloud applications. And we extend our partnership with Docker to make the commercially supported Docker engine available to Windows 2016 customers at no additional cost. 
Now let's talk about More Personal Computing, where we're also seeing intelligence transform Windows 10 and our ecosystem of devices. We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and nearly 200 billion hours of usage. And we are expanding our growth opportunities for Windows with enterprises and in areas such as gaming. 
Last quarter, I outlined 3 aspects of our Windows strategy: first, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers; second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform; third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me talk through the progress we are making in each.
This quarter, we released Windows 10 Anniversary Update, with advanced security features, including Windows Defender, Threat Protection, our cloud-enabled service that helps enterprises detect, investigate and respond to advanced network attacks. And with Threat Intelligence sharing capabilities, we enable IT to investigate and respond to security threats across Windows 10 and Office 365. 
Our advancements in security helped to drive a 3x increase in Windows 10 enterprise deployments over the last 6 months. The growth in customer adoption is also driving increased developer, search and Cortana engagement. The number of developers building and updating universal Windows apps is 3 -- up 3x year-over-year. More than 1,000 applications have been developed using the Cortana API, and Windows 10 Cortana search box now has 141 million monthly active users, with almost 13 billion questions asked to date.
Gaming is a leading driver of engagement on Windows 10 and opens up new experiences and scenarios across Windows devices. For the past 3 consecutive months, Xbox One has been the #1 selling console in the United States, giving us strong momentum heading into the holiday season. 
Our highly-engaged Xbox LIVE fan base continues to grow across Windows 10, iOS and Android, up 21% year-over-year, and we have more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets, a more than 500% increase year-over-year. 
Our commitment to grow Xbox LIVE community led us to acquire Beam this quarter, an innovative and interactive live streaming service that gives viewers the ability to watch and play along with their favorite game in real time. 
Finally, let's talk about our progress in new device categories. Surface continues to drive category growth, and more commercial customers are choosing to deploy Surface, with deals of 500 devices or more, increasing 70% year-over-year. And we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. 
The Windows Holographic platform and Microsoft HoloLens are opening up new differentiated opportunities on Windows. This quarter, we made Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition available to all developers and business customers in the U.S. and Canada. And last week, we expanded our presence to 6 additional markets. 
Enterprise customers like Audi, Volvo, Japan Airlines and the PGA TOUR are all embracing Microsoft HoloLens to transform the way they work and create new mixed reality experiences for customers. It's still early but it's great to see the innovation and creativity that developers are bringing to the platform. And coming in 2017, we will enable our hardware partners to deliver entirely new mixed reality experiences with Windows Holographic and -- on Windows 10.
In closing, we are leading digital transformation across all industries and geographies, creating enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. As we infuse AI into all of our computing platforms and experiences, we will drive even greater transformation value for our customers. In the coming weeks, I'm looking forward to sharing news about our new innovation in Windows 10 and Office 365.
Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",1918
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3465.0,1058995.0,44375395.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.3 billion, up 3% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat and up 2% in constant currency. Operating income was flat and grew 4% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.76, increasing 9% or 13% in constant currency.
I'm pleased with the strong execution we saw in the first quarter from our sales teams and the partner ecosystem across both our commercial and consumer businesses. Across most markets, our results were in line with macroeconomic trends, with strength in key markets like the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. 
Momentum in cloud services contributed to a total commercial annuity mix of 88%, up 2 points from the prior year. We again saw higher-than-expected transactional deal volume, primarily driven by Office commercial products in our small and midsize business segment. This quarter, the dollar volume of annuity expirations was significantly larger than the prior year. And with solid renewals from that base, we grew our commercial bookings by 18%. 
The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than $25.5 billion. Strong execution resulted in better-than-expected commercial unearned revenue of $22.3 billion or an 8% increase in constant currency. 
Our commercial cloud revenue run rate exceeded $13 billion this quarter, growing 59%. As I've shared previously, we expect our commercial cloud gross margin percentage to materially improve throughout the year. This quarter, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 49%, up 7 points sequentially, although we do expect variability from quarter to quarter. Importantly, gross margin dollars grew by 61% across the total commercial cloud. 
Now to company gross margin. Our company gross margin was approximately 65%, down a little less than 2 points from the prior year, impacted by an increasing mix of commercial cloud revenue, slightly offset by improvements in More Personal Computing. The revenue performance in More Personal Computing largely drove COGS above our expectations. 
This quarter, the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a 2-point negative impact on productivity and business processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a 1-point negative impact on More Personal Computing results. 
Total operating expenses were flat and grew 1% in constant currency from investments supporting our commercial cloud. At the company level, operating income grew 4% in constant currency.
Let's turn to each segment, where we can now discuss constant-currency impact at the revenue and operating income levels. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations, with approximately $6.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% and 8% in constant currency. 
In Office commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 8% in constant currency as Office 365 growth continued to outpace the shift from our on-premise business. We again grew our installed base across all key workloads. In our Office 365 commercial business, our premium workload mix was above 60%. As mentioned earlier, our transactional results were higher than expected in the small and midsize customers segment and benefited from a stabilizing commercial PC market. 
Office consumer revenue grew 8%, also 8% in constant currency, benefited from a stronger-than-expected consumer PC market, subscriber seat growth and recurring subscription revenue. 
And our Dynamics business grew 11%, up 13% in constant currency as customer preference for our cloud services and CRM Online and Dynamics AX contributed to billings and seat growth. Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Segment gross margin percentage declined on an increasing cloud revenue mix. 
Operating expenses grew 2%, also 2% in constant currency, primarily driven by investments in cloud engineering. Operating income declined slightly but was up 2% in constant currency. 
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered nearly $6.4 billion in revenue, above our expectations, and grew 8% or 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 11% and 13% in constant currency. Demand for our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth with in-server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional on-premise server business. Server premium products grew double digits in constant currency.
As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth slowed this quarter to 1% and 2% in constant currency, largely due to a decreasing volume of support agreements associated with Windows Server 2003 end of support. 
Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined, primarily due to increasing cloud revenue mix, partially offset by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. 
Given the growth opportunity in cloud, we increased our operating expenses by 21%, also 21% in constant currency, to fund cloud engineering, sales capacity and developer engagement. Consequently, operating income declined 14% and 11% in constant currency. 
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $9.3 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency and better than expected across multiple businesses. 
First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business was flat this quarter, more in line with the PC market and better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue grew 1%, reflecting the stabilizing commercial PC market, particularly in the U.S. OEM non-Pro revenue declined by 1%, slightly ahead of the consumer PC market, driven by a higher mix of premium devices. 
Channel inventory levels for OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels. As Satya said, we're seeing strong growth in Windows 10 enterprise deployments. The annuity portion of our Windows commercial business grew again in constant currency as customers continued to commit to our differentiated security and management solutions. 
Overall, our total Windows commercial business revenue across small and midsized businesses, enterprises and academic institutions was flat and grew 2% year-over-year in constant currency. Patent licensing revenue increased this quarter, primarily due to favorable results in our annual contractual agreements. 
Our search business grew again this quarter, driven by rate and volume improvements in Bing. Though our growth rate has moderated, we continued to gain share and scale while delivering profit. 
As expected, Devices revenue declined this quarter. Revenue decreased 27%, down 25% in constant currency due to Phone while revenue declined 72% and 71% in constant currency. Surface revenue increased 38%, 39% in constant currency, driven by year-over-year growth for Surface Pro 4 and Book, which launched in Q2 of the prior year. 
In Gaming, revenue declined 5% or 4% in constant currency due to lower console hardware revenue. We continue to see strong engagement on our platform, with monthly active Xbox LIVE users up 21%. Our software and services revenue from console, PC and other gaming devices grew 6% or 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars declined 1%, up 1% in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles and Phone were partially offset by our search and Surface results.
Segment gross margin percentage improved slightly, given the revenue shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses decreased 13%, also 13% in constant currency, primarily based on reduced Phone spend and lower marketing spend, resulting in segment operating income growth of 26% and 31% in constant currency. 
Now back to our company results. We invested $2.3 billion in capital expenditures, a decline from Q4 but consistent with our plan for investment to support customer and partner demand for our commercial and consumer cloud services. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio, which resulted in other income and expense of $100 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest, partially offset by interest expense.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17% this quarter. As I've mentioned before, our income tax rate is impacted by 3 factors: the proportion of service revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests. In our first quarter, equity vests impact the rate more significantly than in other quarters.
We returned $6.6 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 8% to $0.39. 
With that overview of the quarter, let's turn to the outlook. My commentary for the upcoming quarter does not include LinkedIn. We still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.
Turning to FX. We expect 1 point of revenue impact at both the total company and individual segment levels. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy. Though we will still see and experience variability in our transactional business, we will also see strong annuity growth, driven by solid renewal execution and increasing customer adoption and use of our cloud services. Therefore, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $21.05 billion to $21.25 billion.
Next on CapEx. We'll continue to invest to meet growing demand and see quarterly variability in spend. We expect a sequential dollar increase in the upcoming quarter. For the full year, our total expected CapEx growth rate should be lower than FY '16, given efficiency improvements.
Now let me share some additional thoughts for each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. We expect the ongoing transition to the cloud to drive installed base growth, with continuing declines in our transactional business. 
For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.55 billion to $6.75 billion, driven by strong annuity growth across our server products and cloud services. We anticipate the Enterprise Services revenue will decline due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $11.2 billion to $11.6 billion. This segment is impacted by different trends than our other 2 segments, so some additional detail.
First on Windows. We expect our OEM business and the underlying PC market to be closely aligned. As a reminder, in our OEM Pro business, we exited Q2 last year with a slightly higher level of inventory. We currently see normal inventory levels in the channel, which will dampen year-over-year growth a bit. 
In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth, ex TAC, to be similar to Q1. Additionally, we expect that total search revenue growth will slow considerably as we pass the 1-year anniversary of our Yahoo! deal and the associated change in revenue recognition. Phone revenue will continue to decline. And as we previously announced, we anticipate closing the sale of our feature phone business in Q2. 
We expect Surface revenue to decline as we anniversary the product launch from a year ago. And in gaming, we expect strong share performance in key markets like the U.S. and the U.K. this holiday, but overall revenue will decline, given lower price points and lower overall console units as mix shifts towards Xbox One and Xbox One S. We expect continued active engagement growth on our gaming platform, given the holiday season.
We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.85 billion and $7.95 billion in Q2. And we remain on path for full year operating expense of $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion. 
We expect other income and expenses to be $150 million as we continue to balance gains on equity investments and income from interest and dividends against the interest expense and the net cost of hedging. 
We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be 20%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability due to the 3 factors discussed earlier. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.",1910

Overall, again, I'd go back to how we think about Azure. We really have a view of distributed computing, which is more expansive than just even our hyperscale cloud. We think about Azure and our service as one distributed computing fabric that we're building. We also don't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as independent. We think of them all together building out our commercial cloud because take one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT. But it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. They collect the data, they store the data, they analyze and do predictions on it. But then after you do predictions, you've got to do something about the predictions. So in many cases, they choose to use, especially with the new Dynamics 365 field service module, automating field service. So it's those higher-level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating. And that's something that, obviously, we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. This is a decision we made many, many years ago. In some sense, the inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client/server era. And I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing, and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.",249

That seems to imply you guys are seeing some nice ASP increase as the platform matures. Can you talk to us about where we are in that cycle of guys moving from like E1 to E3? Is E5 part of the equation? Are the other guys actually moving there yet?",90

Why don't I take that one? When I talk about the premium services mix in our Office commercial 365 business being above 60%, that is what's driving. Whether that's the mix shift to E3 or, ultimately, to E5, you'll continue to see and have headroom in that number. But you're right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time. I don't really think about there being sort of a cap on that when you think about the mix percentage because part of it is, as you know, not just adding the first few nodes in E3, it's continuing to add E5 and new scenarios over time that we'll continue to create. So hopefully, that's helpful. But you are right, it is ARPU-driven, the performance outside of the 40% seat growth.",151

I'm just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you see PaaS coming along, and where do you think we are in getting kind of the easier workloads to the cloud? And are you now starting to see the inflection, given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter, where you're starting to see kind of production -- significant production workloads that are on-premise actually starting to move over as well?",119

We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from on-premise. But I think the more interesting thing, Heather, for us is to see new workloads. When I look at what's happening with, say, to take some of the most innovative work we have done around distributed computing, which is service fabric, and how people are, in fact, going straight to building out using our PaaS services, some of the new hyperscale service -- cloud services using microservices. And not only are they doing that but we're also seeing great growth in our serverless infrastructure, which is Azure Functions. So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers. So the most interesting thing that I'm observing is that it could be the same auto customer that was participating with us in the client/server era who are not just building or moving their IT but they're building new digital services for hyperscale. And that's what is probably unique in terms of what has changed year-over-year for us. It's not just the Silicon Valley startups anymore. It is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company. And we are well positioned to serve them, and that's good to see.",211

The operating cash flow generation, $11.6 billion, was extraordinary. I don't think you've had a 50-plus percent cash flow margin since early 2012.

So you'll actually see that revert in Q2.

The margin for commercial cloud improved 7% which, given the size, is a large improvement. Can you give us some more details on what exactly is driving that margin improvement? And you said it's going to be improving over the year, but how sustainable is that drive to improvement?",58
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3465.0,1058995.0,44375411.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,19,"Let me start, Mark, and then, Amy, you can add to it. Again, Mark, this goes back to a little bit of understanding, I guess, how we think about both CapEx as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud, right, the architectural design we have. For example, when we do CapEx, we are buying the equipment for everything that Microsoft does, which is everything from Azure to Office 365 to Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services like Xbox LIVE. So -- and you see the growth that we talked about across all of this. Then we have a very common platform, both for our first-party workloads as well as our third-party business. And so then as we drive efficiency in our cloud infrastructure, when we, for example, use FPGA to get more out of our network, that's efficiency that we gain across the marginal cost and gross margin that spans everything that we do. Then also what we think about as the mix, our goal is not to just sell commodity services but to actually use commodity services, in some cases, as a bootstrap for higher-level services because of things like data gravity. So there will be differences quarter-to-quarter. We may, in fact, onboard a few customers who first onboard a lot of storage at commodity service levels and then later on start consuming some of the higher-level services. So the margin improvement on a large -- over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see. But for quarter to quarter, there will be more volatility, but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we are building. We're not just building Azure. We're building Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services, which are all cloud-oriented. And it's the combination of that, that's driving margin. But Amy, I'll let you add to it.",327

And I would say in terms of sustainability or quarter-to-quarter, Satya is right, there is going to be variability. And the variability is really 2 things. One is the pace of the mix shift to Azure. As it grows at the pace we've seen, it does impact quarter-to-quarter the overall commercial cloud revenue mix. But I would also say the directionality of the Azure gross margin, for example, which we said significantly improved, we expect to continue certainly over the course of this year as we've discussed. So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct. And I think the variability can certainly occur for many of the reasons Satya has talked about.",114

Do you expect to see, as we get towards the end of the year, that the 2 sort of enterprise cloud segments move positive and MPC is not as much of a driver? How should we think about the evolution of the product contribution of the 3 segments over the year?",87

Let me -- I'm actually going to cover our commercial segments as one because, really, when you think about the commercial cloud, it's really about capturing the opportunity of selling more complete solutions, which include Dynamics and Office, plus some components of Azure, which is I think really the trend you'll see us talk about from here on out. So what I would say is you will continue to see us focus on gross margin improvement, and we've talked about that. You will also continue to see us invest where we see massive market addressable expansion with sales capacity as well. So I think we've pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. You'll continue to see us do that, but we also expect revenue growth and gross margin growth to come out of that investment. So I do believe that's a continued pace you'll see us on. And we feel good about the ROI of the investments we've made, especially in those commercial segments. In MPC, I generally expect you'll continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that we'll have over the course of the year. That's not new. You saw the same mechanism last year through the year as we pivot from our Phone business to some of our higher-margin products. And so I suspect you'll see a similar pattern and a similar desire by Satya and I to continue to invest toward growth, especially on the commercial side.",248

Let me break apart that long-term unearned balance a bit. I do really focus, and I think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our commercial business, to focus only on the unearned commercial balance. Our overall long-term unearned balance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the past bit. And so it can make a bit of a distraction towards seeing the underlying trend. That being said, our commercial unearned balance is seeing good growth. I'm proud of our performance this quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. And if you think about sort of any change we're making or not in our partner agreements or customer agreements, we still do generally rely, the vast majority, on 3-year agreements. So whether or not the term were to change, given how we recognize revenue, I would let you know if it was going to be material. And I do not expect the change you're talking about to be material in any way on the commercial unearned balance.",172

We obviously saw a very interesting announcement from AWS and VMware which kind of seems to suggest that hybrid cloud is the way forward and both vendors have to react. Can you talk a little bit about your customer feedback around the hybrid cloud offering from you and how are your customers thinking about that working with you together?,68

And I spoke to this a little earlier because, in some sense, from day 1, I had -- we have this vision of how we want to build for a future of distributed computing that included our hyperscale cloud service, which is Azure. And in fact, Azure is built on Hyper-V, and we always said that we were going to build our server at the edge of our hyperscale cloud. And so that's what Windows Server 2016 represents. That's what SQL Server 2016 represents. And so we have these unique capabilities like being able to stretch even a single table in a database in SQL 2016 all the way to the cloud for having infinite table capacity and then having your apps and queries work. How we're doing containers, for example, in Windows Server 2016, we have great container support as well as support for things like our service fabric, so that people can have absolute application portability. And in fact, people can even tier applications. We have had many customers who tier their storage and compute across a hybrid backplane. So this is an architectural design point that we have built for from the ground up from day 1. And it's good to see people validating it now and elsewhere, and we'll take that as a validation of something that we thought of a long time ago.",230

One, it is about the hybrid design point that is at the core of how we are built, both Azure as well as our servers. It is because of the higher-level services that we have. It is also because of the design point we have around not just Azure but as well as Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and the extensibility of our cloud services, across all 3 of them. And that's really the fundamental reasons why customers choose us. The other thing I would sort of mention is we have more of a commitment, I would say, which has been there from a long time, to build out a global footprint. We have more regions than anyone. We have more certifications than anyone in terms of adhering to both regulated industry as well as digital sovereignty needs. So we've done unique things. We're the only public cloud provider, for example, that operates in China. We operate in Germany under German law. And that matters to multinational companies that also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions. So those are our core attributes that are driving our growth, and we'll continue to stay focused on them.",224

And so I think when you think about that plus the breadth of our offerings, I think we're pretty confident. I will take the opportunity because we haven't been asked about Windows 10 and the enterprise, I think we are encouraged by the pace of deployment, the number of proof of concepts and actually some of the stability we've seen in the commercial PC market in terms of starting to see some refresh rates. So I think overall, I think we'll continue to watch, but our security and management value prop, I think, really is paying off.",128

As you think about the port to Linux, I wonder if you could provide an update on 2 things: one is just the timing on when we should see that in market; and then two, are there other things you need to do to meet that requirement of across the landscape. So for example, do you have to think about supporting Java runtimes inside of SQL Server, moving a little bit away from the traditional .NET development environment? Just curious as to how you're thinking about getting your arms around a wider set of use cases on alternative operating systems.",111

Overall, we are very, very excited about what we are seeing with SQL on Linux because the entire idea was to be able to have a full conversation around the data estate with customers and to now be able to talk about the full SQL estate but quite -- one of the other conversations that we're having is not just about SQL but our analytics and advanced analytics with R, where we have done some very, very compelling work again across Linux and Windows. And then, of course, the cloud. So it's really the combination of SQL advanced analytics and the cloud, with things like Azure Data Lake, that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital capability and the next generation of services and both the storage and processing capability they need. Now in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why, for example, on Azure itself, Java is first-class. We have Linux as first-class. We have real openness to all of the frameworks that you can call out to. And that's something that we stay very attuned to, which is we are not trying to fight some old battles.

Having said that, Microsoft has worked on AI projects for quite some time, so can you help us understand what degree of positive change you think will come from the combined group that you've recently formed, including when you think material AI benefits will become truly ingrained in your customers' workflows? And then secondly, how should we think about your incremental investment in AI going forward?",86

Overall, I'm thrilled about both the AI group that we have formed, the AI research and the heritage we have with MSR. Even this week, I think we publicly are talking about setting the state-of-the-art when it comes to something like speech recognition. And it's something that we did even with ImageNet in image recognition and object rec. so these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you don't have a real commitment to research and then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn it into products. So the way to measure though from the investment side is to see AI when it's sort of infused into everything we do. Take HoloLens. The ability of HoloLens to be able to see the world reconstructed and in that world to be able to super-impose holograms, that's AI, applied AI that's working today. When you have Skype Translate, when 2 people are talking 2 different languages and are able to automatically translate without an interpreter between languages, it's using a deep neural net that's bringing together speech synthesis, speech recognition and machine translation with Skype data, and that's fairly magical. When you see FPGA capable of running CNTK or TensorFlow to create intelligence, that is what we are using, in fact, for our speech and vision work, that is AI as applied today. So I'm not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI. We are very much going forward. Even the Office tools example I used. They are all using AI today. The PowerPoint Designer, if you want the most practical use of it, even I can design great PowerPoint slides now because of AI. And so that's how I measure progress. We are committed to long-term research, but we are also very focused on having that long-term research translated into everyday use products, and that's what you will see from us going forward.",321

With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact it a couple of points either way, but I don't think about that as really a material impact you should think about in the next couple of quarters.

On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. 
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which include research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. 
As a reminder, in May, we announced plans to further streamline the Phone Hardware business. During the fourth quarter, restructuring and related impairment expenses were $1.1 billion. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation. 
At the segment level, we provide constant-currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent changes to our segment reporting groupings, we're not able to provide segment level constant-currency operating expense growth and, consequently, cannot derive constant-currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant-currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level. 
We'll post our prepared remarks on our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 19, 2017. 
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",498

I want to thank all the Microsoft team members and partners who contributed to a successful year. We are proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are positioned for new growth. Today, Amy and I will share our fourth quarter results and our perspective on the year ahead. 
We delivered $22.6 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% for the quarter in constant currency. This past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnerships with customers who are also driving their own digital transformation. Our progress is best captured in the results of our 3 ambitions, starting with Productivity and Business Process. In a world of infinite information but finite attention and time, we aim to change the nature of work with digital technology. 
In pursuit of this ambition, we continue to add value to our products, grow usage and increase our addressable market. Along these lines, let me start with Office 365 and then move to Dynamics 365. In the last quarter, we advanced our collaboration tools. We launched Microsoft Planner, which helps teams manage operations as well as Skype meetings, which is aimed at helping small businesses collaborate. In June, we further strengthened our security value proposition with the release of Advanced Security Management.
Lastly, we continue to add intelligence and machine learning to Office to help people automate their tasks and glean insights from data. These advancements help to drive increased usage across enterprises, small and medium businesses and consumers. In the enterprise, Office 365 commercial seats grew 45% year-over-year, and revenue grew 59% in constant currency. Also, 70% of our Office Enterprise Agreement renewals are in the cloud. Innovative companies like Facebook, HERSHEY'S, Discovery Communications, Cushman & Wakefield, all adopted Office 365 and now see how transformative this service can be for their own business. We are enthusiastic about the early feedback and growth opportunity from companies using our newly released Office 365 E5, which includes powerful security controls, advanced analytics and cloud voice. These customers tell us that they love the simplification that comes with standardizing across all of our productivity workloads. 
We see momentum in small and medium businesses, with a growing number of partners selling Office 365, now up to nearly 90,000, a 25% increase year-over-year. We continue to grab share and adding over 50,000 customers each month for 28 consecutive months. We also see momentum amongst consumers with now more than 23 million Office 365 subscribers. Across segments, customers increasingly experience the power of Office on their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, we now have more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices, up more than 4x over last year. 
Now let's talk about progress with the other pillar of this ambition, Dynamics 365. We're removing any impedance that exists within productivity, collaboration and business process. This month, we took a major step forward with the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource. Dynamics 365 provides business users with purpose-built SaaS applications. These applications have intelligence built in. They integrate deeply with communications and collaboration capabilities of Office 365. Dynamics 365, along with AppSource and our rich application platform, introduces a disruptive and customer-centric business model, so customers can build what they want and use just the capabilities they need. 
The launch of Dynamics 365 builds on the momentum we're already seeing in this business. Customers around the globe are harnessing the power of Dynamics in their own transformation, including 24 Hour Fitness and AccuWeather. Overall, Dynamics now has nearly 10 million monthly paid feeds, up more than 20% year-over-year, and Q4 billings grew more than 20% year-over-year. Overall, business processes represent an enormous addressable market projected to be more than 100 billion by 2020. It's a market we are increasingly focused on, and I believe we are poised with both Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource to grow and drive opportunity for our partners. 
Across Office 365 and Dynamics 365, developers increasingly see the opportunity to build innovative apps and experiences with the Microsoft Graph, and we now have over 27,000 apps connected to it. Microsoft AppSource will be a new way for developers to offer their services and reach customers worldwide. 
Lastly, with Office 365 and Dynamics 365, we have the opportunity to connect the world's professional cloud and the world's professional network with our pending LinkedIn deal. 
Overall, the Microsoft Cloud is winning significant customer support. With more than $12 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate, we're on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year '18. Also, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 companies have at least 3 of our cloud offerings, and we continue to grow our annuity mix of our business. In fact, commercial annuity mix increased year-over-year to 83%. 
Now let's get into the specifics of the Intelligent Cloud, an area of massive opportunity as we are clearly one of the 2 enterprise cloud leaders. Companies looking to digitally transform need a trusted cloud partner and turned to Microsoft. As a result, Azure revenue and usage again grew by more than 100% this quarter. We see customers choose Microsoft for 3 reasons: they want a cloud provider that offer solutions that reflect the realities of today's world and their enterprise great needs; they want higher-level services to drive digital transformation; and they want a cloud open to developers of all types. 
Let me expand on each. To start, a wide variety of customers turn to Azure because of their specific real-world needs. Multinationals choose us because we are the only hybrid and hyperscale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions. We cover more countries and regions than any other cloud provider, from North America to Asia to Europe to Latin America. Our cloud respects data sovereignty and makes it possible for an enterprise application to work across these regions and jurisdictions. 
More than 80% of the world's largest banks are Azure customers because of our leadership support for regulatory requirements, advanced security and commitment to privacy. Large ISVs like SAP and Citrix as well as startups like Sprinklr, also choose Azure because of our global reach and our broad set of platform services. Last week, GE announced it will adopt our cloud for its IoT approach. 
Next, Azure customers also value our unique higher-level services. Now at 33,000, we nearly doubled in 1 year the number of companies worldwide that have selected our Enterprise Mobility solutions. The Dow Chemical Company leverages EMS along with Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics to give its thousands of employees secure, real-time access to data and apps from anywhere. Just yesterday, we announced Boeing will use Azure IoT Suite and Cortana Intelligence to drive digital transformation in commercial aviation with connected airline systems optimization, predictive maintenance and much more. This builds on great momentum in IoT, including our work with Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric and others. This is great progress, but our ambitions are set even higher. 
Our Intelligent Cloud also enables cognitive services. Cortana Intelligence Suite offers machine learning capabilities and advanced predictive analytics. Customers like Jabil Circuit, Fruit of the Loom, Land O'Lakes, Liebherr, already realize the benefits of these new capabilities. 
Lastly, central to our Intelligent Cloud ambition is providing developers with the tools and capabilities they need to build apps and services for the platforms and devices of their choice. The new Azure Container Service as well as .NET Core 1.0 for open source and our ongoing work with companies such as Red Hat, Docker, Mesosphere, reflects significant progress on this front. We continue to see traction from open source with nearly 1/3 of customer virtual machines on Azure running Linux. 
On the server side, premium server revenue grew double-digits in constant currency year-over-year. New SQL Server 2016 helps us expand into new markets with built-in advanced analytics and unparalleled performance. More than 15,000 customers, including over 50% of the Fortune 500 have registered for the private preview of SQL Server for Linux. And we're not slowing down. We will launch Windows Server 2016 and Systems Server 2016 later this year.
Now let's talk about the progress in More Personal Computing. We have increased Windows 10 monthly active devices, and they're now at more than 350 million. This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release. While we are proud of these results, given changes to our Phone plan, we changed how we will assess progress. 
Going forward, we will track progress by regularly reporting the growth of Windows 10 monthly active devices in addition to progress on 3 aspects of our Windows strategy. First, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform. Third, innovating new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me walk through each. 
We continue to pursue our goal of moving people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows. In 2 weeks, we will launch Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which takes a significant step up in security. We are also extending Windows Hello to support apps and websites and delivering a range of new features like Windows Ink and updates to Microsoft Edge. We expect these advances will drive increased adoption of Windows 10, particularly in the enterprise in the coming year. We already have strong traction with over 96% of our enterprise customers piloting Windows 10. 
Next, as we grow our installed base and engagement, we generate more opportunity for Microsoft and our ecosystem. Bing profitability continues to grow with greater than 40% of the search revenue in June from Windows 10 devices. Bing PC query share in the United States approached 22% this quarter, not including volume from AOL and Yahoo!. The Cortana search box has over 100 million monthly active users, with 8 billion questions asked to date. 
We continue to drive growth in gaming by connecting fans on Xbox LIVE across Windows 10, iOS and Android. Just this quarter, we launched our Minecraft Realms subscription on Android and iOS. Overall, engagement on Xbox LIVE is at record levels with more than 49 million monthly active users, up 33% year-over-year. At E3, we announced our biggest lineup of exclusive games ever for Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs. And we announced Xbox Play Anywhere titles where gamers can buy a game once and play it on both their Windows 10 PC and Xbox One. We also announced 2 new members of the Xbox One console family, the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio. The Windows store continues to grow with new universal Windows apps like Bank of America, Roku, SiriusXM, Instagram, Facebook, Wine, Hulu and popular PC games like Quantum Break. 
Finally, we are innovating in new device categories in partnership with OEMs. Our hardware partners are embracing the new personal computing vision, with over 1,500 new devices designed to take advantage of Windows 10 innovations like Touch, Pen, Hello and better performance and power efficiency. 
Microsoft's family of Surface devices continues to drive category growth, and we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. We recently announced new Surface enterprise initiatives with IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton to enable more customer segments. Also in the past year, we grew our commercial Surface partner channel from over 150 to over 10,000. 
Lastly, this quarter, more and more developers and enterprise customers got to experience 2 entirely new device categories from Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. While we are still in the early days of both of these devices, we have seen great traction with both enterprise customers and developers making us optimistic about future growth. 
In closing, I want to reflect on the opportunity ahead of us. Simply put, businesses will not just use digital technologies, but they will become digital companies. This generates enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. We are the ones who can empower digital transformation across all industries, companies and geographies with our technology and platforms. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions.",2046
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3687.0,1178310.0,48479510.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.6 billion, up 2% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat but up 4% in constant currency. Operating income this quarter declined by 3% and grew 6% in constant currency. And earnings per share were $0.69, increasing 11% year-over-year or 27% in constant currency.
Across most markets, our execution and results were generally as expected, with some strength in the U.S. But we did see additional softness in Brazil, the Middle East and Africa, which were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds. From a seasonality perspective, the fourth quarter is always an important one for our commercial business. Our results were strong as our sales teams led with our cloud offers. Healthy renewal helped to drive double-digit annuity performance in constant currency. Our total annuity mix reached 83%, up 1 point year-over-year. While our commercial cloud continued to drive a higher annuity mix overall, we also had better-than-expected transactional revenue performance as products like Office 2016 and SQL Server 2016 generated more deal volume. 
The dollar volume of expiring enterprise agreements was smaller this quarter than last year. On that base, our commercial bookings increased 4% in constant currency, driven by customer preference for our cloud offers. Commercial unearned revenue slightly beat our expectations at $24.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance exceeded $25.5 billion. 
As Satya called out earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue rate exceeded $12.1 billion, growing more than 50% year-over-year. Additionally, more than 70% of customers who signed Enterprise Agreements this quarter attached cloud offerings. Our commercial cloud gross margin was 42%, declining year-over-year, driven by investments for cloud capacity, deployment and support. 
Now let's turn to company gross margin performance. We were above our COGS expectations due to approximately $200 million of inventory adjustments from the change in our Phone Hardware business. And, as expected, our mix of cloud services revenue continued to increase, resulting in gross margin percentage declines in the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments. Importantly, gross margin dollars expanded year-over-year in constant currency. 
In Q4, the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a 3-point negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a 2-point negative impact on More Personal Computing results. As we've noted in previous quarters, we're not able to provide constant-currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and, therefore, segment operating income. This quarter, total operating expenses grew 1% in constant currency, above our expectations due to legal settlements and revenue-driven sales cost. At the company level, our operating income grew 6% in constant currency as FX had a 9-point impact on our results. 
Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations, with nearly $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 5% and 8% in constant currency. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 9% in constant currency as Office 365 growth outpaced the shift from our on-premises business. Our seat growth was driven by broad-based momentum across commercial customers of all sizes. While we generally expect transactional purchasing to continue to decline, results across all products came in higher-than-anticipated this quarter. 
Office consumer revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, outperforming the consumer PC market, driven by seat growth, recurring subscription revenue and 6 points of growth from Japan, which had a particularly weak quarter a year ago. And our Dynamics business grew 6%, up 7% in constant currency with strong billings and seat growth. Segment gross margin dollars were flat and up 4% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud revenue mix within the segment, coupled with an increase in cloud investments. Operating expenses grew 6% from investments in commercial cloud sales programs and engineering. As a result, operating income declined 5%. 
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered slightly more than $6.7 billion in revenue, growing 7% and 10% in constant currency. Demand and use of our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional on-premises server business. 
Enterprise services revenue grew 12%, 14% in constant currency, as customer demand for Windows Server 2003 and the support agreement and premier services continued this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 1% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentages declined as cloud mix accelerated. This quarter, operating income declined 17%, driven by investment in sales resources and engineering. 
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $8.9 billion, down 4% and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business grew 11% this quarter outperforming the overall PC market, which was better than we expected in most markets, including the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by incremental weakness in India and Russia. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 27% and, similar to last quarter, was driven by a higher mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue grew 2%, reflecting a stabilizing commercial PC market and a higher mix of business PCs sold with Windows Pro. 
Inventory, across both OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels. Windows volume licensing grew 3% and 9% in constant currency with ongoing annuity growth. IP licensing declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and lower revenue per unit. 
We continued to execute well in our search business this quarter. And as we committed, Bing was profitable for the full fiscal year, driven by increasing revenue per search and search volume. As expected, devices revenue significantly decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 35%, also 35% in constant currency, due to Phone, where revenue declined 70% in constant currency. Surface revenue increased 9% in constant currency as Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book growth was partially offset by unit declines in our prior-generation Surface 3. 
And in gaming, revenue declined 9% or 8% in constant currency, driven by lower Xbox 360 unit volume and reduced Xbox One pricing. Our overall gaming ecosystem showed healthy growth with 49 million monthly active Xbox LIVE users or a 33% increase and 4% Xbox LIVE revenue growth. Segment gross margin dollars declined 3%, or roughly flat in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles and the Phone inventory adjustment were partially offset by our OEM and search results. Operating expenses decreased this quarter by 13% based primarily on reduced Phone spend and the transition of display advertising sales to AOL, resulting in segment operating income growth of 59%. 
Now back to our overall company results. We invested $3.1 billion in capital expenditures, consistent with our plan for accelerated investment as we added both commercial and consumer global cloud capacity to meet near-term and longer-term customer demand. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio, which resulted in other income and expense of $267 million from net recognized gains on investments, partially offset by interest expense. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15% this quarter, lower than we expected. Our income tax expense reflected a favorable mix between U.S. and foreign currencies, as well as benefits associated with distributions from foreign affiliates. 
This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. 
Before turning to next quarter's outlook, I want to share our view on the shape of next fiscal year. My commentary, both on the year and next quarter, does not include LinkedIn. However, we still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. 
For the full year, we expect the FX impact to lessen throughout the year, assuming current rates remain stable. In H1, we expect the total impact of 1 point, reducing to 0 in H2. The fundamentals of our commercial business remain strong, and we anticipate that cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive high annuity mix. As I've noted before, our Commercial transactional business is influenced by different dynamics. Most important, it's impacted by a structural transition to the cloud across all workloads, but it's also more sensitive to overall macroeconomic conditions and changes in corporate budgets. We expect volatility as we saw in both Q3 and Q4 this year to continue in the next fiscal year. 
Before discussing our total company gross margin expectations, let me first address commercial cloud gross margin. We expect the commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars to materially improve next fiscal year. We have invested heavily to build share, expand geographically and ensure world-class support and reliability for our commercial customers. Going forward, we expect those investments to provide benefits of scale. We also anticipate our cloud capital expenditure growth curve will slow. Given seasonality and revenue mix, commercial cloud gross margin will see variability quarter-to-quarter but an overall trend of material improvement. 
At the company level, at each cloud service continues to grow and improve its gross margin percentage, our company gross margin should only decline roughly 1 point in FY '17. We now expect our full-year operating expense will be $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion, as we continue to prioritize spend on strategic growth opportunities. 
Lastly, our effective tax rate. Our tax rate is impacted by 3 factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing of equity vests. As our cloud continues to gain momentum, we expect our tax rate to increase. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% for the full year, plus or minus 2 points. 
Now to the outlook for the next quarter. Based on current currency rates and forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect 2 points of negative impact on total revenue in Q1. By segment, the negative impact is 2 points in Productivity and Business Process, 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $21.8 billion to $22 billion, in line with historic seasonality. In Productivity and Business Process, we expect revenue to be $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion. We will continue to grow our installed base and drive premium mix through offers like Office 365 E5. We anticipate continued transactional decline as customer migration to the cloud accelerates. 
In our consumer business, we will outpace the consumer PC market. But the benefit from Japan's improved results over a weak prior period and the benefit from last year's Office 2016 launch are not expected to repeat.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion, driven by continued annuity strength across Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings, offset by ongoing declines in our transactional on-premises server business and moderating growth from support agreement and enterprise services. 
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. We anticipate that our OEM revenue will be more in line with overall PC market trends. Devices revenue will decline again from more actions in Phone. Gaming revenue will be driven by the same factors as in Q4. And in search, we expect Bing's growth trajectory to continue. 
We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion with variability due to device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.35 billion and $7.45 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be approximately 0 as realized gains on investment should offset debt expense.

I may have one question for Satya and one question for Amy. Satya, you mentioned the Boeing agreement. What was interesting about that is not just a large company moving significant workloads onto Azure, but from my reading, it sounds like there's a distribution side to this agreement that you guys are going to help them distribute some of those applications on a going forward basis. I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on that. Is that a onetime thing? Or is that something that you look to do more often with some of these large companies, moving workloads onto Azure? And then for Amy, thank you for the additional detail on sort of the cloud risk margin profile on a going-forward basis. When we dig into just Azure, you said in the past that you sort of -- you expect to match the gross margin profile of what we're seeing in Amazon Web Services. Does that commentary still hold? And maybe you could give us a sort of mark-to-market on how you're doing in terms of matching up Azure's gross margin profile to what you're seeing from your top competitor there?",201

So let me start on the first one. You're absolutely right that one of the phenomena now is that pretty much anyone who is a customer of Azure is also, in some form, an ISV, and that's no longer just limited to people who are ""in the classic tech industry"" or the software business. That's the same case with GE, it's the same case with Boeing, it's the same case with Schneider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with, because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure. And that's something that we will, in fact, have distribution agreements with. And AppSource, it's a pretty major announcement for us because we essentially created, for SaaS applications and infrastructure applications, a way to distribute their applications through us and our channel. And I think it makes, in fact, our cloud more attractive to many of them because of that. So we look for -- I think going forward, we will -- you'll look to see -- or you'll see us do much more of this with many other customers of ours.",199

Let me first say the additional color I gave in terms of comments, in terms of material improvement, clearly also apply to our Azure portfolio as well. We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year-over-year, and we do expect a material improvement in FY '17, both from the benefits of scale and the investments we've made, but importantly also, in the revenue trajectory we're seeing and the makeup of that revenue. Boeing's agreement is one such agreement in terms of embedding a sort of premium service at a premium gross margin. We signed many of those this quarter that we feel quite good about. We -- I think I have a strong line of sight to AWS' margin profile and still feel good about the progress we're making not just on the workloads that are relevant, apples-to-apples with Azure, but also in our broader cloud portfolio and our ability to have very healthy margins across Dynamics 365 as well as Office 365 in conjunction with many of the innovations we're doing across Azure. So while I am focused on both the workload improvement, I'm also focused on what's possible across the entirety of the cloud. Thanks, Keith.",214

And I think your commentary around the transactional part of that suggested it softened a little bit. I think your tone on this call is a lot better around the transactional performance, and it looks like that business accelerated a little bit. Perhaps you could explain what changed in the course of the 3 months to make the transactional piece, at least, if I'm hearing you correctly, feel a little bit better.",93

Let me start, and then Amy you can add to it. Overall, Karl, the focus for us is in what I would describe as this hyperscale plus hybrid approach when you think about the cloud approach, which is pretty unique to us. And the way we track progress is to see how is our annuity growth of our server business and how is our cloud growth. And if you look at this last quarter, we -- our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits, and that's a pretty healthy growth rate and that's something that, by design, both in terms of the technical architecture as well as the traction we have in the marketplace and our sales efforts and so on, are playing out well and we are very bullish about that going forward. The transactional business is much more volatile because of the macro environment, IT budgets and also the secular shift to the cloud. The question again that gets asked is about the cannibalization. But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about when it comes to the cloud, our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our cloud. So at a fundamental long-term secular basis, we have new growth, new workloads, and that's what we are focused on and that's a much bigger addressable market than anything our transactional server business had in the past.",245

Was that just a mere fact of you cleaning up some of the flip business? Or did you see additional strength on top of some of those closed transactions on the transactional business in Q4?",53
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3687.0,1178310.0,48479521.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,14,"Thanks, Brent. I -- let me split your question into 2 components. The first thing really that I think Satya and I both focus on every quarter, every month is how much of our business are we continuing to shift to annuity and, specifically, to the cloud. We structure all of our motions at this company, from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-market to how we think about sales engagement to how we do our investments, fundamentally toward that long-term structural transition in the market. And so to your question on transactional performance, there were some deals that didn't get done in Q3 that got done in Q4. And there were some deals done in Q4 on the Office side with large companies that I'm thrilled by. But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time. And so this volatility that we are going to see because of macro and because of budget constraints, especially on transactional, we will focus on because we expect excellent execution and have accountability to do that in the field. But our first priority every time is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.",216

Satya, I had a question for you on Azure. I was just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of Azure revenue coming from ISVs. And then how do you see this helping you compete with AWS? And can you talk about why these partners may be choosing you over the competition?",54
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3687.0,1178310.0,48479527.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,20,"Sure. Let me take that second part in terms of what is our differentiation. And in my remarks, I sort of pointed out the couple of dimensions. But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers because we meet them where the realities are today and also the digital transformation needs going forward. So that's one massive advantage we have. And the second area for us is also the nexus between what's happening in Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource and, in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform. At our Partner Conference, there was significant amount of excitement with the tools that we announced like Power Apps and Power BI, Azure Functions and Flow. These are tools that our developers and system integrators and solution partners will use in order to be able to customize applications around Azure. And so to me, that's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us. And then, lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers, not only is .NET first-class, but Linux is first-class, Java is first-class, Azure Container Service cuts across both containers running on Windows, running across Linux, so, again, speaks to the enterprise realities. So those would be the places where we are fairly differentiated, and that's what you see us gaining, both for enterprise customers and ISVs. The question you asked is an interesting one, which is if I had to sort of slice it by classic ISVs, it would be 1/3 or so of our revenue. But the thing that -- the first question that Keith asked is probably more indicative of what's happening, which is every customer is also an ISV. So every customer who starts off consuming Azure is also turning what is their IP in some -- most cases, into an ISV solution, which ultimately will even participate in AppSource. So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways.",372

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3687.0,1178310.0,48479531.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,24,"It's probably not exactly how I would say it, Mark. I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led. That cloud-led conversation and making a plan for customers to best change and perform their own business is certainly a far more in-depth one than on occasion is required by long-time transactional purchasers especially in Office, as an example, because what we're talking about now is really pivoting your business for the long-term. And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle for good reason, but I would generally point back to say that most of these are driven at the structural level, which is structurally, over time, on-premises transactional business will move to the cloud or to a hybrid structure through an annuity revenue stream. Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is really budget -- is either budget constraint, a macroeconomic economic change or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe in the midst of making their cloud transition plan and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an extent. But again, I don't view that as negative performance, I view that as a strategic relevance long-term inside of digital accounts.",209

And I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the dynamics between -- in new and renewal signings that drove that combination of really strong unearned but somewhat weaker trends in the bookings.",81

Strong unearned, in particular, was actually better-than-expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our guide. And I think we were quite pleased by that performance. In terms of C&B, that's the reference I made in my comments to the lower expiry base. Quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, we just have different amounts of contracts expiring. And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago. So the fact that we were able to grow on that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance.",98

First of all, you're obviously, really reaching the very large numbers in terms of the numbers of seats that you have. Can you talk a little bit about towards the seat growth because both for consumer and for commercial, it seemed to be coming down? Is that kind of the law of large numbers coming in? Or is there anything else? And then in Consumer Office, so the Consumer Office performance was very, very strong and almost needs to be stronger from transactions because otherwise, I don't get to the numbers. Can you talk a little bit about the source of the strength there?",110
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3687.0,1178310.0,48479537.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,30,"Thanks, Raimo. Let me start with the Office Consumer question. We haven't had a chance to touch on that, and then we'll talk about commercial seat growth. You're right; the Office Consumer growth still has quite a bit of transactional business to it, even though we have moved. And you saw that growth of the subscriber base sort of materially. The growth in quarter versus our expectations was really 2 things that are transactionally focused. One, the PC market was a little better than we thought and, particularly, in developed markets, the PC growth was better than we thought. And developed markets are where we see the most transactional business with Consumer Office that impacts in quarter. So the strength from that outperformance or better market in consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office Consumer, and so that's how to think about that big delta. The other thing was Japan was a little better. And when Japan is better, it's why you also see the interesting relationship in constant currency. We have a lot of yen exposure in that segment, so the Japan performance being better also helped. And that is a purely -- it's more transactional than even our rest of world business. So you're right, Raimo, in terms of what impacted that number in quarter versus the underlying market dynamics. On commercial seats, listen, we're very proud of that big number -- growth number. But you're right; we're also getting a very big base. And so while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate, converting and adding net new into our installed base, you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is getting quite big.",294

You're right; my comments are more pivoted toward the absolute dollar amount, which is what I intend to focus on in my comments, so that's a good clarification, and thanks for asking. In terms of how we think about the absolute numbers, first, I should say, I think most people assume, and it is true to a certain extent, so much of this is the growth in our commercial businesses across Azure and Dynamics and Office 365, and that's true. But we're also seeing quite good growth in some of the consumer businesses, which also are built on our cloud infrastructure: Search, some of our gaming assets, our Xbox LIVE business going forward. And so many of these assets, including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our Productivity business and Office, do require capital spend. And so the growth is pretty broad-based to support. And so as I think about moderation, it is the absolute dollar. It's from -- it's not due to any change in our aspiration or belief in the growth curve of revenue. And I want to be clear on that, it really is about continuing to benefit from scale and engineering improvements that will allow us to do that even as we see broad-based growth.",212

Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add to this. In some sense, Ross, you're sort of trying to ask us to project forward and say what is the legitimate digital security and digital sovereignty needs of all the different types of businesses that we want to serve using the cloud all over the world. The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers where they are and not assume some very simplistically that, that digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met out of a fewer data center approach because, right now, given the secular trend to move to the cloud across all of the regulated industries across the globe, we think it's wiser for us and our investors long-term to be able to meet them where they are. And that's what you see us. We were the only cloud that operates in China under Chinese law; the only cloud that operates in Germany under German law. And these are very critical competitive advantages to us. And so we will track that, and we will be very demand-driven. So there is -- in this case, we're not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our demand. If anything, I think our cycle times have significantly come down, so it will be demand-driven. But I don't want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises, and for us it's a high ROI decision to open a new region, we will do so.",260

Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location. The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required. So there's really 2 components. And I think Satya talked about why you would enter a region, and it's ROI and there's also their correlation to how many servers and that spend and pace over time based on demand.",104

And then we fairly shortly afterwards got the announcement of Dynamics 365 and AppSource. So maybe given the amount of discussion here, you could comment on the evolution of the strategy and your thought process around broad enterprise application.",70

So I sort of look at what we are doing with Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource, LinkedIn as all being part of one strategy. So the move to the cloud for our customers and for us is not just about a new way of delivering the same value just to the service. It's really the transformation from having applications that are silos to becoming more services in the cloud where you can reason about the activity and the data underneath these services to benefit the customers who are using these services. So that's what this notion of a graph represents. So when somebody moves to Office 365, their graph, their people, their relationships with other people inside the organization, their work artifacts all move to the cloud. You can connect them with all the business process data that's in Dynamics 365. But not just in Dynamics 365, but all the applications in AppSource because business process will always be a much more fragmented market as opposed to just one market share leader by industry, by vertical, by country. And so that's our strategy there. And now the professional cloud or the professional network helps usage across all of that professional usage. Whether it's in Office 365 or whether you are a salesperson using any application related to sales, you want your professional network there. Of course, it's relevant in recruiting, it's relevant in training, it's relevant in marketing. So that's really our strategy with LinkedIn as the professional network meeting the professional cloud. And so you're right to point out that these are all part of one overarching strategy and, ultimately, it's about adding value to customers.",281

So Satya, we noticed Office 365 commercial seat growth of 45% produced Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 59% in constant currency, so a favorable spread of about 14 points, suggesting ASP growth. I'm wondering if you could help us understand the drivers, both now and into the future, particularly in terms of the initial response to the E5 plan and also, which products you think are driving the strength as you consider across Exchange, Skype for Business, Power BI, Yammer, SharePoint, et cetera.",85

Let me start. And, Amy, you can add to it. Overall, I would say, even in this last year, even just a broader spread of E3 has driven a lot of the growth. And then, of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5. And E5 value proposition across all 3 of the areas, whether it's cloud voice or analytics or security, are all 3 massive areas for us. And I would say, if anything, the initial data from customers around security is very -- is gaining a lot of traction. But we're -- at the same time, one of the things that customers are looking for is making an enterprise-wide architectural decision across all of the workloads. So E3, E5 and higher penetration of this is what's going to drive ASP growth. And you will look to -- you can see -- you'll see us add more value to these packages as time goes on as well because our R&D is focused on that, which is how do we take these buckets of value creation and reinforce them with all of the future R&D as well.",195
