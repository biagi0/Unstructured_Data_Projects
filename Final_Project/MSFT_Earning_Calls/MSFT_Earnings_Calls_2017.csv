Today, I'll share the results of the third quarter and discuss what's ahead. 
I'm proud of the progress this quarter. We delivered $23.6 billion in revenue, up 7% in constant currency. Across all industries, organizations are looking to digitally transform with the state-of-the-art cloud services, AI and new natural user interface technology. Increasingly, these organizations are turning to Microsoft as a partner they can trust for the innovation and building their own digital capability.
Now let's look at the progress we made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We crossed a major milestone with more than 100 million monthly active users of Office 365 commercial. Office 365 commercial seats grew 35% year-over-year and revenue is up 45% in constant currency. 
Across industries, customers recognize Office 365 is the productivity platform of choice. Companies like H&R Block, Johnson & Johnson, Deutsche BÃ¶rse AG, LVMH has all chose Office 365. And we continue to innovate and add new value. This quarter, we made Microsoft Teams broadly available to Office 365 customers in 181 markets. Our new chat-based workspace is already empowering a new way to work for more than 50,000 customers, including Accenture, J. Walter Thompson, J.B. Hunt and Expedia. Teams also creates a new platform opportunity for developers to reach 100 million Office 365 users with rich extensibility for bots, apps and services.
Additionally, we're expanding the relevance of Office 365 to new segments. Retail, hospitality and manufacturing companies have a huge need to empower their frontline employees. Our expanded offering for this segment includes Microsoft StaffHub, Teams, OneDrive, Skype for Business and more to give these critical employees a robust collaboration toolkit to maximize their impact.
Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. Accelerating our growth with LinkedIn by driving value for members and customers remains our top priority. This quarter, we redesigned the LinkedIn desktop to create a more seamless intuitive experience across devices. We continue to invest in the LinkedIn feed, bringing curated news and views to help members stay informed on what's most important to them. Our innovation across both the desktop and mobile is driving strong engagement momentum, with sessions up more than 20% again this quarter. 
LinkedIn marked an important milestone this week, exceeding 500 million members, and our jobs platform hit new record levels with more than 10 million jobs posted. The strong momentum with jobs and engagement is continuing to fuel the growth across talent, marketing, sales and learning solutions.
We took significant steps this week to redefine social selling with deeper integration of Sales Navigator with Dynamics 365, enabling sales professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. Customers like Visa are choosing Dynamics 365 because of our deep integration across Office 365 and now Sales Navigator. I'm excited to put the Microsoft enterprise sales force and partner ecosystem behind this new opportunity.
Dynamics 365 solves a critical challenge for businesses, helping them break free of monolithic siloed suites of applications to unlock insights across the entire organization. You see this in our new Dynamics 365 talent applications, which combines HR business processes with LinkedIn Recruiter to help companies manage the employee life cycle from recruiting to retention. Our innovation in Dynamics is driving strong revenue growth, with Dynamics 365 up 82% in constant currency this quarter.
Now let's talk about the progress we're making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $15.2 billion. Customers are increasingly choosing the Microsoft Cloud. They value our differentiated approach as the most trusted global hyperscale cloud with hybrid support and higher-level services to help drive their digital transformation. 
Moreover, they appreciate the agility, operational consistency and security across the entire digital estate, spanning Enterprise Mobility, Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Azure. Take Maersk, the largest transport and logistics firm in the world with operations in 130 countries and a fleet of over 1,000 vessels. Maersk began the journey to the Microsoft Cloud with Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security and Windows 10. 
They choose -- they chose Dynamics 365 for operations to streamline container production and maintenance. Now Maersk is using Azure to digitally transform its supply chain management and global trade. The intelligent services in Azure deliver up-to-the-minute insights on carrier performance and equipment usage with real-time data, visualization and advanced analytics, enabling them to trim costs and create new revenue streams. For a company that ships 17 million containers annually, the ability to react quickly can mean the difference of tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. This is a great example of our 3 clouds coming together to enable deep digital transformation.
Across industries, customers are choosing Azure. UBS announced they're using Azure for risk management, and GEICO chose Azure for hybrid capabilities. Publicis Groupe announced that they will use Azure and Cortana Intelligence Suite to deliver AI-powered marketing solutions at scale. Flipkart, India's leading online marketplace, chose Azure as the platform to enable their rapid growth. 
We continue to rapidly innovate and add new capability to drive further customer value. Microsoft IoT Central is the first SaaS offering that provides the end-to-end solution for organizations of all sizes to manage their entire IoT ecosystem across devices, cloud, analytics, networks and software. 
This week at Hannover Messe, the world's largest industrial trade shows, manufacturers showcased how they're using our solutions to transform all aspects of manufacturing, from water management to food and beverage, packaging, to improving safety on the factory floor. 
When it comes to AI, this quarter, we made our cognitive services for face recognition and computer vision broadly available to enable any developer to become an AI developer. 
We're excited about how Azure Stack and SQL Server are helping define the edge computing paradigm. Azure Stack will enable computers -- our customers to extend Azure capability to their private data center in a truly consistent hybrid computing environment. SQL Server 2017, coming this fall, is the first database with cloud tiering and artificial intelligence built in. It runs on Windows and Linux, supports Docker container deployment and popular programming languages such as R and Python for machine learning and data science. We will share more about all these advances and more at our upcoming Build Developer Conference. 
Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Almost 2 years ago, we introduced a new approach with Windows 10, transforming the way customers experience Windows on all their devices. Now customers are always up-to-date, running the most secure Windows ever. This quarter, the Windows business grew 5% in constant currency, and we delivered the next phase of innovation with the Creators Update. 
Creators Update is about inspiring the creator in us all. We create technology so that others can create their own content and technology. We want to empower people to paint in 3D or paint with numbers in Excel. We empower people to create in Word or in Minecraft. These new forms of creation and expression are shaping Windows for the next generation. 
Gaming is a key scenario to expand our opportunity across the PC and console. We're building on our already strong foundation with Xbox One and our Xbox LIVE community, up 13% to 52 million active users this quarter. With Creators Update, we integrated gameplay broadcasting into Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One. We're off to a very strong start with both streamers and viewers. In fact, the majority of the streaming in this industry today is on the PC and console. And we are uniquely positioned to provide the best, most complete gaming experience from hardware to software to broadcast services. It's early days and we are excited to pursue this new growing opportunity.
This quarter, we also revealed more about our forthcoming project, Scorpio, which will be the most powerful console ever and will enable true 4K gaming in the living room. 
Our commercial customers continue to adopt Windows 10 as the secure trusted platform of choice. Customers like the Department of Education in the United Kingdom, British Telecommunications, the Adventist Health System, one of the largest health care providers in the United States, all chose Windows 10. 
When I talk to businesses and government leaders, they value security and privacy of their data, the reliability of their systems and choice and control over how and when they deploy. We remain committed to our core values of trust, transparency, privacy and security for every customer.
Finally, Devices. This quarter, our Surface results fell short of expectations, impacted by end-of-product life cycle and increased price competition. We continue to innovate and invest in creating new computers and computing experiences. Surface Pro, Book, Hub, Studio, HoloLens are all creating new markets for the Windows ecosystem and pushing differentiation with new natural user interface capabilities: ink, vision, voice, touch and mixed reality.
In the context of mixed reality, we just passed the 1-year anniversary of Microsoft HoloLens. We now have more than 150 exclusive HoloLens apps in the store. Moreover, many of our commercial customers are using HoloLens to drive digital transformation and seeing real impact. HoloLens-based innovation was featured front and center at NRF, HIMSS and most recently, this week at Hannover. Digital transformation across these industries is being shaped by new technologies from IoT to mixed reality to AI and the cloud. 
thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens and Azure to digitize their entire sales and order process, shortening delivery times by 4x, and they chose Dynamics 365 to enable transformation in their steel division. Leading global medical technology company, Stryker, chose Office 365 to empower employees and is using HoloLens to improve operating room design for surgeons, staff and ultimately, the patients. All this creates a strong foundation for the broader opportunity ahead with digital transformation.
I'm proud of the progress this quarter. I'm enthusiastic about what's to come. In the coming weeks, we will share more about how Microsoft is innovating uniquely to empower every customer, from students and teachers to business professionals to developers. Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",1724
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685197.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, up 6%, and 7% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 7%, and 9% in constant currency. Operating income grew 2% or 5% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.73, an increase of 16%, and 19% in constant currency. 
This was the first full quarter of company results with LinkedIn, which had a significant impact on revenue, gross margin and operating income. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue and gross margin growth and 6 points of drag on operating income growth, which includes $371 million from amortization of acquired intangibles. 
From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends. Our performance in Japan was better than expected, driven by increased public sector spending and improved market conditions. Our commercial annuity mix was 88%, even with another quarter of higher-than-expected transactional revenue results. Commercial bookings increased 12%, or 11% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue followed historical seasonal trends coming in at $20.4 billion and growing 9%, and 10% in constant currency. And our contracted not billed balance increased to more than $27.5 billion. 
Another strong quarter of cloud services performance drove our commercial cloud revenue run rate over $15.2 billion, growing 52%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased to 51%, up 6 points from last year, with improvement across Office 365, Azure and Dynamics. And gross margin dollars grew 74%, keeping us on pace for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year.
As a reminder, our commercial cloud includes Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365 and other cloud properties, but does not include LinkedIn. Our company gross margin was 66%, better than anticipated and up 1 point as the sales mix of higher-margin products and services, coupled with commercial cloud margin improvement, more than offset the impact of $218 million of LinkedIn amortization.
Now to FX. This quarter, the U.S. dollar was weaker than expected. As such, we had 1 point less FX impact across our individual reporting segments even though overall company impact was still approximately 1 point, as guided. FX impacted the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments by 1 point and had minimal impact in More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 12%, with LinkedIn contributing 13 points of growth, including $153 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense.
Now let's move to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 22% and 23% in constant currency to $8 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 7%, and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased to 45%, driven by installed base growth across all workloads and continued ARPU expansion. 
Our transactional results came in higher than expected, mostly from performance in large markets like Japan and Western Europe. Office consumer revenue increased 15% and 14% in constant currency, primarily from recurring subscription revenue as well as growth in our subscriber base.
Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with Dynamics 365 customer momentum contributing to double-digit billings growth. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was $975 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, with 11 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. 
Gross margin percentage declined due to a higher mix of cloud revenue and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization. Operating expenses increased 44% and 45% in constant currency with 43 points from LinkedIn, including $153 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency, with 13 points of impact from LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 15%, up 16% in constant currency, demonstrating durable double-digit growth. Azure revenue increased 93%, up 94% in constant currency and annuity revenue again grew double digits. Azure Premium revenue grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using our premium services.
Our Windows Server and SQL Server transactional business continued to perform well, with better-than-expected results mainly from Japan and continuing post-launch demand. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue declined 1% and was flat in constant currency due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements. 
Segment gross margin dollars grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 11% with ongoing investment in sales capacity, cloud engineering and developer engagement. Operating income was flat and up 3% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $8.8 billion, declining 7% as phone and Surface results offset healthy growth in Windows, search and gaming. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 10% ahead of the commercial PC market mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Additionally, the commercial PC market was slightly below our expectations, negatively impacted by channel production timing changes and upcoming Windows SKU pricing changes. Commercial end customer demand signals remained consistent and positive. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows premium device category. Overall, inventory levels remain in the normal range.
Windows commercial products and services grew 6%, with healthy enterprise demand as customers continue to deploy Windows 10 for its advanced security and management capabilities. Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex TAC grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume. 
Devices revenue declined 51%. We had no material phone revenue this quarter. Our Surface business declined 26% and 25% in constant currency as heightened price competition and product end-of-life cycle dynamics resulted in lower-than-expected Surface Pro unit volumes. Our gaming business grew 4% and 6% in constant currency as Xbox LIVE revenue growth offset declines in hardware. Xbox LIVE monthly active users grew 13% across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms, which contributed to software and services revenue growth of 7% and 8% in constant currency.
Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with a sales shift to higher-margin product and services. Operating expenses declined 11% and 10% in constant currency from lower phone expense and Surface launch-related marketing spend in the prior year. Operating income grew 20% and 23% in constant currency.
Now back to overall company results. We invested approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, less than we expected, as a portion of the expense will move into Q4. Other income and expense was $322 million, greater than originally planned as we saw more opportunities in the equity market to realize gains during the quarter. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 23%. We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, continuing our balanced approach to capital allocation through share repurchase and dividends. After a period of accelerated buyback, we've resumed a buyback pace consistent with our historical trend.
Now let's turn to the outlook. First, FX. Given current rates, we now expect less FX headwinds in our fourth quarter. We expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. 
Second, our commercial business. The fourth quarter is an important one for our commercial business, and we expect continued annuity growth and healthy renewals as customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of commercial cloud services. We expect unearned revenue between $26.8 billion and $27 billion, in line with historical seasonality. Additionally, we have a large expiry base in the fourth quarter, and our sales execution on renewals and upsell opportunities, while contemplated in our unearned revenue guidance, should also show up in a larger contracted not billed balance and commercial bookings growth.
Third, capital expenditure. We expect CapEx to grow sequentially and year-over-year. Quarterly spend variability will continue and we remain on track for our full year capital expenditure year-over-year growth curve to slow.
Let's move to the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing annuity shift to cloud and commercial Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect growth rates to moderate from prior quarters, which were impacted by prior year comparables. We expect consistent growth from Dynamics and approximately $1.05 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. Similar to Q3, we anticipate that LinkedIn, excluding amortization, will have minimal impact on segment operating income, and we continue to expect it to be minimally dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this fiscal year.
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion in revenue. Performance trends from Q3 should continue into Q4, with annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline with lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements. 
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate that revenue growth will be more aligned with the overall PC market. OEM Pro growth will continue to be driven by Windows 10 enterprise momentum and aligned to a commercial PC market that should return to typical seasonality. 
Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, with continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices. In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex TAC to be similar to Q3. In gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform and we look forward to E3 in June. We will share more on Project Scorpio and new titles for next fiscal year. 
And in devices, we expect revenue to decline with negligible revenue from phone. With Surface, we expect a more moderate rate of decline, given the prior year comparable and current market dynamics. 
We expect COGS of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. This includes approximately $420 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with roughly $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which $150 million is related to amortization. We now expect full year operating expenses between $32.9 billion and $33 billion, with approximately $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. That includes about $360 million of amortization expense. Other income and expense should be about $150 million. And for tax, we expect the full fiscal year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, plus or minus 1 point.
Finally, we encourage you to watch a few upcoming events: our education event on May 2, our Dynamics 365 event on May 3 and the upcoming keynotes from Bill to learn more about our ambitious plans leading into FY '18. We will also host our Financial Analyst Briefing on May 10. The webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website. Chris, let's move to Q&A",1872

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685200.0,Question,Keith Weiss,,Analysts,6,"I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. You gave us some really interesting statistics about gross margins going up, premium mix going up. One of the concerns I hear a lot from investors is what happens when we get these price cuts that go back and forth between you guys and AWS? And it doesn't seem like the price cuts this quarter really affected you guys. So I was hoping could sort of shed some light on it and how -- to what degree do those price cuts actually affect you? And then on the flip side, where does all that growth come from? Where do you get that sort of tripling of premium growth from? What kind of workloads are coming on board to kind of actually drive the underlying growth in that business?",137
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685201.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,7,"Sure, thanks for the question, Keith. Let me start and then Amy, if you want, you can add. Again, Keith, I talked -- when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture -- and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud. When you look at what we're trying to get done between Azure, we don't really see these scenes across Azure, O365, Dynamics 365 and also the things that we're doing with Xbox LIVE, for example. All build as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud. So for example, some of the cognitive capabilities that are there in Azure first come because of our first-party AI investments, whether it's been speech or vision or anything else. Even the infrastructure that is there in Azure came out of some of our first-party investments in Office 365 or again, Bing and other areas. So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together. And that same thing is reflected even in the customer journeys. I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one. While it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365, but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation. In the case of Maersk, they were using field service and operations inside of Dynamics 365. So to me, those high-level services will, over time, attach in Azure but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365. So to me, that's why Azure is pretty strategic for us, not just for the attachment of high-level services and what is defined as Azure, but the all-up digital transformation opportunity. That's how Amy and I even think about our margin structure. We need to improve in each one on the elements, but all-up we need to improve because we think that increased opportunity is what's unique about our approach.",332
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685202.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,8,"And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment. The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not. And so I think, while I do understand that people ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth.",155
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685203.0,Question and Answer Operator Message,Operator,,Operator,9,Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.,13
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685204.0,Question,Karl Keirstead,,Analysts,10,"I've got a follow-up actually on Azure, maybe to you Satya. And it's the interplay between the cloud piece, Azure, and mostly the on-prem piece, what you guys call the server product. Most of your peers, obviously, when they're pivoting to the cloud, are seeing weakness on the on-prem side, but what's unique about Microsoft is not only is Azure growth accelerating, but your server product growth at 7% is up meaningfully year-over-year as well. So we're not seeing that trade-off with Microsoft. I suspect part of the explanation is that a lot of the Azure growth is net new, but I'm just curious, when do you think customers will actually start migrating existing on-prem Microsoft workloads into Azure such that, that server product line might start to decelerate? Do you think there's a prospect of that occurring in fiscal '18?",142
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685205.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,11,"Yes, the time frames of these migrations and so on are a lot more complicated than they perhaps appear on the surface. So here's what we think of. For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. Whether it's IoT, whether it's the auto industry, whether it's what's happening in retail, essentially, compute is going where the data gets generated and increasingly, data is getting generated at the volumes in which it's drawing compute to it, which is the edge. So if you look at even our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge. Of course, we have an amazing cloud with sort of the SaaS services for IoT, but the edge compute, the ability to run a neural network at the edge, do inferences at the edge is exciting. Azure Stack is going to completely change what hybrid is and the expectations customers have with hybrid. I mean, GEICO example is a good one. What's happening with SQL Server? SQL Server is no longer just about a database that's on-premise. It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud. Our single table can be extended to the cloud. The queries will work across both the tiering. And so to me, the innovative work we are doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed. And that's what we are building towards. We'll talk a lot more and build on -- about that architecture and what we're seeing with customers. Then, given that, what you are saying is true, which is there will be some which will be lift and shift of workloads, but then there is lift, shift and modernizing of workloads. And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud. And so that's the transformation at play, that's a multiyear and a generational transformation. Quarter-to-quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility, but what is clear to me and clear to Microsoft's engineers is that we have a very clear worldview of what it is that we want to get done and we stay focused on it.",397

And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out. It tends to be -- in this instance, Japan was a little better. It can be product launch-related, it can be macro impacted. But whether or not you see that in transactional, the uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamics Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about whether it's a ""on-prem server launch"" or an Azure feature about the integration of the 2.",147

I was just wondering, Satya, if you could share with us, and I know I've asked this in the past, but just kind of any qualitative commentary you could give us about PaaS adoption. And I'm also wondering in particular, given the high percentage of workloads on Azure running Linux, what type of services are you typically seeing run on top of the OS? And how do you see your monetization of those workloads playing out over time? And then Amy, just a follow-up for you would just be -- and I apologize, we did another earnings call tonight, so I might have missed it. But you usually give a comment about out-year OpEx on the call, and I was just wondering if you had any high-level thoughts there.",138

Overall qualitatively in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about like IoT. We now have a much higher-level managed service. We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions and sort of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive. So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services. Same thing with data. The DocumentDB is a massive thing for us. It's a planet scale database that supports JSON and much more, and we see that as a core part of the data tier for many, many applications. We even see -- or we see the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to Enterprise Mobility. So all-up, we have multiple pieces. The other area is, of course, the entire tool chain of what's happening with Visual Studio to continuous integration to continuous deployment. And that's a place where we have a very, very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity, which, in some sense, you can think of as it's kind of like the Office 365 for developers, but that's all part of Azure. So those are the places where there is PaaS services. But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I would say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers because we know that over time, maybe not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be, in fact, a Dynamics 365 module. I mean, the canonical example for me is someone who sort of collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation, like field service. So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT. And that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.",368

Is it a big deal or should we expect growth in the same vicinity for the -- in your future? And then as a second question, as discussed in the previous -- one of the previous questions about Server & Tools and the healthiness of that growth, I'm trying to understand the drivers. Is this the product refresh cycle? Is it Azure driving customer upgrades? Is it something else? Can you give a bit more color? That would be helpful. I appreciate it.",104

On the Dynamics 365, we're at the very, very beginning phase of the transition of Dynamics from primarily being on-premise to now being a very modern, modular SaaS service. The Dynamics 365 momentum is picking up. I talked about the revenue growth rate. And that's definitely going to be what's going to be true in the quarters to come and the years to come. But we do have a huge on-premise base. There is still a need for those on-premise products. That will continue, but our focus is on transitioning to the cloud. And you've seen us do this successfully with Office 365. You've seen us do that with Azure. And now we're ready to do that mainstream across what has been traditionally known as CRM and ERP without, in fact, us thinking and talking about those suites because we think that's a pretty old concept to have suites like that, which is we have now really made the entire Dynamics 365 much more modular, modern and much more efficient for customers, so that's what's happening in Dynamics. Same thing on Azure, which is the driver is -- a lot of it is net new. IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world whereas it's one of the big workloads for us. Same thing with AI, not an old workload. So there's new growth in Azure. There is the lift, shift and modernize motion as well as well as a new need for the edge of the cloud. So all 3 of them are in play while recognizing we had a large business called the server licensing business. So we have 3 new things that we are driving and the -- a lot of large licensing pieces that are just transitioning into these 3 motions.",311

The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us and that, I think, is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter-to-quarter. In the more temporal bucket this quarter, as well as last, you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature. Japan happens to be one of those geos. And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically in the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent. So that's how I kind of break down the drivers, Mark.",144

I think you mentioned in the script that Windows -- there was some Windows volatility around some new SKU pricing. Could you go into some detail there?

On 606, we will talk about it in detail, actually on May 10, in terms of the timing and what you can expect. You'll also note in the Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example. The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM. Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile. But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change, in some ways, back to how we thought about OEM revenue. So that's what I would think of on 606.",131

I'm sorry, I answered them in the opposite order. And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value. This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU. And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs. And so what you'll continue to see is that will normalize. Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself.",118

So 2 quick questions. First off, Amy, there's been a lot about talk about tax law changes on the corporate side. Would a repatriation holiday impact how you guys allocate capital back to shareholders? And then just real quickly, on the OpEx side, I know you don't want to get too specific, but over the last few years, you've been able to effectively reallocate upwards of $2 billion from the phone business elsewhere. Is there still a fair amount of ability to reallocate internally?",85

Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking too, that I probably don't relate as directly and I should do that for you. We've been a long-time advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out. And as decisions get made and proposals clarified, we'll share more about what that means for us. Next, in terms of how we thought about that impacting capital return. As you know, I think we've been -- and executed significant capital return program over the past couple of years, including accelerating a buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it's created. And so I wouldn't say that I view those 2 things as waiting for one to do the other. We've, in fact, continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends as well as repurchase shares. And we've continued to do that this quarter as well. I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related. The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new. And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS. At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments. What Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time, picking markets and making sure we execute in them. So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course, there's opportunities. We learn frankly, I think, every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate. That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint. More, I view, is the return healthy? Is it growing the top line? Are we executing well on it? And if we are, it will make sense to spend more, and if we aren't, it won't. And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number.",425

Kirk Materne,,Analysts,30,"Amy, I want to follow up on your last point around investment and return on it. Around this time last year, you guys started spending a lot more or investing a lot more in OpEx on the Intelligent Cloud side in particular. This quarter, you saw Intelligent Cloud operating profit, on a constant currency basis, get back to growth again, which I think shows that those investments were indeed -- made some sense. Now that you've spent a lot, you've obviously added a lot in sales and marketing resources, R&D resources on that front. Could you just give us, I guess, qualitatively how you're thinking about that? It seemed like last year, you needed to catch up to a certain degree in terms of go-to-market capabilities. Do you feel better, I guess, where you are today versus your position, say, a year ago just in terms of being able to capture the opportunity on the Intelligent Cloud side?",158

I mean, I don't view it that narrowly quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year. These are generational opportunities, what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality. Either one of those things, I think if we started viewing it quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year, we'll completely miss the trend. We definitely need to be smart about 2 things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM. And most importantly, what's our role in it? Is this something that the world needs Microsoft to be doing? Or is it well served by others? That's where we spend most of our cycles in. The fact that we put some salespeople, and then there's increased productivity is something that we obviously celebrate and we track very closely. But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out. And it won't be very transparent to you, right, and that's how it is. I mean, if we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't even have Azure. But I completely understand that all of you measure us by what we have done for you lately, and that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.",257

Are we doing them in the right way? Are they in the right market? Are we investing in the right types of people and the right capabilities? What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing, and it is encouraging, that the plan that we put in place that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on. And all that does is build more confidence that both we picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers. And then the most important thing is that the customer success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year. And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.",195

The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure, Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome. So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency or how they can change the products and the business models and the products. And if you look at even the examples I used in this quarterly earnings call, Maersk and what they're trying to do across all of those is pretty transformative. There is machine learning and AI, there is IoT, there is new type of business process automation with operations. All of that is sort of transforming Maersk. What ThyssenKrupp has done in their elevator business and other business units who are using anything from HoloLens to a front-line worker, to how they're fundamentally moving their business model from essentially the margin on the thing, to the margin on the service, which has machine learning and AI built into it. Those are the killer transformation opportunities that we are seeing. And in fact, it's not about, in fact, taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these. And in that context, of course, they are lifting and shifting some of the older workloads but they're modernizing the entire business process flow. And that's what's, I think, the killer opportunity, not any one technology, but the entire flow.",267

What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do. Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend aren't much different than we've seen. For me, what I think is missing in that question is really -- it's not about any one customer saying, ""Wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more."" These are companies actually deciding that change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective but to change how they're running their business itself. And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense through COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently. And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a ""budget"" that sits in IT very narrowly. This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology.",203

That happens from 2 things: premium mix, revenue doing well as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement. Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really. The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change. And so while year-over-year, you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly, you've seen over the past 6 quarters even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more.",119

You guys reported another strong quarter here, 8% constant currency growth. Obviously, continuing that acceleration that you've had over the first 3 quarters of this year. Now I guess the question to Satya and then Amy. Satya, you still have a positive mix shift going on here because we see the unit count growth but also the revenue growth, so a positive spread there. Maybe help me walk through where you think we are in sort of this life cycle of Office 365 because you obviously have a lot of SKUs. And then Amy, in that context, kind of to the last question on gross margins for commercial cloud. Obviously, you made a lot of headway on Azure. How do you think where we are similarly on the life cycle on the gross margin side of 365?",143
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3848.0,1183586.0,48685238.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,44,"Yes, I can start. I mean, I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions. A lot of what we're still seeing in play is the rapid adoption or the increased adoption of Office 365 E3, which is what I think is driving a lot of the growth, the ASP growth. Now we have a good start with what is the high end of the enterprise value, which is E5. Some of the value we have, whether it's voice or analytics and security, it resonates. And we're learning, we're improving and we're pushing forward on that front. At the same time, we are also introducing new SKUs for the front-line workers. This is one of the other first-time trends I'm seeing where CEOs on are more interested in productivity of their front-line workers, and so that's another exciting space. It comes at a different ASP point so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365. We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business. The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element, because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end server SKUs in the international markets, and we finally get to sort of do that with the service offering. So those are all the areas where there's significant room left, and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play.",272

And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact, still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition, so we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3. And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving. We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature. I do think, here, the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement, is continuing to raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow.",138

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756016.0,Presenter Speech,Satya Nadella,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today, I'll share the results of the second quarter and discuss what's ahead. We had a solid quarter overall, delivering $26.1 billion in revenue, up 4% in constant currency. More importantly, we are making progress by innovating in new areas, growing our addressable market opportunity and transforming our culture. 
Wherever I go in my travels, whether it's in conversations with heads of state, NGOs or CEOs, the common thread is the transformative power of digital technology to unlock new opportunity. Everyone I meet is talking about building their own digital capability to transform their products, service and business model. They're looking to Microsoft for security, productivity, business process, cloud and AI platforms to help drive their own transformation. 
In this last quarter, we have continued to build momentum across all of these areas and, in particular, AI. Just this month, we acquired an AI deep learning startup, Maluuba, whose work in natural language processing will help advance our strategy to democratize AI for everyone.
With that as a backdrop, I'll turn to progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Process. Office 365 commercial seats grew 37% year-over-year, and revenue is up 49% in constant currency. We are changing the nature of work with Office as the universal toolkit to help people and teams accomplish more together. To that end, this quarter we introduced Microsoft Teams, our new chat-based workspace for Office 365. It brings together the full breadth and depth of Office 365 as well as connection to third-party services all in a secure hub for teamwork. 
We are seeing strong demand for the preview from our existing Office 365 customers due to the deep integration of the rest of the Office platform. And at the same time, customers not yet on Office 365 are excited about this new work -- way to work to see Teams as a potential first cloud workload. 
In addition to collaboration, our innovation and security and compliance continues to drive customer preference for Office 365. This quarter we added new capabilities to give IT better ways to help their users safely connect to third-party applications. And for compliance, new e-discovery capabilities make it easier and faster for organizations to find and analyze information related to legal and regulatory requests.
Customers also find value in the integration of SharePoint with Power Apps and Microsoft Flow to quickly and easily build mobile apps and automate workflows. In fact, just 8 weeks after availability, we have seen more than 0.5 million people use Power Apps or Flow. This combination of productivity, security and agility is incredibly valuable to customers, particularly in sectors like financial services and health care.
Take Willis Towers Watson, a global financial services firm, who chose our premium enterprise offering, including Office 365 E5. Global Fortune 500 companies TD Bank and AXA, as well as Partners HealthCare and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, all chose Office 365 for its powerful security and productivity platform. And AstraZeneca recently upgraded Office 365 E5 to its -- for its advanced voice capabilities. 
We're also expanding our growth opportunity beyond information workers by creating productivity solutions for retail, restaurant, hospitality and manufacturing employees who have traditionally been underserved by technology providers. Microsoft StaffHub, a new application in Office 365, provides shift scheduling, messaging and sharing capabilities for all these front-line workers.
Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment: reinventing business process. We completed the acquisition of LinkedIn in December, marking the start of our journey to bring together the world's professional cloud with the world's leading professional network. Our top priority is to ensure we innovate and drive value for LinkedIn members and grow their daily engagement. 
The LinkedIn business solutions -- hire, market, sell and learn -- represent an expanded market opportunity for Microsoft, and we plan to diligently execute on this opportunity, keeping the member-first ethos and focus.
We are seeing good results with the core experience, with our revamped mobile app driving significant engagement growth in 2016. This quarter, the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year-over-year, a consistent level of growth throughout 2016. We also achieved record levels of mobile page views and feed interaction, creating a healthy foundation for LinkedIn's marketing solutions, which includes the rapidly growing sponsored updates.
We also saw members engage with LinkedIn's hiring products at record levels as part of Talent Solutions. And LinkedIn sales solutions have also seen rapid growth, with Sales Navigator seats up more than 20% year-over-year during the quarter. Sales Navigator's success on multiple CRM platforms makes it an essential tool for every B2B salesperson, and one of our first integration scenarios will be to redefine social selling by enhancing Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn capabilities.
The combination of LinkedIn's business solutions and Dynamics 365 gives us a more comprehensive portfolio of business SaaS solutions and strengthens our position in this growing and competitive market. Dynamics 365 paid seats more than doubled again this quarter, and new enterprise customers are increasingly choosing our cloud solutions, with more than 80% choosing Dynamics 365. DefenseReady is using Dynamics to give military leaders a 360-degree view of their organizations to quickly make informed decisions about capacity planning and operations. Amway is using Dynamics 365 to modernize and empower their entrepreneurial sales force around the globe.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $14 billion, and we're on track to achieve our $20 billion in fiscal '18. Customers choose the Microsoft Cloud for the following reasons: they want a trusted global hyperscale cloud provider that meets enterprise great needs; they want hybrid support that is architected into the hyperscale servers as well as the cloud servers; they want higher-level services to help build their own digital capability across IoT, enterprise app dev, advanced analytics and AI capability. 
Moreover, and most importantly, CIOs, CSOs, BDMs and developers are all seeing the benefit from operational consistency, productivity and security across their entire digital estates, spanning Windows 10 Cloud and Security Management, Office 365, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility and Azure. 
A prime example is Mars, a $35 billion business with 60 brands. An early adopter of Office 365, Mars is using Office and Windows 10 to transform how its 80,000-strong global workforce collaborates while staying secure. And more recently, they have begun running mission-critical workloads on Azure, with hundreds more on the way, including inventory management using Azure IoT. 
Swift Transportation, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States, is digitizing work for nearly 20,000 drivers with Office 365 and Skype and is using Azure to harness the data from their sensor-equipped trucks to optimize driver productivity and safety. 
Across industries, we continue to see strong customer demand for our differentiated cloud solutions. Azure revenue grew 95% in constant currency this quarter, Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 10th consecutive quarter, and more than 3 out of 4 Azure customers are using premium services.
We're also leading the next-generation programming model and developer services innovation with conversational bots, micro-services and event-driven serverless compute to help businesses rapidly gain the benefits of cloud infrastructure. Our bot framework is being used by more than 77,000 developers to do everything from e-commerce to customer service. Azure Functions is helping companies like AccuWeather and Flexure to quickly and easily implement business-critical event-driven serverless processes. And everyone from game developers to financial services companies are using Azure Service Fabric for their low latency, high-scale micro-services applications.
We're also rapidly expanding our portfolio of data and AI capabilities in Azure. Cognitive services, now deeply integrated with Azure Data Lake, enables customers to use industry-leading AI capabilities to easily analyze images, text, emotions, speech, sentiments at petabyte scale. 
In our push to meet the needs of any developer on any platform, we joined The Linux Foundation, welcomed Google to the .NET Foundation and announced new Azure partnership with OpenAI to accelerate our vision. 
At the edge of our cloud, Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016 give enterprises Azure-inspired scale and innovation for secure infrastructure and cloud applications. Customers have already deployed more than 1 million instances of Windows Server 2016, and the new SQL Server drove a 5x increase in developer downloads in Q2 versus Q1.
Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. This quarter, we saw growth across Windows broadly. First, Windows 10 commercial customers are rapidly adopting Windows 10, driven by their need for a secure and trusted platform. In fact, this quarter enterprise and education deployments increased 52%. Accenture, Broward County School District, UnitedHealthcare Group are just a few that are choosing Windows 10 as their modern, secure, enterprise-grade platform. These 3 commercial customers alone have already deployed more than 300,000 seats, with commitments to deploy over 0.5 million. 
The consumer PC market is also stabilizing. Gamers are increasingly turning to Windows 10 premium PCs for the best gaming experiences, logging more than 26 billion hours of gameplay on PCs and tablets this year. One reason gamers love their Windows 10 PC is because they can connect to their favorite games and social network on Xbox Live. Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 55 million this quarter, a new record, with growth across PCs, mobile as well as the console. 
Windows 10 Creators Update will bring 3D mixed reality and game broadcasting to all Windows 10 customers. Partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo and Acer are investing to deliver cutting-edge virtual reality experiences for customers using Windows 10 holographic platform. We're also broadening our opportunity through partnerships with chipset makers Intel as well as Qualcomm, who have committed to build the next-generation of modern Windows PCs with advanced security, connectivity, AI and mixed reality in gaming.
Our services, innovation and user engagement on Windows 10 continues to grow. Users have asked Cortana more than 18 billion questions to date, and we are opening up new addressable markets with Cortana Devices SDK. BMW, Renault-Nissan, Harman are all using Cortana to embed voice-activated intelligence into their portfolio of products.
Finally, let's talk about devices. I'm excited about the customer reception to Surface Studio, our latest innovation in Surface line and a new device category. Overall commercial demand for Surface remains strong, with 3 consecutive quarters of more than 25% growth.
Organizations across industries are looking to Surface to help them achieve more, such as Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom rolling out Surface to more than 25,000 of its employees. We're expanding into new markets with HoloLens. Commercial customers like thyssenkrupp Elevator are using HoloLens to enable servicing up to 4x faster than ever before. And we look forward to making HoloLens available in China in the first half of this year.
As customers embrace these new computers and computing experiences, we are generating enthusiasm for Windows 10 and new forms of expression, creativity and gaming that it can unleash. 
I'm proud of the progress we made this quarter and during the entire first half of the year. We look to the second half with a clear focus on execution and innovation. We have a significant opportunity this year and beyond for growth across every one of our segments. We're uniquely positioned to build the technology that helps every person and organization take advantage of new innovations like AI and use them to drive their own growth and transformation. 
Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.",1954
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756017.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to reiterate that my commentary reflects our performance inclusive of approximately 3 weeks of LinkedIn results. For this quarter only, I will comment on our results excluding LinkedIn for consistency with the guidance provided last quarter. I encourage you to reference our earnings slides for supplemental information.
Our second quarter revenue was $26.1 billion, up 2% and 4% in constant currency; gross margin grew 3%, up 5% in constant currency; operating income grew 5% or 8% in constant currency; and earnings per share was $0.83, an increase of 9% and 13% in constant currency. 
Excluding LinkedIn, our second quarter revenue was $25.8 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency; gross margin increased 3% and 4% in constant currency; operating income grew 8% and 11% in constant currency; and our EPS was $0.84, increasing 11% and 15% in constant currency. 
Our investment agility and execution focus resulted in strong performance this quarter. From a geographic perspective, our results were largely in line with macroeconomic trends, with additional benefit from a healthier PC market, particularly in the commercial segment. 
Our commercial cloud services drove our annuity mix up slightly year-over-year to 84%, even with better-than-expected transactional revenue performance. Commercial bookings increased 7% or 12% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue met our guidance range at $21.1 billion, growing 8% and 9% in constant currency, even with an FX headwind of approximately $150 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar through the quarter. And our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high, exceeding $28 billion. 
Our commercial cloud revenue run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 48%, up 2 points from last year, largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage. And gross margin dollars grew again, increasing 62% across the commercial cloud. We remain on track for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year.
Now to company gross margin. Gross margin was approximately 62% inclusive of LinkedIn, up slightly from the prior year. This quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major currencies created additional negative FX impact on total and segment level revenue. On total revenue, FX had a 2-point negative impact, 1 point more than expected, with no additional impact from LinkedIn. 
In both Productivity and Business Processes and the Intelligent Cloud segments, the FX impact was 2 points, 1 point more than expected. And in More Personal Computing, FX had a 1-point impact, in line with expectations. 
Total operating expenses grew 1% and 2% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses declined 2%, also 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were under our guidance range, primarily due to a favorable onetime legal settlement and FX benefits.
Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes LinkedIn, grew 10% and 12% in constant currency to $7.4 billion. In Office commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 7% in constant currency as Office 365 growth again outpaced the shift from the on-premise business. 
Office 365 commercial revenue increased by 47% or 49% in constant currency, driven by a combination of installed base growth across all workloads and ARPU expansion. We also continued to see higher-than-expected results from our transactional business, in part due to an improving commercial PC market. 
Office consumer revenue grew 22% or 21% in constant currency as we continued to see an increase in our subscriber base and growth of recurring subscription revenue. In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter was aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period. 
Our Dynamics business grew 7%, up 9% in constant currency, and our Dynamics 365 installed base more than doubled. 
LinkedIn revenue for the 3-week period from December 8 to the end of the quarter was $228 million.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix as well as roughly 1 point of impact from LinkedIn. Operating expenses grew 13%, 14% in constant currency, driven by the LinkedIn acquisition. Operating income declined slightly but was up 1% in constant currency and up 7% in constant currency excluding LinkedIn. 
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion in revenue, growing 8% and 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, with strong momentum in our Azure business and another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. 
Post-launch demand and purchasing, ahead of currency-driven pricing adjustments, contributed to a higher-than-expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth declined this quarter 4% and 2% in constant currency, due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements.
Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and a lower Enterprise Services gross margin, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. We grew operating expenses by 12% and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity and developer engagement. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectation at $11.8 billion, primarily from stronger-than-expected performance from our Windows business. Overall, revenue declined 5% and 4% in constant currency. 
Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro grew 6%, better than we anticipated, driven by an improving commercial PC market and enterprise demand for Windows 10. OEM non-Pro grew 5%, ahead of the consumer PC market, as our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows premium device category. 
Inventory levels remain normal. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity billings growth and installed base expansion. Patent licensing declined this quarter, driven by lower unit volume and revenue per unit. 
Our search business ex TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with improving profitability and continued growth in Bing from higher revenue per search and search volume. In our devices business, revenue declined 35%, down 34% in constant currency. Phone revenue declined 81%, and we closed the sale of our feature phone business during this quarter. 
Surface revenue was down 2% and flat in constant currency as we continued to phase out the Surface 3 device. Importantly, Surface gross margin dollars grew 6% and 17% in constant currency from an increasing mix of Pro 4 and Book replacing Surface 3 in the portfolio. 
In gaming, revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency due to lower console hardware pricing and Xbox 360 volumes. In this holiday quarter, as Satya mentioned, we reached an all-time high of active Xbox Live users, which helped to drive our gaming software and services revenue to 18% and 21% growth in constant currency. This marks our first $1 billion quarter in digital transactions for our gaming business through our universal store across Windows 10 and Xbox One. 
Segment gross margin percentage and dollars both increased this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 3% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage expanded, with a continued shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined by 12%, also 12% in constant currency, from lower phone expense, a onetime legal settlement and reduced marketing spend. Growth from Windows 10, the shift toward higher gross margin products and services and devices in gaming and disciplined operating expense management resulted in operating income growth of 33% and 37% in constant currency.
Now back to our overall company results. We invested $2.5 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of capital leases, as we continued to support customer and partner demand across our commercial and consumer services. During the quarter, other income and expense was $186 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. We returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, completing our prior $40 billion share repurchase program this quarter as we committed.
Now let's turn to the outlook. First, FX. We'd originally expected FX rates to lessen going into H2. However, given current rates, we expect continued currency headwinds for the rest of the year. For Q3, we now expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. In Q4, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on total revenue, 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing.
Second, our commercial business. We expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth as we expand our installed base, grow consumption and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud.
Third, CapEx. We will continue to meet customer demand by expanding data center capacity while driving efficiencies through new technologies. With the addition of LinkedIn, we expect our capital expenditures, including capital leases, to grow sequentially to support a broader portfolio. For the full year, including LinkedIn, we continue to expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year.
Let's turn to our outlook for the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion. This reflects the continued annuity shift to the cloud, with Office 365, Dynamics double-digit billings growth and LinkedIn revenue of approximately $950 million adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. 
In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion of revenue, with continued annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services revenue should decline again due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. 
And in More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.35 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate revenue growth will exceed the overall PC market. Continued growth in Pro, driven by enterprise momentum for Windows 10, should be roughly in line with the commercial PC market, with some additional benefit coming from the prior year inventory build. 
Our OEM non-Pro performance should grow ahead of the market due to strength in the premium device category. In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex TAC to be similar to Q2. As a reminder, total search revenue growth will slow now that we passed the 1-year anniversary of our Yahoo! deal and the associated change in revenue recognition. 
And in gaming, we expect normal post-holiday trends, with declines in hardware console volumes and pricing balanced by higher engagement, usage and transaction volume. In devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone. Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book.
We expect COGS of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, including approximately $400 million of LinkedIn expenses. LinkedIn COGS include approximately $220 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
We expect operating expenses between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, with about $970 million from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes about $160 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
For the full year, we now expect operating expenses of $33.1 billion to $33.3 billion, with about $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes roughly $360 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
Other income and expense should be $150 million. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 20%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability driven by the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests. 
Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to announce that we will hold a financial analyst briefing for the investor community in conjunction with our Build Developer Conference in May here in Seattle. We will share more details as we get closer to the date.

I wanted to ask a question about LinkedIn and what our expectations should be for achieving revenue synergies on LinkedIn. It seems like there's a lot of really interesting things you could do with that asset and combining with your own portfolio. And how should we think about the potential for achieving some expense synergies? Obviously, there's a big sort of cloud base that you could utilize under their assets. And Amy, you're bullish and very good at keeping expenses very well managed. So just as we go forward past the forward quarter, how should we think about the time frame for achieving those benefits?",106

The core focus, Keith, for us to start with is to ensure that the innovation road map we have is all driving member value. The core ethos of LinkedIn needs to be about member-first, how do we increase the engagement on the mobile flagship application as well as the revamped desktop experience that's now rolling out. We think that that's at the core of being able to, in fact, then have all of the revenue -- have revenue growth in their business solutions, which across higher market sell. So that's how I see it. It's a 2-sided market which starts with the help of membership and member engagement. And that is where the product road map, whether it's the integration with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, we'll be staying focused on it. We expect to see that rollout pretty rapidly. And as far as the guidance we have given at close in terms of what to expect, for example, around EPS impact, those are things that we'll stay committed to. And I'll let Amy add more to it.",198

The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on -- excluding the impact of purchase accounting being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses. 
As a reminder, the 2 biggest impacts of purchase accounting, one is it does impact the deferred revenue, so the in-quarter revenue and the guidance will look a bit lower due to that, as well as the amortization of intangible expenses which also hit. We'll take care to give you insight into those so that you can continue to hold us against the goals we set for ourselves.",141

I mean, I'm not particularly sure exactly what's happening on February 1. But I would sort of say the overall change that we are going through, and this has been ongoing for, I would say, the last multiple years, is transforming our field engagement model where we're putting a lot more technical depth in the frontline sellers and also that they can engage, whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists or even productivity specialists. Because it's super important for us in this phase, when people are looking for solutions to help them digitally transform, for us to have a very fundamentally different type of capability in terms of our sales. And that's the transformation. And so we have really reorganized ourselves both in the headquarters and in the field to be able to recognize that shift. 
What used to be large accounts for us, for example, are not by PC count anymore. And that's a pretty fundamental change. It's by consumption of cloud capacity in many cases. And this is happening all over the world. So that's the transformation that you will increasingly see us push forward. And no status quo on any part of Microsoft's organization should be counted on. If anything, we'll push to make sure that we are addressing what is our growth opportunities pretty aggressively.",225

And the guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business. And in fact, in some ways it actually includes an acceleration in certain areas. So I think that's how I tend to look at it.",80

I was just wondering if you could share with us, I guess, given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative? And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why, at a similar revenue scale, you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS, what you can back into from the financials of AWS? Can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes? And then once you've kind of hit that scale point, do they -- is it something that we should see inflect pretty quickly?",120
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756029.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,15,"Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer. You'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365, Office 365, as well as our Azure core and premium services. And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on, where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate consistently, securely through one interface. You'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud. It benefits margin not just in Azure but across actually the entirety of the cloud. 
That 2-point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin, really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected. But I tend to think you will consistently hear both Satya and I refer to our cloud in its entirety. But I do respect people always wonder, so I did comment that we saw material improvement in Azure specifically.",197

So your prior guidance was for ex LinkedIn fiscal '17 gross margins to be down 100 basis points. So the quarter you just posted gross margins ex LinkedIn were actually up. And if I ran the math accurately, it looks like for your March quarter ex LinkedIn you're expecting gross margins to be about flat. So it feels like you're outperforming the core Microsoft gross margin guidance you gave before. So are you sticking with the down 100, or has that improved? And if it has, what are the 1 or 2 biggest drivers of the gross margins feeling a little bit better ex LinkedIn?",122
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756032.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,18,"Thanks, Karl. I am sticking with it being about 1 point. That's the guidance we gave. And even inclusive of LinkedIn, I continue to believe it's about 1 point. So in some ways, I guess you could say it implies slightly better at the company level, if that's how you're thinking about it. 
Really, Karl, what can drive that, in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we've seen in our Windows business. And I mean that not just in our OEM business but also across the commercial business for Windows. That tends to have a very good margin profile. And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve. And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox as also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile. So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year. But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps.",194

It was obviously helped by Windows Server 2016, SQL Server 2016. How should we think about, on a longer-term horizon over the next 12 months or even longer, how those 2 should help on the on-premise license or annuity business, on the cloud, on Azure? How should we think about the impact of that?",68

Let me start by saying is why we tend to focus all up at that server product and services KPI being double digits is generally an easier way for us to talk about it all up between Azure and the on-prem business. But let me talk a little bit about what impacted the transactional business this quarter, and then we can talk about how to think about it in Q3 and maybe going forward. 
We did and were encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year. That value prop is resonating. We saw some growth. I feel very good about that. And so I do think that can have an impact in H2. You heard me talk a little bit about it. With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us, it did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2. And so it'll be a bit of a drag on Q3, which is taken into account in the guide. But I would reiterate that the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw.",222

And I'm wondering how we should think about the factors impacting and the timing in the sort of handoff of profit growth from MPC to IC and PBP. Is that something that you expect? What are the factors and timing there?",70
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756038.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,24,"Great. And I would say, actually, we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment, this quarter up in constant currency it was 7% before LinkedIn. So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth. But the heart of your question is really about the MPC transition in IC. The way I think about it, we really -- Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago, it's been a little bit longer than that now, to overindex on investing because of the TAM we saw in the Intelligent Cloud. We increased hiring and we invested in direct customer acquisition costs and we invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities in our sales force. We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers, that 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number. And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired and get up to speed and add value at accounts. 
A lot of that account value, frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue. Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be. And so some of the confidence, I think, that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense and to even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have. And so I do think about that being sort of an 18-month investment we've been making is starting to pivot to consumed. It will then land as billings and ultimately in our P&L as GAAP revenue in-quarter off the balance sheet. 
But I think you're right. We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient. People often think we focus on cut here, add here. It's also about are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful. And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through, where it's how we build products. And so I actually am confident you'll start to see that transition land.",409

But architecturally, some of the examples I used are about the digital estate that actually doesn't start with Azure. In many cases it starts with advanced threat protection of Windows 10 estate and then how does that relate to Office 365, how does that relate to Azure Active Directory and then the workloads that they may want to put, which are Tier 1 workloads, in Azure. 
It's very similar to what happened even in the client/server era, but of course the starting points and how this progresses is very different. So we always think at least of the technical architecture that makes us unique and differentiated spanning all of it. And so I don't think of it as margin shifts across the segments. And that's why we think of all of this as one digital estate, at least from a customer-end perspective.",164

For example, are there incremental waves of activity on the horizon that you would tie to Tier 1 workloads or large data center migrations or serverless usage which would enable that? 
And separate from that, Amy, I'm curious, just philosophically, how do you plan to handle price cuts for compute and storage when they occur? Do you think you're better off matching them? Exceeding them? Or does it make sense perhaps warranting a premium in many cases due to the differentiated IP that you have up the stack?",107
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756042.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,28,"Yes, let me start. Overall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it is Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that's happening. And even the customer examples I gave, they were littered with example after example of, for example in FinServ, some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in Service Fabric, which is really a PaaS service which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale. That's a place where we are seeing, in fact, activity, whether it's game development or trading applications. We are seeing even interesting use cases of Azure Functions, which is completely serverless. In fact, the -- you can even think of it as a price cut. For anybody who cares about using -- being very, very smart about cloud consumption, going serverless is something that we, in fact, advocate. 
So across the board, I feel we have the right mix of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and per user SaaS services like Azure Active Directory which gives us the right mix to be able to even have the right margins long-term. We're not concentrated in any one layer of the stack, which is something we do by design, because our vision has always been that we want, of course, to offer all of these layers and customers will choose depending on their needs and their scenarios. And we are now seeing even a single customer estate spanning all of these.",251

But what I would say is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate. And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core.",78

One, Amy, when I look at your comments on gross margin, clearly you're not in a position to break out Azure-only gross margin, but I'm wondering if you could take a composite. Your commercial cloud targets are about $20 billion. So if I take what I believe could be a rough split between Azure versus the SaaS segment and look at the best-of-breed companies, I could get about 70%, 75% gross margin when you hit your targets. Curious what you think about that. Is that too aggressive or within the ballpark? 
And for you, Satya, as cloud computing moves to the enterprise, there is some belief among investors that AWS is going to be a big, strong competitor in the enterprise, which is typically not a stronghold for them. What -- how do we think of Microsoft's enduring strength in the enterprise? And how confident can we be that you should be able to capture your fair share of enterprise workloads as they move to the cloud?",175

So Kash, I mean, the way I think about it is, even in the client/server era we had tough competition. We had Oracle, we had VMware and we had many other players we competed with, and I grew up competing with. And we now have AWS, I think, who is going to be a credible competitor. And so I feel that -- as I said, we have a cloud strategy that is not just about infrastructure. It is about really SaaS and infrastructure. And we want to uniquely think about what are the things that we can do to differentiate and add value to our customers' digital estate in the cloud in that context. And that's where, if you will, our fair share will come from, by competing hard where we have to but also mostly thinking about differentiation.",151

And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously, much as it did in the -- when that was run as a hardware solution, the margins weren't as high either. And so I do think it'll be a blend of those. But certainly at the SaaS end I understand where you get that benchmark from.",110

You have another strong quarter of revenue growth, obviously, at 49% constant currency. But it continues to meaningfully outpace the seat growth, which is still strong, but 37%. So that commentary that you all have given about premium mix in the past, 2 questions here. First to Satya, when you think about sort of where we are in the sort of the progression, call it, up to E5, so to speak, or E3, how do you think this plays out? And how do you think about sort of the mix of unit growth versus that premium mix and kind of translating it to revenue? 
And then to Amy, I guess I'd argue that maybe we've done sort of the low margin or low gross margin parts of the Office 365 transition, and now, as this mix goes up, you're actually not just increasing revenue, but the margin is better, too. Is that fair? And then sort of how do you tie that back to your commercial cloud gross margin expectations long-term?",184
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756050.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,36,"Yes, I can start. On the product side, we think of actually 3 things we are trying to do on a continuous basis in Office 365. First, even for the customers already in Office 365, at any given licensing level, we focus quite a bit on their increased usage and intensity. So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with Power Apps and Flow. That's, to us, the best way for us to keep having that recurring value. And so we focus quite a bit of adding additional value even to the existing licensing levels and increasing intensity of usage. 
Then things like what we are doing to even go to the non-knowledge worker audiences in retail or in manufacturing with some of the things that we're doing, the staff scheduling, for example. That's a way to expand seat even beyond what is the traditional knowledge worker. Of course we have a significant more opportunity in small and medium-size businesses. Although we have good, healthy growth there, I think seat growth will come more from material increases internationally as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud. Those are all opportunities ahead. 
And then the last one, of course, is this new value in things like E5 with voice or analytics and security. 
So all those 3 dimensions, there will be variability quarter-to-quarter in terms of what's happening, but we -- in terms of our investments in the core product value, they're actually happening on all those 3.",264
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756051.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,37,"And to your point on sort of where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. The transitions take time. And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. We're excited about all the customers in trial and already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics and ultimately voice. But really, from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3. 
And so then that leads to your question on do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads. And of course the answer to that is we do believe that. But it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace.",146

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756053.0,Question,Ross MacMillan,,Analysts,39,"Two questions, one for Amy first. When we look at CapEx, it actually declined year-over-year ex capital leases. But even with capital leases the growth rate decelerated. And for the full year it's obviously a pretty wide range, sort of roughly 0% to 40% growth. I'm just curious, Amy, with LinkedIn, have you made any changes to your CapEx assumptions for core Microsoft? And I guess I'm pointing to the fact that it did seem to decelerate quite a lot this quarter. And I wondered if there's any additional color you could frame around sort of growth rate for all-up CapEx plus capital leases.",104
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756054.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,40,"Sure. Let me first comment on that I've said it will be lower than it was previously. I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower, just so that you're getting into something closer. I realize 0% to 40% is not as helpful. I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy. And it's why I don't sort of give very specific guidance every single quarter. And it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn. 
Our real goal for LinkedIn is, over time, of course, I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets. But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members. And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next 6 months for sure. So I think what you're seeing in terms of year-over-year and what does it mean for next year -- next quarter, it will be a sequential increase but, again, it is a bit lumpy.",192

Can you talk a little bit about that cycle and how you think that's unfolding and what the customer feedback is in terms of their intention to adopt it now versus kind of waiting for a little bit?",68
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3780.0,1216661.0,49756057.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,43,"Yes, I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we have seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows and primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows. And that's what's been the driver. 
But in addition to that, I must say there are 2 other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system which is secure and an always up-to-date Office experience that is a SaaS service. We're increasingly seeing that resonate, not just in small business and some of the high-tech industry as it has been in the past but now even in the regulated parts of the enterprise. So we're very excited about that. 
The other piece also that's driving is hardware innovation by the entire ecosystem. In fact, the work that we did with the Surface line has really stimulated the entire ecosystem to do some of the best innovative work, and you saw that even at CES. And the enterprise adoption of these new devices is also driving the overall excitement around Windows 10 and Windows 10 innovation.",215

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and the financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation.
At the start of fiscal '18, Microsoft adopted ASU 606, the new revenue accounting standard. Today's Q4 earnings report and any forward-looking statements follow the current revenue accounting standard, consistent with our reporting throughout fiscal '17. In early August, we will be holding a conference call to provide you with information that will aid you in the transition to the new standard.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 20, 2018.
During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any update -- any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",437

This quarter, we delivered $24.7 billion in revenue, up 10% in constant currency. For the year, we are $96.7 billion in revenue, up 5%. I'm proud of the progress, particularly the strength of our commercial cloud results. FY '17 all up was a tremendous year of customer momentum with cloud, AI and digital transformation. 
Our technology worldview of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge is resonating with businesses everywhere. Every customer I talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth as well as a strategic partner who can help build their own digital capability. Microsoft is that trusted partner.
Now let's look at the progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Process. The workplace is transforming, from changing employee expectations, a need for more diverse skills and globally distributed teams and increasingly complex threat environment. Only Microsoft gives customers a comprehensive approach for this new culture of work. 
Earlier this month, we introduced Microsoft 365, which brings together Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security in a complete, secure solution to empower employees, safeguard businesses and simplify IT management. Microsoft 365 is a fundamental shift in how we design, build and go to market to address customer needs. 
Fortune 500 customers FedEx, Dow Chemicals, Staples, Progressive Insurance all chose Microsoft 365. The success of our secure productive enterprise offering with its triple-digit seat growth is one reason we are investing in Microsoft 365 for businesses of all sizes. 
We continue to see strong growth of Office 365, with customers like Nissan, Quicken Loans, KeyBanc, Deutsche Telekom all choosing Office 365. And importantly, customers are moving beyond core workloads to adopt higher-value workloads. For example, we have seen a significant increase in SharePoint usage, which nearly doubled year-over-year. 
The classroom is also transforming. This quarter, we introduced Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for education, the digital hub for students and teachers. Microsoft Teams gives educators a whole new way to create and inspire modern classroom environments. With rich learning tools and the ability to have digital conversations with students, share materials, manage assignments, Teams gives educators more time to focus on doing what they love the most: teaching.
Now I'll talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We are investing in LinkedIn flagship experience to create new value for members and customers and accelerate growth. We saw continued momentum in mobile and strong engagement across the platform, with sessions up more than 20% for the third consecutive quarter. And we continue to innovate new ways for members to maximize the value of the platform. We launched a new messaging overlay, resulting in record levels of messages sent on LinkedIn, and introduced a career advice marketplace that will let members easily tap into the professional expertise of more than 500 million members around the world. On top of that, Talent Solutions saw record-level growth in confirmed hires and InMail response rates this quarter.
I've talked about the opportunities with Dynamics and LinkedIn. Earlier this month, we launched Microsoft Relationship Sales solution, bringing together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as Dynamics 365 solution for retail and talent. In a world where customers are increasingly digitizing every business process, we continue to invest and expand our portfolio of modern modular business applications that are infused with AI.
We also introduced ISV Cloud Embed to make it easier for partners to modernize their existing business process applications, build new ones using Dynamics 365, Power BI, Power Apps and Microsoft Flow. A global health care solution provider and partner, Indegene, is using it to create a mobile CRM solution for medical sales. Customers like HSBC, Best Buy, Dolce & Gabbana all chose Dynamics 365 to transform their own business processes and experience the benefits of moving away from monolithic suites.
Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $18.9 billion. This quarter's cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over 2 years ago of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR in fiscal 2018. More than ever before, customers are placing their trust in the Microsoft Cloud. 
Azure revenue accelerated this quarter, growing 97% year-over-year. CIOs and business decision-makers increasingly prefer Azure as they make decisions about their cloud strategy. They value our hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted approach. 
And we keep investing in cloud computing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity, as we have done with our South Africa data center expansion, bringing Azure to 40 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider. And as part of our commitment to trust, we are helping our customers prepare to be GDPR-compliant and meet the requirements of the European Union ahead of the enforcement deadline. 
AXA Global, KPMG, Dun & Bradstreet, Hearst, Walgreens, T-Mobile and Sephora all chose Azure to transform their businesses. Box announced that it'll bring its content and collaboration service to Azure and plans to use our AI to simplify discovery and use of all types of content across the enterprise. And Baidu will use Azure to take its autonomous driving platform worldwide.
The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. It all starts with having the support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, combined with SQL Server. 
Azure Cosmos DB is industry's first globally distributed database service. It enables customers to securely and reliably power data-intensive applications at unprecedented scale and performance, from IoT to AI to mobile and much more. Retailer jet.com is using Azure Cosmos DB to process trillions of transactions every day. 
Customers are infusing AI into their products and services using Azure AI infrastructure and services such as bot framework and cognitive services. Sabre, a leading technology provider to the global travel industry, is piloting AI-powered solutions for travel agencies to better serve customers; and Dixons Carphone is using Azure and our cognitive services to boost customer engagement and provide a more consistent, seamless experience across online and in their stores.
Azure is also unique in its support for these emerging Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge applications. Azure IoT Edge extends cloud intelligence to edge devices. This means IoT devices can act locally at the edge while taking advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale. 
Azure is the first cloud to provide true hybrid support that customers predominantly choose. Azure Stack extends Azure to enable developers to build and deploy applications the same way, whether they run on the intelligent cloud or at the intelligent edge, so customers can meet any regulatory requirement and bring cloud applications to remote or disconnected locations like cruise ships or oil rigs.
Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Against the backdrop of more than 500 million Windows 10 monthly active devices and continued broad progress across the Windows ecosystem, I want to highlight a couple of key strategic areas this quarter. Windows 10 is made to inspire the creator in all of us and is pivotal to enabling employees to transform the way they work. Increasingly, commercial customers value Windows 10 as the foundation for a secure modern workplace. Enterprise and education deployments increased 33% over the last quarter as companies like NASCAR, Emirates Airline, BMW Group, Bank of China all adopt Windows 10. 
This quarter, we introduced Windows 10 S, streamlined for simplicity, security and superior performance and tailored for the classroom. Our goal for Windows 10 S is to develop a vibrant ecosystem with partners like Acer, Asus, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung and Toshiba to introduce a new class of modern devices that enables affordable, powerful new scenarios, from Windows Ink to 3D. We also introduced the Surface Laptop and the new Surface Pro this quarter to continue to build and create momentum for new Windows device category. 
Now on to gaming. Our gaming business now is more than $9 billion and growing profitably. The gaming world is evolving faster than ever before, from gameplay across multiple devices to the explosive growth in streaming and e-sports to new subscription services and mixed-reality scenarios. We're uniquely positioned to capture a large share of this opportunity because of our ability to unite the global community of gamers through Xbox Live, now 53 million strong and growing, and to enable new experiences across PC, console and mobile. 
Our approach is to let gamers play the games they want with the people they want on the device they want. At E3, we celebrated the passion of gamers by introducing Xbox One X, broadening our portfolio of gaming devices with the world's most powerful console. We launched 2 new services that broaden our reach and enrich the gaming experience, both of which are off to a very strong start. Mixer, our new live-streaming service, makes it easier than ever before for gamers to create and share across platforms and to interact in entirely new ways. The Xbox Game Pass is a digital subscription service that expands our existing gaming value proposition.
In closing, I'm proud of the progress this year, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to digitally transform. As technology disrupts every industry and has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone, we strive to create local opportunity and growth and impact in every country around the world. 
Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public sector efficiency. We also support new start-ups, improve educational health outcomes and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers' success. Transformation is a continuous process of renewal and reinvestment. We will continue to invest in the high-growth opportunities, lead innovation in cloud and AI and bring our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock new value for customers.
Now I'll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",1725
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2017",2017-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3593.0,1249613.0,50634920.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $24.7 billion, up 9% and 10% in constant currency, with stronger-than-expected performance across all segments. Gross margin grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 13% and 16% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.98, increasing 42% and 43% in constant currency, which includes $0.23 from the utilization of phone-related losses from prior years that were previously nondeductible. 
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth. LinkedIn's operating loss of $361 million was a 6 point drag on total company operating income growth and is entirely attributable to the $371 million of amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in COGS and OpEx.
From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends, though large markets like the U.S., Germany and Japan performed better than we expected. We had a strong quarter in our commercial business, reflecting terrific execution from our sales teams and partners in the largest quarter of our year.
We increased commitment to our commercial cloud and healthy renewals on a record volume of expirations. We closed the highest number of multimillion dollar Azure deals to date and improved our annuity mix to 86%, up 3 points year-over-year. As a result, commercial bookings grew 30% and commercial unearned revenue was $27.8 billion, significantly higher than we expected.
Our contracted not billed balance increased to more than $31.5 billion. As Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $18.9 billion this quarter, growing 56%. We finished the year with nearly $15 billion in commercial cloud revenue.
At the start of the year, we committed to material improvement in commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars. This quarter, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 52%, up 10 points year-over-year, with positive gross margin in each cloud service. Commercial cloud gross margin dollars grew 92% from strength across all services. Our company gross margin was 66%, up 1 point from the prior year, as sales mix of higher-margin product and services offset the impact of a growing mix of cloud revenue and $217 million of LinkedIn amortization cost.
FX was mostly in line with our expectations with 1 point of negative impact on total revenue growth, even with a slightly weaker-than-expected U.S. dollar. At the segment level, FX had a negative impact of 2 points on Productivity and Business Processes, 1 point on Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 9% and 10% in constant currency, with LinkedIn contributing 12 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 21% and 23% in constant currency to $8.4 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 43% and 44% in constant currency, with continued install base growth across all workloads, ARPU expansion and emerging E5 momentum. For the first time, Office 365 commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business.
Office consumer revenue increased 13%, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base. Our Dynamics business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency, and Dynamics 365 grew 74% and 75% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, a bit better than expected.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, with 12 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $217 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined from an increasing cloud revenue mix and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization. Operating expenses increased 41%, with 40 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 8% and 5% in constant currency, with 12 points of impact from LinkedIn.
The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Our server products and cloud services revenue grew 15% and 16% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity revenue growth. 
Azure revenue growth accelerated to 97%, up 98% in constant currency. Azure Premium revenue grew triple digits for the 12th consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements, partially offset by growth in premier support services.
Segment gross margin dollars grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 2% and 3% in constant currency, with continued investment in sales capacity and developer engagement. Operating income increased 15%, up 18% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $8.8 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency, with 4 points of decline from phone. Our OEM business grew 1% this quarter, as both our commercial and consumer OEM businesses were slightly ahead of the PC market. OEM Pro revenue grew 3%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Windows 10 deployment cycles continue to drive commercial customer hardware demand. OEM non-Pro revenue was flat ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from Windows premium device mix. Inventories remain in their normal range.
Windows commercial cloud products and services grew 8%, driven by annuity revenue growth. Enterprise customers increasingly chose Windows 10 on new and existing devices, which led to install base growth and higher adoption of our cloud security solutions. Patent licensing declined this quarter primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume. 
Devices revenue declined 28% and 27% in constant currency. Our Surface business performed better than we expected, declining 2% and 1% in constant currency, with strong sales execution on our Surface Pro product transition and early positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface Laptop launch in June.
Our gaming business grew 3% and 4% in constant currency. Xbox software and services growth of 11%, 13% in constant currency, offset declines in hardware. And our engaged user base grew 8% to 53 million monthly active users across console, mobile and Windows 10 platforms.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to a sales mix shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 10% and 9% in constant currency from lower phone expense as well as Surface and gaming marketing spend in the prior year. As a result, operating income grew 68% and 72% in constant currency.
Now back to the overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $3.3 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, up sequentially in part due to the planned Q3 data center spend pushed into this Q4. This includes approximately $2.3 billion of cash paid for property and equipment, which was down year-over-year as we utilized more capital leases. 
Free cash flow grew 50% year-over-year, driven primarily by operating cash flow growth of 30% as well as lower cash outlays for CapEx. Operating cash flow increased due to higher collections from customers following strong billings growth as well as working capital improvements in our hardware business. Other income and expense was $215 million, more than originally planned, as we continued to see opportunities in the equities market to realize gains throughout the quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was negative 6%, significantly lower than we expected due to a $1.8 billion impact related to the utilization of prior years' losses from our phone business that were not deductible in the years incurred. Excluding this item, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19% this quarter and 20% for the full year. This quarter, we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
Now let's turn to the outlook. The key trends for FY '18 from the financial analyst briefing remain largely unchanged. For the full year, we expect about 1 point of negative FX impact, assuming current rates remain stable. In our Commercial business, we anticipate that increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive a higher annuity mix. Our commercial transactional business will continue to decline, driven by the transition to the cloud. We remain focused on improving our commercial cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud services. As a reminder, given seasonality and revenue mix, commercial cloud gross margin will experience quarterly variability.
Cloud migrations, deployments and new scenarios are driving greater customer usage. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. Total CapEx spend will continue to have variability quarter-to-quarter.
At the company level, our gross margin percentage should decline about 1 point in FY '18, with increasing cloud revenue mix; a full year of LinkedIn amortization; and hardware launches, including our new console, Xbox One X. We expect LinkedIn quarterly amortization expense and COGS to be approximately $220 million or about $880 million for the full year.
Next, operating expenses. You should think about our FY '18 operating expenses in 2 categories: first, organic Microsoft expenses, which we expect to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to support our top line growth; second, LinkedIn. We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth. 
Additionally, we will recognize our first full year of operating expenses, including $620 million of amortization expense. Importantly, we expect our company operating margin to only decline by about 1 point as we continue to grow our cloud revenue, we fund new investment to support growth in strategic areas and absorb $1.5 billion of LinkedIn amortization in COGS and OpEx. Excluding the LinkedIn impact, operating margin should be flat year-over-year.
Next, our effective tax rate. As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least 3 major factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vest. As cloud revenue mix increases, we anticipate our tax rate will move higher. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 23%, plus or minus 2 points. And finally, we expect LinkedIn, ex purchase accounting, to be nondilutive in FY '18, as it was in Q4.
Now to the outlook for next quarter. Based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on revenue growth overall and for each segment. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $24.85 billion to $25.05 billion. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion. Office 365 commercial revenue growth will continue to be driven by install base growth, ARPU expansion and adoption of premium services like E5 and should outpace the rate of transactional decline. 
We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business, given prior year comparables. In our Dynamics business, Dynamics 365 will continue to drive our cloud mix higher. And we expect approximately $1.1 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion. Customer demand for Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings remains strong, and we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline, given lower volumes of custom support agreements. 
We expect More Personal Computing revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion. We anticipate OEM revenue will move more closely in line with the PC market. Devices revenue growth will continue to be impacted by the prior year phone comparable. Surface revenue will continue to be driven by the product life cycle transition between Pro 4 and our new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro.
In search, Bing's revenue growth ex TAC should be similar to prior quarters, and we expect gaming to have a typical seasonality revenue pattern for a preholiday quarter. 
We expect COGS between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion, including approximately $400 million from LinkedIn. LinkedIn COGS include about $220 million of amortization.
We expect CapEx on an accrual dollar basis to be similar to Q4 as we grow our investment to meet demand. We expect operating expenses of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, with about $1 billion of LinkedIn, of which roughly $155 million is related to amortization. Other income and expense should be about $250 million as we expect to realize more gains in our equities portfolio. Given the volume of equity vests that occur in our first quarter and based on today's stock value, we expect our first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 4 points lower than the estimated full year tax rate.
Finally, we adopted the new revenue standard, ASU 606, effective at the start of fiscal year '18. To assist in the transition, Chris, along with our Chief Accounting Officer, Frank Brod, will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss these changes, present historical restated financial results and share Q1 guidance converted to the new standard. And with that, let's go to Q&A.",2223

Amy, I had a question about commercial cloud COGS, and I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage of these roughly is related to depreciation, and how should we think about the pace of your CapEx deployments versus what you have been experiencing in commercial cloud to support the initiatives and the vast growth opportunities that you see ahead as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months? If there's anything you could share with us around that.",86

Overall, when you think about COGS and the pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change. It's generally over a 3-year period. And there's other pieces of equipment that have longer or shorter depreciation lives. So that pace of depreciation doesn't change per se. 
If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter, in Q4 we felt very good about cloud demand across all 3 services but in particular with Azure. I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services. I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth. And I am encouraged by the demand signals we're getting. 
All of those things, I think -- it's not really about the pace, it's as much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can, and I feel really good about the team's execution.",167

And first of all, thank you for the question, Keith. Overall, the approach we have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it's the product creation; how we are organized in the R&D; how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we may have had in the past; how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach; and then, of course, even with the go-to-market. 
And this transformation is ongoing. This has been happening over multiple years. But we have now got very good customer momentum, because ultimately this is all driven by the opportunity at hand, which is much bigger than anything that we have participated in the past. So the total addressable market is much bigger. And second, our customer expectations and our partner expectations of how we show up with them has changed. And so over the years, we have been making changes. And now that we have a lot more momentum and critical mass, we're going to that next phase. And that's what you are seeing us -- in terms of changing the skill sets, changing the scope of how we show up to support the digital transformation needs of both large customers as well as small businesses.",220

We're taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they'll have a good long-term return in that next phase of transformation.",102

Amy, there were a lot of numbers in this print that look very strong, but one that stood out to me was the commercial bookings growth of 30%. You did touch on it a little bit in your remarks, but if you don't mind, I'd love to ask you a few questions. One is, you mentioned that maybe part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals. Does it feel like maybe last quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush? In other words, it might have been a bit of a onetime phenomenon? 
Secondly, is Microsoft doing anything different around contract structure or invoicing to -- that would result in bookings being unusually high, maybe collecting a little bit more up front? 
And lastly, is it fair to interpret the strong bookings performance as giving us, and I suppose you, comfort in your revenue growth profile in fiscal '18 as all those bookings obviously convert to reported revs?",163
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2017",2017-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3593.0,1249613.0,50634932.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,15,"Thanks, Karl. Let me make sure I cover off on most of those. Let me start by saying the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals. The second component of that is the execution on new revenue, in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial. And billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall. There was no change in any way to invoicing, people paying earlier, paying more up front. That's definitely not an impact on that number. 
And so overall I think, while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it's really, I think, to your point, it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY '18 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers.",149

While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that, it's also the balance, right? This is the first quarter where we've actually seen the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus perpetual. So I actually feel very good that, as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory, that you're not seeing, frankly, much impact on the gross margin line, and we're seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.",105

When you think about -- you're right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it. And for the year, on a pure basis, it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue. See, we're starting to get to that point, Mark, where you have a big base which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps, in the one that you saw this quarter. And you're right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter, and this one certainly was as well. 
But you also saw, and what really does matter, especially in Azure, is usage growth, really consumption growth, having customers use, deploy, be successful and really continue to get, you think, sort of meters up and running, and that continues to build on itself. And so when you start to see that, you can and I do think we'll continue to see good growth in this number.",161

Next, I think across every service, the momentum we've seen in Q4 -- and in particular, I would say I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows, E5, Advanced Threat Protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings. 
One of the things we often talk about is we sell Microsoft 365. That's Windows 10 with security and services. It's a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365. It includes EMS. We really did see strength across all of them. So I don't really think it's about a percentage but it's about each of them continuing to make progress.",131

And so that's helped us, in fact, come up with Microsoft 365 as this very strong offering that brings together Office 365, Windows 10 as well as our Enterprise Mobility + Security and support even cross-platform devices. So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people who use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, security across all of this estate of theirs. And that's where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition. 
So that's what Microsoft 365 embodies. It's today available in -- for enterprises, and in the fall you will have the mid-market version of it, which I think is another very big opportunity, because it really helps take what we have learned in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute. And so we are excited about that when -- at Inspire, the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well.",209

You're right; in terms of Office Commercial 365, the primary driver is still install base, both the transition as well as new. I think we're optimistic as we head into FY '18 for the install base growth that's possible in particular for some of these mid-market offerings that we're quite proud of. 
The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen the past couple of quarters continues to primarily, Phil, be related still to the E1 to E3 transition. When we mentioned E5, I think that's, frankly, encouraging for us, because all of these premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion. People start using E1, then they use E3, and then you start to see the momentum in E5. And we did see that. However, in terms of ARPU impact, very, very small in quarter. So that's something that, over time, you would continue to see improvement in, in terms of impact on ARPU.",187

Clearly, that's off the charts. And also, when I look at the $18.9 billion of annualized revenue, and judging from the fact that the commercial business, non-Azure component of it, was about steady in growth rate [indiscernible] that Azure went through some significant acceleration which is yet to be reflected in your forward-looking revenues, if you could just shed a little bit more light and drill into any 2 or 3 product SKUs or areas or geographies that contributed to that off-the-charts performance, that would be great.",104

Let me go through the bookings. Again, with that 30%, the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in-quarter. It was reasonably consistent, Kash. There's not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier, although, in 2 of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany, they did have very good years, in particular in Q4. 
Now if you separate the fact that we had the large base, which clearly contributes to that bookings number being big, aside from that, in particular Azure, in the last, to your point, did it really show up in that $18.9 billion, it didn't. The strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide, and it was significant. And a lot of that is the Azure billings. I think we felt very good. Those as well, I think, were pretty broad-based across industry, I would also say across geos. And so while we, of course, get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors, it was actually quite broad. There's not really one place for me to say that ""We just saw it here."" 
And then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and where you'd see that, Kash, again, versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there, was that final piece around our security value prop, ATP. Windows annuity growth was very good. That's in the KPI Windows commercial products and services, is the place you'll look and see that number. And outside of that, I mean, those really are the biggest contributors.",284

I'm just curious, is that representative of the portfolio that flowed through into this quarter on a 3-year cycle? Or is it more complex than that? And also, does it include or exclude LinkedIn contributions for the current period? 
And just finally, I'm wondering, again, looking back 3 years, it was a different number in the September quarter that follows, and can you help us just with the year-over-year growth of the expiry base for the September quarter? I'm not sure if you had commented on that.",124

You're right. Mark, it's not exactly. If I said is the Q3 from 3 years ago exactly the expiry base, it's not exactly, but it's directionally. And so that's a good example, to say every 3 years tends to be the length of our agreements. And so you do tend to see that repeated. And so that's what we mean by sort of the record or the largest expiry base, and that is the pattern. In terms of LinkedIn having any impact, it did not.

I think the last 3 quarters we've been trending at mid-single digits or even higher. And Amy, I'd just love your thoughts, as we progress through fiscal '18 just so we think about this in the right way, how would you expect that sort of growth rate to trend? And should we be sort of aware of the comps that come up in Q2 and beyond?",91

First of all, we don't think of our servers as distinct from our cloud. In other words, this intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge is the architecture or pattern for which we are building, whether it's SQL Server 2017 or with Windows Server, the Container Service. Everything that we do assumes that distributed computing will actually remain distributed. And it turns out that it's helpful to think about it that way both for customers who are rationalizing their portfolios of apps as they lift, shift, modernize as to what they run in their data centers or in our data centers but also forward-looking new workloads. If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud is cloud applications that actively require an edge. Azure IoT or Azure Stack are becoming the run times of the edge, where you do need not only the ability to do compute and storage but to run the AI inference and the edge. 
So to me, that's what we are building to. It's actually a big architectural shift from thinking purely of this as a migration to some public cloud to really thinking of this as a real future distributed computing infrastructure and applications that I, quite frankly, feel very, very good about leading. And so in that context, our server license revenue will fluctuate based on what the macro is and these transitions and mix shifts. But from a forward-looking perspective, I want us to be very, very clear that we anticipate the edge to be actually one of the more exciting parts of what's happening with our infrastructure.",308
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2017",2017-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3593.0,1249613.0,50634962.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,45,"And so that leads why I always tend to say I don't focus as much on the mix per se. I know both of them will matter. I know both of them are important. And so that's why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the Edge, which is the on-prem. And so I think we remain confident in that double-digit target that we have for that KPI. And there isn't really, I don't think, sort of a comparability challenge per se, but that's why we try to keep it at that high level, to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion that's possible. We know we can grow within it. 
And I apologize, I didn't answer Mark's last component, so let me just go back, and I had forgotten, which was, was there anything unique in the expiry base for Q1. The answer is it's up a little year-over-year but -- and certainly not through the same type of Q4 comparable. When we tend to have these, we try to call them out, like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. So Q1, I would say, is just up a little, so I wouldn't expect any material impact.",222

Satya, you talked a little bit about SharePoint taking off and being a big part. Can you talk a little bit about the portfolio you have there?

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2017",2017-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3593.0,1249613.0,50634966.0,Answer,Satya Nadella,,Executives,49,"Yes, I mean, I think we have premium services, whether it's in Office 365 or in the SaaS side with Dynamics 365, and that's where the SharePoint comment came, that there's a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle beyond Exchange or e-mail. 
On the Azure side, my comments, in fact, walked that entire tree, so to speak, which is there's the infrastructure there, where in fact even in the infrastructure side there is no such thing as one generic infrastructure, when I look at the diversity of the virtual machines, what's happening with AI infrastructure, with GPU compute. So there's a lot of richness there. 
The layer above that, for me, is the data estate. One of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, our data warehouse product the Data Lake. So that's a place where we are seeing significant attach. On top of the data is where the AI services, whether it's the bot framework, the cognitive services. So that's all the rich services where we're seeing significant customer action. 
The other side of it is the edge. So Azure IoT, our service both in the cloud and the edge, and Azure Stack now, truly starting this quarter, is going to be another way to extend out the rich services of Azure even beyond public cloud deployment. So that's what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have. 
And then one linchpin that we have between, in fact, our SaaS services as well as Azure is Azure Active Directory. 90% of all the enterprises use Azure -- use Active Directory, and all of them rendezvous with Azure Active Directory irrespective of what applications they have in whichever cloud, because that becomes a very key control plane for IT.",300

21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2017",2017-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3593.0,1249613.0,50634969.0,Answer,Amy Hood,,Executives,52,"Thanks, Brad. The way I tend to think about it is, with any service, you want the gross margin itself to improve. And that includes, in the Azure services, components themselves. The difference between core compute and store versus the premium layers can be significant, and we've had improvement across all of them. 
So the real question on how and where should the Azure gross margin be is about sort of the ultimate mix of those. And we saw significant improvement this year. We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines. And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we'll just have to wait and see. But -- and that's why I tend to not focus at that layer. It's like, can you get every service better; can you make material improvement; and then, of course, can you get usage and consumption going. That leads to premium service usage. And of course, over time, you'd expect a higher mix of premium versus core.",173

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call.
As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting our results under the new revenue standard, ASC 606. As we detailed during a conference call we hosted on August 3, the adoption of this standard had several impacts but most materially, the revenue recognition of Windows 10 OEM licenses and the license component of on-premises annuity contracts.
As we discuss our Q1 results and share our outlook on the call, please keep in mind the following: first, the new standard allows us to simplify the communication of our results by eliminating the non-GAAP revenue reporting; second, there is no change in customer billings, cash flows or revenue recognition for our cloud services, hardware, Enterprise Services and advertising businesses; and lastly, the quarterly seasonality of our revenue within a given year does change, and we may experience higher quarterly volatility as well.
The prior periods we'll reference on this call and in the earnings materials on our IR website have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. During our August 3 call, we also translated our outlook for Q1 into the new standard, and all references to expectations on this call refer to that translated guidance. You can find additional information on this accounting change located on the IR website.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We'll also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. 
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 26, 2018.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",502

We're off to a very strong start in FY '18, delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth and exceeding $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR, outpacing the goal we set just over 2 years ago. I'm proud of our team's work behind these results that spanned all of our segments.
We now have 120 million monthly active users of Office 365 commercial. We have more than 530 million LinkedIn members. Dynamics 365 customers grew 40% year-over-year. Azure Compute usage more than doubled this quarter, and revenue grew 90%; and Windows 10 commercial monthly active devices grew 90% year-over-year.
These results reflect our accelerating innovation as well as increased usage and engagement across all businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform. Amy will cover our financial results in more detail, but today I wanted to talk about the key areas of innovation and opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond.
Our focus is on bringing our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that deliver new value for customers by galvanizing around 5 key solution areas: first, top of mind for every CEO is empowering their own employees for the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is our core offering to address this $500 billion-plus market. We are bringing together Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility and Security as a complete integrated solution for organizations of all sizes. It represents a profound shift in the way we design, build and deliver our productivity solutions, moving to a people-centered approach, spanning all their devices to unlock creativity and inspire teamwork, while simplifying security and management.
This past quarter, we launched a wave of innovation across Microsoft 365. The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update empowers people with new AI-first [ in phases ], ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content, storytelling and mixed reality experiences. Cloud sharing and co-authoring experiences are now natively enabled with OneDrive files on demand.
We are making Windows 10 more accessible to everyone with new features like the eye control, which gives people the ability to operate a PC using just their eyes. You'll see a great line-up of new Windows 10 devices this holiday, from the new Surface Book 2 to a vibrant range of devices from our OEM partners.
This month, we also introduced Windows mixed reality broadly. Mixed reality, which is a voice, gaze and gesture interface, will fundamentally change the way people and teams collaborate. Our work with Ford is a great example of this promise. Ford's designers are using mixed reality to blend 3D holograms digitally with models and physical production vehicles, allowing them to experiment and iterate on design much more quickly. HoloLens, Windows VR headsets and Microsoft 365 enable any customer to blend physical and digital worlds across devices, empowering people to collaborate in the same shared experience from anywhere in the world.
AI is infused across Microsoft 365 in a myriad of helpful ways, making it easier for people to create high-impact presentations and documents, automate routine tasks and search and discover people and content in highly personalized and relevant ways.
Beyond new AI capabilities in PowerPoint, Word, OneNote, SharePoint, we're enabling AI-first workloads like Bing and Cortana using the Microsoft Graph. Soon, you'll be able to search not only the public Internet but also corporate intranet sites, line of business applications and people with Bing for Business now in private preview. With Cortana, you'll be able to query your calendar and automate tasks like scheduling a meeting or replying to an e-mail using just your voice.
Microsoft Teams is core to our vision for the modern workplace as a digital hub for teamwork, bringing together conversations, meetings and content into a single canvas. We are integrating AI and cognitive services to make meetings more productive for users today and longer term.
Lastly, Microsoft 365 connects users, devices and SaaS applications into a single control plane to simplify IT management while providing comprehensive security across the entire digital estate. Today's sophisticated threats require AI-based security approaches. Using the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, we process billions of signals to detect and remediate threats. New conditional access capabilities evaluate risk in real-time based on the user's account, device and application and physical location. Our leading-edge security and management capabilities are just one reason customers trust Microsoft 365 for their modern workplace needs.
Now I'll turn to LinkedIn and our business applications. From the outset, the priority one was to ensure that LinkedIn, on its own, accelerate its mission and growth while retaining its culture as part of Microsoft. Nearly 1 year in, we are ahead of plan with LinkedIn contributing positively to EPS ex purchase accounting in fiscal '18.
Second, we're seeing record levels of engagement. LinkedIn is on target to surpass 21 billion sessions this calendar year and has seen its fourth consecutive quarter of 50%-plus sessions growth. Engagement across the platform is strong, with 65% year-over-year growth in jobs, visitors across mobile and desktop, 60% growth in feed update views and nearly 40% growth in messages sent, driven by more ubiquitous messaging.
Third, innovation and execution are accelerating in both the business and in the product integrations across Microsoft, with a positive reception to native video, career advice marketplace and this week's launch of smart reply messaging. LinkedIn profile integration in Office 365 delivers rich people insights from both the LinkedIn Graph and the Microsoft Graph.
The Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics to transform business-to-business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution to compete in the talent marketplace. You'll see more product integration in fiscal '18 as we continue to accelerate our innovation to connect the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network.
Now I'll turn to 2 areas of our hybrid cloud value proposition: applications and infrastructure and data and AI. We've been focused on addressing the real-world needs of customers with our differentiated approach to the cloud, architecting for hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance. Moreover, customers are choosing the Microsoft Cloud for its operational consistency, productivity and security that spans the entire digital estate, inclusive of Windows 10, security and management, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security and Azure.
Let's double click on hybrid. To support the emerging Intelligent Cloud, Intelligent Edge application pattern, you need a consistent stack across the public cloud and the edge. Merely providing co-location services or connectivity between on-premise data centers and the public cloud is not sufficient to meet customer needs. You need consistency across the development environment, operating models and technology stacks.
Azure provides this consistency across the entire stack, inclusive of identity, data, app platform, security and management -- at the edge and in the cloud. Our hybrid cloud is one of the reasons nearly every Fortune 500 company has chosen to partner with Microsoft. Costco recently chose Azure as its hybrid cloud platform, and we are excited to partner with them on their digital transformation.
Core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. Azure SQL DB makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premise data center to a fully managed instance in the cloud with no code changes. SQL 2017 is now broadly available on Windows, Linux, Docker containers with everything built in, including the ability to run AI compute close to the data with Python or R.
Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed multimodal database that enables developers to write apps for IoT and other event-based serverless applications. We're accelerating our innovation to help every developer be an AI developer with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple ML models to powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling in data science. We continue to enhance our cognitive services to give every enterprise powerful building blocks to create their own AI applications.
Finally, we continue to invest in making Azure the most trusted cloud with AI-based security built in. Azure confidential computing enables encryption of in-use data to ensure that information is always under customer control, a first for any public cloud. Our ongoing data center expansion brings Azure to 42 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider and 69 compliance offerings and the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. And new Azure availability zones provide new levels of resiliency for high-availability apps within a region and across regions.
Now let me turn to our last solution area: gaming. We are mobilizing to pursue our expansive opportunity in the $100 billion-plus gaming industry, broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We will continue to connect our gaming assets across PC, console and mobile and work to grow and engage the more than 53 million Xbox LIVE member network more deeply and frequently with new services like Game Pass and Mixer. And we are a few days away from launching the Xbox One X, the most technically advanced and powerful console ever built.
Moreover, we have high expectations for our gaming business to bring more people to more Microsoft experiences and broaden our engagement and usage scenarios. This means fundamentally rethinking how we measure progress in gaming. While we continue to innovate across the console, PC and Xbox LIVE services, we see substantial additional opportunities across e-sports and streaming. At 20% this quarter, our software and services revenue growth reflects the early-stage potential of this larger opportunity.
We also see the opportunity to empower developers who work on console, PC and mobile games to use our cloud infrastructure and services to enhance their gameplay and community. Gaming pushes the boundaries of hardware and software innovation, with some of the most CPU and GPU-intensive applications and content, giving us a huge opportunity in the cloud. As one example, PUBG Corp., with the hit game PlayerUnknown: Battlegrounds, is not only partnering to make Xbox the exclusive console at launch but is also running on Azure.
In closing, across the company, we are mobilizing to pursue our 5 core customer solution areas. We are partnering deeply with our customers so that our new technologies and innovations can help them digitally transform, grow and thrive.
Now I'll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.",1785
21835.0,"Microsoft Corporation, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Microsoft Corporation,3757.0,1325094.0,53199249.0,Presenter Speech,Amy Hood,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $24.5 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 15%, operating income increased 15% and earnings per share was $0.84, increasing 17%. Our strong start to the fiscal year with double-digit top and bottom line growth is a result of our consistent execution and ongoing investment in product innovation and sales capacity.
At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth and had a 4-point drag on operating income. Excluding the cost amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed $78 million to operating income. We are confidently ahead of our original financial commitment for LinkedIn. We now expect LinkedIn, ex purchase accounting, to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year. 
Our results were in line with macroeconomic trends, with better-than-expected performance from large markets like France, Japan and the U.K. and stabilization in markets like Brazil and Russia. Our sales team and partners delivered strong commercial results this quarter. Multiyear commitments from customers contributed to an 89% annuity mix. On a roughly flat dollar volume of EA expirations, we grew commercial bookings 14% and 9% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue came in higher than we expected at $21.5 billion, primarily from higher software assurance billings and FX benefit.
Our commercial cloud business had another quarter of robust revenue growth and material gross margin improvement. Revenue exceeded $5 billion this quarter, growing 56% year-over-year and gross margin increased 8 points to 57%, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably in Azure.
Our company gross margin was 66%, up 2 points from prior year as sales mix of higher-margin products and services, along with improving cloud margins, more than offset the impact of the growing cloud mix of revenue and LinkedIn amortization cost.
The FX impact of a weaker-than-expected U.S. dollar increased total company revenue growth by 1 point. At the segment level, FX had minimal impact on Productivity and Business Processes and increased revenue growth in both Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing by 1 point. FX added 1 point of growth to operating expenses this quarter, which grew 16% and 15% in constant currency. LinkedIn contributed 14 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangible expense.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 28%, also 28% in constant currency to $8.2 billion, with better-than-expected results due to FX as well as Office commercial, consumer and LinkedIn. LinkedIn contributed 18 points of growth.
Office commercial revenue increased 10% as revenue mix continued to shift to Office 365 commercial. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 42% from strong installed base growth and ARPU expansion. Companies like Lowe's and Devon Energy chose Office 365 to connect their employees and empower them in the modern workplace. And with our channel partners, we added, on average, more than 50,000 small and medium business customers each month, a trend we have sustained for more than 3 years.
Office 365 commercial seat growth was up 1 point sequentially to 32% and declined 8 points year-over-year. We do expect that year-over-year trend to continue, given the increasing size of the base. Office consumer revenue increased 12% or 10% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 28 million.
Our Dynamics business grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, driven by the revenue mix shift to Dynamics 365. Customers like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Seattle Seahawks, have adopted Dynamics 365 to modernize their business processes. Dynamics 365 grew 69%, same in constant currency with continued installed base and ARPU growth.
LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, a bit better than we expected. Post-acquisition sales execution has been strong, with record levels of user engagement. This quarter, LinkedIn sessions again grew more than 20%. Segment gross margin dollars grew 25% and 24% in constant currency with 15 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined due to the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization.
Operating expenses grew 54% and 53% in constant currency with 49 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with 10 points of negative impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion in revenue, growing 14% and 13% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance driven by hybrid cloud results as well as FX.
Server products and cloud services revenue grew 17%, also 17% in constant currency with another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue grew 90% and 89% in constant currency, and Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 13th consecutive quarter. Our unique ability to provide a distributed hybrid model for the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge continues to attract customers to Microsoft.
Symantec, the industry's largest security vendor, has adopted a company-wide hybrid strategy with Azure, including delivery of its Norton consumer products to a global community of more than 50 million people. And financial services firms like Bank of America, TD Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, are all using Azure and its data services to improve customer experiences.
Enterprise Services revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as premium support services growth offset declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars grew 10%, the same in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to the increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure's gross margin.
This quarter, operating expenses grew 3% or 2% in constant currency from ongoing investments in sales capacity and engineering. Operating income increased 20%, the same in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $9.4 billion with FX as well as each core business contributing to the segment's better-than-expected results. Excluding phone, revenue grew 3%, the same in constant currency. Both the commercial and the consumer PC markets were better than we expected, contributing to OEM revenue growth of 4%. OEM Pro revenue grew 7%, ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium SKUs and a couple points from timing of license purchases. We continue to see Windows 10 deployment cycles drive commercial customer hardware demand.
OEM non-Pro revenue was down 1%, in line with the consumer PC market and reflecting healthier conditions in key markets like Brazil and Russia. Inventory levels were in the normal range for a preholiday quarter. Windows commercial products and services grew 7% and 6% in constant currency, mainly driven by seat growth. We continue to see enterprise customer momentum with Coca-Cola Company, Her Majesty Revenue and Customs and Rogers Communications choosing Windows 10 for its intelligent security features and advanced management capabilities.
Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily due to onetime impact of IP deals signed in the prior year. Search revenue ex TAC grew 15%, the same in constant currency from higher revenue per search and stronger-than-expected performance from volume. Our online businesses showed healthy improvement in revenue growth and profitability as we realized the benefits of scale.
Our Surface business grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, driven by sales of the new Surface Laptop in both the commercial and consumer segments. We continued to see solid execution through the product life cycle transition between Pro 4 and our new devices.
Gaming revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as Xbox software and services growth offset declines in hardware. Software and services revenue grew 21% or 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in monetization. Our engaged user base grew 13% to 53 million monthly active users across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms. Additionally, new services like Game Pass and Mixer, which create more opportunity for engagement and monetization, showed encouraging early results.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 10%. Gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to sales mix shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 1% or 2% in constant currency from lower Windows and gaming marketing spend and our last full quarter of significant benefit from Phone savings. Operating income grew 26%, the same in constant currency.
Now back to our overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $2.7 billion in capital expenditures, including finance leases, down sequentially and lower-than-originally planned, mainly due to quarter-to-quarter volatility. Cash paid for property and equipment was approximately $2.1 billion. Our significant capital investment continues based on customer demand and usage signal, and the teams remain focused on gross margin improvement as they deploy services globally to meet that demand signal.
Free cash flow grew 10% from operating cash flow growth of 8%. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had $1.3 billion in unsettled cash equivalent positions that reversed the following quarter. Excluding this amount, free cash flow increased 27% from higher customer collections following strong billings growth and working capital improvement in the hardware business, primarily driven by our exit in the phone business.
Other income and expense was $276 million, a little more than planned as we continued to see opportunities in the equity market to realize gains throughout the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 18%, 1 point lower than we expected, primarily due to geographic mix of revenue. This quarter, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now let's turn to the Q2 outlook. First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 1 point, COGS growth by 1 point and OpEx growth by 2 points. Our commercial business should remain healthy, with solid renewal execution and increasing customer demand for our hybrid cloud services and new cloud solutions like Microsoft 365.
Turning to commercial bookings. As you know, the underlying dollar volume of EA expirations impacts commercial bookings growth. For the full year, total expirations will be up slightly, but Q2 expiration dollar volume will be down roughly 20%, impacting our Q2 commercial bookings growth. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 7% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality.
We remain committed to material improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage. Margin performance is variable quarter-to-quarter, driven by revenue mix and seasonality as well as the timing of infrastructure spend. We expect continued year-over-year margin improvement and sequential trends consistent with prior years.
Next to CapEx. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. And on accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.75 billion and $8.95 billion. Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the transactional decline. We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business, given the prior year comparable. In Dynamics, we expect continued double-digit revenue growth, driven by the shift to Dynamics 365. And we expect approximately $1.2 billion of LinkedIn revenue, reflecting continued strong sales execution by the team.
Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.55 billion, with another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. As a reminder, starting in Q2 of last year, the launch of Windows Server 2016 drove strong on-premises performance, resulting in 6% constant currency growth for server products. This comparable will impact the segment year-over-year growth rate.
We expect enterprise services revenue growth to be similar to last quarter, driven by premier support services offsetting declines in custom support agreements. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $11.7 billion to $12.1 billion. 
First on Windows. OEM revenue should track roughly in line with the overall PC market. Specifically, OEM Pro revenue growth should be more aligned to the commercial PC market, normalizing for a couple of points of growth from the timing of licensing purchasing in the first quarter.
Next, devices. In Surface, we expect revenue to be up slightly from Q1 as we continue to transition to the new Surface Pro, ramp Surface Laptop and launch the Surface Book 2. Also in November of last year, we closed the sale of our feature phone business, so this will be the final quarter of revenue comparability impacted by the phone. We expect double-digit revenue growth in search ex TAC, reflecting continued strong performance in both rate and volume.
And finally, gaming. We expect revenue growth from the launch of the Xbox One console and continued healthy growth of software and services revenue. In Q2, the higher mix of gaming hardware revenue will significantly impact both the segment and company gross margin percentages. We expect COGS between $11 billion and $11.2 billion, in the normal range for a holiday quarter with new device launches and including 1 point of FX headwind. This includes approximately $400 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization expense.
We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, which includes 2 points of FX headwind. This includes $1.1 billion of LinkedIn expenses, of which $154 million is related to amortization. Other income and expense should be approximately $450 million as we continued to take gains in our equities portfolio; and we expect this pace to continue until the end of the fiscal year.
Now let me share some additional comments on fiscal '18, given our strong first quarter results, our business momentum and the changing currency landscape. First on FX. For the full year at current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue, COGS and OpEx growth at the company level by 1 point. Therefore, we now expect full year operating expense growth, excluding LinkedIn, to be between 4% and 5%. This is unchanged from our prior outlook except for the updated FX impact.
Second on margins. With our strong Q1 results and the FX impacts I just outlined, we are trending a bit better on both gross and operating margin relative to our original full year outlook of down roughly 1 point each. We now expect operating margin ex LinkedIn, to be up year-over-year even as we increase investment to support long-term top line growth in commercial cloud, AI, mixed reality, quantum, new hardware launches and the continued transformation of our sales team.
Third, tax rate. We're updating our full year tax rate to 22%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability due to the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and timing of equity vest and expect next quarter's tax rate to come in at the midpoint of that full year range.

We've been seeing Intelligent Cloud growing very well for quite some time, Azure sustaining very, very impressive growth rates, but even the server and tools business sustaining growth. When we think about the drivers of that growth, is this just continued share gains by Microsoft enabling you guys to outgrow the market? Or have you started to see stuff like AI and all these additional cognitive services that you bring to the market actually accelerating workload growth within your customers? You're actually like building new market opportunity for yourself with these additional services.",98

I would say, all of the above. One of the things that we started always, we always believed in distributed computing, and we've built for that -- so when we say hybrid, we never thought of it as some kind of a temporary state, but we always thought the edge and the cloud was going to be where the application pattern was in fact going to get to. In fact, I'm very excited about some of the new workloads. If I look at whether it's IoT or AI, the 2 workloads that are new, both of them require both computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation, which is as event-driven computation. So we feel good about new workload growth. We feel good about this lift, shift, modernize motions that are happening. We feel that we're well positioned for both meeting today's realities of our enterprise customers but most importantly, where on a secular basis, I believe, hybrid computing is going, which is to this architectural pattern of Intelligent Cloud, Intelligent Edge.",184

You guys mentioned on the call that premium services grew triple digits for the 13th quarter in a row. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how to think about the percentage of workloads that are now running premium services as a percentage of the total. And/or is there -- are we at the point now where that's a high enough percentage of the mix that we're at a tipping point here, where what seems like very significant gross margin progression is going to continue at this similar clip?",101

The premium services, for example, the way we think about them is in everything related to our data is -- and especially the higher level databases. I'm not talking about raw storage, but this is Cosmos DB or Azure DB or any of the data services, our IoT services, our AI services are all the premium services. And there is a path. Every customer sometimes just starts with Infrastructure as a Service and some storage. And then the lift, shift turns into lift, shift and modernize and that's where these premium services get activated. So they definitely are margin accretive for us, but most importantly, they add a tremendous amount of value to the customers. And I'll let Amy add any additional color to that.",137

There are really, when you think about it, 3. The first one's just pure revenue scale. We've done such a terrific job, I think, of growing and focusing and the innovation we put in and having our sales teams, through investments we've made for the past couple of years, and competency building land that at customers. The second component and the one you'd asked about is a little bit about that premium services revenue mix. And you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin. In addition to the workload Satya mentioned, I also bring up EMF. EMF continues to be, I think, an incredible value to customers. And I think we've done a very good job of pointing out its competitive advantages, and we're seeing that also benefit margins. And finally, just a strong work on the infrastructure team, both between hardware innovation done at everything from the network, all the way to the [ products ] and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of it. Those things together, with premium being a component of that, are all lending itself to gross margin improvement.",225

But within Office, you've got several secular trends as well as just mix shift going on there just from a price point perspective as well as the gross margin between the different levels of E1, E3, E5. So wondering if you can give us some color on what we're seeing there because obviously, there is healthy seat growth, revenues outpacing and it seems like margins are as well. So just [ rise ] more color on sort of what we've been seeing an kind of how you think about that trending going forward.",117

One of the new suites we have is called F1 and this is about first-line work. So Office is no longer limited just to the knowledge workers. In fact, we see significant opportunity for some of our teamwork, collaboration, communications as well as scheduling software to be very, very relevant for anyone who is on the manufacturing plant or a retail specialist. Some of our social tools like llama are increasingly getting used for broad communications, inclusive of Skype for Teams. So I just wanted to put that in there as well as the -- there is, of course, E3. There is E3 to E5. But there is also F1, which is increasing the overall penetration. And not to mention the small business segment. And of course, all the markets that we participate in with Office 365 where we don't have much of a server business at all. We sold Office on-premise or Office perpetual clients. But now you can have a small business in a country like India buy Office 365 as a subscription service. So those are all the things that are in play.",228

I think sometimes, on this call particularly, we talked about there's installed base growth and there's ARPU increases. Sitting underneath that is this very large $120 million (sic) [ 120 million ] monthly active users in commercial. And they're experiencing frankly the latest innovations that the company has built. So I look and say, seeing growth in that number allows us to actually grow the ARPU, and the new services that Satya mentioned continues to let us grow the installed base. Innovations around Teams, innovations in AI in the actual Office products themselves are now being experienced by our customers. I think when you have that happen, over time, it builds confidence in the product and it builds confidence in end user, confidence in it itself. And then purchasers are happy to continue to add SKUs and add and move up the scale. We -- still, this is primarily the ARPU growth, continues to be some of the early -- earlier transitions we've always talked about, is that E3 transition as well as installed base growth. E5 continues to see encouraging signs, starting to see it enter but that will take a long time as we talked about to actually land in ARPU.",219

Amy, just a general sort of corporate-wide question on gross margins. Your revenue and COGS guide, if I ran the math correctly, imply about 60% gross margins for the December quarter. So that's going to be down year-over-year and I suspect below some of the street estimates, but it sounds like your tone is a little bit better for gross margins for the full year. So I just want to make sure I leave the call understanding what's happening here is the conclusion that 2Q is somewhat of a one-off, given the uptick in lower-margin hardware and thereafter will return to a more normal year-over-year pattern on gross margins.",114

Actually, this is really all the gaming Xbox One console launch. It's very specific. And so every other gross margin trend across IC, across PDP and across the rest of the MPC portfolio exhibits the exact same fundamental drivers and improvement.

Just looking at the -- trying to figure out the dependency of your Azure growth this year on your -- on the volume of annuity up for renewal. I know last year, you had very, very strong growth in annuity on that renewal cycle, and you're talking about some pressure in the Q2 and then slightly uptrend for the year. But how dependent is Azure growth in customers attaching that to the volume of annuity up?",83

There is just an expiration base that comes up every quarter and there's volatility to it. So the way to think about it is, over the year, it's up a little, and in Q2, it happens to be just a low quarter of the 12 that come up through the cycle, much like Q4 was quite large in the cycle. And Azure actually falls a couple of patterns. It's not just about EA attach, although it absolutely can be one of the motions. Because it tends to be project-based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity and the reason we did some of the sales transformation was to invest a lot more in that project-led motion, which is a bit disconnected actually from the EA renewal cycles and you've really seen that. The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago as we both, I think, matured the product and matured our sales cycles.",187

Kirk Materne,,Analysts,23,"Satya, yesterday, you were down at the GE event and announcing the partnership with them around Predix. And I was wondering, when we think about the opportunities for Azure to be that sort of trusted platform for ISVs, can you just talk about how you think the progress is going on that front because it seems to obviously just expand your overall TAM and the kind of use cases you can address by your bringing partners like GE onto your platform?",81

Overall, I think you sort of speak to, I think, one of the big advantages and one of the big value propositions we have on both sides. One is to the enterprise customer, we are a trusted partner. And we support them with their hybrid computing needs and their AI needs. One of the things that we emphasize is it's not about our technology but it's our ability to transfer that capability to our customer because they're increasingly becoming, whether you're in retail or you're in oil and gas or you're in financial services, every one of them is trying to build their own software capability and we're uniquely capable of doing so. The second part is the ISVs. We now, in fact, one of the big areas of investment this year was the co-sell capacity in our field so that ISVs can be successful on our platform. Whether it is GE or Adobe and many others can all now benefit both because of our enterprise partnership and credibility and more importantly, because of the field resources we have put in place. So we are really looking forward to accelerating our business with GE and many others to come. But it's a very important co-sell motion and, more importantly, building trust on both sides of that equation.",223

The way we designed Dynamics 365 both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things, whether it's CRM or ERP or SEM. Because we realized that, for example, you take any IoT project that is starting in Azure, it first translates into an analytics workload that pulls through some Azure high router analytics services. And then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance, you need field service. And all they need is just a very robust field service module that's cost-effective and efficient. And so we're able to attach that to that project. Similarly, on talent, they want to be able to -- if you start on LinkedIn with hiring, you want to be able to do the onboarding and talent management. That's the module you want. Even on the operations side, we are realizing that even if you keep your financials the same, there is need -- with increasing digitization, there is more operational modules that you need. So that's what we have designed it for. So the growth is actually across the board. It's coming in customer service, it's coming in sales, it's coming in talent, it's coming in operations. And we have some very competitive price points there. The other one is that there is no such thing as a canonical business. There is no such thing as a canonical business in time. That means things are always changing. So customization, customization and composition, especially with Office 365, is very important, and this is where we have some very differentiated offer with Power BI, Power Apps and Flow. And that's another big driver of some of that growth across our enterprise customers.",306

But really since we've launched, the question that I get, by far, the most is around the long-term margin potential in Azure. And with the gross margins being as good as they were this quarter, without giving us long-term guidance, is there any reason to believe that the long-term operating margins in Azure couldn't be -- we just saw AWS put up a mid-20s operating margin. Is there anything structural to -- that would lead us to believe that you couldn't do something in that range? Or how should we think about the long-term framework to that business?",122

The one thing I'd say is -- when I think about the long-term margin, I actually think of the long-term margin across our cloud. I mean, when we even make our CapEx decisions, which is one of the drivers of margin, we think of -- first of all, first party equals third party. A lot of what we do even in Windows, most people don't recognize, but one of the most important services we run is Windows Update as a cloud service. And so we have a lot of value that is across-the-board cloud services, whether it's Xbox LIVE, Windows Update, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and of course, all of the Azure services. And we want to build scale across all of them. And so we would not -- in fact, we will be very aggressive in taking margin in one place, which is different as we see a path to margin in a different spot. That's something that we want to make sure we follow more, our opportunity in a customer across the board versus trying to micromanage to certain margins in very specific opportunities because we think that it's the integrated ability for us to deliver value is -- which I think long term, is what customers expect of Microsoft.",216

And our ability to blend them into interesting products that solve customer solutions, which may not even be priced as the component parts is, I think, how we think about, especially in our solution areas that Satya talks about, how we talk about delivering it to a customer. So while I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow the core margin, I do think for us in particular, it really is a portfolio that we believe that we need to manage appropriately.",117

Given the even larger focus you're putting on this segment in the near term, how quickly or in what time frame do you think gaming revenue could grow at or above the average gaming industry growth rate of mid- to high single digits? And I know you don't break out segment margins, but could you give us a sense of how you think about gaming from a normalized contribution margin perspective relative to MPC and your overall company-wide margins, excluding the onetime Xbox launch effects?",92

I would say, from a gaming perspective, one of the bigger changes that has happened in the last, I would say, couple of years is one, of course, the vibrancy of the Xbox LIVE network across the PC and the console and now increasingly even on the phone because of titles like Minecraft. And once you have the network, you have plenty of different opportunities. In particular, we now have a subscription offer with Game Pass that's off to a very good start, and our goal is to be able to have essentially a Netflix for games so that we can have the game subscriptions that people can use across all of the devices they play in. The other area is streaming. As you know, there is gameplaying and game watching and there is secular growth on both fronts. And we feel very, very good about the engagement increases in a pretty unique value proposition we have in Mixer. So that's another opportunity that we believe will shape in addition to things like e-sports and so on. So it's the totality of that. And one of the numbers that I did put in my script was that 20% growth in what we call software and services, that's perhaps a leading indicator of where we think the opportunity lies. These are early days for us, but that said, that's probably one of the key numbers to watch as we make progress and execute.",246

Even this quarter is a great example. There was material improvement in gross margin in that segment, and a lot of that was actually due to the higher margins that we have structurally in that software and services revenue from Xbox. And as I believe the industry that Satya is talking about pivots to be more about the engagement and monetization of that member network, you can expect that margin profile as well of our traditional, more hardware-focused Xbox to evolve, to be a real combination of those 2 things going forward. And structurally, that would, of course, have higher operating margins.",117

Can you talk to that? Is that something that just I picked up or is that what you're seeing in your customer relation -- in your conversations as well?",72

But we have -- so we do have a very different dialogue. If I -- if you think about it, all of the customers that we have worked with, we have always worked with them historically even in our server days. But to your point, Raimo, I think what has happened is the change, even in the financial services, the segments that you all represent, the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed. In the past, we participated but a lot of Tier 1 workloads were not on Microsoft stack, whereas now, a lot of Tier 1 workloads are, in fact, increasingly on Microsoft Cloud. And so to me, that represents a qualitative change, and so the type of dialogue we have, whether it's with an auto company or a financial services company or a retail company, is much deeper, much broader. And I would use the word, we are deeply partnering with them. It's no longer just simple vendor relationships because as they are trying to build their own software capability, they need a trusted partner who's more interested in making sure that they build their own technology capability. And that's what we're investing in.",213

The investments we've made over the past years are about hiring the type of talent that can go and sit with a customer and drive the customer's successful outcomes of the projects they deploy. And that's what we mean. It's about the investment we've made in capability, the evolution of the product and its innovation, and I think using and trying to continue to earn the customer for us to deliver these world-class workloads. So I do think this is really an output of multiple years of concentration on delivering that capability.",122

And as you said, Adobe and Microsoft have partnered, in fact, across our entire histories in many of the areas, but increasingly across of the creative cloud and their Document Cloud as well as their Experience Cloud, we have plenty going on. In fact, we are very excited about what we are doing with our devices and Adobe and with Windows because I think Windows and Windows 10 Creators Update is the ideal platform for all of the creators in the world because of the innovation in Windows and the innovation in devices, both Surface Book as well as our OEM devices. So that's one area that I think you will see. I would love if you're an illustrator or a Photoshop user, you should just check out the dial support that they have in Surface, which just is beautiful. And then you go to Office 365. We have a partnership with them on e-signatures. We have good interoperability between our respective document clouds. That will, in fact, continue. And then on the creative side or on the experience side, in fact, we are adding a lot of data and AI capability, which is obviously key to Adobe as an ISV. So we're looking forward to the -- ultimately the impact all this has with customers in terms of their ability to take advantage of our respective value and for them to be able to benefit from it all. And so these kinds of partnerships, whether it's with Adobe or others, we are very focused on making sure that ISVs and partners have success on our platforms. And that's sort of our core heritage, and that's something that we want to absolutely focus on.",293
