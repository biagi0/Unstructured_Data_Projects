The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a great year. We began 2014 expecting roughly flat year-over-year revenue and operating income. Instead, the company's full year revenue grew 6%, setting an all-time record of $55.9 billion. At the same time, operating income rose 25%. 
When I became CEO, I set 2 imperatives for the company: first, develop a more outside-in view of markets to ensure we go to where the markets are headed; and second, increase our velocity, both pace and innovation, in a purposeful direction. Over the last year, we've made meaningful progress against these imperatives, which helped us meet and exceed many of our top goals. I'd like to take a moment to review the year.
In the PC Client Group, our goal was to stabilize the PC business. We expected revenue to be down by a low single-digit percentage and for operating profit to be roughly flat year-over-year. Instead, the year closed with a 4% increase in revenue and a 25% increase in operating profit. Our focus on reinventing the computing experience and leaving no segment unserved, from the low end to the high end, contributed to these results. 
We launched Broadwell, the world's first 14-nanometer manufacturing process. While we did have some startup challenges that contributed to roughly 6-month delay, yields have steadily improved. The end result is a family of Core M and fifth-generation Core processors that are the foundation for the industry's most compelling new designs. These designs include the thinnest, lightest, most energy-efficient notebooks, 2-in-1s, Ultrabooks, Chromebooks and mini PCs.
We began the year with high expectations for the Data Center Group. We said we would capitalize on the growth of the cloud and Big Data by diversifying customer segments and product leadership. We initially forecasted revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, with operating profit growing faster than revenue. We exceeded those high expectations and grew revenue 18% while operating profit expanded by a remarkable 31%. 
In the Mobile and Communications Group, we set a goal to ship into 40 million tablets in 2014. This goal is intended to establish Intel architecture in the marketplace and scale the supply chain and attract developers. I'm pleased to report that we shipped into 46 million tablets, becoming one of the industry's largest merchant silicon providers in tablets. We also began shipping our second-generation LTE baseband known as 7260. 
We're proud that the company reached these milestones, though we have more work ahead of us. A key goal for mobility is to improve profitability. To that end, we just qualified the first SoC in our SoFIA lineup. SoFIA is a low-cost integrated applications processor and baseband chip. As it ramps, it will progressively reduce the bill of material costs that have adversely affected our gross margins in the Mobile business.  We also struck landmark agreements with Rockchip and Spreadtrum to expand the development and distribution of IA products for phones and satellites.
Similarly, we grew other adjacent businesses by using IP from our core products. For example, our Internet of Things Group grew 19% in 2014, passing the $2 billion mark for the first time. The recently launched RealSense 3D camera technology is another examples of extending our own IP. RealSense is redefining imaging in a variety of computing devices. It's also making its way into all sorts of new and unanticipated applications, highlighting the value of taking an outside-in view, investing ahead of churn and shaping nascent technology. 
Finally, you see us moving quickly into wearables through our growing portfolio of collaborations with world-class fashion and fitness brands like Fossil, Oakley, Opening Ceremony and SMS Audio, along with our own products like the Basis Peak and the Curie module, a computer the size of a button. 
Intel is in a very different place today than we were just 12 months ago. We are participating in a broader range of devices, but we are innovating in emerging segments. These are the trends we will build on in 2015, bringing us closer to our vision that if it's smart and connected, it is best with Intel. Our work isn't done, but our progress against our imperatives leaves us increasingly confident in our strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",710

To reiterate what Brian said, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year. Revenue of $14.7 billion was a record for the company and was up 6% from the prior year. The strength of our product portfolio can be seen in our gross margin of over 65% and in our profitability. Operating income grew 25%. And earnings per share, which also benefited from the passage of the R&D tax credit, grew 45% from a year ago. 
From a market perspective, we saw nice unit and revenue growth in the PC Client Group segment, with revenue up 3% and operating profit up 18% on a year-over-year basis.
The Data Center Group benefited from the build-out of the cloud, data analytics and our strong product portfolio. This business achieved 25% revenue growth and 39% profit growth year-over-year. The company saw a modest increase in net inventory levels quarter-over-quarter as we are efficiently managing capacity while ramping Broadwell in 14-nanometer. And the worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate as we enter the first quarter. These results for the fourth quarter completed a strong year for Intel. 
Recapping the 2014 financials. For full year 2014, revenue of $55.9 billion was up 6%, operating income of $15.3 billion was up 25%; and earnings per share of $2.31 was up 22% from 2013. Gross margin of approximately 64% in 2014 is up about 4 points from 2013. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $19.7 billion in 2014, up $1 billion from 2013, driven primarily by increased R&D spending and higher profit-dependent spending. 
In 2014, both our PC business and our Data Center business outperformed our expectations at the start of the year. PC Client Group revenue grew by 4%. We saw PC Client Group platform volumes grow 8% from a year ago, and inclusive of tablets, we saw 18% unit growth. Operating profit for the PC Client Group segment was up 25% over the same horizon. 
We saw robust growth in our Data Center business, with 8% unit growth leading to 18% revenue growth from 2013 and operating profit growth of 31%. Additionally, in comparison to 2013, The Internet of Things segment achieved revenue growth of 19%. The Software and Services operating segment was up slightly. Our NAND business grew at a fast pace. And although revenue was down for the Mobile and Communications Group, we grew share in tablets.
The business continued to generate significant cash, with $20.4 billion of cash from operations in 2014. Total cash balance at the end of the year was roughly $14.1 billion, down approximately $6 billion from a year ago. We purchased $10.1 billion in capital assets, down from our prior outlook of $11 billion as we found efficiencies, optimized the manufacturing network and increased our factory utilization.  
In addition, we paid $4.4 billion in dividends. In November, we announced a dividend increase to $0.96 per share on an annual basis, effective for the first quarter of 2015. We repurchased about $10.8 billion of stock in 2014, up from $2.1 billion in 2013. 
Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $340 million and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is more than $4 billion. This is down by over $5.5 billion from the start of the year.
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, down about 7% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. 
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 60%, plus or minus a couple of points. Consistent with the business drivers discussed in the November Investor Meeting, the 5-point decline from the fourth quarter is primarily driven by higher platform unit costs on 14-nanometer products, higher factory start-up costs and lower platform volumes.
Turning to full year 2015, we're planning for revenues to grow in the mid-single digits. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 62%, plus or minus a couple of points. We are forecasting R&D and MG&A spending for the year at $20 billion, plus or minus $400 million. And we are forecasting capital spending of $10 billion, plus or minus $500 million.
2014 was a great year, and the financials demonstrate our strategy in action as we enter 2015. First, we are growing again across a broad range of products and markets. Second, we continue to invest in our core competitive advantages of leadership IP and leadership manufacturing. These competitive advantages are becoming increasingly valuable and increasingly rare. Third, we are in a great position to benefit from the build-out of the cloud and data analytics as we enter 2015, and we expect these trends to drive growth again this year. Then last, we continue to execute our strategy of both investing in our business and also generating return for our shareholders via the dividend and the buyback.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",853

Can you just talk about, I guess for Stacy, the trend in gross margins after Q1? And embedded in that, do you think that the second half '15 gross margins can be equal to the second half of '14 gross margins? And for this year, assuming something close to normal, can we assume gross margins would be up in 2016 on an apples-to-apples basis?",73
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3273.0,746584.0,32721393.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,7,"This is Stacy. Yes I am -- I'll just start by saying I'm not going to forecast 2016 gross margins in January of '15. We will probably talk about those in November. So you're getting a little ahead of me. In terms of what's happening in the gross margin, it's very consistent with what we talked about in the November Investor Meeting. And to specifically answer your question, yes, I expect that the second half gross margins will be back above the midpoint. We forecasted 62% for the year. We're at 60% in Q1. I think the second half will be above that midpoint; the first half will be below. This is all what I told you in November. The big drivers for us here are 14-nanometer. As 14-nanometer becomes a larger mix of our products, we're mixing up in terms of our costs. That is higher than normal in the beginning of the year, and then it will come down and catch up to prior technologies by the time we get to the back half. We have some increase in start-up costs. And then, we'll get some good news associated with getting back some of the impact associated with tablets. So we get back about half of the impact from 2014 into 2015. In terms of whether that will match the back half of 2014, I'd say the only thing that I'd point to is 2015 is a year where we have start-up costs. So that's going to be in overhang through the year, and you know our cadence kind of every other year. So probably adjusted for that, we're going to be in the same kind of range.",280

So Brian, I guess, we're still losing a little more than 1 billion a quarter, but you said that those losses will go down. Any color you can provide on that? Anything you can give us in terms of your overall goals or goals for the Mobile business this year, either in units or profitability, or anything else there?",74
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3273.0,746584.0,32721395.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,9,"Sure. Sure Chris. So what we said for 2015, so if you remember, step back in 2014, we said, look, we have to go out and establish our footprint here. We have to get ourselves known in this market, be considered a serious player and get the developers attracted, both the hardware and software developers, interested in our IA. And so that's we went out and set a goal, a unit-level goal, so they knew we were serious. And we brought parts of that were not necessarily designed for this segment, and that's where the BOM costs delta came from. For 2015, we feel like we've done a very nice job now of establishing ourselves as one of the top producers of silicon in this segment. And our goal right now is from a unit perspective, is we think we can just grow roughly at what the market will grow for tablets. So we don't need to go out and necessarily outpace the market or anything like that for this year from a growth perspective. Instead, we're going to focus on 2 segments, and that is one, as you just said, getting our cost profiles down, making it so that we're much more cost-effective, and as a result, getting the loss out. Stacy and I committed to drive $800 million out of this business for '15. We believe we have a solid plan to go do that. That's based on a couple of things. One, part of this reorganization was to drive efficiency, to get the consistency across the platform, to be utilized and to get the efficiency of people, of hardware, of software, of all of that. The other one is as we move into the second half of this year, especially SoFIA, which we said was designed for this segment and has no BOM adder or difference, really starts to ramp. And you saw we've already internally qualified our first SoFIA, the 3G version. We said the next version, the LTE version, would be in the first half of next year, and they'll ramp through the year. So as those come in, they take a lot of that cost delta out. And that's where we are feeling fairly good about the $800 million. The other place, you saw the Dell Venue 8 7000 as a great example. It won Best of Innovation at CES and Best of Show at CES. And it's showing the thinnest tablet with real innovation at a $399 price where people can start to make money in the tablet space a little bit now again. And so we think the combination of right products plus real innovation like that will allow us to make real progress.",452

And DSOs, looked like they're pretty elevated relative to the levels we've seen the last couple of years. Could you kind of explain what was going on there with the receivables?",47

It actually -- I think DSOs still are in a healthy range. But the timing -- the quarter was a little bit more back-end loaded than Q3 was, and so we ended the quarter with more receivables. It was as simple as that. We started with -- we didn't have a terribly strong October, and the quarter strengthened as we went through.",63

And then, just looking at linearity for DCG given you got a new product family. We've got an operating system from Microsoft that's going to be expiring this year. Could you give us any color on how we should expect linearity on a quarterly basis for DCG this year, if it will be any different than what we've seen in the past?",64
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3273.0,746584.0,32721400.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,14,"So, yes. I think we always caution you. The PC market, I think we have data that says it behaves roughly seasonal. With DCG, you have to be careful because you have 5 to 10 very large cloud customers that, based on their buying patterns, can really change the quarter-to-quarter trend. So I tend to hesitate to tie too much to seasonal in DCG. When you look at the results over the course of 2014, it was robust unit growth, that was great revenue growth, 18% revenue growth. And as we said in the Investor Meeting, we think that the underlying trends that are driving that continue to '15, and we put a forecast out there that said in excess of 15% growth, that's what we still think.",128

Based on the drivers that you laid out, should we then expect that the recovery in the operating losses should be more back-end loaded? And then, you mentioned that tablets you expect to grow with the end market. And most -- and least I'll speak for myself, we expect almost no growth. So is that how you guys are thinking about the tablet market? And then, I had a quick follow-up for you, Stacy.",87
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3273.0,746584.0,32721403.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,17,"Sure. So let me give you the -- how we view the market. And then, I'll let Stacy talk about how the $800 million is laid out through the year. And then you can talk about the margins, too. I've seen forecasts that are at or near 0, as you say. I've seen forecasts that are a slight decline. I've seen forecasts that have, I'll say, 10 to low teen growth on tablets. And it's kind of varied as the fourth quarter went through even. So that's why we've kind of said we'll grow at the rate that the market does. I don't think I want to necessarily shrink. So unless the market shrinks significantly, I think we will then probably try and target more of a flattish. But in general, I think saying that we're going to grow our market tells you I'm not going to try and outgrow the market is the message I'm trying to send. And whether it's minus 5, 0, or plus 5 to 10, I call all of that kind of flattish to growing with the market.",183

And on the linearity of the $800 million improvement, there's really, at the highest level, 3 things that are improving our profitability this year. So first is bringing SoFIA into the product mix. That helps us both from the standpoint of the SoC costs that SoFIA has and the contra revenue dollars associated with the bill of material offset that we've been providing, which we don't plan to provide with SoFIA. That is back-end loaded. We're bringing SoFIA into the product family kind of as we speak. But it becomes really significant volume for us when we get into the back half. The second one is the ramp of LTE to offset some of the investments we've been making there. That ramp is underway now, but I would expect the back half volume to be higher than the first half. That also is a little bit more back-end loaded. And then, the third is, as you said, we're shifting the investment profile, and that's more linear across the year. So those are the 3 items, and 2 of those 3 does put more of the improvement in the back half.",191

And my quick follow-up for you, Stacy, is on the capital allocation side. Last couple of quarters, you did a great job, bought back a lot of stock. But now, if I look at the onshore versus offshore on the balance sheet, there's just a $2 billion delta. Could you remind us, in terms of the cash flow generated, how much is onshore versus offshore, and then, the ramifications for stock buyback?",73

It varies year-by-year, depending on where we're -- remember, we actually invest in factories around the world. So a lot of the onshore versus offshore will vary based on where we're starting up factories. But the majority of our cash generation is in the U.S. We do generate a lot of cash, and we certainly have the ability to use that for any corporate purposes including a buyback.",69

Anything significant there? Or are you just able to find a little bit of ability to save some money?",31
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3273.0,746584.0,32721409.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,23,"Yes, I would term it as a fairly significant reduction in CapEx for '14, and we brought down -- we brought the CapEx for '15 down to the bottom of the range. And it's a variety of things. When I look at the savings we had in '14, about half of it was due to, I call it, basic blocking and tackling. We were able to negotiate some lower pricing. We had some non-capacity-related projects that we're able to push out of the year. And we're always looking for those opportunities, and I think the manufacturing organization did a great job of finding them. And then about half of it is as we progressed over the course of 2014, we learned a couple of things. One is our confidence in yields and our yield forecast went up. That's what we showed be in the November Investor Meeting. Secondly, the manufacturing organization demonstrated the ability to start up factories more quickly than we had assumed at the beginning of the year, and the combination of that allowed us to shift out the third HVM 14-nanometer factory that starts up now kind of mid-'15 out by 2 to 3 months. And that doesn't sound like a lot. But given how capital-intensive those factories are, that actually gives us a much more capital-efficient ramp, and we're able to generate some savings as a result of it.",233

And as a follow-up, Brian, can you just, on the highest level maybe give us a sense of how you think the PC market stands today entering 2015 compared to how it was entering 2014? Some of the ODM data would suggest we exited 2014 a little weaker, but that may just be a function of that weak October that Stacy had mentioned in terms of linearity and things. Maybe it really is more similar than we thought even though the quarterly data isn't quite as good in '14 as it was in '13. But maybe if you could offer your perspective there.",106

So I'm not sure of all your statistics you threw out there, Jim, but let me just give you kind of our view of the PC market. I think when we look at Q4 and then, again as you look at '14 overall, it was a very strong -- it played out exactly as we forecasted and predicted. Q4 ended up being very much a seasonal quarter. We saw demand in the more mature markets stronger, especially on the consumer side than in the emerging markets. And as Stacy mentioned, our inventories as we exited Q4, we're very comfortable with where the inventories are. So remember as we entered -- exited Q3 and kind of entered Q4, there might have been -- there was some concern, there might have been a little inventory. We feel like we burned that off through the system. Especially, a lot of that was down at the low end.  And as we exited Q4, we're very comfortable with the inventory. For me, as I look out into now '15, I look at it and say, ""Okay, we've got Core M, which has just really hit the market as we entered into the holiday season. We saw great thin, fanless 2-in-1 devices at all price points that I believe will stimulate usage there. We've got the Broadwell U, which is the first of really the high-volume Broadwells just hitting the market. We've got something, a dozen systems in Q1 that will be coming out on Broadwell. You saw us introduce RealSense at CES. We have I think 7 or 8 systems in the first quarter coming out with RealSense in that combination. So I look at the amount of innovation, all of the OSs we're on and the availability and the optionality a consumer has for OS or an enterprise and the price points. You've got PCs from Chromebook down to $199, Windows systems, $249, all the way up from there, to the real innovative systems like Sprout. I look at it and say the innovation and the options of the PC market have never been better. So I'm feeling pretty good about where we are in the PC market. If you remember, our forecast is based even still on flat units and a slight decrease in ASP. So we're still, even though I've told you there's always [ph] innovation and there's that, we've still been relatively conservative and said it's flat unit year and a slight decline even in ASPs given that.",418

I think we'd characterize it as pretty normal from an in-demand standpoint. We under-shipped demand some in Q4, so there was an inventory burn. And what we now think happened as we look back is there was a bit of inventory, particularly Bay Trail, lower end systems. When we started the quarter, it led to some weakness in the first few weeks and then it caught back up as we worked our way through the quarter and burned through that inventory and then we saw it behave a bit more normally from a shipment pattern.",104

If the inventory burn that you saw in the channel was at the low end, we saw ASPs come up, I guess, because you were losing some of that low-end shipment. What does that suggest for your ASP trend next quarter as potentially those -- I guess, I should ask if you see those inventory trends going back the other way? And, what does that mean for pricing as we move into the next quarter, does the low end start to come back for you?",115

And so first off, I will say that the ASP good news that we saw in Q4 really had 3 elements to it. One element was the fact that we saw some inventory burn on Bay Trail, so our mix within notebooks was a little bit higher. Think of that in rough numbers, that's about 1/3 of it. And about 2/3 of it is associated with server. We just had a very strong quarter in terms of server. And our server mix is starting to look better, starting to improve some. So that's about 2/3 of it. In terms of the impact on Q1, it's not jumping out on the margin recon. So you should take from that, that we're expecting pretty benign ASP environment as we go into the year. And it also doesn't pop out on the year recon. So it's not a big driver of gross margin next year based on what we can see today.",163

And for my follow-up, I want to ask maybe a more general question on 14 versus 22. So for 14 nanometers, you've shown a lot of charts showing normalized cost per transistor dropping below trend. Obviously, wafer cost is going up quite a bit, but your density seems to be increasing even faster. And that's going down. But that's a normalized basis. At the same time, we've had yields that obviously have taken a bit longer to get into place. We have factory ramps that seem to be hitting more than normal in the first half of the year. Would you say that the all-in cost of the lifetime of 14-nanometer is going to turn out to be lower than the all-in cost of 22?",127

And so what that chart shows is the churn in the first half of this year, so the early stage of the Broadwell ramp, because of some of the yield issues that we've talked about, it is higher. It's on a non-normalized basis, it's a higher cost. But by the time we get into the back half of the year, on a non-normalized basis, Broadwell actually is less expensive than those other products at the same stage of their life.",115

So we have -- let me start. There's a series of SoFIA products. So the SoFIA -- the first of the products is the SoFIA 3G, which basically has a 3G modem. The second products will be a SoFIA LTE modem. What we said was 3G modem version, the SoFIA 3G, has finished its internal qualification, which means that we've gone through and made sure that the apps processor is fully functional and the modem is working. All of that work is done. And it's electrically and logically functional. We are in the process now of -- what we -- and we've got several design wins. And I'm just never able to go and tell you, but it's all of our major OEMs and partners plus some. We are in the process now of going out to the carriers and getting -- the carrier certifications, and that's why we said that actually that's the difference, the time difference between ramping a product or qualifying a product in Q4 internally and before our customers can ramp in the first half is a lot of the qualification and getting it out there and to the rest of the world. The same thing will happen. We said we would qualify internally in the first half the LTE, with the ramp on the second half. It's that same process that's going to occur.",230

So I think I said in the past, I view ASP growth in the data center product line as being much more akin to capacity additions. So as the performance of the machines go up, as people move up in terms of 1-way servers to 2-way to 4-way servers, we see that as an increase in ASP, but it really is from the standpoint of a CIO, an increase in capacity that they go and buy. How sustainable it will be, I don't know. But it is a segment of the market where as we bring technology in and that technology brings benefit to the customers, it increases their capacity and decreases our operating costs, we get paid for advancing technology faster than others can do it. I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to that.",140

I think that almost like the PC, if you really look back at the PC, the PC began to kind of bifurcate. You did see systems coming in at lower and lower price points, right? And you saw kind of a bottom of the PC market go from the $500 range to as we said now, you can go out there and get a good system, $249 all the way down to $199 with Chrome. I think -- and then, you saw -- but at same time as you said, we saw record Core i7, and the gaming PCs are hitting record levels. And so the high end kind of did very well as well, and we've been working on filling in that middle. I think the same thing is going to happen on tablets. You are going to see a robust low end of the tablets. I go to Shenzhen. I see what's coming out of China right now. There are actually good low-cost tablets that are going to come out and continue to drive probably that average ASP system down into the $700 range. At the same time, I think you see systems that we've got them coming with all of our major OEMs -- Lenovo, Dell, HP -- systems with real innovation, things like the RealSense snapshot, thinner and lighter, longer battery life, better screens, edge-to-edge screens, people are willing, if you bring the innovation, a $399 tablet, maybe $299 to $399 tablet is not an unreasonable price if you bring that performance or capability that's new and innovative. So I think we'll get that same kind of effect, yes, in the tablet space that we saw in the PC space as well.",292

There's I'd say 2 things to point to. So first of all, we are making increases in R&D investment in areas where Brian and I have looked and believe we're going to get a significant payoff on those investments. So specifically, Data Center Group, the Internet of Things Group, and a bit more towards process technology. And then, we're offsetting some of that with decreases in investment in other areas that you see, the MCG segment being top of that list, and some efficiencies across our product engineering group. I'd also point to the second phenomenon, which is the acquisition of Axxia, which is going into the Data Center Group and increases our product or improves our product portfolio there in the networking space, is bringing along some R&D costs associated with that. And so that's part of what is adding to the R&D spending next year.",148

We talked a little bit about this at CES, but Stacy, I wanted to get your view. Broadwell is launching in the fourth quarter and then starting to ramp now. Skylake, it sounds like you want to continue to have that be on time in the, I guess, the early part of the second half of this year. To the extent that the Broadwell duration is shorter than normal, what sort of business implications, whether it be on the revenue, the COGS, et cetera line, should we think of to hit the financials throughout the year?",105

Let me first kind of answer how we're looking at this. I mean, we're not going to slow Skylake down. We said it will be in the second half of this year. I don't want to slow it down because it brings a lot of innovation, a lot of new capability to this market. We think we've managed between the SKUs of what SKUs we'll bring out on Broadwell to really refresh the 2-in-1 devices, the Chromebooks. We wanted to bring Core M out, which I think in the first part of this year with the Chinese New Year, the back-to-school season, having these super thin and light devices is going to be critical. So missing that by doing something else with Broadwell would have been a mistake. And I think getting that volume is a good thing. We think we've managed the transition on the number of SKUs of Broadwell we'll have and how we'll transition the market to Skylake now and moving forward. From a margin or COGS standpoint, remember they are on the same technology, the same piece of silicon. It's the same factory. All we do is change the piece of glass in the scanner to get a different product. So there's not a change or revamp of our factory that needs to occur for this.",224

Rockchip, we've actually been working with them on their first design. It's an enhancement to the 3G, so it's SoFIA 3G-R. You'll see it. It's got some enhancements to the graphics and some other functionality. I think you'll see that in 2015. They've already got their first silicon out. You have to go talk to them. Again, part of it is they have a certain level of independence. They're going to ramp and launch that product when they feel ready. But it's -- the first silicon is out and going out there, validation and certification. So we are right on schedule. I'd say, actually, we're slightly ahead of schedule with Rockchip. And we'll continue to bring designs. The next one will move to LTE, just like ours and then, keep moving on just right in line with ours, just a little bit, maybe a quarter or 2 after our exemplary product as well. For Spreadtrum, that deal closed more in the second half of the year. We started to work with them. The product definition is done. We're working on exactly what their SoFIA would look like. And we'll progress through that through this year. But the relationship and kind of the model of having them produce SoFIA derivatives with additional features or additional capabilities targeted towards their specific market and channels is exactly the same methodology that we'll take.",237

And, Brian, as a follow-up in the Mobile group, obviously, great work in hitting the target in the tablet units. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the market reception and the health of the channel for those products, particularly since a lot of those are Chinese OEMs. What's sort of the setup for Chinese New Year on the tablet side?",64

I'd tell you that market reception in the channel so far for the Intel tablet has been very strong. There's a strong brand value just in the Intel tied to a tablet no matter who is the manufacturer. The tablets we've made with Lenovo and Dell and many of the I'll call it major OEMs have been selling very well. And you saw the great reception the Dell Venue 8, for example, 7000 got at CES. I'll call it the more broad products that are coming out of China, more of the Shenzhen marketplace. So far, they've been selling quite well. And the number -- I'd say the number of OEMs that are working with us in that space and the amount of innovation and breadth that they're bringing into these products has surpassed even what our expectations were. And as we show them things like RealSense and WiDi and the WiGig, all these capabilities both from the tablet and the PC space, we're seeing a lot of innovation coming out of that Chinese market, Chinese manufacture space.",184

And how are you balancing the push there in terms of the low cost tablet versus PCs?",37
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2015",2015-01-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3273.0,746584.0,32721460.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,74,"Sure. So if you remember, Vivek, what we said for the year was we'd be roughly flat in units. We also forecasted a roughly similar worldwide economic or worldwide demand scenario is what we're seeing today. So we did not build in a big recovery or a big resurgence of the emerging markets into our '15 model. So we are not dependent on an emerging market recovery or return in order to make our numbers for '15. The next question you asked is what about tablets and the low-end tablet? And I'd really say it's the low-end tablet and emergence of the phablet in that space versus the PC. And we think that if I took a look at that, the phablet is probably taking a little bit more out of the tablet than the PC. I think people still are going to use the PC for their high-end usages, when they have to have a keyboard, when they have to have the higher-end compute. And for the low end, kind of I want to look at the material. I want to watch a video. I want to scan my data. It's the phablet and the tablet that are kind of battling out for the user in that space, I'd say. And you see a large growth that's occurring in phablets in the emerging markets. So bottom line, we're not expecting an emerging market recovery. We're not building our forecast on that, and so that's why we're feeling comfortable with our current PC forecast.",254

Following a reset to our outlook in March, the first quarter finished roughly as expected. Our PC business was impacted by slowing desktop sales, particularly in small and medium business. At the same time, challenging macroeconomic conditions and an appreciating U.S. dollar weighed on our business in the important geographic markets.
Despite this, revenue was flat year-over-year as our Data Center, Internet of Things and NAND business all delivered double-digit growth. The diversity and scale of Intel products today puts us in a position to compete across the breadth of devices that compute and connect. I'll take just a moment to review each of these businesses before sharing my expectations for the rest of the year.
Our newly formed Client Computing Group results reflected weakness in desktop demand and the depletion of PC supply chain inventories. And while desktop volume declined, notebook volume grew year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our silicon technology leadership remains a valuable competitive advantage, and the percentage mix of our latest 14-nanometer processors, the fifth-gen Core and Core M processor is just ahead of our expectation. 
In addition to launching the high-volume fifth-gen Core product at CES, the CCG group also reached some important product milestones. We launched our newest Broadwell-based vPro notebook SKUs that feature aspects of the company's no wires vision to help us all work better. We also expanded our mobile product portfolio to address a range of price points and form factors. This includes the Intel Atom x5 and x7 for mainstream and premium tablets, formerly called Cherry Trail, which is powering the new Microsoft Surface 3. 
We also started shipping the Atom x3, formerly SoFIA 3G, the company's first single-chip integrated baseband and apps processor designed for entry and value smartphones and tablets. This product was not even on our roadmap 1.5 years ago and is now launched in the market. This is a great example of the velocity of the new Intel.
In the Data Center, our manufacturing and architecture leadership, combined with opportunities driven by the rise of cloud computing and HPC usages, continue to yield impressive results. DCG revenue grew 19% year-over-year, and our Xeon E5 Version 3 product line, formerly known as Grantley platform, now represents more than 50% of our 2-socket volume. New products like Grantley and our increased support of custom versions of the product helped us achieve record cloud revenue. And in the telco segment, we continue to significantly outpace the market with the adoption of Intel architecture.
We also introduced our first Xeon-based SoC processor, optimized for micro servers, storage, network and IoT devices. This product is an example of our strategy to reuse IT from our core business in complementary and profitable segments.
Many of the secular trends underpinning our growth in the Data Center also benefited our NAND business, which grew 14% year-over-year. Just 3 weeks ago, Intel and Micron formally announced our jointly developed 3D NAND technology. Intel 3D NAND will be available in the second half of this year and offers roughly 3x the stated capacity of competing technologies, which aren't expected until 2016. 3D NANDs, for example, can provide greater than 10 terabytes of storage in a 2.5-inch solid-state drive and is the first 3D NAND solution to be architected to be lower cost than 2D NAND. 
And finally, the Internet of Things Group grew 11% over the first quarter of last year based on strength in the retail and digital security market segments. Our first quarter results, combined with a variety of third-party insights from across the industry, inform our thinking for the balance of 2015. We expect the PC market to remain challenging, leading to a mid-single-digit decline in the overall full year PC TAM.
That said, we are excited about the launch of our 14-nanometer Skylake microprocessors and the capability this product family will enable on a variety of operating systems. In particular, we are enthusiastic about the release of Windows 10 this summer, especially when combined with Skylake. 
We continue to be confident in our strategy to drive growth. We're focused on innovating in our Client business, improving mobile profitability and investing in and growing profitable adjacent markets. We're applying our process technology leadership, silicon integration expertise and the efficient use of shared intellectual property. This strategy is delivering results, as evidenced by the growth we saw this quarter in the Data Center, IoT and NAND segments. The performance of those businesses remains strong and is expected to roughly offset weakness in CCG. As we move forward, we will continue to work to ensure that if it's smart and connected, it's best with Intel.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",784
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2015",2015-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3426.0,789165.0,34390694.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. Revenue for the first quarter was $12.8 billion, flat year-over-year and in line with the downward revision to outlook provided on March 12. As a reminder, the change in revenue outlook was a result of weaker-than-expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower-than-expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain. While the PC market was challenging in the first quarter, we continue to see strength in the Data Center, Internet of Things and NAND business.
First quarter gross margin of 60.5% was slightly above the original outlook provided on the January earnings call. Spending on R&D and MG&A, $4.9 billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter and in line with our guidance. Operating income of $2.6 billion was up 4% from a year ago. Earnings per share of $0.41 was up over 8% from a year ago.
The newly created Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.4 billion, an 8% decline year-over-year, driven by a 16% decline in desktop unit volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in notebook volume. Tablet unit volumes were over 7 million units, up 45% year-over-year. We are on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by $800 million, with the majority of improvements to be realized in the back half of the year. Operating profit for the overall Client Computing Group was $1.4 billion, down 24% from a year ago. The decrease was driven primarily by lower desktop revenue and higher unit costs.
The Data Center Group had revenue of approximately $3.7 billion, 19% growth on a year-over-year basis, driven by 15% unit growth. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 billion. This was up 27% year-over-year, driven by unit growth, a richer mix and lower unit costs.
Additionally, year-over-year, the Internet of Things segment achieved revenue growth of 11% and the NAND business grew at a fast pace. 
The business continued to generate significant cash with $4.4 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We purchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $750 million of stock in the first quarter. Total cash balances at the end of the quarter was roughly $14 billion, down approximately $5 billion from a year ago. Our net cash balances, total cash, less debt, is below $1 billion. And inclusive of our other longer-term investments, it is more than $4 billion.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $13.2 billion, up 3% from the first quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We believe there was an inventory burn across the worldwide PC supply chain in the first quarter, and we expect a further reduction of inventory supply chain levels in the second quarter in anticipation of the Windows 10 launch this summer. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%, plus or minus a couple of points, a 1.5 point increase from the first quarter. 
Turning to the full year 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat to 2014, down from the prior guidance of mid-single-digit percentage growth. We are now projecting a mid-single-digit decline in the overall PC market. We continue to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group and NAND businesses, which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group.
As a result of lower-than-expected demand and reduced growth rates this year, we are lowering capital spending, spending on R&D and MG&A. We are moving to reuse capital by rolling it forward to 14-nanometer and to align overall capacity with demand. We are now forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $8.7 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior outlook.
We are also forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range of 61%, down 1 point from our prior guidance as a result of temporarily lower utilization rates and lower platform volumes. And we are forecasting the midpoint of R&D and MG&A spending for the year at $19.7 billion, down $300 million from the prior outlook.
We are prudently managing our cost capacity and inventory to address the changes in expected PC demand. We are using our manufacturing leadership to transform the company by developing leadership products across a broad range of end markets. That product leadership is driving growth in revenue and profits at the Data Center, Internet of Things and NAND business.
To illustrate this transformation, in the first quarter, almost 40% of our revenue came from the combination of these businesses. And these businesses accounted for more than 2/3 of the company's overall operating profit in the first quarter. Our work is far from done, but the transformation of the company is well underway. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",813

And I'm kind of curious, given the revenue guide implies a pretty steep ramp in the back half of the year, i.e., utilization going up, can you just help me understand why you wouldn't get better leverage in gross margins in the second half?",77
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2015",2015-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3426.0,789165.0,34390698.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,7,"Yes. John, so yes, you're doing the algebra correctly there. We're averaging about 61% in the first half. We've guided 61% for the year. My expectation is the average over the back half is in that range of about 61%. You see some offsetting trends going on. So first, we do expect we'll see some benefit associated with just seasonally stronger volume in the back half of the year. Offsetting that is 2 things. One is we'll start to see -- we're seeing 10-nanometer start-up costs today, but they'll ramp pretty significantly when we get into Q3 and Q4. So that's one element. And then the other is we're bringing down the utilization rates on our 22-nanometer factory network kind of now and through Q2, maybe a little bit into Q3. Those products will go into inventory, and they'll ship in the back half of the year. And so we'll see a little bit of an elevated cost relative to what we thought in the back half associated with bringing down the utilization rates in the factories. As you've watched us for a while, you know that we do that so that we can free up some capacity and roll it forward to 14-nanometer and offset some of the capital investment there. So that's why we're doing it. But the impact of that is higher cost.",226

I'm not going to comment on any of the rumors and on the press. But our strategy on investing in this business and what we do with our cash hasn't changed. And it's really the same strategy that's been before me. And that is always, first, invest in the business. I firmly believe in that, that investment, Moore's Law, new architectures, technology, things like that and M&A at times. And then share buybacks and dividends. Although there always are priorities, we're stewards of our shareholders' cash. And we always feel like that's always the first thing we do. And if we can invest in the business and get a better return than that, then we do that no matter how we invest in that. But yes, I'm not going to speculate on any of the rumors.",140

Now we're projecting mid-single-digit PC decline, and that's leading to relatively flat revenue growth year-on-year. So it has changed my view of the year. So maybe you can define your question a little better, and I'll try to answer a little better.",73

Yes, I understand your question. It's about linearity. So yes, let me put the PC market in context and we can go from there. Again, we're expecting mid-single-digit decline overall in the PC market. We are seeing a little bit of shift in linearity over the course of the [indiscernible]. We saw a fairly significant inventory burn in Q1. Normally in Q2, we would expect to see customers start to put inventory in place for the back half. Our guide for Q2 is assuming that we'll see a continued inventory burn in the quarter, and that's because of the timing of Windows 10. It's hitting in the summer. And so what we think is going to happen is that our customers will lean out inventory levels in the second quarter, and then they'll rebuild inventory levels in the third quarter. And if you do the math, it shifts 1 point or 2 of growth from the first half to the second half as a result of that inventory [indiscernible].",170

As my follow-up, Brian, I was hoping you could just elaborate on the $8.7 billion in CapEx and this idea of increased reuse of equipment. Is that just a repurposing of 22-nanometer?

I think you've got it mostly right. Each one of these product ramps or these technology ramps kind of have a personality and an image of their own. And what you're seeing as we move through 2015 is just that. You did see that we shifted our overall view of the market from single-digit growth to single-digit decline. So that has one impact. You are seeing us be able to move more capital now as a result of that plus, I'll give you some other things, move more capital from 22-nanometers to 14-nanometers. We also said that 14-nanometers, the ramps of our Broadwell products are slightly ahead of our forecasts. So we're seeing a very nice migration of our product demand over to 14-nanometers. And we're seeing some things like better yields, better utilization out of our 14-nanometers as it continues to get healthier. And so all of those combined have led to us adjust our capital. So you're seeing better utilization, better efficiency but also the ability to move more 22-nanometer capacity over to 14-nanometer.",177

Can you just talk about how that transpired? And I thought maybe you'd have to work that inventory down in the second quarter. Just why isn't there a little bit of an inventory overhang after the magnitude of the shortfall in Q1?",74

So it wasn't so much a unit comment as much as a dollar comment. But we expect the dollar values to come down because 14-nanometer costs are coming down the cost curve pretty steeply, and we ended up, up. So there's, from our perspective, a pretty significant shift. And then as we think about the rest of the year, we will -- as we said, we'll bring utilization rates down on 22-nanometer. We'll roll forward some of that capacity to 14-nanometer and we should bring inventory rates -- levels down by the time we get to the end of [indiscernible].",118

And then for my follow-up, with regards to the buyback, how do you think about what the net cash level should be? Is there still a target of sort of -- I think you've said historically you're comfortable at around 0 net cash. And then how do you factor in any potential M&A into that equation? Does that mean that M&A would require you to slow the buyback? Or just how should we think about those trade-offs?

I know there's a lot of speculation out there. 
In terms of net cash balances, yes, we have said that we're targeting approximately 0 net cash. I also said it's impossible for me to manage it so tightly that we mathematically ever get to exactly 0. You can see we brought down cash balances a lot over the year. And in Q1, we were sub-$1 billion in net cash. And when you include in some of the longer-term portions of the portfolio, we were pretty flat at about $4 billion. I'd say it's -- we're kind of comfortably where we want to be and comfortably where we communicated.",124

And given what you were saying on SoFIA, do you expect to be incurring any contra revenues on tablet processor sales by the fourth quarter of this year?

And let me -- if I may, let me just take it all the way out to the commitment Brian and I made around improving -- making the $800 million improvement to the mobility portion of [indiscernible]. We're on track to that. There's 2 big buckets, if you will. One is the improvement in product margin, and it's a combination of the cost structure we get with SoFIA and having a great product that's targeted at the entry and value segments of the phone and tablet market. And a chunk of it is the reduction in contra revenue dollars. Again, for the bill of materials around SoFIA, we think, is a competitive bill of materials cost, and so we aren't planning to pay contra revenue dollars associated with the SoFIA shipment. SoFIA is now shipping in the market, so on track from a timing standpoint. Brian highlighted how fast we're able to execute this product line. I think it really is an example of the changes going on inside the company. As I think about those playing out over the course of the year -- then the other big bucket is just reductions in investment level that we talked about at the Investor Meeting. That second bucket plays out kind of linearly across the year. It will grow but it's giving us benefit in each quarter. The product mix, SoFIA reduction in contra revenue dollars really kicks in, in the back half of the year. So it's more back-end loaded for us based on the SoFIA ramp.",258

It grew 19% here in Q1. I assume much of this growth was your cloud and Web 2.0 customers.

So we have always said in times when the growth is high or in times when the growth is a little bit less, that this tends to be lumpy. There are large cloud providers. They tend to come in with big shifts in their purchasing. And so don't be surprised if there's a very high a quarter and not as high. What we said though is that over time, we believe we can continue to grow this business on a mid-double-digit -- mid-teens kind of growth rates, right? So 14%, 15%, 16%, somewhere in there, growth rates over the rest -- several year period moving forward. And we continue to have that view. We look at the products we're bringing, the growth that we're seeing in cloud, Cloud 2.0 as you say. Big data is driving some of this growth as the cloud generates this data and the cloud providers realize that they can utilize it to improve their cloud performance and their cloud offerings. All of these things are working together and what gives us confidence that we can continue to grow this business segment.",197

And then the team started ramping its Core M product just before the holiday season.

So as you said, Core M was introduced right before the holidays. I'd say that we had a limited number of SKUs available at holiday. And the amount of time we can get in front of it with marketing and all was limited as well. That said, we were very happy with the sales we saw in the holidays. Core M is really designed to provide the first truly fanless Core product capability, very thin and light form factors. As we've moved through the first quarter, you're starting to see a lot more. There are several designs that have come out during this quarter. The uptake has been good, and we're going -- continuing to market and make the product awareness. As we move through the first half, you're going to see a remainder of products come out on Core M that continue this thin, light, fanless design, 2-in-1s. And so far, the uptake has been very good. We think those, combined with our tablet offerings, provide a very -- a lot of choices for the consumer in this mobile space. And then as we move through into the second half of the year, as we introduce Skylake, Skylake will have an additional Core M version, which drives even the performance, the battery life and the second generation for Core M. And again, we expect to see form factors, thin, light, long battery life, fanless designs that are quite compelling.",241

So, you've got gross margins down in the second half, where your 14-nanometer startups are coming down, your revenue's up a bunch. Your tablet profit losses get a lot worse. Obviously, you have 10-nanometer ramping. And you talked about reducing your 22-nanometer utilization and building inventory. So that to me suggests that utilization has to be coming down a lot in the second half. You've got to be building inventory a lot in Q2, but it's mostly 22-nanometers that you'll then be selling in the second half when Windows 10 and Skylake are launching. Do I have those dynamics correct? And then what is the risk that you're going to be building inventory, I guess, in the first half or in Q2 that will be tougher to sell in the second half given the new products that ought to be launching at that point?",156

So what we're doing is in Q2, we're cutting the utilization rates of the 22-nanometer factories to avoid putting product into inventory. Our role is to bring it down. You've seen this from us in the past. When we have a downturn or an opportunity to roll forward capacity, we want to do it. We certainly don't want to put older-generation inventory into inventory if we can help it. So we're going to be cutting utilizations. We're actually cutting them as we speak. The impact of that is we'll have some higher costs that are sitting in inventory because those products that we're producing in Q2 will sell through in Q3 and Q4. A little bit of a cost headwind in the back half of the year. The utilization rates will kind of bottom in Q2, and then we think they start to build back up because we'll take capacity off-line on 22-nanometer, it will build back up in the back half.",180

Because we're not cutting to the point that we have excess capacity charges, so what's happening is you'll see production costs going up, but that sits in inventory and it settles out in the back half. So that's why the way you'll see it is a cost increase in the back half as opposed to a period charge in Q [indiscernible].",64

So you're basically reducing it earlier and you're taking the cost, it's actually hitting your P&L in the back half.

I'll stop while I'm somewhat behind. Next one, a little more mainstream. So if we kind of do the math on your revenue guidance, we get like, I guess, basically a high single-digit revenue growth for Q3 and Q4. You've talked about taking the PC growth rate down. So if we just look at straight desktop notebook, that's 58% of the biz or something like that. So I guess how can we get to high single-digit sequential revenue growth for Q3 and Q4 with the PC business a little slow? When I look at the last 10 quarters, Q3, Q4, and high single-digit revenue growth has only happened once. I was wondering how we can get to the math.",122

You're seeing -- so I'd say not seeing anything unusual in the growth rates of DCG, IoTG, the memory business, they're growing at a robust rate. We're not expecting that to accelerate or decelerate in the back half. So we're just -- we're -- with the exception of DCG, we had a higher than what our average is in Q1. So maybe that comes down a little bit [indiscernible]. But the real issue here is on the PC segment. We think we grew -- we've reduced inventories in Q1. What's unusual is we're predicting that we're going to reduce the worldwide PC supply chain and we'll reduce inventories more in Q2. So think of that as you shift a few million units from Q2 and they get replenished in Q3 and that shifts when the billings happen. It's not so much a comment on the end market, it's just a comment on when inventories get built up for the back-end selling season. So I think the driver there is Windows 10. It's hitting in the summer, and given that plus economic volatility and currency volatility, we think customers will reduce inventory levels into the summer and then replenish back to kind of more normal rates after Windows 10 is available.",218

So PC industry volumes are now going to fall probably mid-single digits along with you guys. And some, including myself, believe that tablet volumes might also fall this year.

Is this a timing issue? Or is there something else here? Is it PC life span, for example, that might be expanding? I know you guys track that.

I think you probably are not too far off. We said that the PC will be down mid-single digits. I would agree most people are thinking that tablets will likely be down. I've -- we've all heard a variety of forecasts. It's a little bit more difficult to forecast, I think, tablet space. Just as a reference point, our tablet number for Q1 came in right on line with what we had projected. And it's up from our Q1 of 2014 significantly. And when we look at this for the full year and we look at compute, there's a variety of things that we look at where we look at this. There's share growth. There's what's happening in compute. And then there's also sell-up as we continue to have newer and better performance as our products get better and better, at the higher ends especially. And then with like the introduction of Core M and the number of people coming with entry-level systems with Core M. You put all of those together, and that's how we formed our view of this year. But as you said, it is formed around a view that when you probably look at the total computes from those products, it declines. We still think phones and tablets continue to grow. And then there's the growth in the Data Center, the growth in the Internet of Things and our memory business, which will all grow in that teens kind of range and they'll vary quarter-to-quarter.",260

And then the other question I had was a major bear thesis at looking at least cash flow for Intel was around increasing cap intensity as we move down Moore's Law. But your CapEx guidance implies the lowest spend that we've had since 2010, and we're pretty much on record revenue here. So in your opinion, does this speak against that capital intensity argument? Or is this really just sort of a timing issue?",93

Let me answer the first, and I'll let Stacy answer the capital intensity one. The first one was around what is happening to system longevity or system lifespan. It is continuing to grow. Our estimates are that there's something approximating 600 million PCs out there, and that's growing somewhat by the day that are greater than 4 years old. You could look at that as this is continuing to grow and push. You can also look at this as this is a great opportunity. We still believe that at some point, those systems will flip over. Windows 10, Skylake, all of those things are opportunities that we think we can start to move some of those units. But the approximation is there are 600 million-ish units at greater than 4 years. I'll let Stacy handle the capital intensity.",144
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2015",2015-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3426.0,789165.0,34390742.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,51,"Yes. On the capital intensity, I mean, I'll give you the long-term answer and then come back to what we're seeing in 2015. The longer-term answer, and I'll refer you to some of the stuff we showed at the Investor Meeting, we do agree capital intensity is going to go up as measured by capital costs per square inch of silicon. We believe that through 14-, 10- and with some insight all the way down to 7-nanometer, we can offset that increase in capital cost per square inch of silicon by improving our density. And so we can keep the cost per transistor coming down at the historical curve. So for us, we don't think that we're going to be impacted by -- at least over the next 2 to 3 generations, by the increase in capital intensity. And that's what I showed at the Investor Meeting, there is kind of this $7 billion to $8 billion normalized run rate where we can respond to some unit growth with manufacturing CapEx. And then on top of that, we put some other capital, things like office buildings, the fabs. And specific then to what's happening this year is we were planning for -- if you go all the way back to the Investor Meeting last year, we've seen 2 big buckets of improvement. One is, as Brian said, our confidence around 14-nanometer has improved. And second, our desktop units have come down. And so versus flat units, we now think we're down in the mid-single digits. And the combination of those 2 things has allowed us to have more reuse of 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer. And we've driven some efficiency in the factory network. And so I'd characterize this as being an unusually low level of CapEx relative to the size of the business because we're driving efficiency at a faster rate and we are getting more reuse than -- or and than we expected.",323

That was very helpful color. Could you talk a little bit about the strategy or the thought process behind combining the categorizations of the groups in the reporting structure? What was the thought there?,51
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2015",2015-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3426.0,789165.0,34390745.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,54,"Sure. I'll start, Jim, and Stacy can voice in on some of this as well because there's a financial side to this. But, in general, there is -- we first made this move based on our customers and how we look at the architecture in the business. And so our customers, you walk into whoever that customer is, a Lenovo or Acer or some of the ODMs in China, they look at the platform from the phablet especially up through at least the tablet and into the low-end entry-level PC, whether it be a Windows-based system, a Chromebook or Android. They look at all of those platforms as the same type of hardware. And they want to have a single group that they interface with. And so our customers wanted this. Secondly, from an engineering perspective, from our side, the silicon, the cost improvement, the software work, the drivers, all of those things, again, a lot of overlap. So by driving these 2 organizations together, we are getting efficiencies that are helping contribute to that $800 million cost reduction that Stacy and I committed to. So it was, first and foremost, our customers and our efficiency were driven by this. This is not anything else. At that point then, Stacy's -- what he does is says ""The financials need to represent how you're running the business and making decisions Brian"", and so we also made the reporting structure that same way. But I'll let Stacy jump on that.",248

The only 2 pieces of commentary I'd add to that is, and I'll take you back to Chris's question earlier, that we're seeing this blurring of lines between different devices. And we were doing some unnatural things to try to categorize them. I think the Microsoft Surface is a perfect example of that. When you look at partners and IDCs, the way they characterize the market, they count that as a tablet. We're including that in the PC revenue line, and we realized that the customer were viewing these as one category of devices, we were starting to manage it as one category of devices. And we would be more efficient and more accurate to think of client broadly. The other comment I'd make is, as we showed in the Investor Meeting, and Brian had some specific materials on this, we were also finding that the IP that we were developing were shared across these different groups. And so again, we were having to categorize things that ultimately came down to judgment. So we realized it was one set of customers, one set of products and one set of IP that was playing across the different products.",204

Maybe my follow-up would be on the NAND market. I know you said NAND is going to follow the same secular trends as DCG. Is there ever going to be a time period where it makes sense to expand that opportunity for you? It's a good growth market. You're making good margins on it. Fills up the factories. What would be the pros and cons of expanding your business in that segment?,76
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2015",2015-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3426.0,789165.0,34390748.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,57,"So first, you're right. As we said at our conference, Jim, especially for us, because the majority of the NAND that we sell goes into enterprise-level products, mainly the Data Center. Greater than 50% of what we sell in the NAND -- off the NAND is an enterprise-class device. We also announced our 3D NAND which we think really is a game changer. We talked about the density, the cost. And putting 10 terabytes or more into an SSD, we think, is pretty compelling. We are constantly looking at these businesses, NAND especially, and asking ourselves what are the level of investments. Right now, we have a great partnership with Micron, where we jointly developed these, the majority of the manufacturing is done, in fact all the manufacturing on these technologies is done by them. And that relationship works very well. We're able to invest. We invest through them, and they have the efficiency of having factories that they can offset loadings with other products that they have. And that's a very efficient model in the memory market, to have basically 2 companies with 2 very different business models to be efficiently using the same factory network. What would drive us outside that would be if we saw some unique growth or some unique situation where it makes sense for us to manufacture. But right now, this model works very well. And the efficiency that we get out of working together with them, I think, is really what has been a game changer in the market for us.",258

You referenced a 50% of Xeon E5, if I remember correctly, on Grantley. What -- just help us understand, what has that done in terms of driving growth so far for the business? And my second question, my follow-up, is on the PC side, Brian. You have mentioned Windows 10 a couple of times. Are you expecting a big bump-up in demand from that? And if so, why?",77
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2015",2015-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3426.0,789165.0,34390751.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,60,"Sure. So we'll answer this one at a time, and let me start with the Grantley one and Stacy can voice in and I'll answer the Windows 10 one. In all of these cases, our new products, as you said, the Grantley platform, which is our E5 series of products, provides a new level of performance. And when you look at this business, there are some segments of this business that's replacement. With each one of these new generation, we look at the fact that the total cost of ownership for a cloud provider, an enterprise provider to come in and do a replacement from an older-generation Intel product to new-generation Intel product tends to have a positive total cost of ownership return. So there's a replacement function that each one of these new 2 generations have, along with the increased density and performance that a cloud provider can get with a new product like the Grantley, allows them to grow their business without having to grow their footprint as much. And so that allows cloud growth at a much more efficient and effective capacity. And so if we look at new platforms like Grantley, the fact that we do get a very fast transition, as we said, greater than 50% now is on Grantley, is just an example of how fast people see the economics that these products deliver. So that would be my answer to this. It's really performance, which then drive economics, which then drives both replacement and overall Data Center growth. But I'll see if Stacy has a comment on that?",265

We -- this is a place where if we can drive technology faster than everybody else, we get paid for it because as we bring more powerful products in, people buy higher in the stack because they get an increasing return on that, okay? And when you look at the DCG results year-on-year, you see that units were up 15%, ASP was up 5%. So you see it in both of those. It drives this replacement cycle and it drives an increasing mix.",100

So how much of the 19% growth was due to Grantley. We don't go through and report those kinds of separations. Partly, it -- as we said, the growth in the Data Center in general tends to be lumpy. And it's based on orders by some of the big cloud providers. And as we said, more than 50% of the volume is now on Grantley. So just by the math, you'd say, sure, there's more than 50% of the 19% growth was probably on Grantley. But I'm not sure it's necessarily the factor driving this. It's one of the factors.",101

And so it's not like an event. It's -- you bring out a product. It starts in a segment. Then we bring out products that are appropriate to different segments.

What we said is there's some push out of the inventory that would normally be present in the second quarter as people lean their inventories so that they're in preparation for Windows 10. The Windows 10 launch is in the summer as it has been announced. As that occurs and we move into Q3, we anticipate that inventories will simply recover back to a normal level from that leaned out. And so we'll see growth in that inventory recovery at that point. But if you took a look at the sell-through in the overall year, we're actually projecting, as we said, a relatively seasonal mid-single-digit decline in the PC business. And it's just got this inventory shift kind of moving in the center of the year around that.",161

So I'll start with the second part. It's really impossible to de-tangle the -- what we're seeing in the PC market and separate out what's happening from a macroeconomic standpoint, currency volatility, kind of an XP hangover and then Windows 10 shift. It's just kind of all wrapped up together. So I don't think I can give you a lot of color on that. I'd say our view of the year when we started the year is that we would see, I articulated, a little less strength in the enterprise segment of the market and a little less weakness in the consumer segment of the market. I think we'd revise that statement now to say we're going from strength in the enterprise segment to probably a little bit of weakness in the enterprise segment. And consumer was weak last year. It's probably a little less weak this year, but expect it to be down. And you take the combination of those 2 things, and that's how you get to minus 5% kind of mid-single-digit decline [indiscernible].",182

And as a follow-up, in terms of the cut to CapEx, curious if this is a new steady-state for you guys. And then I guess as the question that follows that, how do we think about impact to construction in progress, if at all? And then as well, when we go down to 10-nanometer, the rising cap intensity there, do we see a stair-step higher in terms of that number in depreciation? Or how should we think about those moving parts?",84
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2015",2015-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3426.0,789165.0,34390763.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,72,"So let me start and then I'll let Stacy jump in. What we said was that this year's capital is a little bit less than what we would have normally projected for the year. We were able to get, as we said, better yields, better utilization, and we were able to -- and this happens from time to time. You can look back in our past. It happened in '08, '09 time frame where we get it that there's a slight decrease in our projection for total volume. At the same time, we're going through a transition and we're able to move capital very, very quickly. One of the things we've made as an improvement at Intel is our ability to shift capital from one node to another very quickly. And that has all to do with the copy exactly and how we design our architectures and technologies to be able to do that. That said, again, separate out capital intensity of a technology with the absolute unit cost of a technology. And the real fundamental of Moore's Law is one of economics. And on the 50th anniversary of Moore's Law, which this year is, we should remember that Moore's Law is an economics law in that we're going to reduce the cost as well as improve the performance of these products. So we believe in 10-nanometers, yes. The capital per wafer start does go up, but it goes up less than the density does. And so we believe our unit cost, and whether you measure that in transistor cost, which is probably the best way to measure it, 1:1, or our overall product cost on the same die equivalent. If you built a Skylake part on one technology or the other, we get an improvement in that cost greater than the capital intensity. So the bottom line is I don't expect us always to have this lower level of CapEx. That said, we are continuously trying to reduce and be as efficient in CapEx as we can. Yes, the capital intensity will go up in 10-nanometers, but we feel like it goes up less -- the data says it goes up less than the density and cost improvements of the product.",373

Our second quarter results were consistent with our outlook, as a year-over-year decline in the PC business was partially offset by 10% growth in our Data Center business, more than 40% growth in NAND revenue and 4% growth in our IoT segment.
I'll take just a moment to review our results before discussing the rest of the year, the Altera acquisition and the process and product technology update.
During this quarter, we qualified our 6th generation Core products, previously code-named, Skylake for production, and we continue to see excitement in the industry for the launch of these products in Windows 10. And while there were year-over-year declines in desktop and notebook volume, we saw record Core desktop mix due to growth in the high-end segment and record Core i7 mix overall for the PC business.
We're excited about the opportunities created by new products from our OEM partners and the upcoming launch of Windows 10. We've worked closely with Microsoft to make sure the best Windows 10 PCs and tablet experience run on Intel. We have also updated our mobile road map. Our OEMs' first Atom x3, x5 and x7 products were announced and are ramping using our previously code-named Cherry Trail, SoFIA 3G and SoFIA 3G-R products.
The 4G version of our Atom x3 platform, SoFIA LTE, is sampling now for network certification and is expected to ship in volume in the first half of next year. Our latest LTE modem, the Cat 10 7360, is on track for shipments to customers this year.
The Data Center business continued to perform, growing 10% over Q2 last year, and we remain on track to grow this business by more than 15% year-over-year. Again, this quarter, we saw the growth of consumer services fueling the build-out of the cloud. We also saw very strong growth in network infrastructure with the continued migration of workloads onto Intel Architecture and the rise of network function virtualization.
These areas of strength were partially offset by weakness in the Enterprise segment. While our overall billings roughly matched our forecast, PC supply chain inventories declined at a slower rate than we expected as PC demand weakened further. While we are expecting a seasonal second half, we're now forecasting total revenue to decline by about 1% for the full year, down from our prior expectation of approximately flat.
I'd like to shift gears now and talk about a couple of important strategic updates. Last month, we announced our plan to acquire Altera, a leading FPGA vendor. We see 4 key strategic drivers behind this acquisition. First, we believe we can enhance Altera's base FPGA ARM-based business substantially. We plan to do this through our leadership in Moore's Law and our ability to execute designs using our tools and silicon more quickly, allowing us to continue to support and develop their ARM-based products.
Second, history tells us that the FPGA vendor who's first to a manufacturing process node, enjoys a market segment share advantage over the life of that node.
Finally, integrating Altera's world class technology with Intel Architecture in the high growth Data Center and Internet of Things market segments will create new product categories and capabilities. We expect this strategy to produce significant shareholder value, and we're looking forward to implementing our plans. We plan to have a deeper discussion on the value drivers underlying this strategy at our investor meeting this fall.
The last thing I'd like to share with you is an update related to our 10-nanometer technology transition. Just last quarter, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Moore's Law. In 1965, when Gordon's paper was first published, he predicted a doubling of transistor density every year for at least the next 10 years. His prediction proved to be right. And in fact, in 1975, looking ahead to the next 10 years, he updated his estimate to a doubling every 24 months. These transitions are a natural part of the history of Moore's Law and are a by-product of the technical challenges of shrinking transistors while ensuring they could be manufactured in high volume.
As node transitions lengthened, we adapted our approach to the Tick Tock method, which gave us a second product on each node. This strategy created better products for our customers and a competitive advantage for Intel. It also disproved the death of Moore's Law predictions many times over. The last 2 technology transitions have signaled that our cadence today is closer to 2.5 years than 2. To address this cadence, in the second half of 2016, we plan to introduce a third 14-nanometer product, code-named Kaby Lake, built on the foundations of the Skylake microarchitecture but with key performance enhancements. Then, in the second half of 2017, we expect to launch our first 10-nanometer product code-named Cannon Lake. We expect that this addition to the road map will deliver new features and improved performance and pave the way for a smooth transition to 10 nanometers.
As we move forward, we are focused on innovation and execution. We continue to be confident in our strategy to drive growth.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",860

Revenue for the second quarter was $13.2 billion, in line with our outlook and down 5% year-on-year as a result of lower desktop and notebook platform volume. This was partially offset by increases in the Data Center Group and NAND. Quarter-on-quarter, revenue was up 3%.
Second quarter gross margin of 62.5% was 0.5 point above our outlook. Operating income of $2.9 billion was down 25% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Net income was $2.7 billion, down 3% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $0.55 was flat year-over-year.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 14% decrease year-over-year. Both desktop and notebook unit volumes were down as a result of lower demand in the business segment and in emerging markets.
In terms of the worldwide PC supply chain, we saw a slight decline of inventory levels quarter-over-quarter and believe that overall inventory levels are normal.
Our own inventory declined in units but grew in dollars as we refreshed inventory levels with 14-nanometer products. Tablet unit volumes were 9.9 million units, up 11% year-over-year. We are on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by $800 million with about 1/3 of the improvement realized to date. Operating profit for the overall Client Computing Group was $1.6 billion, down 38% year-over-year.
Our business portfolio continues to transform, with growing the Data Center, Internet of Things and NAND business, which accounted for almost 40% of our revenue and more than 70% of the company's overall operating profit in the second quarter.
The Data Center Group had revenue of $3.9 billion, 10% growth year-over-year, driven by very strong results in cloud and networking infrastructure. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, flat year-over-year. Additionally, year-over-year, the Internet of Things segment achieved revenue growth of 4% and the NAND business achieved record revenue and grew at over 40%.
The business continued to generate significant cash, with $3.4 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter. We purchased $1.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $700 million of stock in the second quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was $13.9 billion, flat to the first quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is approximately $4 billion. Over the next 2 to 3 quarters, we expect to complete the acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion.
The financing plan for this acquisition is to issue $7 billion to $9 billion in new long-term debt and finance the remaining balance with our cash and short-term commercial paper. As we generate free cash flow, we expect to get back to approximately 0 net cash in the second half of 2016.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.3 billion, up 8% from the second quarter. This forecast is at the higher end range of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 63%, 0.5 point increase from the second quarter.
Turning to the full year 2015. We expect revenue to be down approximately 1% from 2014, lower than our prior guidance of approximately flat. Our expectations are that the PC market is going to be weaker than previously expected. We continue to forecast robust growth rates in the Data Center Group, Internet of Things group and NAND businesses, which we expect to mostly offset the PC decline. We are forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $7.7 billion, down $1 billion from the prior outlook. This is driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies and changes in timing for purchases.
We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 61.5%, up 0.5 point from our prior guidance. And we are forecasting the midpoint of our R&D and MG&A spending for the year at $19.8 billion, up $100 million from the prior outlook.
The second quarter financials came in a little better than our expectations. As we look at the second half, we expect seasonal market growth from here, and we are very excited about the devices based on Skylake, our sixth generation Core processor, that are coming to market. Additionally, we expect continued robust growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things and NAND business. And lastly, we are working to complete the acquisition of Altera. This acquisition will broaden our product portfolio, enable innovation in our current product line and deliver value for our shareholders.

So for instance, you're guiding up 8% for Q3 and implied it's up 5% for Q4. How much benefit are you expecting from Windows 10? Because I think there is very limited conviction whether that could indeed be a growth driver for PCs. So I'm just trying to reconcile your caution, right, with this seasonal guidance. Are you being adequately conservative with your second half guidance?",88

We think we -- remember this is seasonal off Q2, which was down. So we -- this is off a forecasted and actual Q2 that was down from our original assumptions for this year. And so we believe that, yes, a seasonal forecast off that, roughly seasonal, is a reasonable forecast for the remainder of this year. You also saw the announcement that Stacy and I took down our overall revenue guidance a bit as well to be in line with all of that, a seasonal guidance off a lower Q2. I don't know, Stacy, if you have something else you want to add.",106

If you remember, our prediction for Q2 was that inventory levels would be taken down fairly significantly, which is unusual in a Q2. What we actually saw in the second quarter is inventory levels were -- did come down but they're kind of at normal. And so what you're seeing now in Q3 is a little bit of a pipeline fill based on inventory levels that came down in Q2 against the backdrop of Q2s that normally would have inventory levels going up. So it's the same phenomenon of some shift of billings from Q2 to Q3, it's just much more muted than what we thought a quarter ago.",123

We're excited about Win 10 launch and Skylake. We believe great products are coming to market, but we didn't build in a large increase, that's why we stuck with this seasonal off the lowered Q2.",62

I'd also say, if you zoom out, our view of the PC market now is kind of down in the high single digits. And our view a quarter ago was a PC market that was down in the more mid-single digits. So we have definitely brought down our expectations to the PC market overall for the -- but you're still seeing a little bit of that inventory lumpiness.",81

And then as my follow-up, on the Data Center business, I understand that it's lumpy and there are many moving pieces. But you're still expecting mid-teens growth for the year. But in Q2, it sort of slowed down to 10%. And I think you mentioned enterprise as one area of weakness. So are you anticipating a recovery there in the back half? And are you seeing any impact with all the macro headwinds in Europe and China, for instance?",83
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2015",2015-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3209.0,833626.0,36004556.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,12,"So if you take a look at the Data Center and you take a look at the first half, remember we exited Q1 at about 19% growth. And we said, ""Hey, that's pretty robust. Don't expect that for the whole year."" You take that 19% and combine it with this 10%, the first half actually played out right close to -- between 14% and 15%, which was what we've said would be roughly our growth rate in this business. We did say that enterprise was weaker than we had forecasted, but the cloud has been stronger. We've taken that cloud -- actually, cloud, networking and some storage as well, all 3 of those have been stronger and enterprise weaker. We took that same model and carried that through the rest of the year. So we do not expect a large recovery of the enterprise as we go through the remainder of this year. You kind of said it, the headwinds are the macroeconomic, companies looking at how do they spend their capital and when do they deploy their capital, being careful about that. All those things are causing enterprise to be a bit weaker, and we didn't say there would be a big recovery of that. We do think the other trends, the cloud, continuing to grow; networking, continuing to grow, especially with the conversion; the software-defined infrastructure and storage, continuing to grow. We do believe those will continue and that what's drives the second half as well.",248

So I'm wondering if you can talk about what the CapEx implications are for that? And maybe also what the gross margin implications are for, maybe, the back half of this year and in July next year?",55
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2015",2015-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3209.0,833626.0,36004559.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,15,"Sure. A lot in that question, so let me take a shot and you can come back if I don't appropriately or adequately answer all of it. The CapEx implications. So we've taken down our CapEx forecast again this cycle, so relatively significantly from where we were at the beginning of the year. If you go back to the beginning of the year, what you see in terms of the reduction in CapEx, it's kind of in, I'll call it, 4 buckets. There's a big piece that's just factory efficiency. We talked about this last quarter, the 14-nanometer factories are becoming more efficient and our confidence in that ramp has gone up, so that was a chunk of it. We talked the last quarter about taking advantage of some of the unit weakness that we saw to bring down the capacity in our 22-nanometer factories, and we successfully executed on that in the second quarter. We were -- we took utilization down, we took a bunch of capacity offline, we rolled it forward to 14-nanometers, so that was a chunk of what we're seeing. We talked a bit about desktop units being lower as a result of the XP refresh last year, that's a piece. And then there's a big chunk associated with this third wave of products that Brian talked about. And so just isolating then on that, the implications in this generation are that we'll be on the -- at the 14-nanometer peak for longer and we'll delay a little bit some of the purchases on 10-nanometer from when we were on a 2-year cadence. And so that is definitely a piece of the lower CapEx this year. In terms of the gross margin implications, minor. For us, the key is to have great products, and that's why we're adding in this third wave of products. So the first approximation, that's the best correlation to gross margin is, when you've got leadership products, you tend to have a healthy gross margin. It does change the shape of start-up costs a little bit. You can see the 10-nanometer costs are a bit later than normal. But we'll talk more about that at the Investor Meeting in Q4.",368

Is that simply the result of Broadwell having pushed out? Or is there something specific to 10 that is causing it to push?",51
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2015",2015-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3209.0,833626.0,36004561.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,17,"No. It's -- I'd call it similar to what happened in 14. Remember on all of these technologies, each one has kind of its own recipe of complexity and difficulty, 14 to 10, same thing that happened in 22 to 14. The lithography is continuing to get more difficult as you try and scale and the number of multi-pattern steps you have to do is increasing. This is the longest period of time without a lithography node change, so we're assuming 10 nanometers does not have EUV for our technology. That, combined with just the other material science changes you do with the new technology. And then you look at kind of the pattern we've been having with the same kind of sets of conditions, which was the 22-nanometer technology and the 14-nanometer technology, and we said those took about 2.5 years. And the feedback from our customers that said, ""Look, we really want you to be predictable. That's as important as getting to that leading edge."" We chose to actually just go ahead and insert -- since nothing else had changed, insert this third wave. When we go from 10 to 7, it will be another set of parameters that we'll reevaluate this. We'll always strive to get back to 2 years, and we'll take a look at what's the maturity of EUV, what's the maturity of the material science changes that are occurring, what's the complexity of the product roadmap that we're adding and make that adjustment out in the future here. So this is a -- we took a snapshot of the 14 to 10 transition. We looked at the history, and we said, ""Let's be very predictable and do the best thing for our shareholders and for our partners and customers.""",295

One of the things that Intel has always done better than most is get down Moore's Law more quickly. And then I understand there's definitional differences of why nodes and not everyone's 10 is the same. But relative to kind of the targets you've put out this afternoon for second half of '17, if you look at some of the publicly available data from some of your manufacturing competitors, it kind of appears like everyone's going to get to 10 at the same time. So how do you guys think about that historic world of manufacturing lead relative to those peers? And how should we think about it?",121

We believe we'll continue to lead with roughly the same leadership position that we have today. We base that on, one, what really counts. When I talk about 2017, that's not samples, that's not small volume, that's converting over to Cannon Lake and producing a large percentage of our CPUs in volume in the second half of 2017. So there's a bit of definition; when we say second half of '17, we're talking about millions of units and large volumes. And then, as you said, there's this definitional difference, right? This will be now our fourth -- or third-generation of FinFETs. By then, it will be -- have several other transistor enhancements. And we believe, if you take a look at the scaling, it will be quite strong relative to the normal scaling parameters that occur with the Moore's Law transition. I'm not going to give you the exact numbers right now, but if you combine all those together, our leadership position doesn't change even with this date.",191

And then guys, going back to DCG. Relative to the full year guidance of growing at least 15% year-over-year, it does kind of assume a reacceleration of sort of year-over-year growth. I know it's a business that -- where seasonality is less relevant than PC, but it would suggest a second half that's growing half-on-half kind of much more significantly than it historically had. So I'm kind of curious, is the expectation enterprise comes back to bolster what's been strong cloud? Or how do you think about the growth profile of DCG in the back half of the year if it needs to reaccelerate year-over-year?",108
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2015",2015-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3209.0,833626.0,36004566.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,22,"John, this is Stacy. So I think if you look at DCG, we've said for years it's lumpy. We've deconstructed kind of what happened in Q1 and Q2. When you look across the quarters, we're growing 14% to 15%. That's pretty consistent with what we expect for the year, so I think you'll come up with a number that's pretty consistent with that in the back half of the year. As we zoom out a bit on the market from what we thought when we started the year, as Brian said, we'd say that we're seeing an enterprise market that's weaker-than-expected. We're not expecting a lot of incremental strength there. It's more macroeconomic-driven than anything else, and we're not predicting a big macroeconomic boom in the back half. And -- but that's being offset by a cloud market primarily but also networking and storage that is stronger than what we expected. And we saw some spectacular growth rates in the networking -- in the cloud segment in the business this quarter.",171

They kind of -- what I'm seeing is there's a little bit of a counteract between those 2, which is why we've kind of said, ""No, we believe that the overall -- the year will be on balance, still grow at that 15%."" But again, we are looking over the long haul. Don't get caught by a quarter in this kind of a growth rate.",101

One question on that is on your inventory, have you adjusted your inventory to, I guess, increase the server products and decrease some of the PC processors? And can you give us a sense of where you expect inventory to trend in the second half of the year?",67
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2015",2015-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3209.0,833626.0,36004570.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,26,"Sure. It's less driven by server and more driven by the mix of Skylake on 14-nanometer. And so what happened in Q2 is that, as you can see, dollars went up but units were down and actually down a bit more than we had expected when we started the quarter. And -- but the mix of the units that are in inventory have shifted from 22-nanometer products to 14-nanometer. And within 14-nanometer, we're starting to see the shift from Broadwell to Skylake. And so it's a more expensive product because it's brand new. It's also the newest product which gives me a lot of comfort about what's sitting in inventory. As we play out through the rest of the year, what we expect to happen is that units will continue to come down from here. 14-nanometer comes down the cost curve, but the inventory shifts even more dramatically from Broadwell to Skylake. And so when I take those 3 trends into account, I'm predicting that we'll end the year with inventory levels roughly flat to where we are today. Not dramatically different, but again, units will be down, dollars will be flat.",192

And for my follow-up, just, I guess, a longer-term question on the PC market. I mean, you guys are closer to it than anybody. I mean, why do you think it's so  weak this year? Do you think that -- I mean, should we be expecting down 5 to 10 every year? Is there something going on? Is your -- has your long-term outlook on the PC market changed? Any color you could provide as to why this is happening would be very helpful.",85

If I had a perfect mirror into this, I'd be -- this wouldn't be a forecast, this would be a guaranteed schedule of earnings for the next couple of quarters. In general, I think if you look at it, the PC has always had a fairly decent tie to GDP, both in the countries that we sell in, but then you can just look at the worldwide GDP. So worldwide GDP growth has slowed, especially in areas like China where a lot of the growth in PCs was occurring but even in the mature areas like the U.S. and Western Europe. That has caused it to slow down a bit more. I think there has been a little bit of a stall, there's always a little bit of a stall right before a new product like Skylake. But when you have a new product like Skylake combined with a new OS like Win 10, which a majority of these devices will run on, that tends to have people waiting to see what those products are going to be, what's going to be offered, the new form factors, how's Windows 10 accepted. So I think you put all these together, it's made a bit -- the 2015 be weaker on the PC than we had anticipated. Long term, I still think, with the great form factors we have coming, we're going to be talking about all-day battery lives, no liars. We've got some great thin form factors. The fact that there's very little difference between a 2-in-1 device and a tablet and the ability to take back that volume onto the PC. All those things put together, I still stick with the forecast that we can keep this stable, that it will be, over the long haul, relatively flat. There'll be years like last year that it's up, there'll be years like this year that it will be down depending on all of those factors. But over the long haul, relatively flat forecast. And remember, that's how we built our growth strategy. Our growth strategy was hold the PC as close to flat as we can, and grow in the Data Center, grow in IoT, grow in NAND and memory.

Our basic forecast, remember, we said it's basically seasonal off the lower Q2. We didn't build in a big boom from the Windows 10 transition. That said, we are excited about it. You're right, it has a free upgrade. But a lot of the really good features of Windows 10, things like Windows 10 Hello where you have facial log-in, and you don't have to use all your passwords, the start screen and your ability to go through that, the touch usages of gaming as they move games more and more onto this product, those are going to come with PCs that have the latest features. And so that combined with products like Skylake, over the long haul, I think Windows 10 will be a boost to the PC market. It will kind of take some of the negativity about Windows 8 out of that marketplace. And I think it'll be a real positive for us. As you said, some people will have to go through a free upgrade and then see what they really wanted and see the new form factors and go, ""Okay, I'm going to upgrade."" Some of the enterprise guys will take a little bit longer because enterprise always has to check everything they've got on the new OS. And that's why we didn't really build it into the forecast as a big plus for the second half of this year. I think if you look long-term, it's going to be a positive.",262

You typically get a benefit in the second year of a process node. You said the third year, you don't get much benefit. Is that because you've gotten the yields pretty maxed out in the second year? Or are you adding more content? Just what's your thoughts on why you don't get another a little bit of a boost on the third year?",75

I haven't provided a forecast yet for next year. But I'd expect that third wave product coming out on 14-nanometers will have a good cost structure, have a very healthy process, running at high utilization. That tends to be the sweet spot. If you look at 22-nanometer, you kind of have seen that phenomenon not because we had a third wave but just because the process was running full, relatively -- on a relatively mature process and that we got great cost out of it. So my comment was about start-up costs. It does change the trend of start-up costs, and I'll provide more insight into that at the Investor Meeting in the fourth quarter.",139

It sounds like the inventory in the channel didn't burn as much as you thought. Are you building in that it bounces back just to normal levels? I would think that your sequentials would be impacted off of a relatively higher base given that, that didn't burn down the second quarter. So put that all together, how does the lack of that burn in the second quarter fall into your guidance for the third?",85

And the way we articulated that it was -- our belief was that customers would burn off inventory levels in advance of Windows 10 and then replenish inventory levels in the third quarter. What we actually saw was much more normal than that. We just -- we saw customers maintain inventory levels. I think their confidence in the overall PC market grew some as they worked through the quarter and got towards the end of the quarter. So I'd articulate that we have relatively normal inventory levels now. We expect relatively normal inventory levels in the third quarter. Historically, you see inventory build some in the third quarter in anticipation of the Q4 selling season.",128

And I guess, as my follow-on, a bit of a longer-term question, it's on the OpEx side of things. Clearly, OpEx revenue will come down closer to your target in the back half of this year if you guys hit the forecast that you laid out. But you're still well above the 30% OpEx to revenue targets you have. What's the plan to get there? Last year was better than expected on revenues, and you didn't really get much leverage on that metric. This year has obviously been a little bit worse, so it's a bit more challenging. Is there ever the need to do something more structural? Or is it only going to be grow to get to the target?",122

Structural would mean starting to lower our investments in things like the Data Center or IoT. And I really think that would be the wrong thing to do to keep this company growing. I think we have to get this by the growth metric. And our models say if we can stabilize the PC and continue to grow in our forecasted numbers for the Data Center and IoT and NAND, we get there. And we have a plan to not grow our spending while that growth occurs or grow the revenue faster. And we just need to get that and execute to that.",110

The change in your expectations from last quarter, the 1% change, was that entirely due to your comments on the PC channel, the PC segment, and the DCG expectations are essentially unchanged? Is that the right way to think about that?",63
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2015",2015-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3209.0,833626.0,36004585.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,41,"Yes. Entirely is a word that makes me nervous, so -- but it's the vast majority of the change. I guess, I'd also say it's a much smaller business, but I'd also say our expectations on the year have come down for the IoTG business. But that's not adding up to a big number at the corporate level. Some of the issues that Brian talked about, macroeconomics in the sectors in which we play, I think we're unlikely to be at the growth rate that we were at last year, we'll be a little bit less, as Brian mentioned. But again, the big dollars are the PC TAM. Our expectations last quarter were down mid-single digits, we're now down high single digits. That puts us kind of in the low end of what we see from third parties, although, in fairness, they are revising their forecast over the next quarter.",150

And as a follow-up, with regards to mobile, you had a goal to reduce your mobile operating losses this year. Your comments on SoFIA LTE, I think that's a little later than what you had indicated earlier. Does that have any effect on your ability to reduce the mobile operating losses? And maybe just give us a general indication of where you stand against those goals.",68

So the SoFIA, as you said, it's a little bit later than what we wanted. The good news is about it, it's yielding well, it's, as we said, in carrier validation and it'll ship in volume in the first half of next year. As far as the spending reduction targets we had for mobile, we've said we'd get $800 million out. I think Stacy in his part of the presentation stating we're right on target actually to do that. We're very happy with our results there and have already done about 1/3 of it out of the system. And it was back-end loaded as the SoFIA 3G, not LTE, products ramped. So we feel like we have a very good detailed plan to go and continue. And we'll -- at the Investor Meeting update, you on how we'll continue that program to reduce the costs and the losses again next year as well. And really, that's part of -- the SoFIA LTE is a good example. We weren't going to go spend the money to necessarily try and pull that product back in versus say, you know what, it's fine in the first half of the year and the product's healthy. It's more important that we get an LTE product for 2016. And getting it in early in '16 is going to be just fine.",229

But our conversion to 3D NAND, we believe, is a major boost to our product roadmap, both in a performance standpoint and a cost. And remember, we believe we have an architectural advantage to how we built with Micron our 3D NAND over the competition.

So first, let's just talk about Q3. Q3, we acknowledge that the revenue's at the higher end of the seasonal range. The point we were making earlier is we think the market is pretty seasonal and -- but we saw an unusual inventory depletion in Q2. We think some of that inventory fill has just shifted into Q3. So there's a little bit of a billing shift. It's not a lot, it's maybe a couple of points at the top line. Q4, I think you have to be a little careful with the math about implied. I think if you just assume -- we've said on the call, we're expecting Q4 to be roughly seasonal.

R stands for Rockchip, so that's a part that was codesigned between Intel and Rockchip. So that part is in-market, selling today. And so I'd say that, that part has -- that portion of the Chinese relationship has gone quite well, and it's quite far along now. The other relationship that we have in this space is with Spreadtrum. That deal is still going through closure. It had to go through a variety of regulatory approvals in China. It's looking to close fairly soon now.

It's a good forecast for this year. We've kind of told you what's going to happen at 10-nanometers with 2017. So you can kind of now model out -- it's part of why we wanted to get this out to everybody today; you can now model out what the typical CapEx would be given that schedule based on previous node transitions. But what we're saying is don't necessarily count on that for 10- to 7-nanometers. We'll again take a look at the tool set that's available, the maturity of those tools, maturity of the material science additions that we'll be doing and what's the next around FinFET transistors and other kinds of materials that we'll put into the transistor or the die itself. And when you take a look at all those, we'll be trying to pull it into 2 years, but we really won't know, and you won't get it -- we won't be able to give a signal to that until, my guess, late next year at the earliest.",178

When the process node transition shifts out to be longer than that, then that third wave of products gives us another opportunity to deliver features to the customer.

So I don't think there's going to be a huge resurgence of SMB in the desktop. There is some good products coming out on Skylake in the desktop space, but that's not necessarily something we forecasted as a big return for right now. So the majority of this seasonality that we've projected is just based on just standard consumer which, as you said, has got a higher percentage of laptop 2-in-1 and in like devices.",106

And then back to the flash business, obviously another solid quarter of growth. I think you guys are #1 in enterprise SSD with about 25% market share. I just wanted to confirm that the team is still on track to roll out 3D NAND-based platforms in the second half of the year? And then secondarily, how do the cost per bit yield and reliability metrics look relative to your planar-based 2D NAND products?",74

The 3D NAND is looking quite good. From a cost yield and performance, I don't think we've gone public with much of those numbers right now, but we -- what we have said is that 3D NAND, especially with the architectural choices that Micron and Intel chose, we believe gives a significant cost and performance advantage over the competitors. And those specifics are holding as we go through the ramp process. So -- but we haven't broken down it's x% or anything like that yet. So we'll be doing some NAND updates as we go through the back half of this year and give you guys more color in that space. And clearly, at the Investor Meeting that Stacy talked about, we'll spend some time on NAND because, as you said, it's a good growth area for the company right now.",159

We executed well against our strategy in the third quarter and delivered revenue just above the midpoint of our expectations as a result of a richer client mix, driven largely by our new 6th Gen Core products. Despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, there are signs that the PC market is beginning to stabilize, and we continue to benefit from a strategy designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure that powers the smart and connected world. I'd like to take a moment to touch on a few highlights.
The Client Computing Group's new products and good, better, best segmentation strategy drove record Core mix. The third quarter saw the release of both Windows 10 and our 6th Generation Core microprocessors, formerly known as Skylake. Our partners in the industry are using this combination to drive an unprecedented innovation, creating new generation of high-performance, enthusiast desktops, and thinner, lighter and more versatile 2-in-1s. There are more than 50 6th Generation Core systems in the market available and shipping now, and we expect to more than triple that number by the end of 2015. 
We remain solidly on track to our previously committed goal to improve mobile profitability by $800 million. Over 75% of that goal has already been realized to date. At the same time, our strategy to be a foundational supplier of Internet infrastructure is delivering growth. Our Data Center, Non-Volatile Memory and IoT groups all posted double-digit growth year-over-year. DCG grew 12% on strong cloud and networking volume. At the same time, the Internet of Things Group grew 10% year-over-year, driven by the video, manufacturing and retail segments.
The Altera transaction remains on track to our original 6- to 9-month closing schedule. During the quarter, both U.S. regulators and Altera stockholders approved the transaction. We are excited about the new opportunities and innovations that integrated FPGAs will make possible in both the Data Center and the Internet of Things.
In the third quarter, the strength in our memory business continued, growing 20% year-over-year. We are excited about our 3D XPoint technology, the industry's first new memory category in more than 2 decades. This breakthrough technology is up to 1,000x faster than NAND and up to 10x denser than conventional memory like DRAMs. This enables memory-intensive applications to be performed at much faster rates and much lower cost, opening up entirely new opportunities. 3D XPoint is evidence of our commitment to innovation, and it's a direct result of our 10-plus year research and development pipeline. 
While we have more work to do, together, these results reinforce my confidence in our strategy to create shareholder value. I look forward to talking with you more about our opportunities and our plans during our November Investor Meeting. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",468
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2015",2015-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2841.0,881485.0,37808858.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. Revenue for the third quarter was $14.5 billion, 10% growth quarter-on-quarter and above the midpoint of our outlook. The higher-than-expected revenue was driven by higher notebook and desktop platform average selling prices as we shipped a record Core mix. Year-on-year revenue was flat.
Third quarter gross margin of 63% was in line with the outlook. Operating income of $4.2 billion was down 8% year-over-year and up 45% quarter-over-quarter. Net income was $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year and up 15% quarter-over-quarter. And earnings per share of $0.64 was down 3% year-over-year and up 16% quarter-over-quarter.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8.5 billion, a 7% decrease year-over-year. From a PC market perspective, we continue to see weakness in nonconsumer segments and emerging markets. The worldwide PC supply chain is healthy as we ramp our 6th Generation Core microprocessors, formerly known as Skylake. Operating profit for the overall Client Computing Group was $2.4 billion, down 20% year-over-year. 
The Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses continue to account for almost 40% of our revenue in the third quarter. The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.1 billion. The 12% growth year-over-year is driven by strength in the cloud and improvement in our enterprise business. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $2.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year. The Internet of Things segment also achieved 10% year-over-year revenue growth at $581 million. Additionally, the memory business grew at 20%. The business continued to generate significant cash with $5.7 billion of cash from operations in the third quarter. We purchased $1.2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of stock in the third quarter.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was $20.8 billion, up $7 billion quarter-over-quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is approximately $5.1 billion. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect to complete the acquisition of Altera. During the third quarter, we issued $8 billion of new long-term debt, consistent with the financing plan I outlined on the last earnings call. 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 2% from the third quarter. And we are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%, a 1-point decrease from the third quarter. This revenue forecast aligns with our prior full year 2015 revenue guidance of down approximately 1% when compared to 2014.
Overall, we are seeing a weak PC Client business being offset by strong growth in the Data Center, Memory and Internet of Things businesses. For the full year 2015, we expect the Memory business to grow at a fast pace. Both the Data Center and Internet of Things businesses will also exhibit strong growth. But the annual growth rate for these businesses will be lower than expectations at the beginning of the year as a result of weaker-than-expected macroeconomic growth. We now expect the Data Center business to grow in the low-double digits versus the prior forecast of approximately 15%. Relative to our forecast at the beginning of the year, we are seeing a weaker enterprise segment being partially offset by a stronger-than-expected cloud segment.
The third quarter results and the fourth quarter forecast reinforce our strategy. Despite weakness in the macroeconomic environment and the overall PC market, we are achieving solid financial results as we benefit from the growth in Data Center, Memory and Internet of Things businesses. More importantly, we are building the foundation for future growth. The combination of the 6th Generation Core microprocessor and Windows 10 creates exciting devices for the PC segment. Our investments in leadership in the Data Center are resulting in strong growth. We have a strong and growing memory business, which is well-positioned to disrupt the industry with the launch of 3D XPoint technology. And lastly, we are well positioned to benefit in the Internet of Things market. Our process technology leadership and our broad range of leadership IP creates a competitive advantage that we believe will result in increased shareholder value. And as we complete the Altera acquisition, we expect to broaden our product portfolio and enable even more innovation. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",721

So it sounds like, to paraphrase, it was mostly driven by -- or all driven by CCG, and that was mostly driven by pricing. Is that true?

So yes, the first approximation, the revenue higher than expectations was a result of a richer mix inside the Client Group. You can see the unit and ASP trends in the supplemental materials that I put out. But pretty much to our expectations, it was all due to just a richer mix. We saw strength at the Core i7 level and really across the Core product line as we launched Skylake. The gross margin question, so if you look at the margin recon, what we saw is we saw some good news associated with the richer mix. It was offset by higher 14-nanometer costs than we were anticipating. We were expecting some bad news. We got a little bit more bad news than we anticipated. And that comes down to we actually ramped the Ireland factory a little bit earlier. And the first wafers out of that factory were pretty expensive, and so we saw a mixing up of costs in Q4 a little bit more than we thought -- in Q3 a little bit more than we thought.",181

I think if you take a look at it, there's been a trend this entire year where the mature markets have tended to do -- be the strongest for us, so U.S., Western Europe and Asia, PRC, parts of Eastern Europe, developing countries not being as strong to having some softness. That carried into the third quarter as well. And so if you just take a look at China in general, it kind of mimics that in that if you look at sales, they're down slightly. They're softer. And it's more of the consumer than the enterprise in that space. And across all the different segments, we saw it across the board.",116

And then how sustainable is that ASP increase going forward? As I noticed, you did not put it into your gross margin benefit in the fourth quarter.",76

So on to your first question, the piece of the math you're missing is what's going on in tablets. And while it's a relatively small portion of the business, if you remember, a year ago, we were seeing very significant contra revenue dollars which was coming out of ASP, and those, for the large part, have abated. And so it's that change in tablets that's giving you that average that's higher than both desktop and notebook. We provided it today. If you just look at desktop, the ASP is up about 8% year-on-year and notebook ASP is up about 4% year-on-year, and that's really just mix. And actually, there's a second part of your question.",117

I -- we're shipping a rich mix. It's been true across 2015. If you just -- against a backdrop of a relatively weak PC market, we've seen pockets of strength, and a lot of that's been at the high end. And I think it's coming down to we've got some great technology there. We are doing a reasonably good job of segmenting the product line. So it's not one-size-fits-all anymore, you have all-in-ones and gaming PCs. We've launched a specific line now for gamers, those kinds of things. I think it's likely to stay a fairly rich mix. So it's not in the gross margin recon, it just means we're expecting it to maintain, not necessarily grow from here but also not necessarily come down.",126

And I guess as my follow-up, looking at your MCG, what you used to call the MCG side, and more specifically, the cellular side, you've had another reasonably large player exit that market during this last quarter in Marvell. Can you just give us an update on where you are with your LTE and maybe SoFIA product lines? And strategically, have you noticed any change in that business now that the number of suppliers at the high end seems to be down to 2?",85
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2015",2015-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2841.0,881485.0,37808871.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,16,"Yes. So I think -- so let me start with the first part of your question, which is how is the progress going inside. So we have our 7260 modem that's been shipping throughout this year. There are products throughout the world that are using that modem, including in the U.S. The 7360, which is our next-generation modem, is -- will be shipping by the end of this year, with products to be announced by our customers next year. So the LTE modem ramp, basically, you need to get a yearly cadence with these modems, is going well. SoFIA 3G and the 3G-R, which is the Rockchip version of the SoFIA, is in market today, and you can see tablets and phones with those today. You'll see the first of the SoFIA LTEs next year, first half of next year and the SoFIA LTE with Intel 14-nanometer in the back half of next year. And so those continue on schedule as well. And market dynamics, I guess the way I look at the modem business is it's not really dependent -- it's a competitive market. It's not as much about how many players are in it. There's actually, I think, more than 2. But it's really about keeping that yearly cadence and having the right technologies in place and being competitive. And it doesn't really matter almost how many there are. There'll be somebody there trying to compete with you at that leading edge. But that's where the modem is really driven at that leading edge.",256

It's actually -- it's a pretty specific issue this quarter. We upgraded the configuration of a specific piece of equipment that we were going to buy. We had some delivery slots that were -- towards the end of this year. As we upgraded to a richer configuration, it swapped out the delivery slots from the end of this year to Q1 of next year. So just shifted a few hundred million dollars’ worth of CapEx from 2015 to 2016. In terms of the outlook for next year, we're not providing that forecast now. We'll talk obviously a lot more about that in November. You do have to keep in mind that this was an unusually low year, so I'd expect directionally, CapEx will be up some next year, but we'll talk much more about that in November.",139

For my follow-up, I just want to clarify. So you're essentially holding your Q4 revenue guide effectively unchanged versus what was implied before. We've got Data Center, which is basically lower. PC outlook is still weak, and it seems like the unit outlook there may be lower than it was. Your CapEx cut again, suggesting you don't see the units -- the unit trend improving. Is it fair to say then that, really, the pricing outlook is really all that's kind of helping you support the outlook into Q4? And I guess you sort of talked about -- a little bit on sustainability of that and as you see it. But I guess would you define sort of the, I guess, the outlook on pricing now to be the biggest near-term risk on -- beyond just what the channel's  doing? I guess is pricing the biggest near-term risk in terms of what's driving the business if we're looking over the next couple of quarters as we exit the year?",171

I think first, you made a comment that we're not -- given the CapEx shift, we're not thinking about units growing. Anything we spend in CapEx today is really about capacity, probably more towards the end of next year and maybe even into '17. So you have to always remember, there's this lag. And that's why as we looked at the tool, we actually were making an adjustment on the efficiency of that tool, basically the number of units per tool out, in order to get more capacity when that tool is really required. So I want to just separate that so people don't get the wrong message about the CapEx and what we're viewing the future. If you take a look at Q4, we said that it's actually, relatively a seasonal when you just take a look at the unit level standpoint. So there's a natural decline in the total number of units as you go from Q3 into Q4 based on just the holiday shift. Now we're going to move -- if you take a look at Q4 versus Q3, they're the higher percentage of Skylake, which is our 6th Generation Core as we talked about. And we think there'll be a richer mix as you move into there. So that's kind of how Q4 was laid out. And then as we've said, we're not really talking about '16 yet until -- or 7 -- yes, '16 yet until the investor meeting. But I think we should separate out the CapEx. We've predicted a seasonal Q4 but with a mix that is remaining rich, but that richness is based on both the great products that we've been producing but also a richer percentage of Skylake/Intel 6th Gen Core.",308

And I guess I'd just add. I would just zoom out a little bit on the math. We exited Q3 with healthy worldwide supply chain inventories. We actually think we probably under-shipped the market a little bit in Q3, and we're forecasting a seasonal Q4.

You said in your prepared comments that platform for client was up about 3% on a volume basis. Can you help me better understand what desktops and notebooks did sequentially? Because if I kind of wrecked the year-over-years, I'm getting up high single digits to low double digits sequentially. Is that right? I mean, just relative to your comment about -- earlier about inventory, how does that jive with sort of a lean inventory? Or do you actually feel like Skylake is producing a build or will continue to produce a build into the calendar fourth quarter?",107

We were down 14%, 15% between notebooks and desktops. When you compare that against what the third parties would say happened with the TAM, they're kind of down in the more high single digits. So I think we under-shipped a bit relative to the overall TAM. And when we go do our test of inventory, we come back with healthy inventory levels, if that's what you're getting at.",95

And then, guys, my follow-up, Brian, just on the Data Center Group, you're going to be a little bit shy of the long-term target this year because of macro. Do you have to rethink what that long-term growth rate target should be? And I guess more importantly, at what point is the enterprise part of the business small enough? Because that's actually the most macro sensitive where these macro issues won't kind of be this significant.",79

So I don't want to -- I'm not going to go rethink the long-term growth. We are still very confident that we can keep this over the long term growing at the mid-teens level. You really have to take a look at this, John, over a longer period of time. You can't live in this industry by a quarter. For example, we have talked about enterprise is a bit weak right now, and the cloud has been basically helping us and growing at a rate faster than we'd even projected as we entered this year. But what typically happens in the fourth quarter, the cloud enterprises tend not to do large purchases in the fourth quarter. They have in the past at times but in general don't because they're really fourth quarter is their selling season, and so they don't want to disrupt their systems during that quarter. And then it comes back in the first half of the follow-on year. So there's always this lumpiness to this quarter-by-quarter, and you have to look over a much longer period of time. Your second kind of question built into that is when does cloud and networking and the rest of the infrastructure work? Because I really want to remind people that what we're doing in the Data Center is not only just growing cloud versus enterprise, but we're driving hard into networking. We're driving -- next year, you'll see our photo -- silicon photonics. You'll see FPGAs with Altera. So it's a broad spectrum of products as we increase our footprint in the Data Center. We haven't set a date for when those are big enough that they offset enterprise, but it's not long. It's in the near future that we can offset enterprise weakness.",295

I'll ask a couple longer-term things. First, I guess, Brian, on the NAND market, obviously this has been a terrific market for you guys. There's a lot going on there. There's a lot of growth opportunities commensurate with what's going on in the Data Center. There seems to be a lot of consternation next year about which of the various players are going to do what and potential consolidation on the industry. Maybe you could just give us an update on how the NAND market looks to you as you go out to 2016 and where you see the opportunities and what kind of investments you think you'll need to make there.",124
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2015",2015-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2841.0,881485.0,37808887.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,32,"Sure, Jim. So let's start at kind of the macro level and then work our way down. As you said, the Non-Volatile business has been very good to us and it's grown at a better rate than we've even anticipated as we entered the year. You need to remember that more than 80% of what we sell are enterprise SSDs that are going into those data centers. So we've made a very tight connection. When we think of our NAND business, we think of it tied very closely to our Data Center business. And in fact, we try and build a lot of synergy on the products, the efficiencies, the performance of these products as we go to market and in how we go talk to our customers. If we take a look at next year, it's really the ramp of 3D -- our 3D NAND process, and that, we believe, gives us a performance and cost advantage over the competition. I'm very comfortable with where we are positioned for next year from that perspective. In addition, we talked about our 3D XPoint, which is really a transformational product for the memory market. What we said was we'd start shipping limited engineering samples end of this year. You've seen onstage, we showed at IDF and a couple of other places now, working products with benchmarks. We'll continue to show more and more of those as we go through this year, and we'll start shipping product for that next year. So as I look out in next year and beyond, it really becomes the 3D NAND driving the real high-volume, better cost and performance enterprise SSDs and then 3D XPoint really transforming how memory and storage work together. And again, we'll target the Data Center and have that very close cross link between these. But I think 3D XPoint, you'll actually see in many, many other products as the value of both memory, storage and performance start to play out in a variety of applications, IoT, mobile, all over the place.",340

Maybe for a follow-up, I'll kind of ask about one of the other longer-term drivers that you've talked about, the foundry business, to kind of offset what you expect to be continued declines in the PC unit business over time or continued slow growth in that business over time. So you've talked about NAND. You've also talked about foundry. If you could give us a little bit of an update on the thoughts around foundry. Bringing Altera in-house, notwithstanding, do you still see incremental growth opportunities in that space even though a lot of them, you can't really talk about too much publicly?",107

So I know last year, on a quarterly basis, you were losing about 1 to $1 billion a quarter in MCG. And this year, you have made improvements of $800 million for the year. So on a quarterly basis, Stacy, is it reasonable to assume that the loss there is less than $900 million? So as you make improvements, it continues to be a source of accretion to your EPS.",97

We've completely reorganized. We no longer have the MCG segment. So when we talk about this, we want to talk about it in the context of the commitments we made to improve the overall profitability of our mobile business broadly. We're well on track to the commitment that we made at the beginning of the year. As Brian said, we've kind of zoomed up to having achieved 75% of the overall target. I did say it was a little bit back-end-loaded. So if you were doing your quarterly math, you'd probably get to a little bit -- it wouldn't be linear. You get to a little bit of a bigger reduction as we move into the back half relative to the first half because the contra revenue dollars really ramped up for us as we brought SoFIA into the marketplace, and that was more of a back half phenomenon for us.",158

At the heart of your question, what's driving the upside? I really think a lot of it is segmentation. And it's interesting. If you use our desktop business as a proxy, we've been in a low unit growth environment for a while, kind of slightly down, slightly up kind of thing. This year, down a bit more. But we've managed to maintain the profitability of that business because we -- we're seeing a lot more segmentation of the business. You still have the first-time buyer PCs that happen in emerging markets. But increasingly, there's relatively expensive PCs that provide a lot of value to the consumer and all-in-ones and we now see dedicated gaming PCs that are doing quite well and those kind of things. So I think the future for us is more segmentation of our product line. I think that helps us both from the standpoint of volume, mix and should give us some opportunities in terms of pricing.",177

First off, congrats on getting the 75% target of the $800 million savings. Do you want to introduce a new target given that you are so far along in this? And just to try to get a handle on how much more cost reduction or what your strategy is really going forward with the mobility side of the business. The tablet units look like they did soften here. So my question really is, what's your target for your mobility IP?",104
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2015",2015-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2841.0,881485.0,37808897.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,42,"So let me start with a bit about the strategy and then -- and we can then lay out. I think Stacy gave you some indication that we're well on our way. And in fact, if you take a look at it, it's nonlinear. So we should be handily hitting the $800 million and probably slightly above that number. How much, we're not going to forecast that right now. Our strategy, really, when you -- and as we get into the Investor Meeting, we'll talk about next year. But you can assume we'll have another goal next year where we do another reduction and prove the P&L. That's fundamental as we said we were going to go into this business to make money and we have to get there. So that is absolutely the fundamental strategy. That said, what we said around mobility is that on tablets, we'd pretty much keep our share and our position in the market relatively equal to where it was, like everybody sees tablets have shrunk this year as a category. And so we've been careful about not chasing the bottom as prices dropped, figuring out where the value is, where we can go in and make a little bit of money and actually add some innovation. So you're going to see some tablets as we go towards the holidays with things like RealSense in them that allow people new usages and new applications. And as we go into '16, you'll see more of that. On phones, it's the same thing. We're being even more careful there, doing partnerships with people, where we can go in, we can provide innovation and the right cost model, make some money for both us and our partners. And we've been very, very careful, and that's why we've actually said our bigger, longer-term strategy there is modems to the general phone market and then partnerships for specific products. And that's the Spreadtrum and Rockchip partnerships that we have right now.",331

All these markets, there's always been a competitor. And whether you look in the PC market or whether you look in the Data Center market or any of these, there's been competitors. We've worked our way up in this position. And our goal is always to continuously push the product performance. And -- well, the way we think about it is, really, what does it take to replace ourselves even in this market, especially the Data Center? Where is -- how do we do a total cost of ownership such that it pays to go to our next-generation in both footprint, cost of operation and performance? All of those things are what we drive. That and system integration, right, the whole Rack Scale Architecture and doing system integration such that it's simpler, quicker and cheaper for people to install a cloud-based system. We really focus on those and just really trying to have the best performance we can in that space. And there will always be competitors, and our goal is to just consistently outperform. And there will be new entrants and old entrants all along trying to win share away from us, and that's going to be a norm.",202

Brian, every year, we're looking for -- calling for a bottom in PCs. And last year, even though units were better than expected, they were still down. This year, it's obviously been weaker, but now we're at the point where you look at the supply chain, as you guys characterized, it's fairly lean. You've got a new operating system from Windows plus Skylake. And so it just seems like all the pieces are there for PCs to finally bottom, but I wanted to gauge your confidence.",94

We have our 6th Generation Core Skylake in place. We have a lot of innovation from the OEMs. We have some additional product like -- or innovation like RealSense. You'll see some unique memory architectures next year. Even 3D XPoint gets into this space. So I do think that there's a good point for optimism. That said, some of these transitions are going to take some time. And so I'm very cautious of people to say, ""How fast and when?"" So if you take a look at it, there's the ability to do Windows 10 upgrades today but actual on-shelf new system isn't until later this month. So it's not until later this month that actually you can walk into the store and get an on-shelf system with Win 10. Enterprises will go, I think, quicker to Win 10 than some of the prior generations of Windows. But still, enterprise takes a while to do these kinds of conversions. So it'll be into next year, those conversions. So I do see that this is a great opportunity and that we should see some tailwinds pushing us in the PC market. But it's going to be over time. It's not going to be, boy, next quarter, it jumps. So I kind of want to lay out that it's going to be over this next year or so, that it takes to get this transition through.",263

In a time period where PC units are down in the high single digits at the TAM level, we still get enough growth from the Data Center and the Memory business and the Internet of Things to pretty much tread water in terms of revenue growth, right? And you can see it in our results in Q3. In fact, you can see it in our results for the year. If PC units are down in the mid-single-digits, we actually grow at a pretty fast pace. And if we get into a world where PC units are flat, we're growing at a very fast pace. That's kind of fixing the growth rate for everything else, but it's a good way to think about what our strategy is and how we're driving the business. So we don't really need unit growth to grow the company at a fast pace because we're much less dependent on the PC segment than we've historically been. And our growth really comes from the Data Center as a very large business, and then we're investing in things like Memory and the Internet of Things business that we think will add some growth to that.",229

We were 63% in Q3 of this year. And the units are down some from last year. We've talked about this is a weaker TAM. So that's one piece. But the bigger piece is 14-nanometer costs. And you're right, we're coming down the cost curve pretty rapidly on 14-nanometer, but it's becoming a richer and richer percentage of the overall shipment mix. And 14-nanometer still is more than 22-nanometer. So we've seen a little bit of a mix-up in terms of costs as we've worked our way through 2015.",116

Just in that bucket, are you starting to see the weakness spread out into different geographic regions? Or is it still mostly isolated in China relative to your original expectations?",48

And that is consistent with what we see now. The -- I just want to come back to what Brian said earlier, that the overall enterprise segment is weak. And when you look at it, it -- that correlates very closely for us over time with GDP growth rates. And the GDP growth rates are quite a bit less than we thought when we started the year. We're offsetting much of that. In fact, we're offsetting most of that by a cloud growth rate that's significantly more than we thought when we started the year. So general macroeconomic weakness, it's pronounced in China, but we see it elsewhere in the enterprise segment, being offset by, I'd say, torrid growth rates in cloud computing. And we'll share more on that when we get to November.",155
