21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096886.0,Presenter Speech,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,2,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 revenue came in at the low end of guide and was impacted by persistent macro headwinds, which began in Q2 and underscored a 2022 characterized by unprecedented volatility, which will continue in the near term. 
We made meaningful progress on several fronts in calendar year '22, notwithstanding all the challenges, but we readily admit our results and our Q1 guidance are below what we expected ourselves. We are working diligently to address the challenges brought on by current demand trends and remain confident in our long-term plans and trajectory. 
Accordingly, we are even more aggressively executing on the cost measures we described in Q3 even as we keep the investments critical to our long-term transformation intact with a clear eye of making the right capital allocation decision to drive the most long-term value. 
Today, I'd like to address 3 areas. One, our view on the macro and the markets in which we participate; two, the operational progress we made in 2022; three, as we enter the new year outlining the commitments we are making to all our stakeholders. 
First, on the macro. We expect macro weakness to persist at least through the first half of the year with the possibility of second half improvements. However, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we are not going to provide revenue guidance beyond Q1. Dave will provide guidelines for capital spending, depreciation and adjusted free cash flow in his prepared comments. 
Having said that, let me give you additional color regarding our view of our markets in 2023. To various degrees, all our markets are being impacted by macro uncertainty, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe and COVID impacts in Asia, especially in China. 
In the PC market, we saw a further deterioration as we ended calendar year '22. In Q3, we provided an estimate for the calendar year '23 PC consumption TAM of 270 million to 295 million units. Given continued uncertainty and demand signals we see in Q1, we expect the lower end of that range is a more likely outcome. Near term, the PC ecosystem continues to deplete inventory. 
For all of calendar year '22, our sell-in was roughly 10% below consumption with Q4 under-shipping meaningfully higher than full year, and Q1 expected to grow again to represent the most significant inventory digestion in our data set. While we know this dynamic will need to reverse, predicting one is difficult. 
Importantly, PC usage data remains strong, reinforcing that use cases brought on by COVID are persistent even as the economy has reopened. And as we highlighted in our recent PC webinar, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels and what we see as a conservative refresh rate, supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units plus or minus, post this period of adjustment. 
We intend to capitalize on this TAM through a strong pipeline of innovation and based on the growing strength of our product portfolio, customers are increasingly betting on Intel. We grew share in the second half of '22, and we expect that positive momentum to continue in '23. 
We remain clear eyed on managing to near-term weakness in PCs but we also see the enduring and increasing value PCs have in our daily lives. 
In the server market, the overall consumption TAM grew modestly in calendar year '22, albeit at diminishing rates as the year progressed. Inventory burn drove server CPU shipments down mid-single digits year-on-year in calendar year '22 with hyperscale up, offset by declines in enterprise and Rest of World. 
Our share in calendar year '22 was in line with our subdued expectations, and our revenue volatility was a function of TAM, especially given our outsized exposure to enterprise and China. We expect Q1 server consumption TAM to decline both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate with first half '23 server consumption TAM down year-on-year before returning to growth in the second half. 
While all segments have weakened, enterprise and rest of world, especially China, continues to be weaker than hyperscale. However, we'd highlight that the correction in enterprise and rest of the world, where we have stronger positions, are further along than hyperscale. 
Lastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure, demand trends throughout calendar year '22 were strong but not completely immune to the macro volatility. Strong demand in these markets was mirrored by strong Q4 and record calendar year '22 revenue in NEX, PSG, IFS and Mobileye. We see calendar year '23 as another growth year for us in these areas even though the absolute rate is difficult to predict today. 
This is in contrast to the semi market ex-memory, which third parties expect to decline low to mid-single digits. We entered 2023 with a view that much of the macro uncertainty of the last year is likely to persist, especially in the first half of the year. As such, we are laser-focused on executing to our $3 billion in calendar year '23 cost savings that we committed on our Q3 earnings call. 
We are making tough decisions to right-size the organization and we further sharpened our business focus within our BUs by rationalizing product road maps and investments. 
NEX continues to do well and is a core part of our strategic transformation, but we will end future investments in our network switching product line, while still fully supporting existing products and customers. Since my return, we have exited 7 businesses, providing in excess of $1.5 billion in savings. 
We are also well underway to integrating AXG into CCG and DCAI, respectively, to drive a more effective go-to-market capability, accelerating the scale of these businesses while further reducing costs. While it was important to focus on what we are doing to address the current macro uncertainty, it is also important to highlight that despite disappointing financial results, calendar year '22 did see considerable progress towards our transformation. We remain fully committed to executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. Success starts with our people and execution follows culture. 
In calendar year '22, we took important strides to rebuild the leadership team, promoting from within and adding fresh perspectives from the outside. This includes the Board of Directors with the addition of Lip-Bu Tan and Barbara Novick, both of whom have already made significant contributions and the appointment of Frank Yeary as Chair. 
In addition, a year ago, we reestablished OKRs to drive accountability and transparency across the organization, and we reintroduced Tick-Tock 2 to establish a rigorous methodology of design and product development. Both are key spark plugs to our execution engine. 
Rebuilding the culture has begun to show benefits in manufacturing and design. Our progress against our TD road map continue to improve throughout calendar year '22, and every quarter, our confidence grows. We are at/or ahead of our goal of 5 nodes in 4 years. Intel 7 is now in high-volume manufacturing for both client and server. On Intel 4, we are ready today for manufacturing, and we look forward to the Meteor Lake ramp in second half of the year. 
Intel 3 continues to show great health and is on track. Intel 4 and 3 are our first modes deploying EUV, and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density. 
On Intel 20A and Intel 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFETs and PowerVia, internal test chips and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with the silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. 
Progress in TD continues to be validated by our IFS pipeline. I am happy that we were able to add a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider as a leading edge customer for Intel 3. Including prior customers, such as MediaTek, we now have lifetime deal value of greater than $4 billion for IFS. 
We also have an active pipeline engagements with 7 out of the 10 largest foundry customers coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 43 potential customers and ecosystem partner test chips. Additionally, we continue to make progress on Intel18A, and I've already shared the engineering release of PDK 0.5 with our lead customers and expect to have the final production release in the next few weeks. 
In addition, we are working hard to complete the Tower acquisition, which will further amplify our momentum as our foundry business becomes even more compelling to customers. 
On the product front, the PRQ of Sapphire Rapids in Q3 and the formal introduction of our fourth gen Xeon scalable CPU and Xeon CPU MAX series better known to many of you as U.S. Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, respectively, on January 10 was a great milestone. It was particularly satisfying to host a customer-centered events, including testimonials from Dell, Google Cloud, HPE, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA, among many others. 
We are thrilled to be ramping production to meet a strong backlog of demand, and we are on track to ship 1 million units by midyear. In addition, as part of AXG moves into DCAI, it is noteworthy that our Intel Flex series, optimized for and showing clear leadership in media stream density and visual quality, is now shifting initial deployments with large CSPs and MNCs, enabling large-scale cloud gaming and media delivery deployments. 
Our DCAI road map only improves from here and will ramp into sampling and has completed power on with top OEM and CSP customers, and it remains on track to launch in the second half of 2023. Granite Rapids, our next performance core addition to the Xeon portfolio, is on track to launch in 2024, running multiple operating systems across many different configurations. 
Further, our first efficient core product, CR4, is also on track for 2024. Lastly, it is appropriate to continue to highlight PSG for its standout performance delivering record Q4 revenue up 42% year-on-year. We are planning to have a more fulsome look at our progress in DCAI at our next investor webinar later in Q1. Stay tuned for the invitation. 
In CCG, we continue to build on our market share momentum across the PC stack by focusing on delivering leadership products with our broad, open ecosystem. I'm particularly pleased that our clear performance leadership at the high end drove record client ASPs in the quarter. In Q4, the 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family, codename, Raptor Lake, became available, starting with the desktop K processors and the Intel Z 790 chipset. 
In partnership with ASUS, we officially set a new world record for overclocking, pushing the 13th Gen Intel Core past the 9 gigahertz barrier for the first time ever. Hands down, we provide desktop enthusiasts and gamers with the best processors and features for overclocking in the PC industry. 
We also introduced our notebook Raptor Lake family at CES, including the world's fastest notebook CPU and the first 24 cores. We look forward to ramping the more than 300 mobile design wins we have already secured in the first half of '23. 
Meteor Lake, our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, remains on track for the second half of the year. And with Meteor Lake progressing well, it's now appropriate to look forward to Lunar Lake, which is on track for production readiness in 2024, having taped out its first silicon. Lunar Lake is optimized for ultra-low power performance, which will enable more of our PC partners to create ultrathin and light systems for mobile users. In addition, as we outlined on our webinar, we are excited by the strength of the Evo brand. The introduction of Unison for leadership multi-device experience as we ramp the more than 60 design wins and the uniqueness of vPro in the enterprise market, helping our customers drive an almost 200% return on investment by deploying vPro platforms to their end users. 
Lastly, as consumer graphics reintegrate into CCG, enthusiasm for our latest Alchemist-based discrete graphics products continue to build and we expect volume ramp throughout the year. 
Turning to NEX and Mobileye. Both businesses have performed well in Q4 and calendar year '22, partially insulated by some of the market forces impacting PCs and server, any exit key product milestones with Mount Evans, Raptor Lake P&S, and Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids to drive a second consecutive year of double-digit year-on-year growth in calendar year '22. We expect market share gains and outperformance to continue in '23. 
Mobileye increased revenue by almost 60% year-on-year in Q4 and is on a solid growth path for calendar year '23. Calendar year '22 design wins, including SuperVision, are projected to generate future revenue of approximately $6.7 billion across 64 million units. 
In addition, our manufacturing organization performed well throughout calendar year '22. Starting the year navigating the worst supply-constrained environment in over 20 years, only to have to pivot in Q2 to respond to rapidly changing demand signals, which are now driving near-term underloading in our factory network. More importantly, we continue to push forward with the next phase of IDM 2.0, creating an internal foundry evolving our systems business practices and culture to establish a leadership cost structure. This new approach is already gaining momentum internally. 
As a reminder, the internal foundry model will place our BUs in a similar economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have identified 9 different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. 
In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. 
We'll also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L in calendar year '24. Ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are allocating your capital and creating value. 
We expect additional efficiencies as we implement our internal foundry model, which is a key element to accomplish our $8 billion to $10 billion of cost savings exiting 2025, as we outlined on our last call. 
I want to remind everyone that we are on a multiyear journey. We remain focused on the things that are within our control as we navigate short-term headwinds while executing to our long-term strategy. While I remain sober that we have a long way to achieve our financial expectations, I am pleased with the transformation progress that we are making. 
I can tell you, in addition to obviously focusing on the day-to-day running of the company, we continue to examine numerous additional value-creating initiatives for 2023 as we always do. We will update you as we move along on any we deem appropriate. 
Rest assured, we remain committed to creating value for our owners and to delivering the long-term strategic road map we laid out at the beginning of this journey, and we are confident in our ability to do so. We will: one, deliver on 5 nodes in 4 years, achieving process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A; two, execute on an aggressive Sapphire Rapids ramp, introduced Emerald Rapids in second half '23 and Granite Rapids and CR4s in 2024; three, ramp Meteor Lake in second half '23 and PRQ Lunar Lake in 2024; and four, expand our IFS customer base to include large design wins on Intel 16, Intel 3 and 18A this year. 
We also need to improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency. On this front, we will: one, return to profitability and deliver the benefits of our calendar year '23, '24 and '25 efforts to reduce costs and drive efficiencies; two, execute on our internal foundry P&L by 2024; and three, expand on the use of our smart capital strategy to leverage multiple pools of capital, including SCIPs and chips in the U.S. and Europe to balance our long-term capacity aspirations with near-term realities. 
Before I turn it over to Dave, I'm going to close by saying we take our commitments to all our stakeholders extremely seriously and, ultimately, we strive to create value for each of them. For our customers, it is rebuilding our execution engine to provide a predictable cadence of best-in-class products to support their ambitions. 
For our employees, it is to provide them with the opportunity to develop and bring to market world-changing technologies. It is what inspires each of us inside of the company. 
For our external owners, it is to make thoughtful, deliberate decisions around capital allocation, which drives the highest return on investment we make with your capital. Our ambitions are equaled by our passion, and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IBM 2.0.",2847
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096887.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We saw solid business execution in the fourth quarter despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. As Pat indicated, we expect challenging macro conditions to continue through at least the first half of the year.
As outlined last quarter, we'll continue to prioritize investments critical to our transformation, prudently and aggressively managed expenses near term and drive fundamental improvements in our cost structure longer term. We're executing well towards our $3 billion target in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting '25.
Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, landing at the low end of our range and down 8% sequentially. Revenue from DCAI and NEX were in line with expectations, while CCG was impacted by softening demand for PCs. Gross margin for the quarter was 44%, slightly better than we had expected for the low end of our revenue range.
Q4 gross margins were impacted 220 basis points from factory underload charges offsetting a sequential 170 basis point benefit from an insurance settlement. EPS for the quarter was $0.10. $0.10 below our guide on lower revenue and increased inventory reserves.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $7.7 billion. Net CapEx was $4.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $3.1 billion and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. We finished FY '22 with revenue of $63.1 billion, gross margin of 47.3% and EPS of $1.84. We generated $15.4 billion of cash from operations and an adjusted free cash flow of approximately negative $4 billion at the low end of the range we provided last quarter, despite approximately $3 billion of capital incentives that shifted from Q4 into 2023.
When we spoke at Investor Day last February, we forecasted revenue of $76 billion and adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to $2 billion for FY '22. As macroeconomic conditions deteriorated at a rapid pace in second half of '22, we committed to optimizing the areas of the business within our control.
Through reductions in spending and significant working capital improvements, we offset a $13 billion reduction to revenue expectations to come within $2 billion of our initial adjusted free cash flow guide, while still making the needed capital investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy, and to position ourselves for long-term growth in a market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030.
Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $28 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade profile.
Moving to fourth quarter business unit results. CCG revenue was $6.6 billion, a decline of 36% year-over-year as PC TAM deteriorated faster than expected due to macroeconomic headwinds. Customer inventory remains elevated beyond our previous expectations and will continue to burn into the first half of '23.
CCG realized record CPU ASPs, up 11% year-over-year as we continue to see relative strength in our premium segments driven by leadership performance and attractive features of our Evo and vPro platforms. Q4 operating profit was $0.7 billion, down year-over-year on lower revenue and increased Intel 7 product mix.
DCAI revenue was $4.3 billion in Q4, up 2% sequentially with higher ASPs offsetting demand softness and down 33% year-over-year driven by TAM contraction and competitive pressure. DCAI operating profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million.
While still unsatisfactory, profit was up more than $350 million sequentially on reduced factory costs. Operating profit was down substantially year-over-year, impacted by lower revenue, increased advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs.
Within DCAI, PSG achieved record Q4 revenue, up 42% year-over-year, along with record full year revenue, up 29% year-over-year through increased ASPs, improved external supply and strength in the infrastructure segment. PSG enters 2023 with still significant unfulfilled backlog.
NEX quarterly revenue was $2.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year as declining global GDP impacted the Edge business, offsetting growth in Xeon network CPUs and the ramp of our Mount Evans infrastructure processing unit.
Despite second half macro headwinds, NEX set another full year record revenue at $8.9 billion up 11% year-over-year and marking consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter, down year-on-year on mix shift to lower-margin segments and higher factory start-up costs.
AXG achieved record quarterly revenue of $247 million, up 34% sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year, supported by the launch of Sapphire Rapids HBM. Operating loss was $441 million, down $63 million sequentially, with inventory valuations negatively impacted by softer demand, especially for crypto processors.
Mobileye delivered another record revenue quarter of $565 million, up 26% sequentially and growth of more than $200 million and 59% year-over-year. Full year revenue of $1.9 billion was also a record for Mobileye, growing 35% year-over-year.
Fourth quarter operating income of $210 million represents 71% growth year-over-year. IFS achieved record quarterly revenue of $319 million, up 87% sequentially and 30% year-over-year on increased automotive shipments. Operating loss was $31 million, a $72 million improvement sequentially on higher revenue.
We continue to reshape the company to drive to world-class product costs and operational efficiency. We remain committed to the $3 billion of '23 cost savings outlined on our Q3 earnings call, while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation and ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth.
Before turning to Q1 guidance, let me take a moment to discuss an accounting change that will impact our results beginning in the first quarter. Effective January 23, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. This change better reflects the demonstrated economic value of our machinery and equipment over time and is more aligned with the business model changes inherent to our IDM 2.0 strategy.
The growth of the IFS deal pipeline will extend the life of manufacturing nodes beyond what was practical within IDM 1.0. Disaggregated CPU architecture allows performance and cost optimization for each chiplet, better leveraging older nodes. And we are optimizing our core business around more sustainable capacity quarters to improve equipment utilization and maximize ROIC.
The change will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 '23. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of '22, we expect total depreciation expense in '23 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion. An approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expense and a $1.2 billion decrease in ending inventory values. This change will not be counted towards the $3 billion short-term or $8 billion to $10 billion long-term structural cost improvements we committed last quarter, and is intended to provide the most accurate reflection of company financial results to our owners.
Now turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect first quarter revenue of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. In addition to continued macro headwinds, we expect customers will burn inventory at a meaningfully faster pace than the prior few quarters in response to macro TAM softness impacting CCG, DCAI, NEX lines of business.
We see potential for market conditions to improve faster than typical seasonality as third-party data shows macro headwinds easing in the second half of the year. While we're progressing toward a $3 billion spending reduction with significant austerity across the company, given the fixed cost nature of our business, we expect the sequential revenue decline will result in negative operating margin in the first quarter.
We're forecasting gross margin of 39%, a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.15 at the midpoint of revenue guidance, inclusive of $350 million to $500 million of operating margin benefit from the useful life accounting change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to OpEx. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q1 gross margin by 400 basis points.
We continue to evaluate all investments and will remain laser-focused on optimizing for ROI, adjusting for market conditions across operating expenses and capital assets.
While we're not providing guidance beyond Q1, I'll touch on a few elements of our outlook. At Investor Day, we noted that during the investment phase of IDM 2.0, from 2022 through 2024, our model was to operate at approximately 35% net capital intensity.
For FY '23, despite the lower revenue level, we expect to be at or below the 35% model. Embedded in our assumptions are capital offsets of around 20% to 30% of growth CapEx including our innovative SCIP partnership with Brookfield. We expect FY '23 operating expenses of under $20 billion, a roughly 10% year-over-year decline, consistent with committed cost-cutting measures totaling $2 billion, adjusting for the depreciation change.
Adjusted free cash flow will be below our Investor Day guide of approximately neutral in the first half of '23 and return back towards guardrails in second half '23.
In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model we laid out at Investor Day last year. The opportunity for strong revenue growth across our business unit portfolio and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. While we're not satisfied with near-term results, this market downturn represents an opportunity to accelerate the transformation necessary to achieve our long-term goals. I look forward to providing updates on our transformation journey as the year progresses.

So you want to go first? Okay. So let me -- I'll start, and Pat is going to add some color. So on the $11 billion, we're expecting most of the business units to be down sequentially, double digits. We're not going to provide guidance for the rest of the year. But I did say that the first half is likely to be seeing these inventory corrections.
The other thing I would just add, is maybe color to kind of position the year, is that we're expecting Q1 to be the most significant inventory decline at our customers that we've seen in recent history. So it's -- if you look back over the last 4 or 5 quarters of reduction, this will be meaningfully higher than all of those quarters. So obviously, that is impacting the Q1 outlook.",139

And clearly, as we look at Q1, affected by macro significant inventory adjustments, and that's affecting clearly clients but also data center as well. And we do see that year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter data center to be down as well. And we think that's a macro statement across all segments, across cloud, enterprise, government and uniquely China.
Part of our more positive expectation for the second half of the year is clearly from our customers and what we've heard from them but also we expected some level of recovery from China as well. So overall, clearly, a major inventory correction cycle and coming after back-to-school and how they refresh our customers clearly wanting to take more aggressive steps as they adjust.
But that inventory adjustment is well below their sell-out rates. So for that, we do believe that we will see recovery as they have made those inventory adjustments, and we'll see the business be stronger as we go through the year.",161

Quickly, Dave, I want to pivot to the gross margin side of things, excluding the change in the depreciable life side of the equation, I know revenue is the biggest headwind right now. But you had talked at the Investor Day last year about a 51% to 53% gross margin range and kind of you want to operate within those bands.
What does it take to get back to that? Is there a revenue level? Do you have to be above $17 billion, $18 billion? Are there offsets? Any sort of framework you can give to give investors confidence that -- we never thought we'd see a 3 handle on your gross margin. And so we really want to know what it's going to take to get back to a 5 handle, and if that's significantly changed from the last framework that you provided us.",147
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096895.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,11,"Yes, good question. So obviously, revenue is the most significant impact to gross margins. We obviously did not expect to be down at these levels. That said, it's a function of some significant inventory burn. So it's not necessarily a reflection of the demand in the market. So obviously, we would expect that to corroborate at some point, which will be a significant lift to the gross margins.
The other thing is, in the first quarter, we're going to have about a 400 basis point impact on our gross margins just from underloading because of the demand softness. And we would expect loadings to improve once we get past the inventory correction we're currently experiencing.
In addition to that, we have a number of initiatives underway to improve gross margins, and we're well underway. When you look at the $3 billion reduction that we talked about for '23, $1 billion of that is in cost of sales, and we're well underway on our way to getting that $1 billion.
And then when you click it further into the $8 billion to $10 billion that we want to hit by the end of 2025, about 66% of that, 2/3 of that is cost of sales improvement. And we're getting a lot of that from our internal foundry model that Pat mentioned. We're already seeing significant opportunities to be efficient, more efficient between our business units and our factories. And I think we'll have a lot of things to say over the course of this year about areas that we see meaningful improvement.
Also, we have smart capital that was modest in '22, it's going to be more significant in '23 and much of that smart capital does translate to a better cost structure for us that will help gross margin. So net of that, I feel very confident we will get back to 51% to 53% in the medium term. And in the long term, I feel very confident we will get back to 54% to 58%. And I think Pat said it in the past, we aim to beat that range.",351

I'm trying to understand whether the demand assumptions are not what they should be, right? Or is it the supply assumptions? So when you say that the consumption this year will be $270 million, right, which is the low end, how do we know that for sure? What if the consumption rate is much lower than that? So just how many weeks of DC microprocessor inventory is there? And do you think Q1 is that clearing quarter? Or you think even in Q2 you could be shipping below consumption levels?",105
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096899.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,15,"So overall, as we said, we saw the range 270 million, 295 million. We believe the sell-through rate will be to the lower end of that. The consumption that we saw in Q4 was well below that and the consumption rate or the sell-in rate in Q1 is even more significantly almost 2x more significant below the consumption rate. Obviously, these are the macro effects that we can't predict, and that's what's taken us a bit more to the low end of the range. But clearly, as we've been working with our customers and channel partners, we've been monitoring very carefully the sellout that they've seen. So we're pretty comfortable with that range.
Also, we would point to China and a very unique circumstance there, as is well known. And we do expect that there'll be some level of economic recovery there, particularly we forecasted in the second half of the year. And this is a topic that we continue to work closely with our customers.
That said, overall, and as we updated on our PC webinar, we do expect that the long-term market is in the 300 million unit range. So as we overcome this inventory adjustment cycle, and some of this near-term economic. And I think as you heard from Microsoft, PC usage is up, the number of hours per PC continues to be up. The installed base has gone up. So all of those factors give us reasonable confidence that post this period of inventory correction that will have a very healthy 300 million unit plus or minus market that we're selling into.",266

Second question is on the data center. Historically, the semiconductor market likes incumbency, and there is only a share shift if and when the incumbent messes up. And right now, your competitor seems to be becoming a larger incumbent in a lot of cloud deployments, doesn't seem to be messing up. Doesn't it make it harder to displace them? I'm just curious at what edge do you think Intel has to change the status quo of share shift in cloud server? Do you think your design will get noticeably better? Is it architecture? Is it manufacturing? What helps you specifically to change this current momentum of share shift in cloud servers, specifically?",113
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096902.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,18,"Yes. Thank you. And I think the most important thing is what we just did with Sapphire Rapids, right? Our customers were anxious for a great product from Intel. Obviously, we would have liked it to be earlier as we had initially estimated, but we are now shipping a very high-quality product with significant areas of leadership in areas like AI performance, power performance, security feature function, high-performance computing workflows that are 5x the competition and features in areas like confidential computing and security that are quite differentiated from anything in the marketplace.
Obviously, share shift, right, particularly in the data center space, these designs were 1 a year ago, right, or 2 years ago. And so it takes some amount of time. And against that, we're seeing a very strong outlook for Sapphire Rapids ramp through the year, as I said, 1 million units in the middle of the year. So very strong demand from our customers.
And the other thing, as we've indicated, is have we rewon our customers' confidence that they could bet on our road map. And then we'll ramp it looking very healthy for later this year. Granite Rapids and CR4 is looking very healthy for next year. And all of those, I believe, are rebuilding our customers' confidence. And I believe with that, given the massive incumbency that Intel has, and I would just emphasize that even though we have seen the share shift in recent sell-in, the installed base is Intel, right?
There's an enormous on some -- many of the cloud customers, 95-plus percent of their installed base is Intel. That gives us a very strong incumbency that we get to renew as we rebuild our customers' confidence. So as you put all of those things together, yes, we realize that we stumble, right? We lost share. We lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year, and we're going to be building a road map that allows us to regain leadership for the long term in this critical market.",337

I know you don't want to guide for the full year, but you did say that 20% to 30% of the gross CapEx, whatever the number is this year is going to be offsets. I know you don't have a lot of visibility on the chips money you're going to get. But it seems like best case, revenue is going to be in the mid-50s roughly. And if I take a little less than 35% of that, because you said that it's still going to be 35% or less, that will be the net CapEx intensity. And I sort of divide the numbers, it implies a gross CapEx number, something in the range of $20 billion, give or take. Can you sort of help us just handicap that number?",136
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096905.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,21,"Yes. So let me see if I can -- obviously, we're trying to avoid guiding beyond the first quarter given the murkiness. I would just say we are very focused on the appropriate level of investment necessary for the long-term strategy of IDM 2.0 while being very thoughtful around how much CapEx we spend to manage our free cash flow. I think Smart Capital offsets will be pretty healthy this year, much better than last year. Partly, that's because we'll be fully along with SCIPs 1 with our partnership with Brookfield.
We are expecting grant incentives to be a part of this year's Smart capital offsets. And so those -- and then lastly, we do have already in place the investment tax credit, which could have some benefit to us this year. So certainly, Smart capital will be healthy, but we are being very prudent around our gross capital spend through the year. And we'll -- as we kind of progress through the year, we'll see how things develop, and we'll -- you can expect us to manage it accordingly.
I think most importantly, we did not expect to be at this revenue level, obviously, for '23 when we talked about this net CapEx intensity of 35%. And yet we still maintain the discipline to stay at or below that 35% for the year. And I think that's what investors should take away from that message.",236

Also, I'd just add, we do -- and Dave sort of implied it, but we do expect to do SCIP 2 this year as well, which is another source and also the credit center clearly there's motivation on the part of commerce to get that underway and the rules making in place in the near future and start to dispense funds this year.
Also, I'd point to Europe as well. So it's EU chips as well as U.S. chip. So all of those efforts are part of Smart capital for us. We do believe that we'll have the capital necessary to meet both our near-term but more importantly, the strategic long-term investments. And that's what we say we're on track with IDM 2.0. We're on track with the capital, the builds that allow us to restore leadership in our process technology as well as have the factory capacity to both deliver that for our products as well as for our foundry customers.",163

Dave, can you just sort of walk through maybe some of the gross margin puts and takes. I know that, again, you don't want to guide for the full year. But can you just help us think about what some of the puts and takes might be? I mean obviously, as volumes grow, that will help gross margin. But are there any other puts and takes that you would sort of call out for us?",78
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096909.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,25,"Yes. I think clearly, revenue is going to be the most significant driver of gross margins. We're a high-fixed cost model. So we suffer the consequence of that, obviously, when revenue is declining, but we also get the benefit when revenue is expanding. And so what will -- what is currently a headwind does turn to a tailwind as the business recovers.
The second most significant impact we have is the underload charges. So that's 400 basis points or so this quarter. And we'll make a determination as to what loading makes sense for the second quarter as we get closer to the second quarter. But we're doing this to be appropriate in terms of our management of cash flow. But again, as business conditions adjust, we will start loading the fab at a higher rate, and that will improve gross margins.
I think beyond that, it really is around a lot of the cost initiatives we have underway. It's the $3 billion for 2023, and it's the $8 billion to $10 billion improvement over the course of the next few years that really will help drive the costs and drive the gross margins beyond just revenue and loadings.",199

I guess bigger picture, can you kind of speak to your CapEx philosophy in a slower demand environment? Is it finding the right number to fit a free cash flow model? Or are you looking at kind of your overall demand picture and saying, we need x minus y wafer starts, and that's why we can spend less? Would love to get a sense of how kind of the slowdown here is potentially changing or potentially not your strategy of spending. And if it's not, is it just simply delaying investments into '24 and '25?",99

Thanks, C.J. I'll start and ask Dave to jump in. We sort of think about the capital budget with 2 lenses in mind, right? One is the strategic lens. Am I going to get back to leadership at 20A and 18A? Yes, am I going to make the capital investments required to do that? Absolutely. To some degree, do we scrub those? Could we look hard at those? Where can we save tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on those. Yes, we will. But we're not going to diminish from the capital required for strategic leadership for the long term. So strategic capital, largely unchanged.
The second bucket, of course, I'll just call it, capacity capital, right, and adjusting to the near-term ebb and flows of the business requirement. And obviously, in this macro environment, that's been adjusted meaningfully downward and we're finding everywhere we can to squeeze our existing capacity more effectively to be more aggressive in terms of how we work with our equipment suppliers in those areas and doing everything we can to minimize the capital that's required for capacity-driven requirements as well. And that's where the larger trade-offs have been. And of course, in a business as large as ours, we have labs and buildings and everything else. We are scrubbing those like crazy as you would want us to.
Dave, what else would you add?",232

Obviously, the OpEx area, yes, is an area that we've really focused on and Pat mentioned the lab piece, which is an area -- one of the areas that we have found efficiency. And I guess the last thing is that we have seen our capital offsets be higher than our original expectation. We were planning for probably 1/3 of what we think we'll get in 2023 when we announced our Smart capital initiative in -- at the Analyst Day. So that's obviously coming in stronger. Of course, Pat already alluded to the fact that a lot of that is -- SCIP has turned out to be a pretty powerful tool, and this will enable us to do a SCIP 2 this year as well, which obviously helps.",133

And again, I know you don't want to guide the full year, but as you kind of look at different scenario analysis for 2023, how do you see kind of return to positive free cash flow playing out? Is that something that could come in the second half? Or that's really in '24 of that?",60

Obviously, in the first half of this year, we're going to be below that model. But as we look into the back half of the year, we would expect to approach the model in '23. And of course, '24 is a bit away from where we are right now, but this is the thing that we spend a lot of time on.
I would tell you one thing, if you look at our free cash flow for '22, we came in roughly around minus $4 billion. If you remember, in the quarter before, we forecasted that we would be somewhere between minus $2 billion and minus $4 billion. We were actually assuming a higher level of capital offsets, which is still coming, but pushed into '23. And yet we still hit the high end of that range. And the way we did it was through working capital initiatives. So this is a big part of our strategy around managing free cash flow is more attention to working capital. 
It's something that I think in the past may not have been a big focus here, but is a very big focus here. It's how we -- how our shipments are managed in terms of linearity, how we manage payments, how we manage our inventory. The fact that we're taking underload does affect the gross margins, but it also improves our cash flow because we're spending less on variable costs.
So these are areas that we think can be pretty beneficial to us and be a tailwind for us in terms of free cash flow as we progress through the year.",292

I guess as my follow-up question, guys, I wanted to dig into the DCAI business a little bit. And you guys talked about, I think, the PSG or Altera being up, I don't know, 40-odd percent year-over-year, which if you just kind of rough math, it means that the core cloud plus enterprise server business is down 40%, something like that. And so maybe, Pat, could you walk us through what -- is that roughly right in terms of math and just where your -- how you see share loss versus ASP versus weakness in the markets in China and enterprise? Just how do you break that down for us, what operationally is happening in the server share space.",120

So PSG did have a very good quarter, has a very strong backlog, continues to grow. But I'd say the math that you suggest is quite incorrect given the relative size of those businesses. So we'll happily offline talk a little bit more through that. That said, we did -- we grew less than the market last year and saw some share loss. We see that stabilizing this year. The key factor is better products, right? And we've just released that with Sapphire Rapids and getting great response and our announcement event on January 10 was a customer-centric ramps baby product line.
We had strong participation from all the CSPs, all of the OEMs, all of the ISVs, end users. So it was seen as a very strong event. This year will be very much about ramping that and we'll see the improvements in both market share position as well as ASPs as we ramp that product through the year, and the confidence in the road map. And that will be the determinant, okay, you have a better product now, great. Customers are building it on an installed base. But do we have confidence in your long term?
So I'd say we've reestablished a very credible road map. You'll see lots of news coming from us this year as we start delivering on samples, et cetera, of the next-generation products as well as the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids with highly differentiated features and capabilities. So we feel like we've put the worst behind us, right? And we're now coming back to the front foot in this business area. And I'll say in a very customer-centric ISV-centric way, that delivers our customers the use cases that they need in their business.",292

Thank you, Toshi. The -- what we said clearly that we did see demand softening through the year in data center overall. That's a market statement.

So we see all of them weaker in the first half of the year. We are, I'll say, a touch optimistic that China will come back and enterprise will come back more rapidly than the cloud. And with our stronger exposure in those segments, we believe that is a potential good news for us as we go through the year relative to competition.
The networking space is one where we have very sustained leadership and strength in areas like vRAN and O-RAN, are ones that our platform is dramatically better than competitors. And with that strong market share through the year, we also expect some level of softening there in those in the networking area, but not as much as some of the other segments that we would have.
First half of the year, we expect to be down year-on-year in the second half of the year to returning to growth. So inventory adjustments, a weaker market in first half, recovery in the second half of the year is what we expect. Overall, and obviously, the relative position, we believe, that we have is stabilizing and the markets that we're stronger in, we're optimistic that they'll come back a little bit stronger as we go through the year.",271

Pat, you also talked about your focus and commitment toward value creation, you mentioned how you guys are pulling future investments from the switching business. As you look across your portfolio as of today. I think to your point, you've done quite a lot since coming back. Like where is the incremental opportunity as you think about improving the portfolio going forward and creating value?",67

And I'll just say here without being too specific, some of these things are under evaluation, discussion with customers and the best way to handle it. We're doing a thorough analysis across the portfolio. And I would say we are looking at every aspect of the portfolio, where we're getting good returns, where we're not. And we're making decision after decision to optimize the portfolio. And as you say, we haven't been hesitant to make those decisions inside the back. And we have a few more that we're looking carefully at.
But we're also looking at every area of the business. Dave suggested in his comments, ""Hey, can we do a better job with our lineups? Could we do a better job with our building assets?"" We've also discussed, as part of the internal foundry model, that we're making major steps to improve our automation and ERP efficiency to run the company more. Some of our people actions, we've been very scrutinizing and benchmarking ourselves against best-in-class in every aspect of how we run the business.
So one by one, we're saying we're going to be world-class as measured by benchmarks in these areas and all the business areas that we're in, we believe they're strategically important and yielding good results with our shareholders' investments.",216

And in particular, it seems like it's a really good chip. But I think the price at the platform level is getting more expensive, DDR5 is more expensive. What's it like right now migrating to a more expensive platform and environment or budgets are under pressure, does that change the ramp relative to other CPUs that you have?",72
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096931.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,47,"Yes. Thanks, Joe. And you are touching on a very important issue, the memory. And obviously, the memory pricing for DDR4 has collapsed, right? And it -- making that pricing gap versus DDR5 very visible currently. That said, customers don't buy these platforms on memory prices. They buy them on TCO, right? The total cost of the operations, right, that they get for the performance as they put them into operations.
So memory price is one piece of that. But I'd also say DDR prices are expected to decline as we go through DDR5 price and the gap to DDR4 is widely forecast to decline, and that gap will diminish as we go through the year.
However, right, you contrast that to the significant performance capability. And in some areas like AI, we're seeing 5x to 6x performance benefits. And when you put that into a TCO calculation, it's overwhelmingly positive. Security is not measured on TCO. It's measured on absolute statements of security and confidential computing.
So overall, we are driving this ramp very aggressively through the year. We have strong demand of customers. We're ramping our factories quickly. And we do believe that we'll have a strong ramp of the Sapphire Rapids platform as we go through the year.",211

I also just wanted to touch on -- I mean you mentioned the migration of the ASG business into DCAI and CCG. Is that -- is there a change there in any of the priorities? Or is it just kind of a restructuring of where those businesses reside?,49
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2023",2023-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3876.0,2723340.0,102096934.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,50,"Yes. It's a restructuring of where the businesses reside and as we move past this, I'll say, launch phase of those products. And we're now into the scale phase of those product lines. And for instance, discrete graphics, driving the attach rate and channel motions with our enormous client business. In the data center, bringing a broader portfolio across HPC, our Flex product line, the AI capabilities that we have that we're uniquely delivering through data center. So all of this is about is the efficiency and scale of those business areas. And we've been having numerous discussions with our customers about these changes, and they have been very well received.
And I'd say all the products that we launched out of AXG, the Flex product line, the discrete graphics product line, the MAX product lines. All of those products are continuing forward, and we believe all of those will have strong ramps in their volumes revenues and market impact as we go through the year.
So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. First, thank you. We're grateful for you joining us today, the opportunity that you've given us to update you on our business. And clearly, the financials aren't what we would hope for. But we're also pleased with the execution progress we made. And as a result, we're confident in the strategic outlook that we have for our business.
The macro is difficult. It was difficult in Q4. We expect it to remain difficult as we go through the first half of the year, but we're laser-focused on controlling the things that we can. And every aspect of our execution, cost management and transformation is in our hands and we are well underway in executing against those paths.
So with that, we look forward to seeing many of you throughout the quarter, updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you very much.",319

We delivered solid first quarter results on both the top and bottom line. Upside was driven by better-than-expected revenue and very disciplined expense management across our organization. The latter is not easy, and I want to thank the entire Intel team as we thoughtfully execute on cost reductions and efficiency improvements that support the investments critical to drive our strategy. 
Q1 results demonstrate the progress we are making to advance our transformation and the IDM 2.0 strategy. We still have more work to do as we reestablish process, product and cost leadership. But we continue to provide proof points each quarter. And we remain committed to delivering long-term value for all our shareholders. 
Consistent with prior quarters, I'd like to focus my comments on three areas: one, our view of the macro and our markets; two, key highlights from Q1; and three, an update on our strategic priorities with a focus on our move to an internal foundry model. 
As the industry continues to navigate through multiple global challenges and headwinds, we remain cautious on the macro outlook even as we expect some modest recovery in the second half. We are seeing increasing stability in the PC market with inventory corrections largely proceeding as we had expected. However, the server and networking markets have yet to reach their bottoms as cloud and enterprise remain weak. 
As a result, our Q2 revenue guide embeds continued inventory corrections in our core markets and a range of normal seasonal to better-than-seasonal growth off depressed Q1 revenue levels. We remain focused on what is within our control and steadfast in our commitment to advancing our strategy. 
As we anticipated on our Q4 earnings call, the PC market depleted a significant amount of inventory in Q1 and is tracking to be at a healthy level by the end of Q2. Importantly, the PC installed base is larger and usage remains well above pre-pandemic levels, and along with a better-than-expected Q1, strengthens our view that the PC market is on track to a sell-through of 270 million units in calendar year '23. As we highlighted during our PC webinar in January, strong usage, an installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels, and what we see as a conservative refresh rate supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units, plus or minus. 
In servers, Q1 consumption TAM declined both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate. And we still expect to see first half '23 TAM decline year-on-year with a modest recovery in second half of the year. While all segments have weakened, we'd reiterate that the correction in enterprise and rest of world, where we have stronger positions, is further along and will likely recover more quickly. 
Lastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure, demand trends are relatively stronger, although as anticipated, NEX did see a Q1 inventory correction that we expect will continue for the next couple of quarters and likely will cause NEX revenue to decline this year. In contrast, PSG, IFS and Mobileye continue on a strong growth trajectory. And we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year-on-year in calendar year '23 much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single-digits decline in the semiconductor market ex memory. 
While the semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature, we continue to accelerate our transformation and position ourselves to capture the significant market growth in semis expected over the next decade, nearly doubling to more than $1 trillion by 2030. Combined with the need for globally balanced and resilient supply chains and a foundry market expected to be roughly $200 billion by 2030, we are well positioned to capitalize on multiple vectors of growth. 
On that front, let me highlight some key milestones from Q1. We are relentlessly focused on driving execution excellence across process and product road maps and throughout the company, including a rigorous focus on efficiency and cost savings. Looking first at the progress we are making with our process road map, we remain on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. 
Relative to 5 nodes in 4 years, notably 2 out of these 5 nodes, Intel 7 and Intel 4 are now essentially done. Intel 7 is in high-volume manufacturing. And Meteor Lake on Intel 4 is ramping production wafer starts today for a second half product launch. We are quickly mastering EUV technology with Intel 4 as our first EUV node. 
As we focus on the next 3 nodes, Intel 3 is on track. And we highlighted in our recent DCAI webinar, Sierra Forest will begin shipping in the first half of '24 with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter, both on Intel 3. We also have significant milestones planned in Q2 for Intel 3, Intel 20A and Intel 18A, and look forward to providing more details as we execute. Overall, we are squarely on track to deliver 5 nodes in 4 years. 
We understand that our foundry ambitions will not be realized overnight. Building a vibrant foundry ecosystem will take time. But we also understand our foundry success is vitally important to establishing a geographically diverse and secure supply of semiconductors. We took a major step forward on building our ecosystem this month when we announced a multi-generation agreement with ARM Holdings. 
This will enable chip designers to build leading-edge mobile SoC designs on Intel 18A, giving the design community a new foundry alternative for product innovation and fast time to market, while also opening up new options and approaches for large ecosystem of ARM customers. We look forward to providing access to best-in-class CPU IP and the power of an open system foundry with leading-edge process technology. Finally, as part of my recent trip to China, we continue to work hard to complete the Tower acquisition. And we'll update you appropriately. 
In our webinar last month, we provided a substantial update on our Data Center and AI business, highlighting the progress and health of our road map. Sapphire Rapids, our fourth gen Xeon, is one of the highest quality data center CPUs Intel has ever delivered and continues to ramp aggressively with excellent customer feedback. We are shipping over 400 designs across numerous system and memory configurations for all OEMs, ODM and cloud providers. And we are on track to 1 million units by mid-year. 
Notably, AI inference performance and confidential computing substantially differentiate our fourth gen Xeon from competitors. Specifically, fourth gen Xeon offers the most comprehensive confidential computing portfolio in the industry, including virtual machine isolation with Intel Trust Domain Extensions, or Intel TDX, and trust attestation services. Just this week, leading cloud service providers signaled readiness for Intel TDX instances, including Alibaba Cloud, with Microsoft announcing their preview on Azure and Google releasing joint research conducted prelaunch to further harden TDX in complex environments. 
Emerald Rapids, our fifth gen Xeon Scalable, is already sampling with customers and is on track to launch in Q4 '23. As stated earlier, Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3, will begin shipping in first half '24 with Granite Rapids shortly thereafter, both of which are receiving very positive responses from sample customers. 
Sierra Forest is our first E-core server CPU, which will provide competitive performance per watt across workloads and leadership across many with all of the benefits of the x86 ecosystem. Clearwater Forest, which is the follow-on to Sierra Forest, is coming to market in 2025 and will be manufactured on Intel 18A, the node where we intend to achieve process leadership and representing the culmination of our 5 nodes in 4-year strategy. 
The combination of our road map strengthening, as we highlighted in our webinar, better-than-expected Q1 market share results and great execution on the Xeon Gen 4 ramp, Q1 was a turning point as the first quarter of an improving data center position since I became CEO. 
Further, in Q1, we taped in the Habana Gaudi3 AI accelerator. And the Habana Gaudi2 is in the market and offering substantial performance advantage over A100 in training and inferencing, vision and language models. For example, Gaudi2 delivers 60% higher power efficiency measured in throughput per watt for inferencing large language models, such as BLOOM 176 billion parameter model. Along with fourth gen Xeon and Xeon Max, Gaudi enables us to address the accelerating growth in AI. Recent endorsements by Hugging Face and Stability AI are strong proof points of the validation in our AI road map and strategy. 
Our strategy is to truly democratize the incredible power of AI, championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge and client across training and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions. Our oneAPI now includes the open and royalty-free C++-based programming model SYCL, which is critical to driving collaboration and innovation. 
As developers want the ability to write once, run anywhere, our open source toolkit, SYCLomatic, is helping to accelerate the migration to SYCL as we work to democratize AI. While AI development, sparked by enthusiasm around generative AI, is today centered on LLMs in the cloud, AI deployment will rapidly migrate to inference as the dominant AI workload. And adoption will quickly expand outwards to edge and client, all areas that play to our strengths. We are focused on capitalizing across all segments with optimized silicon and software solutions. 
Our Programmable Solutions business continues to perform well with an all-time record revenue in Q1. And our FPGA portfolio now includes more than 15 new products scheduled to PRQ this calendar year, the highest number of new product introductions ever in our FPGA business. PSG is also piloting an initiative to build a more resilient supply chain by which customers would provide Intel with enhanced demand and new design visibility while Intel provides customers with greater predictability of supply, leveraging the benefits of transitioning a great percentage of PSG products to an Intel supply chain. 
Our Client Computing business continues to execute on this road map and build on recent market share wins. We gained overall PC market share in Q1 and expect our competitive position to continue to improve as we ramp Meteor Lake production in Q2 for a launch in second half. In Q1, we introduced our 13th gen Intel Core mobile processor, followed by our new vPro platform powered by the full lineup of 13th gen Intel Core processors. 
Intel vPro delivers the most comprehensive security and the necessary hardware for companies in the need of a PC refresh and increased productivity. In 2023, our expansive commercial portfolio will deliver more than 170 notebooks, desktops and entry workstations from technology providers such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Panasonic and Samsung Electronics. 
Turning to NEX and Mobileye. At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated that nearly all vRAN and virtualized network core deployments run on Intel. We also introduced a range of products and solutions that enable the world's networks from the core to the radio access network and out to the intelligent edge to transition from fixed function hardware to open programmable, software-defined platforms. 
Highlights include the launch of our fourth gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors with Intel vRAN Boost, delivering two times the capacity gains gen-over-gen within the same power envelope and up to an additional 20% power savings with integrated acceleration and with extensive industry support from Ericsson, Verizon, Telefonica and Vodafone, among many others. In particular, Ericsson has been working closely with us to enable the cloudification of the network, making possible industry-scale OpenRAN. 
Lastly, Mobileye continues to be an important part of the Intel family and delivered strong growth and profitability in Q1. They continue to gain significant traction with customers for their advanced product portfolio. And we remain very confident in the long-term growth profile and value of the Mobileye business. 
In addition to our process and product road map, we continue to make progress on our commitment to reduce costs and drive efficiencies. We are well on our way towards our goal of reducing $3 billion in costs in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion in annual savings exiting 2025. We further rationalize our products as we prioritize our investments in support of IDM 2.0. This includes integrating AXG into DCAI and CCG, respectively. In addition, we exited our server business in Q1 and signed an agreement with MiTAC, an edge-to-cloud IT solutions provider and long-standing ODM partner, to manufacture and sell products based on the designs of our server systems business to create a path forward for our channel customers. 
I'm going to spend a few minutes on cost leadership. Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with some of you on the East Coast. And while everyone understands that we are establishing an internal foundry model, I'm not sure we have fully explained the importance and impact of this change. Giving the manufacturing group their own P&L and the BUs a standard wafer price will drive a more efficient factory network and a better decision on design-to-cost at the BU level. 
It will also serve to create parity between internal and external foundry customers and drive a more efficient manufacturing cost structure needed to compete and win external foundry customers. With a separate P&L for the manufacturing group, we will also provide you with a cleaner comparison of the BUs to their external fabless peers. 
As we stated on our Q3 earnings call, we believe this structure should allow us to access and execute on multiple pools of profit that are unique to an IDM, which none of our peers have. Establishing an internal foundry model is one of the most consequential steps we are taking to deliver IDM 2.0 and fundamentally shifts the way the company operates and the incentive mechanisms that drive day-to-day behaviors. We look forward to discussing this in more detail during our internal foundry webinar in Q2. 
I am proud of our team's progress this quarter. We remain committed to executing on our strategic road map by, first, delivering on 5 nodes in 4 years, achieving process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A; second, executing on our Data Center and AI road map, including the Sapphire Rapids ramp, the launch of Emerald Rapids in second half of '23 and Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest in 2024; third, ramping Meteor Lake in second half '23 and launching Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake in 2024; and fourth, expanding our IFS customer base to include large design wins on advanced packaging, Intel 16, Intel 3 and Intel 18A this year. 
As we improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency, we will, first, return to profitability; second, execute on our internal foundry P&L by 2024; and third, expand the use of our Smart Capital strategy to balance our long-term capital aspirations with near-term realities. We are steadfast in our commitment to continue to effectively allocate your capital in the pursuit of creating value for all of our stakeholders. 
Before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to take a moment to honor and pay tribute to the life of Gordon Moore, who passed away on March 24. Gordon defined and enabled the technology industry through his insight and vision. He was instrumental in revealing the power of transistors and inspired technologists and entrepreneurs across the decades. I am forever grateful for his guiding hand, willingness to mentor me and his unwavering friendship. 
Gordon famously said, ""What can be done, can be outdone."" This is our guiding principle as stewards of Moore's Law, which we intend to enable and drive until the periodic table is exhausted as we use the power of technology to improve the lives of every person on Earth. Intel will hold a memorial service to honor the life and accomplishments of Gordon. And we will share more details on this shortly.",2659
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104103972.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove solid business execution in the first quarter, beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. Against the backdrop of persistent macroeconomic volatility, we will continue to prioritize investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively manage expenses near term and drive fundamental improvements to our cost structure long term. 
First quarter revenue was $11.7 billion, $700 million above the midpoint of our guide. Results from CCG, DCAI, IFS and Mobileye exceeded our expectations, partially offset by softer demand in the network and edge markets, impacting NEX revenue in the quarter. Gross margin was 38.4%, modestly below our guidance on higher-than-expected inventory reserves tied to continued macro uncertainty. Q1 margins were impacted 300 basis points by factory underload charges taken in the period. 
EPS was negative $0.04 for the quarter, $0.11 better than guide, demonstrating our cross-company focus on spending discipline. Operating cash flow in Q1 was negative $1.8 billion. Net CapEx was $7 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $8.8 billion. And we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $27 billion and a strong investment-grade profile. 
Before moving to business unit results, I will highlight a few changes made within our segment reporting. The client and data center-focused products from the former AXG business are now reported within our CCG and DCAI segments, respectively, and will have a dilutive effect on the operating margins of those businesses. Our silicon photonics and foundry automotive businesses have moved out of NEX and IFS, respectively, and are now reported as part of all other revenue, sharpening our focus on the significant market opportunities available to both NEX and IFS. 
Shifting to the first quarter business unit results. CCG achieved revenue of $5.8 billion, better than our expectations for the quarter. While we continue to see a challenging demand environment, especially in our consumer and education segments, customers continue to prefer Intel, driven by our leadership product performance. As discussed last quarter, we saw significant inventory burn at our customers in the period. While inventory levels remain elevated, we anticipate the market will be closer to equilibrium as we exit Q2. ASPs were down sequentially due to mix. Q1 operating profit was $520 million, flat sequentially despite revenue declining 13% from Q4 and down year-over-year on lower revenue, higher unit costs and excess capacity charges, partially offset by reduced OpEx. 
DCAI revenue was $3.7 billion, ahead of our expectations in Xeon, PSG and AXG lines of business. We saw significant sequential and year-over-year TAM contraction across all CPU market segments and expect demand to remain soft in the second quarter. We saw stable CPU market share in Q1 and are excited by the broad market ramp of our fourth generation Xeon Scalable processor, Sapphire Rapids. Operating loss was $518 million, impacted sequentially by lower revenue, higher product costs and investment in leadership products on new process nodes. DCAI margins were also diluted by the merge of the AXG business and inventory reserves tied to the exit of our server systems business. 
Within our DCAI business, the Programmable Solutions Group delivered record revenue for the second consecutive quarter in Q1, up 36% year-over-year with increased ASPs and improved external supply, which enables us to satisfy customer backlog, helping to drive continued operating profit growth. 
NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, below our expectations for the quarter, driven by demand softness and elevated inventory levels in our network and edge markets, consistent with the overall industry. Operating loss was $300 million, impacted sequentially by depressed revenue in the quarter and inventory reserves, partially offset by continued expense management and discipline. 
Mobileye continues to outperform underlying automotive end markets, delivering record first quarter revenue of $458 million, up 16% year-over-year, along with a 6% year-over-year increase in content per vehicle. Profitability continues to be strong with Q1 operating income of $123 million. 
IFS revenue was $118 million, including 67% sequential growth in packaging revenue. Operating loss was $140 million, impacted sequentially by increased factory start-up costs as we invest in this strategic growth business. 
We're well on our way towards our committed $3 billion of spending reductions in 2023 on our path to $8 billion to $10 billion of reductions exiting 2025, which will exclude benefits from the change in equipment useful life. As demonstrated by our Q1 results, focused investment prioritization and spending discipline have our OpEx reductions trending ahead of expectation, while revenue adjusted cost of sales reductions face headwinds from factory underload charges and inventory reserves due to continued demand uncertainty. 
As Pat highlighted, our shift to an internal foundry model is already demonstrating a path to the structural cost improvements necessary to achieve our long-term profit goals. We've seen early wins with a reduction in disruptive factory expedites and increased focus on sort and test times. We look forward to unpacking the financial and operational benefits of our internal foundry model in much more detail in our investor webinar later in the quarter. 
Now turning to Q2 guidance. We expect second quarter revenue of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. At the midpoint of $12 billion, we expect billings to continue to trail consumption in our data center, network and client markets as customers focus on rightsizing operating inventories. While we remain cautious, we're seeing green shoots and expect sequential revenue growth throughout the year. 
Pat mentioned the continued strong signals of elevated PC usage and active devices, giving us confidence that our short-term headwinds are an anomaly to long-term revenue opportunity. Demand for AI capabilities in the cloud, across the network and at the edge continue to grow. And we're confident that our CPU and accelerator portfolios are well positioned to benefit from the market tailwind. 
We're forecasting Q2 gross margin of 37.5%, a tax rate of 13%, an EPS of negative $0.04 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q2 gross margins by approximately 300 basis points. While gross margins are well below acceptable levels, I'd highlight inventory reserves on pre-PRQ products impact Q2 margins by approximately 250 basis points, costs which should begin to unwind later this year as new products launch. 
Increased sample costs in support of our Xeon product road map will impact margins by 40 basis points sequentially. Our Q2 guidance includes an approximately $500 million benefit to operating margin from the useful life accounting change we announced in January, split approximately 80% to cost of sales and 20% to OpEx, up from $460 million in Q1. It's important to remember that this is a fixed cost business. The impact of underloaded factories goes beyond the period charges we're seeing in the first half of the year and will be felt for several quarters as we sell through products with higher average unit costs. 
We'll continue to deploy factory capacity prudently as we operate within our Smart Capital framework. As communicated last quarter, we expect to manage net CapEx intensity in the low 30% of revenue range in 2023 with capital offsets of approximately 20% to 30% of gross CapEx. Consistent with Smart Capital, IFS capacity represents approximately 10% of 2023 gross CapEx, a number which will scale in line with foundry customer commitments. With gross CapEx weighted to first half and capital offsets weighted to second half, we expect adjusted free cash flow to improve sequentially throughout the year and to be positive in second half of 2023. 
While we're encouraged by first quarter revenue and expect growth to improve sequentially through 2023, we're not satisfied with our financial results and remain focused on what we can control, our execution and the prioritization of our owners' capital toward our long-term goals. We're confident that as we deliver on our road map commitments, we will meet and exceed our customers' expectations for our products and our owners' expectations for strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to John.",1343

There's a lot of moving parts. I know you have the underutilization of 300 basis points. And it sounds like you also have another 200 basis points you highlighted from these pre-PRQ costs. So you're sort of normalized at 43% ex those 2 things, but there's a couple of offsets, too. You've got puts and takes around higher die costs from these new products like Meteor and Sapphire. So can you sort of give us a walk in terms of what the puts and takes are when you move past June?",111
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104103976.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,7,"Yes. Sure, Tim. Let me give you a little color. So on the 250 basis points that you correctly highlight that are the pre-PRQ reserves, the benefit of that is as we go into the back half of the year, that's related to Meteor Lake and Emerald. And as those ship, a lot of that reverses. In fact, in essence, we end up shipping it at 100% gross margin. So that becomes a tailwind. And then we do expect, as things improve from a demand perspective, that we will start to load the fab back up. 
The only, I guess, cautionary comment is that we still have underloaded costs that kind of are built into the cost of our product that are held in inventory. And so there are -- it does take a few quarters even beyond the time where we start to stop seeing these period costs of underutilization that we'll start to still see some cost headwinds from that. But ultimately, we'll be loading the fabs up to the appropriate levels. And that will be a nice tailwind. 
So maybe the best way to describe it is, I think, for the back half of the year, we feel like we'll be comfortably in the 40s from a gross margin perspective based on all those factors. And obviously, we're actively working on our $8 billion to $10 billion of spending reductions by the time we get to the end of 2025. And a lot of that is in the cost base, which will be a benefit to gross margins.",261

Pat, I guess, you have a lot of products coming out in a pretty short amount of time. Basically, you've got 5 data center platforms in 2.5 years. I understand that some are E-core and some are P-core. But usually, customers want to leverage their investments in these platforms for a longer time than that. So could that be some impediment to how quickly these platforms could ramp? Can you kind of talk about that?",78
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104103979.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,10,"Yes, it's a great question, Tim. And what I'd highlight is that Sapphire and Emerald Gen 4 and Gen 5 are the same platform. So from the customers' perspective, they get to leverage those platform investments in a substantial way. Similarly, as we go into next year with Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, that's once again the same platform. And Clearwater Forest, the following year that we disclosed in the data center webinar for '25, also goes into that same platform. 
So essentially, even though it's five products that we've discussed, that's two platforms. And that ability to leverage that platform across a broader market space is very warmly received by our customers. And obviously, as we're working through this period to get back to solid leadership, we're getting increasing momentum from our customers. And as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, this was a good quarter for our data center business, a very healthy road map. We did better than we forecast in Q1 market share on track for the Sapphire Rapids ramp. 
And overall, being able to see these new use cases for AI inferencing in the platform, being able to deploy the increasing security capabilities that we disclosed, all of these are very unique feature capabilities that are both differentiating as well as value add for our customers that helps them to see the value in the underlying platforms that we're delivering. So a very good quarter. Thanks for the question, Tim.",245

Can you give us a sense of by how much you were undershipping end demand today? How do you think about the snapback? And can you talk about the timing of planned raising of utilization, at least for your CCG business?",53
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104103982.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,13,"Yes. So I'll start on that and Dave can jump in. Generally, we think that we undersold into the market by about 20% in Q1. And that continues in Q2. And overall, we said a 270 million unit sell-through TAM for the year. That equates -- it was essentially equivalent to the 240 million or 250 million units sell-in TAM that you might have seen from some of the industry analysts. 
So overall, we think first half, we end the first half with a very healthy inventory position by our OEMs and by the channel. That positions us very well for natural improvement and a stronger second half as we're now selling, I'll say, in at the same rate of selling out in the marketplace in a normally stronger back half of the year. 
Overall, this is just going to be a positive every quarter as we go through the year. We're seeing strong momentum from our customers for our road map. And as Dave indicated, we're already starting to build inventory for the Meteor Lake launch later in the year, which is another strong indication. Dave, if you want to comment on the inventory comment?",196

So we have about 155 days of inventory aggregate -- in the aggregate on the balance sheet. Obviously, as we get through the inventory depletion at customers and we start to normalize back up to the level of end consumption, we'll start to burn through that inventory. And you can expect us to start ramping the factories. I don't think we'll be fully ramped by the end of the year, but we certainly will be improving the ramp through the year.",82

Pat, in your prepared remarks, you talked about positive feedback from tests at your customers for Sierra and Granite. And curious if you can share any of that feedback that you're hearing to give us confidence on that ramp.",43
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104103986.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,17,"Yes. And I'd say, generally, the feedback is, ""Wow,"" right, ""You guys are delivering at the front end of your scheduled windows that you gave us with a very high-quality product."" And they're now into their, what we call, the volume validation phase of their platforms, so where they're receiving enough samples that they can start to do broad validation of the platform. That validation cycle is very critical for us because it informs us of when we're ready to move forward with the production stepping of those parts in both the software and the firmware of the platform. 
We're seeing very good response on both the first E-core part with Sierra Forest as well as the next-generation P-core part with Granite Rapids. So overall, I'd just say we feel super good that we're getting such a warm response from customers. And this positions us very well as they're rebuilding their confidence in Intel. 
And this -- you've heard me talk before, C.J., that we have to rebuild our customers' confidence and the performance that we're seeing, not just on Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids Gen 5, but next year's products. And the very strong position for the E-core products going into 2025 with Clearwater Forest has been a strong uptick in their belief that Intel's execution machine is back for their data center products of the future.",227

I was hoping you could dig a little bit deeper into what you're seeing in the cloud side of things. The customers themselves seem to be reporting very strong numbers. But it seems that you alluded to that still being an inventory digesting end market for you. And then how Intel, specifically in cloud, is doing competitively?",86

And clearly, it was a down quarter for enterprise and for cloud. We do see that affecting the first -- at least the first half of the year. That said, we're encouraged by some of the comments that you've heard and that you refer to for the overall market. We do see that our position is improving. As I indicated in Q1, we saw a better-than-forecast market segment share. We also saw some green shoots for the first time in China. And we're encouraged by that market starting to show some positive characteristics. 
We'd also say that some of that strength in data center is driven by AI. And we're seeing a very positive response to Gaudi2 and seeing our pipeline growing very rapidly for that product line. We also saw that as a driver of the early strong ramp for Gen 4 Sapphire Rapids. Those taken together, we're -- we do believe that's an important trend. But we also, as you said, in my prepared remarks, we see that we need to make AI, and that is a critical use case, broadly available. 
And that's what we refer to as democratizing AI, where those super high-end machines are uneconomical for most environments. And we have to enable the broad deployment of inferencing, being able to use AI. And that's an area where particularly our core Xeon product line has particular strengths well above prior generations and competitive alternatives and one that we expect to be an area of strength for us long term.",257

I just wanted to go back and revisit the gross margin side. So one for Dave. The underutilization charges, is there some trigger point at which revenue-wise, I guess, we should expect that to go away? Because obviously, that's the 300 basis point headwind, 2 quarters in a row of that. 
And then the pre-PRQ side of things, given the frequency of new product introductions that was alluded to in a prior question, it doesn't seem like those would necessarily go away that fast. Or if they do for a quarter or 2, they would come back. So can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes on those underutilization charges and pre-PRQs, please?",119
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104103992.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,23,"Okay. So on the pre-PRQ, you're right, and it always is lumpy. We saw this effect midway through last year with Sapphire Rapids. And so we will have these on occasion. But we think for the second half of the year, for sure, we won't see this magnitude of pre-PRQ reserves as a pretty significant quarter for us in the second quarter. 
On the underloading charges, I think it's -- partially, it's about revenue, but partially it's about our inventory levels and where they are. So we obviously need to bring the inventory levels down from the 155 days. That's going to be important. I think I would just say that, hey, in the third and fourth quarter, I would see -- I would expect to see an improving situation in terms of underloads. 
And likely, that will be behind us by the time we're through the end of the year, just on the period cost underload charges. We might be living with some higher cost per unit for a couple of quarters after that because of underload that we built into the cost of the products. But ultimately, we'll have this factory -- the factory network loaded back up.",200

You guys have made some good progress there. And we're working through some end market and near-term product dynamics. But focusing on the 5 nodes in 4 years, I know there's some internal nodes that are being developed as well around backside PowerVia and also gate-all-around. 
So maybe you could give a little bit of an update as to how those road maps are going on those two pieces of technology individually? And I guess, the second part of the question, if you do succeed in getting to node parity and the node leadership as you described, can you talk about a path to cost parity for internal and external potential customers on 18A?",134
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104103995.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,26,"Yes, great question, Matt. And as I indicated, the 5 nodes in 4 years, Intel 7, done. Intel 4 with the Meteor Lake volume ramp, we view that as all but done, right? We are -- essentially, the process is PRQ-ed. And now we're ramping the product, which will PRQ later in the year. So we feel like we're two of five are now completed. Obviously, the next one up is Intel 3. And with Intel 3, the positive updates that we've given on Granite and Sierra Forest for next year, the volume sampling that I've already referred to gives us a lot of confidence that, that is now coming along very nicely. Both Intel 4 and Intel 3 are EUV nodes. 
As you say, as we go to 20A and 18A, the two major innovations are the RibbonFET, the gate-all-around transistor architecture and the backside power. Given the uniqueness of the backside power, as you indicated, we had an internal node that we didn't expose to products or externally to derisk that node. And that went extremely well. We had very good results from the backside power, the power delivery, the routability improvements that, that gave. And as one proof point of that, the ARM announcement was one that demonstrated significant benefits of backside power that we were able to do. 
So 20A and 18A are the next ones up. 20A will be primarily a client node as we ramp our Arrow Lake products in '24 and '25. 18A will be everything. We will have server products, client products, networking products and many foundry products. We also noted that this was the quarter that we have our first foundry test chips coming out. And so some of the test chips for external customers on 18A are now popping out of fab and being tested by them. So good affirmation from them. 
You also mentioned, I think it's actually a very insightful question, Matt, the cost structure. And one of the things that we've put a lot of emphasis on with 18A is getting to structural cost parity with what we believe is the best in the industry at that point. So we view this as not just getting to power and performance parity but also area parity and cost structural parity as we get to 18A. 
And we believe, as we've benchmarked ourselves against the industry best, we believe we're on track to do that in the 18A time frame. And that's part of why we talk about in the internal foundry model as being able to start really measuring the P&L, right? And really viewing it as the industry price for wafers is understood, and we have to benchmark ourselves against that and deliver margin structure at the wafer level that's competitive with that.",466

I guess, my question kind of relates to another question that was asked on platform compatibility.

There was another product that was on the public road map before, Diamond Rapids, for the next sort of P-core product. Any update there? I just want to -- it wasn't really mentioned in the DCAI Day.

And while we're not speaking a lot about that next-generation product, that would be the introduction of the next-generation platform, at that point would be when we move to the next platform, which will change package architecture, power delivery architecture, memory channel, key steps in memory scalability with our CXL technology.

Sorry, apologies. It's very unlikely, I'm just surprised when you said my name. Thanks a lot for all the details on the gross margin. And taking a step back, I'm kind of thinking between now and the end of 2025, your gross margin is going to be very volatile and very difficult to read because you have a lot on your plate, a lot of costs coming in and out with all the various nodes. 
And so my question would be maybe looking at things from a much higher level, let's say, we are around about 20 points below the historic margins as Intel being in a good competitive position, some of that is clearly a scale issue. The business has shrank a lot recently. And then some of that is really this very difficult 10-nanometer node, where the cost per unit is significantly too high. 
And so my question really is from what you know already from the nodes that you have coming up like that is now very, very tangible, Intel 4, how much of this gap are you going to regain with this node, really looking at it on a wafer-against-wafer without making that any sort of guide of what you get in 2023 or '24 or '25?

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104005.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,36,"Yes. Maybe like at a high level, Pierre, maybe the way to think about it is, look, one element of getting to the appropriate cost structure to deliver the margins is getting our process technology to be competitive. And that's really at 18A where we intersect that. So we make improvements along the way, but that's really where we make the meaningful improvement to get there from a process perspective. 
Now the challenge is all along the way, there's this kind of start-up costs that we have to deal with, which is hundreds of basis points of headwind for us that we have by virtue of the fact that we're stacked-on-stacked. The 5 nodes in 4 years that Pat is driving is the right strategy, but it does create headwinds on the cost side. So that -- we've got to work our way through that. But once we're on the other side of 5 nodes in 4 years, we have a competitive process technology from a cost perspective. 
We've gotten ourselves this, let's say, significantly higher start-up costs that we are incurring behind us as well. And then as you point out, you have the benefits of the scale of revenue that we would expect. And then lastly, you have, as Pat was talking about, this whole notion of the internal foundry model, which just drives a lot of attention on cost and where we think we're going to get a lot of that $8 billion to $10 billion of savings exiting 2025. 
So I think the way I look at it at least is that we put forth a model for gross margins. We changed the depreciation, which incrementally raises that target. And there's nothing that's going on at the company that would suggest that we're off pace from that. We think we are going to achieve that. The timing is obviously a function somewhat of the market. But other than that, we feel like we're on a great path to have those margins.",335

And I would just say there will be lumpiness, Pierre, right, of the ups and downs along the way, when process nodes come online, as you work through different product cycles, et cetera. But we'd say, as Dave said, we're going from the 30s into the 40s comfortably this year. We set a long-term model into the 50s that, if you consider the useful life, gets us up around 60% by the end of the 5-year period, as we've talked about. So we're on track to, I'll say, margins should be up and to the right as we work over time with lumpiness up and down due to these various considerations, but that's the path that we're laying ourselves up on.",122

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104008.0,Question,Pierre Ferragu,,Analysts,39,"Yes, very quick one. Pat, you mentioned Gaudi like a very, very positive benchmark on large language models. When I look around me, I don't see good tangible signs of Gaudi really gaining traction and getting big, despite the fact that the work today is really starving for more processing power and more capacity to run these models. So my question was am I just not seeing something that will become apparent very, very soon? Or are there still building blocks and parts and things that Gaudi is missing before really taking this very fast-growing opportunity?",96
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104009.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,40,"Yes. I think it's a fair commentary that we're only starting to see good positive proof points in the industry. So I think that's a fair critique, Pierre. But I'd point back to the announcement of Hugging Face, which is the most -- sort of like the GitHub of the AI world, very positive proof point this quarter, stable diffusion, right, another in Stability AI, important forces. 
Also, my comments around a rapidly growing pipeline. Obviously, you can't measure that, but I'll tell you, we have many opportunities that we're now engaging in globally. You'll also see us taking more aggressive steps with our DevCloud, presenting this as a developer environment for the market. So I think we have a lot of work to do here to show up in a meaningful way. But we think the Gaudi2 strategy has now started to gain quite a lot of interest in the market. 
As I said in my prepared remarks, Gaudi3 has now taped out, which will be the next step-up. Also, we're describing to customers our 2025 platform, the Falcon Shores product, which is another step-up. That also brings together the full offering of our HPC and AI into a single platform offering. Customers are responding very well to the, I'll say, the alignment and simplification of our road map in HPC and AI coming together. 
So overall, we feel like we're now starting to show up in this space. But we have a lot of work to do to land meaningful revenue customers in this area. And I'm hopeful that we'll be able to put some clear proof points that you can start to see in the marketplace in the near future.",283

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104011.0,Question,Vivek Arya,,Analysts,42,"I had a near-term and then a longer-term one. So on the near term, how should we think about the second half? Right now, when I look at consensus expectations, they are set for about 15% to 20% half-on-half growth. I appreciate you're not giving guidance. But is that the kind of growth that is contemplated or reflected in the return to the low 40s gross margin?",68
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104012.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,43,"Yes. I think what Pat said is we thought things would be modestly better in the second half of the year. And that, combined with the fact that pre-PRQ reserves reverse themselves, we'll probably see some better utilization levels. That's what gives us the confidence of comfortably in the 40s. And we're not providing any specific revenue guidance on the second half.",62
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104013.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,44,"Well, I'd say there's three things to just think about for the second half. One is that you normally have a stronger second half in our industry. We expect that to be the case. Second is we'll have worked through a lot of the inventory issues as you go first half to second half. And we are seeing some green shoots in the marketplace. We think it's a tough market for all, right? And we're navigating through it well, as seen by our top and bottom line beat in Q1. But hey, it's a tough market out there. So we're still being fairly cautious as we look out over time. 
And then third, obviously, our strengthening execution. Our road map is getting stronger. We're gaining market share. And I think of our Q1 as a solid proof point that we're navigating through the tough environment that we have in a better way than most. So we are incrementally more positive on the second half, but we also believe we have to continue careful execution, careful fiscal discipline as we go through a very uncertain macro outlook.",186

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104015.0,Question,Vivek Arya,,Analysts,46,"Yes. So Pat, my longer-term question is how do you see the role of ARM in the server CPU market? It's interesting that you're starting to partner with Ampere on ARM servers. I presume that implies a more credible ecosystem developing for ARM servers. I believe it's already around mid-single-digit or so as part of the cloud instances. So how do you see the role of ARM servers over the next few years? And do you see it as -- and just what is the impact on x86 server CPU TAM if ARM becomes bigger in the market?",98
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104016.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,47,"Yes. And a couple of things here, Vivek. One is the announcement that we did with ARM this quarter around IFS, it was a strong ecosystem statement for our foundry offerings and one that was focused around the mobile platform. But we do expect that we'll have a broader play over time, as the announcement indicated that it's first focused on mobile, where ARM has proven considerable strength across the market. I'd also say that we think of the market and the future of four architectures matter: ARM, RISC-V, x86, right, playing a critical role and the role of accelerators in GPU, right? And we'll be participating across all of those, whether that's through foundry or through our product offerings. 
I've continued to view that if we are doing a great job with our road map, that the role of ARM in the data center will be limited, right? And particularly with the E-core product line that we've laid -- now laid out with Sierra Forest, Clearwater Forest and strong products coming thereafter, we believe that we now deliver power performance, TCO benefit at x86. Migrating software stacks in the data center is a lot of work, right? And if I give customers an easy path with x86 and E-core solutions with superior TCO alternatives, that will do very well. 
So with that, that's our primary play. At the same time, our foundry play will be come one, come all. We will manufacture, right, any of the RISC-V, ARM, x86 and GPU alternatives for the industry through our superior capabilities in our foundry offerings over time. We view this as an industry play of great significance and one that we're committed to competing for leadership wafers across every architecture, every segment of the industry.",294

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104018.0,Question,Joseph Moore,,Analysts,49,I wonder if you could talk about the CapEx. You mentioned 10% going to foundry. Can you talk about -- and I still get kind of a gross CapEx number that's north of $20 million. Does that seem like it's in the ballpark? And are you spending that money more on shells and capacity? Or how much of that money gets allocated to the 5 nodes in 4 years?,69
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2023",2023-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3880.0,2790038.0,104104019.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,50,"Yes. Gross would be north of $20 million. We think, as I mentioned, that we can keep net CapEx intensity in kind of the low 30s as a percent of revenue, which is kind of within our model, actually a little bit better than what we modeled during the capital-intensive phase of our transformation. 
As it relates to kind of the split, we are probably -- certainly, there's a lot of CapEx going to equipment. There's a lot of CapEx going to shells. We're probably a little bit more biased towards shell investment right now. We had been, in the past, behind and that caught us. And these are obviously the very long lead time-type investments. And so you want to be -- make sure you have a shell when you need it. 
And so we have biased ourselves to do that and to make the investments that are appropriate in that regard. And as you point out, as I said, it's largely around our own needs. We are making some modest investments on the foundry side right now as we start to get -- gain traction on the customer front. And as we get more customers, we'll ramp that investment as appropriate.",203

In terms of the sort of capital offsets that you've got another 20% to 30%, is there the opportunity for that number to be better? For example, with the CHIPS Act as the grant money starts to get dispersed or you've talked about additional deals like Brookfield, like I guess, are you contemplating within that number potential future improvement? Or does that number get better if we start to see benefit from those things?",77

It obviously can get better. It assumes that we will have another SCIP by the end of the year and some government incentives. But obviously, I've got the CEO out there managing the offsets. And so I think there's certainly opportunity to see upside, if not this year, next year. And keep in mind, next year, we'll also have the benefit of the investment tax credit coming in at that point, which will obviously be helpful.",90

And I would just add on top of that, this is something we're working. We're engaging right now with the Department of Commerce and working through our grant applications in that area. We have modeled a certain level in the guidelines that Dave said. Obviously, we're going to be working to do better than that in this regard. And fundamentally, the CHIPS Act is all about making U.S. manufacturing competitive in the world. 
And that's the focus that we have and the intent of Congress as was laid out. And we hope to get those done as quickly as possible. We also had a major milestone with the EU CHIPS Act passing Parliament last week. And we continue to work on that front. And obviously, SCIP and investment tax credit, we're working to make our capital intensity and efficiency to be a great opportunity for us to bring shareholder returns in a meaningful way. 
So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. First, let me say thank you. We're grateful that you joined us. We're grateful that we have the opportunity to give you an update on our business and the progress that we're making. While the macro is challenging and plenty of headwinds out there, we also believe that our execution on our financials, a beat on top and bottom line, great execution on our process and product road maps. 
And here we are, 2 years into my tenure and the journey to date has had some unexpected bumps in the road. We're also beginning to see clear points that increase my confidence that we have the right strategy, the right team, and we are executing on this transformation.

Our strong second quarter results exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line, demonstrating continued financial improvement and confirmation of our strategy in the marketplace. Effective execution across our process and product road maps is rebuilding customer confidence in Intel. Strength in client and data center and our efforts to drive efficiencies and cost savings across the organization all contributed to the upside in the quarter and a return to profitability. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic road map, achieving our long-term goals and maximizing shareholder value. 
In Q2, we began to see real benefits from our accelerating AI opportunity. We believe we are in a unique position to drive the best possible TCO for our customers at every node on the AI continuum. Our strategy is to democratize AI, scaling it and making it ubiquitous across the full continuum of workloads and usage models. We are championing an open ecosystem with a full suite of silicon and software IP to drive AI from cloud to enterprise, network, edge and client across data prep, training and inference in both discrete and integrated solutions. 
As we have previously outlined, AI is 1 of our 5 superpowers along with pervasive connectivity, ubiquitous compute, cloud to edge infrastructure and sensing, underpinning a $1 trillion semi-industry by 2030. Intel Foundry Services, or IFS, positions us to further capitalize on the AI market opportunity as well as the growing need for a secure, diversified and resilient global supply chain. IFS is a significant accelerant to our IDM 2.0 strategy, and every day of geopolitical tension reinforces the correctness of our strategy. 
IFS expands our scale, accelerates our ramps at the leading edge and creates long tails at the trailing edge. More importantly for our customers, it provides choice, leading edge capacity outside of Asia and at HANA and beyond, what we believe will deliver leadership performance. We are executing well on our Intel 18A as a key foundry offering and continue to make substantial progress against our strategy. 
In addition, in July, we announced that Boeing and Northrop Grumman will join the RAMP-C program along with IBM, Microsoft and NVIDIA. The Rapid Assurance Microelectronics Prototypes-Commercial or RAMP-C, is a program created by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2021 to assure domestic access to next-generation semiconductors, specifically by establishing and demonstrating a U.S.-based foundry ecosystem to develop and fabricate chips on Intel 18A. RAMP-C continues to build on recent customer and partner announcements by IFS, including MediaTek, ARM and a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider. 
We also made good progress on 2 significant 18A opportunities this quarter. We are strategically investing in manufacturing capacity to further advance our IDM 2.0 strategy and overarching foundry ambitions while adhering to our smart capital strategy. In Q2, we announced an expanded investment to build 2 leading-edge semiconductor facilities in Germany as well as plans for a new assembling and test facility in Poland. The building out of Silicon Junction in Magdeburg is an important part of our go-forward strategy. And with our investment in Poland and the Ireland sites, we already operate at scale in the region.
We are encouraged to see the passage of the EU CHIPS bill supporting our building out an unrivaled capacity corridor in Europe. In addition, a year after being signed into law, we submitted our first application for U.S. CHIPS funding for the on-track construction of our fab expansion in Arizona, working closely with the U.S. Department of Commerce. It all starts with our process and product road maps, and I am pleased to report that all our programs are on or ahead of schedule. We remain on track to 5 nodes in 4 years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. 
Looking specifically at each node, Intel 7 is done and with the second half launch of Meteor Lake, Intel 4, our first EUV node is essentially complete with production ramping. For the remaining 3 nodes, I would highlight Intel 3 met defect density and performance milestones in Q2, released PDK 1.1 and is on track for overall yield and performance targets. We will launch Sierra Forest in first half '24 with Granite Rapids following shortly thereafter, our lead vehicles for Intel 3.
On Intel 20A, our first node using both RibbonFET and PowerVia, Arrow Lake, a volume client product is currently running its first stepping in the fab. In Q2, we announced that we will be the first to implement backside power delivery in silicon 2-plus years ahead of the industry, enabling power savings, area efficiency and performance gains for increased compute demands ideal for use cases like AI, CPUs and graphics. In addition, backside power improves ease of design, a major benefit not only for our own products but even more so for our foundry customers. 
On Intel 18A, we continue to run internal and external test chips and remain on track to being manufacturing ready in the second half of 2024. Just this week, we were pleased to have announced an agreement with Ericsson to partner broadly on their next-generation optimized 5G infrastructure. Reinforcing customer confidence in our road map, Ericsson will be utilizing Intel's 18A process technology for its future custom 5G SoC offerings. 
Moving to products. Our client business exceeded expectations and gained share yet again in Q2 as the group executed well, seeing a modest recovery in the consumer and education segments as well as strength in premium segments where we have leadership performance. We have worked closely with our customers to manage client CPU inventory down to healthy levels. As we continue to execute against our strategic initiatives, we see a sustained recovery in the second half of the year as inventory has normalized. Importantly, we see the AI PC as a critical inflection point for the PC market over the coming years that will rival the importance of Centrino and WiFi in the early 2000s. And we believe that Intel is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth opportunity.
In addition, we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs as household density is stable to increasing across most regions and usage remains above pre-pandemic levels. Building on strong demand for our 13th Gen Intel Processor family, Meteor Lake is ramping well in anticipation of a Q3 PRQ and will maintain and extend our performance leadership in share gains over the last 4 quarters. Meteor Lake will be a key inflection point in our client processor road map as the first PC platform built on Intel 4, our first EUV node and the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology, delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance.
Meteor Lake will also feature a dedicated AI engine, Intel AI Boost. With AI Boost, our integrated neural VPU, enabling dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads, we will bring AI use cases to life through key experience as people will want a need for hybrid work, productivity, sensing, security and creator capabilities, many of which were previewed at Microsoft's Build 2023 Conference.
Finally, while making the decision to end direct investment in our Next Unit of Computing or NUC business, this well-regarded brand will continue to scale effectively with our recently announced ASUS partnership. In the data center, our 4th Gen Xeon Scalable Processor is showing strong customer demand despite the mixed overall market environment. I am pleased to say that we are poised to ship our 1 millionth 4th Gen Xeon unit in the coming days. This quarter, we also announced the general availability of 4th Gen Cloud Instances by Google Cloud.
We also saw great progress with 4th Gen AI acceleration capabilities, and we now estimate more than 25% of Xeon data center shipments are targeted for AI workloads. Also in Q2, we saw a third-party validation from MLCommons when they published MLPerf training performance benchmark data showing that 4th Gen Xeon and Habana Gaudi2 are 2 strong open alternatives in the AI market that compete on both performance and price versus the competition. End-to-end AI-infused applications like DeepMind's AlphaFold and algorithm areas such as graft neural networks show our 4th Gen Xeon outperforming other alternatives, including the best published GPU results.
Our strengthening positioning within the AI market was reinforced by our recent announcement of our collaboration with Boston Consulting Group to deliver enterprise-grade, secure and responsible generative AI, leveraging our Gaudi and 4th Gen Xeon offerings to unlock business value while maintaining high levels of security and data privacy. 
Our data center CPU road map continues to get stronger and remains on or incrementally ahead of schedule. With Emerald Rapids, our 4th Gen Xeon Scalable set to launch in Q4 of '23. Sierra Forest, our lead vehicle for Intel 3 will launch in the first half of '24. Granite Rapids will follow shortly thereafter. For both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, volume validation with customers is progressing ahead of schedule. Multiple Sierra Forest customers have powered on their boards and silicon is hitting all power and performance targets. Clearwater Forest, the follow-on to Sierra Forest, will come to market in 2025 and be manufactured on Intel 18A.
While we performed ahead of expectations, the Q2 consumption TAM for servers remained soft on persistent weakness across all segments but particularly in the enterprise and rest of world where the recovery is taking longer than expected across the entire industry. We see the server CPU inventory digestion persisting in the second half. Additionally, impacted by the near-term wallet share focus on AI accelerators rather than general purpose compute in the cloud. We expect Q3 server CPUs to modestly decline sequentially before recovering in Q4. Longer term, we see AI as TAM expansive to server CPUs and more importantly, we see our accelerated product portfolio is well positioned to gain share in 2024 and beyond. 
The surging demand for AI products and services is expanding the pipeline of business engagements for our accelerator products, which includes our Gaudi Flex and MAX product lines. Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share. The value of our AI products is demonstrated by the public instances of Gaudi at AWS and the new commitments to our Gaudi product line from leading AI companies such as Hugging Face and Stability AI in addition to emerging AI leaders, including Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, [indiscernible] and Genesis Cloud. 
In addition to building near-term momentum with our family of accelerators, we continue to make key advancements in next-generation technologies, which present significant opportunities for Intel. In Q2, we shipped our test chip, Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit, silicon-based quantum chip which uniquely leverages decades of transistor design and manufacturing investments and expertise. 
Tunnel Falls fabrication achieved 95% yield rate with voltage uniformity similar to chips manufactured under the more usual CMOS process, with a single 300-millimeter wafer providing 24,000 quantum dot test chips. We strongly believe our silicon approach is the only path to true cost-effective commercialization of quantum computing, a silicon-based qubit approach is 1 million times smaller than alternative approaches.
Turning to PSG, NEX and Mobileye, demand trends are relatively stronger across our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure. Although as anticipated, NEX did see a Q2 inventory correction, which we expect to continue into Q3. In contrast, PSG, IFS and Mobileye continue on a solid growth trajectory, and we see the collection of these businesses in total growing year-on-year in calendar year '23, much better than third-party expectations for a mid-single digit decline in the semiconductor market, excluding memory. 
Looking specifically at our Programmable Solutions Group, we delivered record results for a third consecutive quarter. In Q2, we announced the Intel Agilex 7 with the R-Tile chiplet is shipping production qualified devices in volume to help customers accelerate workloads with seamless integration and the highest bandwidth processor interfaces. We have now PRQed 11 of the 15 new products we expected to bring to market in calendar year '23. 
For NEX, during Q2, Intel, Ericsson and HPE successfully demonstrated the industry's first vRAN solution running on the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processor with Intel vRAN Boost. In addition, we will enhance the collaboration we announced at Mobile World Congress to accelerate industry-scale open RAN, utilizing standard Intel Xeon-based platforms as telcos transform to a foundation of programmable, software-defined infrastructure. 
Mobileye continued to generate strong profitability in Q2 and demonstrated impressive traction with their advanced product portfolio by announcing a supervision eyes-on hands-off design win with Porsche and the mobility-as-a-service collaboration with Volkswagen Group that will soon begin testing in Austin, Texas. We continue to drive technical and commercial engagement with them, co-developing leading FMCW, LiDAR products based on Intel silicon photonics technology and partnering to drive the software-defined automobile vision that integrates Mobileye's ADAS technology with Intel's Cockpit offerings. 
Additionally, in the second quarter, we executed the secondary offering that generated meaningful proceeds as we continue to optimize our value creation efforts. In addition to executing on our process and product road maps during the quarter, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025. As mentioned during our internal foundry webinar, our new operating model establishes a separate P&L for our manufacturing group, inclusive of IFS and TD, which enables us to facilitate and accelerate our efforts to drive best-in-class cost structure, derisk our technology for external foundry customers and fundamentally changes incentives to drive incremental efficiencies. 
We have already identified numerous gains in efficiency, including factory loading, test and sort time reduction, packaging cost improvements, litho field utilization improvements, reductions in staffing, expedites and many more. It is important to underscore the inherent sustained value creation due to the tight connection between our business units and TD, manufacturing and IFS.
Finally, as we continue to optimize our portfolio, we agreed to sell a minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business to Bain Capital who brings a long history of partnering with companies to drive growth and value creation. IMS has created a significant market position with multi-beam mask writing tools that are critical to the semiconductor ecosystem for enabling EUV technology and is already providing benefit on our 5 nodes, 4 years efforts. Further, this capability becomes even more critical with the adoption of high NA EUV in the second half of the decade. 
As we continue to keep Moore's Law alive and very well, IMS is a hidden gem within Intel, and the business's growth will be exposed and accelerated through this transaction. While we still have work to do, we continue to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy. 5 nodes in 4 years remains well on track. Our product execution and road map is progressing well. We continue to build out our foundry business, and we are seeing early signs of success as we work to truly democratize AI and from cloud to enterprise, network, edge and client. We also saw strong momentum on our financial discipline and cost savings as we return to profitability, are executing our internal foundry model by 2024 and are leveraging our smart capital strategy to effectively and efficiently position us for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Dave.",2568
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2023",2023-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3815.0,2861149.0,106190539.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We drove stronger-than-expected business results in the second quarter, comfortably beating guidance on both the top and bottom line. While we expect continued improvement to global macroeconomic conditions, the pace of recovery remains moderate. We will continue to focus on what we can control, prioritizing investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, prudently and aggressively managing expenses near term and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term. 
Second quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, more than $900 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations in CCG, DCAI, IFS and Mobileye, partially offset by continued demand softness and elevated inventory levels in the network and edge markets, which impacted NEX results. Gross margin was 39.8%, 230 basis points better than guidance on stronger revenue. EPS for the quarter was $0.13, beating guidance by $0.17 as our revenue strength, better gross margin and disciplined OpEx management resulted in a return to profitability. 
Q2 operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up $4.6 billion sequentially. Net inventory was reduced by $1 billion or 18 days in the quarter, and accounts receivable declined by $850 million or 7 days as we continue to focus on disciplined cash management. Net CapEx was $5.5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. Our actions in the last few weeks, the completed secondary offering of Mobileye shares and the upcoming investment in our IMS Nanofabrication business by Bain Capital will generate more than $2.4 billion of cash and help to unlock roughly $35 billion of shareholder value. 
These actions further bolster our strong balance sheet and investment-grade profile with cash and short-term investments of more than $24 billion exiting Q2. We'll continue to focus on avenues to generate shareholder value from our broad portfolio of assets in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy. 
Moving to second quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $6.8 billion, up 18% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the quarter as the pace of customer inventory burn slowed. As anticipated, we see the market moving toward equilibrium and expect shipments to more closely align to consumption in the second half. ASPs declined modestly in the quarter due to higher education shipments and sell-through of older inventory. CCG showed outstanding execution in Q2, generating operating profit of $1 billion, an improvement of more than $500 million sequentially on higher revenue, improved unit costs and reduced operating expenses, offsetting the impact of pre-PRQ inventory reserves in preparation for the second half launch of Meteor Lake. 
DCAI revenue was $4 billion, ahead of expectations and up 8% sequentially, with the Xeon business up double digits sequentially. Data center CPU TAM contracted meaningfully in the first half of '23 and while we expect the magnitude of year-over-year declines to diminish in the second half, a slower-than-anticipated TAM recovery in China and across enterprise markets has delayed a return of CPU TAM growth. CPU market share remained relatively stable in Q2, and the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids contributed to CPU ASP improvement of 3% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. 
DCAI had an operating loss of $161 million, improving sequentially on higher revenue and ASPs and reduced operating expenses. Within DCAI, our FPGA products delivered a third consecutive quarter of record revenue, up 35% year-over-year, along with another record quarterly operating margin. We expect this business to return to more natural demand profile in the second half of the year as we work down customer backlog to normalized levels. 
NEX revenue was $1.4 billion, below our expectations in the quarter and down significantly in comparison to a record Q2 '22. Network and edge markets are slowly working through elevated inventory levels, elongated by sluggish China recovery, and telcos have delayed infrastructure investments due to macro uncertainty. We see demand remaining weak through at least the third quarter. Q2 NEX operating loss of $187 million improved sequentially on lower inventory reserves and reduced operating expenses. 
Mobileye continued to perform well in Q2. Revenue was $454 million, roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year with operating profit improving sequentially to $129 million. This morning, Mobileye increased fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 9% at the midpoint. Intel Foundry Services revenue was $232 million, up 4x year-over-year and nearly doubling sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS Nanofabrication tools. Operating loss was $143 million with higher factory start-up costs offsetting stronger revenue. 
Q2 was another strong quarter of cross-company spending discipline with operating expenses down 14% year-over-year. We're on track to achieve $3 billion of spending reductions in '23. With the decision to stop direct investment in our client NUC business earlier this month, we have now exited 9 lines of business since Pat rejoined the company with a combined annual savings of more than $1.7 billion. Through focused investment prioritization and austerity measures in the first half of the year, some of which are temporary in nature, OpEx is tracking a couple of hundred million dollars better than our $19.6 billion '23 committed goal. 
Now turning to Q3 guidance. We expect third quarter revenue of $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion. At the midpoint of $13.4 billion, we expect client CPU shipments to more quickly match sell-through. Data center, network and edge markets continue to face mixed macro signals and elevated inventory levels in the third quarter, while IFS and Mobileye are well positioned to generate strong sequential and year-over-year growth. We're forecasting gross margin of 43%, a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.20 at the midpoint of revenue guidance. We expect sequential margin improvement on higher sales and lower pre-PRQ inventory reserves. 
While we're starting to see some improvement in factory under load charges, most of the benefit will take some time to run through inventory and positively impact cost of sales. Investment in manufacturing capacity continues to be guided by our smart capital framework, creating flexibility through proactive investment in Shells and aligning equipment purchases to customer demand. In the last few weeks, we have closed agreements with governments in Poland and Germany, which include significant capital incentives, and we're well positioned to meet the requirements of funding laid out by the U.S. CHIPS Act.
Looking at capital requirements and offsets made possible by our smart capital strategy, we expect net capital intensity in the mid-30s as a percentage of revenue across '23 and '24 in aggregate. While our expectations for gross CapEx have not changed, the timing of some capital assets is uncertain and could land in either '23 or '24, depending on a number of factors. Having said that, we're confident in the level of capital assets we will receive over the next 18 months and expect offsets to track to the high end of our previous range of 20% to 30%.
Our financial results in Q2 reflect improved execution and improving macro conditions. Despite a slower-than-expected recovery in key consumption markets like China and the enterprise, we maintain our forecast of sequential revenue growth throughout the year. Accelerating AI use cases will drive increased demand for compute across the AI continuum, and Intel is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in each of our business units. We remain focused on the execution of our near- and long-term product, process and financial commitments and the prioritization of our owner's capital to generate free cash flow and create value for our stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.",1259

I wanted to focus, Pat, on the data center, the DCAI side of things. Strong upside in the quarter but it sounds like there's still some mix trends going forward. So I guess a 2-part question. Can you talk about what drove the upside and where the concern is going forward? And part of that concern, that crowding out potential that you just discussed with, accelerators versus CPUs, how is that playing out and when do you expect it to end?",86

Thanks, Ross, and thanks for the congrats on the quarter as well. I'm super proud of my team for the great execution this quarter, top, bottom line, beats raised, just great execution across every aspect of the business, both financially as well as road map execution.
With regard to the data center, obviously, the good execution, I'll just say we executed well, winning designs, fighting hard in the market, regaining our momentum, good execution. As you said, we'll see the Sapphire Rapids at the 1 millionth unit in the next couple of days, our Xeon Gen 4. So overall, it's feeling good. Road maps in very good shape so we're feeling very good about the future outlook of the business as well.
As we look to 5th Gen EcoRP with Sapphire and Granite Rapids, so all of those, I'll just say we're performing well. That said, we do think that the next quarter, at least, will show some softness. There's some inventory burn that we're still working through. We do see that big cloud customers, in particular, have put a lot of energy into building out their high-end AI training environments. And that is putting more of their budgets focused or prioritized into the AI portion of their build-out.
That said, we do think this is a near term, right, to surge that we expect will balance over time. We see AI as a workload, not as a market, right, which will affect every aspect of the business, whether it's client, whether it's edge, whether it's standard data center or on-premise enterprise or cloud. We're also seeing that Gen 4 Xeon, and we'll be enhancing that in the future road map, has significant AI capabilities. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, we expect about 25% today and growing of our Gen 4 is being driven by AI use cases.
And obviously, we're going to be participating more in the accelerator portion of the market with our Gaudi, Flex and MAX product lines. Particularly, Gaudi is gaining a lot of momentum. In my formal remarks, we said we now have over $1 billion of pipeline, 6x in the last quarter. So we're going to participate in the accelerated portion of it. We're seeing real opportunity for the CPU as that workload balances over time between CPU and accelerator. And obviously, we have a strong position to democratize AI across our entire portfolio of products.",406

I just want to pivot to Dave on a -- question on the gross margin side. Nice beat in the quarter and the sequential increase for the third quarter as well. Beyond the revenue increase side, which I know is important, can you just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses sequentially into the third quarter and even into the back half, some of the pre-PRQ reversals underutilization? Any of those kind of idiosyncratic blocks that we should be aware of as we think about the gross margin in the second half of the year?",99
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2023",2023-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3815.0,2861149.0,106190546.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,10,"Yes. Good question, Ross. So in the second quarter, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, that was largely a function of revenue. We had obviously beat revenue significantly, and we got a good fall-through, given the fixed cost nature of our business. And so that really was what helped us really outperform significantly on the gross margin side in the second quarter.
In the third quarter, we do, obviously, at the midpoint, see revenue growth sequentially. And so that will be helpful in terms of gross margin improvement. We expect, again, pretty good fall-through as we get that incremental revenue. We're also going to see underloadings come down, I would say, modestly come down for 2 reasons. One, we get that period charge for some of our underloading, but some of our underloading is actually just a function of the cost of the inventory. And so that takes some time to flow through.
So it will be more -- it will be a modest decline but nevertheless helpful on the gross margin front. And then as you point out, we will have pre-PRQ reserves in the third quarter but they're meaningfully down from the second quarter. Meteor Lake will not be a pre-PRQ reserve in the third quarter because we expect to launch that this quarter. But we have Emerald Rapids, that will certainly have some impact and then some of the other SKUs will also impact it. So coming down but not to zero.
So we have an opportunity actually to perform better in the fourth quarter, obviously dependent on the revenue and so forth, given that pre-PRQ reserves are likely to come off again in the fourth quarter. We should improve on the loading front in the fourth quarter as well. So there's some, I think, some good tailwinds on the gross margin front.
I'll just take an opportunity to talk longer term. We will continue to be weighed down for some quarters on underload because of the nature of just having it cycle through inventory and then come out through cost of sales. So for multiple quarters, we'll have some underloading charges that we'll see. And then as we talked about for -- since really, Pat joined and we kind of launched into the 5 nodes in 4 years, we're going to have a significant amount of startup costs that will hit gross margins that will affect us for a couple of years.
But we're really optimistic about where gross margins are going over the long term. Ultimately, we will get back to process parity and leadership and that will enable us to not have these start-up costs be a headwind. And of course, as you bring out products at a high performance in terms of process and in terms of product, that shows up in terms of our margins. And then as Pat mentioned, he went through a laundry list in the prepared remarks of areas of benefit that the internal foundry model will give us. We expect a pretty meaningful amount of that to come out in -- by the time we hit 2026.
But we won't be done there. I mean, I think there will be multiple opportunities over the course of multiple years to improve the gross margin. So Pat has talked about a pretty significant improvement in gross margins over time. And I think what we're seeing today is the beginnings of seeing that improvement show up in the P&L.",582

Can you just talk to that? And kind of obviously, Sapphire Rapids is going to get bigger. Can you talk about what you expect to see with platform cost in DCAI?",56
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2023",2023-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3815.0,2861149.0,106190549.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,13,"Platform costs, okay. Well, first of all, AST is obviously improving as we increase core count and as we get more competitive on the product offerings, that enables us to have more confidence in the market in terms of our pricing. So that's certainly helpful. Obviously, with the increase in core count, that affects the cost as well. So cost obviously goes up. But the longer -- the larger drivers of our cost structure will be around what we do in terms of the internal foundry model as we get up in terms of scale and get away from these underloading charges, and as we get past the start-up costs on 5 nodes in 4 years, which data center is certainly getting hit with.
And so those things, I think, longer term will be the biggest drivers of gross margin improvement. And as we get launch Sierra Forest in the first half of next year and Granite later thereafter and start to produce products on the data center side that are really competitive, that enables us to even be stronger in terms of our margin outlook and should help improve the overall P&L of data center.",196

Just also on servers, as you look to Q3, I think you talked about some of the cautious trends there. Can you talk to enterprise versus cloud? Is it different between the 2? And also, do you see -- are you seeing anything different in China for data center versus what you're seeing in North America?",57
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2023",2023-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3815.0,2861149.0,106190552.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,16,"Yes. And as we said Joe -- and thanks for the question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect to be seeing the TAM down in Q3, much driven by all of it. It's a little bit of a data center digestion for the cloud guys, a bit of enterprise weakness and some of that is more inventory. And the China market, I think, has been well reported, hasn't come back as strongly as people would have expected overall.
And then the last factor was one of the first question from Ross around the pressure from accelerator spend being stronger. So I think those 4 somewhat together, right, are leading to a bit of weakness at least through Q3. That said, our overall position is strengthening and we're seeing our products improve, right? We're seeing the benefits of the AI capabilities and our Gen 4 and beyond products improving. We're also starting to see some of the use cases like graft neural networks, Google's AlphaFold showing best results on CPUs as well, which is increasingly gaining momentum in the industry as people look for different aspects of data preparation, data processing, different innovations in AI.
So all of that taken together, we feel optimistic about the long-term opportunities that we have in data center and of course, the strengthening accelerator road map of Gaudi2, 3, Falcon Shores, being now well executed. Also, our first wafers are in hand for Gaudi3. So we see a lot of long-term optimism even as near term, we're working through some of the challenging environments of the market not being as strong as we would have hoped.",275

And thanks, C.J. And generally, there are great analogies here that from history we point to. Cases like virtualization was going to destroy the CPU TAM and then end up driving new workloads, right? If you think about a DGX platform, the leading-edge AI platform, it includes CPUs, right? Why? Head nodes, data processing, data prep, dominate certain portions of the workload. We also see, as we said, AI as a workload where you might spend 10 megawatts and months training a model but then you're going to use it very broadly for inferencing.
We do see with Meteor Lake ushering in the AI PC generation, where you have tens of watts being responding in a second or 2. And then AI is going to be in every hearing aid in the future, including mine, where it's 10 microwatts and instantaneous. So we do see as AI drives workloads across the full spectrum of applications. 
And for that, we're going to build AI into every product that we build, whether it's a client, whether it's an edge platform for retail and manufacturing and industrial use cases, whether it's an enterprise data center where they're not going to stand up a dedicated 10-megawatt farm, but they're not going to move their private data off-premises, right, and use foundational models that are available in open source as well as in the big cloud and training environments as well.
We firmly believe this idea of democratizing AI, opening the software stack, creating and participating with this broad industry ecosystem that's emerging. It was a great opportunity and one that Intel is well positioned to participate in. We've seen that the AI TAM, right, is part of the semiconductor TAM. We've always described this trillion-dollar semiconductor opportunity in AI being one of those superpowers, as I call it, of driving it. But it's not the only one and one that we're going to participate in broadly across our portfolio.",326

We're very affirmed by the Ericsson announcement, which is reinforcing the strong belief they have in 18A.
But over and above that, I mentioned the -- in the prepared remarks the 2 major significant opportunities that we made very good progress on as a big 18A foundry customers this quarter and an overall growing pipeline of potential foundry customers, test chips and process as well. So we feel 5 nodes in 4 years is on track. 18A is the culmination of that and good interest from the industry across the board.
I'd also say that as part of the overall strength in the foundry business as well and maybe tying the first part and the second part of your question together is that our packaging technologies are particularly interesting in the marketplace, an area that Intel never stumbled, right? This is an area of sustained leadership that we've had. And today, many of the big AI machines are packaging limited. And because of that, we're finding a lot of interest for our advanced packaging, and this is an area of immediate strength for the foundry business. We set up a specific packaging business unit within our foundry business and finding a lot of great opportunities for us to pursue there as well.",276

If I look at the third-party contributions, they were down a little bit, which was a little bit of a surprise. But you did say that the Arizona fab is on track. Can you sort of talk about that? And I know last quarter, you said gross CapEx would be first half weighted and the offsets would be back-half weighted. Is that still the case?",72
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2023",2023-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3815.0,2861149.0,106190561.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,25,"Yes. So we did manage CapEx a bit better than I was hoping. We thought it would be more front-end loaded. It's looking -- look it's going to be a lot more evenly distributed first half versus the second half. And we managed CapEx in particular this quarter really well, which I think obviously helped on the free cash flow side.
It's kind of a when you manage the CapEx, you get less offsets. And so that kind of drove the lower capital offsets for the quarter. But for the year, we're still on track to get the same amount of capital offsets through SCIP that we had anticipated. And that's really where most of the capital offsets have come so far. 
Now obviously, as we get into chips incentives that should be coming here in the not-too-distant future, that will add to the offsets that we get. We go into next year, we start getting the investment tax credit that will help on the capital offsets. So there'll be more things that come in the future. But right now, it's largely SCIP and it's SCIP1, and that's a function of where the spending lands quarter-to-quarter.",196

And just maybe to pile on to that a bit, obviously, getting EU CHIPS Act approved, we're excited about that for the Germany and Poland projects, which are -- will go for formal DG comp approval. We're also very happy. We submitted our first proposal, the On-Track Arizona facility, but we'll have 3 more proposals going in for U.S. CHIPS Act this quarter. And so we're now at pace for those. So everything there is feeling exactly as we said it would and super happy with the great engagement, both in Europe as well as with the U.S. Department of Commerce as we're working on those application processes.",109

Pat, so you talked about an accelerated pipeline of more than $1 billion. And I think Sandra has been recently implying that you could do over $1 billion in Gaudi next year. So the question is, is that the commitment? And then also at the Data Center Day, you had talked about merging the GPU and the Gaudi road maps into Falcon Shores but that's not going to come out until 2025. So the question really there is wondering where that leaves customers in terms of their commitment to your road map, given those changes.",98

And let me take that and Dave can add. Overall, as we said, the accelerator pipeline is now well over $1 billion and growing rapidly, about 6x this past quarter. That's led by but not exclusively, Gaudi, that also includes the MAX and Flex product lines as well. But the lion's share of that is Gaudi. Gaudi2 is shipping volume product today. Gaudi3 will be the volume product for next year and then Falcon Shores in '25, and we're already working on Falcon Shores 2 for '26. So we have a simplified road map as we bring together our GPU and our accelerators into a single offering.
But the progress that we're making with Gaudi2, it becomes more generalized with Gaudi3, the software stack, our oneAPI approach that we're taking will give customers confidence that they have forward compatibility into Gaudi3 and Falcon Shores. And we'll just be broadening the flexibility of that software stack. We're adding FPA. We just added PyTorch 2 support. So every step along the way, it gets better and broader use cases. More language models are being supported. More programmability is being supported in the software stack.
And we're building that full, right, solution set as we deliver on the best of GPU and the best of matrix acceleration in the Falcon Shores timeline. But every step along the way, it just gets better. Every software release gets better. Every hardware release gets better along the way to cover more of the overall accelerator marketplace. And as I said, we now have Gaudi3 wafers. First ones are enhanced. So that program is looking very good. And with this rapidly accelerating pipeline of opportunity, we expect that we'll be giving you very positive updates there in the future with both customers as well as expanded business opportunities.",302

Pat, you caught my attention with your comment about PCs next year or with AI having a Centrino moment. Do you mind just talking about that? And what -- when Centrino took place, it was very clear we unplugged from the wires and investors really grasped that. What is the aha moment with AI that's going to accelerate the client business and benefit Intel?",65
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2023",2023-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3815.0,2861149.0,106190568.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,32,"Yes. And I think the real question is what applications are going to become AI-enabled? And today, you're starting to see that people are going to the cloud and goofing around with ChatGPT, writing a research paper and that's like super cool, right? And kids are, of course, simplifying their homework assignments that way. But you're not going to do that for every client becoming AI-enabled. It must be done on the client for that to occur, right?
You can't go to the cloud. You can't round trip to the cloud. All of the new effects, real-time language translation in your Zoom calls, real-time transcription, automation, inferencing, relevance portraying, generated content and gaming environments, real-time creator environments being done through Adobes and others that are doing those as part of the client, new productivity tools being able to do local legal brief generations on clients, one after the other, right, across every aspect of consumer, of developer and enterprise efficiency use cases.
We see that there's going to be a raft of AI enablement and those will be client-centered. Those will also be at the edge. You can't round trip to the cloud. You don't have the latency, the bandwidth or the cost structure to round trip, let's say, inferencing in a local convenience store to the cloud. It will all happen at the edge and at the client.
So with that in mind, we do see this idea of bringing AI directly into the client immediately right, which we bring in to the market in the second half of the year, is the first major client product that includes native AI capabilities, the neural engine that we've talked about. And this will be a volume delivery that we will have. And we expect that Intel as the volume leader for the client footprint is the one that's going to truly democratize AI at the client and at the edge.
And we do believe that this will become a driver of the TAM because people will say, ""Oh, I want those new use cases. They make me more efficient and more capable, just like Centrino made me more efficient because I didn't have to plug into the wire, right? Now I don't have to go to the cloud to get these use cases. I'm going to have them locally on my PC in real time and cost effective."" We see this as a true AI PC moment that begins with Meteor Lake in the fall of this year.",418

Let me start on that and Dave can jump in. The biggest change quarter-on-quarter that we see is that we're now at healthy inventory levels. And we worked through inventory Q4, Q1 and some in Q2. We now see the OEMs and the channel at healthy inventory levels. We continue to see solid demand signals for the client business from our OEMs and even some of the end-of-quarter and early quarter sale through are clear indicators of good strength in that business. And obviously, we combine that with gaining share again in Q2. So we come into the second half of the year with good momentum and a very strong product line. So we feel quite good about the client business outlook.",123

When you look at our 10-Q, which will either be filed late tonight or early tomorrow, you'll see that we don't have a number in there for this quarter, which is an indication of how little we did in terms of strategic purchases.

It's great to see that you announced a customer for 18A on custom silicon. But there's a huge demand, it seems like, for custom silicon on the AI front. I think some of your hyperscale customers are already successfully using custom silicon for -- as an AI accelerator. So I'm just curious what your strategy for that market is. Is that a focus area for you? If so, do you have any engagements with customers right now?",90

Thank you, Srini. And the simple answer is yes. And I have multiple ways to play in this market. Obviously, one of those is foundry customers. We have a good pipeline of foundry customers for 18A, foundry opportunities. And several of those opportunities that we're investigating are exactly what you described, people looking to do their own unique versions of their AI accelerator components, and we're engaging with a number of those.
But some of those are going to be variations of Intel standard products. And this is where the IDM 2.0 strength really comes to play where they could be using some of our silicon, combining it with some of their silicon designs. And given our advanced packaging strength, that gives us another way to be participating in those areas. And of course, that reinforces some of the near-term opportunities will just be packaging, right, where they already have designed with one of the other foundry, but we're going to be able to augment their capacity opportunities with immediately being able to engage with packaging opportunities and we're seeing pipeline of those opportunities.
So overall, we agree that this is clearly going to be a market. We also see that some of the ones that you've seen most in the press are about particularly high-end training environments. But as we said, we see AI being infused in everything. And there's going to be AI chips for the edge, AI chips for the communications infrastructure, AI chips for sensing devices, for automotive devices, and we see opportunities for us, both as a product provider and as a foundry and technology provider across that spectrum, and that's part of the unique positioning that IDM 2.0 gives us for the future.",290

Dave, it's good to see the progress on the working capital front. I think previously, you said your expectation is that free cash flow would turn positive sometime in second half. Just curious if that's still the expectation. And also, on the gross margin front, is there any, I guess, PRQ charges that we should be aware of as we go into fourth quarter?",67
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2023",2023-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3815.0,2861149.0,106190578.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,42,"Okay. So on -- let me just take a moment just to give the team credit on the second quarter in terms of working capital because we brought inventory down by $1 billion. Our days sales outstanding on the AR front is down to 24 days, which is exceptional. So a lot of what you saw in terms of the improving free cash flow from Q1 to Q2 was working capital. So I think the team has done an outstanding job just really focusing on all the elements that drive free cash flow.
Our expectation is still by the end of the year to get to breakeven free cash flow. There's no reason why we shouldn't achieve that. Obviously, the net CapEx might be a little different this year than we thought coming into the year. But as we talked about, it's just a focus on free cash flow, the improved outlook in terms of the business. We think we can get to breakeven by the end of the year.
As it relates to pre-PRQ reserves in the fourth quarter, we're likely to have some, but it should be a pretty good quarter-over-quarter improvement from the third quarter, which was obviously a good quarter-over-quarter improvement from the second quarter.",209

Yes, right? And everyone is looking for alternatives. Clearly, the MLPerf numbers that we posted recently with Gaudi2 show very competitive numbers, significant TCO benefits for customers. They're looking for alternatives. They're also looking for more capacity. And so we're definitely engaged. We already have Gaudi instances on AWS as available today already.
And some of the names that we described in our earnings calls, Stability AI, Genesis Cloud. So some of these are the proven, I'll say, at scale Tier 1 cloud providers but some of the next-generation ones are also engaging. So overall, absolutely, we expect that to be the case. We're also on our own DevCloud, we're making it easier for customers to test Gaudi more quickly. And with that, we now have 1,000 customers now who are taking advantage of the Intel Development Cloud. We're building a 1,000-node Gaudi cluster so that they can be at scale with their testing a very large training environment. So overall, the simple answer is, yes, very much so, and we're seeing a good pipeline of those opportunities.
So with that, let me just wrap up our time together today. Thank you. We're grateful that you have joined us today, and we're thankful that we have the opportunity to update you on our business. And simply put, it was a very good quarter. We exceeded expectations on top line, on bottom line. We raised guidance and we look forward to the continued opportunities that we have of accelerating our business and seeing the margin improvement that comes in the second half of the year.
But even more important to me was the operational improvements that we saw, a good fiscal discipline, cost saving discipline and best of all, the progress that we've made, right, on our execution, our process execution, product execution, the transformational journey that we're in. And I just want to say a big thank you to my team for having a very good quarter that we could tell you about today.

Before we begin, given our significant and now almost 50-year presence in Israel, we are deeply saddened by the recent attacks and their impact on the region. Our utmost priority is the safety and welfare of our people in Israel and their families. But I also want to recognize the resilience of our teams as they have kept our operations running and our factory expansion progressing. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by the war, and I am praying for a swift return to peace. 
Turning to our results. We delivered an outstanding Q3, beating expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Revenue was above the high end of our guidance, and EPS benefited from both strong operating leverage and expense discipline. More important than our standout financial performance were the key operational milestones we achieved in the quarter across process and products, Intel Foundry Services and our strategy to bring AI everywhere. Simply put, this quarter demonstrates the meaningful progress we have made towards our IDM 2.0 transformation. 
The foundation of our strategy is reestablishing transistor power and performance leadership. While many thought our ambitions were a bit audacious when we began our 5 nodes in 4 year journey roughly 2.5 years ago, we have increasing line of sight towards achieving our goal. Intel 7 is done with nearly 150 million units in aggregate of Alder Lake, Raptor Lake and Sapphire Rapids already in the market. In addition, Emerald Rapids has achieved product release and began shipping this month. 
In Q3, we began initial shipments of Meteor Lake on Intel 4, which we are now aggressively ramping on the most productive fleet of EUV tools in the industry, providing us with a greater than 20% capital efficiency advantage compared to when EUV tools were first launched. High-volume EUV manufacturing is well underway in Oregon, and more recently, in Ireland. Our Fab 34 in Ireland represents the first high-volume EUV production in Europe, underscoring our commitment to establish geographically diverse and resilient supply. We are the only leading-edge semiconductor manufacturer at scale in every major region of the globe. 
Our Intel 3 process is tracking to be manufacturing-ready by year-end, supporting our first 2 Intel 3 products: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. In fact, our production stepping of Sierra Forest is already out of fab, and what we expect to be the production stepping of Granite Rapids has already taped in and is in the fab now. We are particularly excited by our move into the angstrom era with Intel 20A and Intel 18A, Adding to our accelerating adoption of EUV are 2 key new innovations, RibbonFET and PowerVia, representing the first fundamental change to the transistor and process architecture since we commercialized FinFET in 2012. I have been studying some diagrams for almost 40 years. RibbonFET and PowerVia are true works of art, the most exquisite transistors ever created. 
We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness on Intel 20A in the first half of 2024. Arrow Lake, our lead product on 20A, is already running Windows and demonstrating excellent functionality. Even more significant, we had a critical milestone on Intel 18A with the 0.9 release of the PDK with imminent availability to external customers. In simple terms, the invention phase of RibbonFET and PowerVia is now complete, and we are racing towards production-ready industry-leading process technology.
Our first products on Intel 18A will go into fab on schedule in Q1 '24 with Clearwater Forest for servers, Panther Lake for clients and, of course, a growing number of IFS test chips. We expect to achieve manufacturing readiness for Intel 18A in second half '24, completing our incredible 5 nodes in 4 years journey on or ahead of schedule. While Intel 18A reestablishes transistor leadership, we are racing to increase that lead. We announced that innovation, our plans to lead the industry and move to glass substrate for high-density, performance and unique optical capabilities. We also announced our plans to begin installation of the world's first high-NA EUV tool for commercial use by the end of the year to continue our modernizations and infrastructure expansion of our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon, home of our technology development team. 
Moore's Law continues to be the foundational driver of semiconductor technology and economics, which, in turn, fuels broader innovation in every industry across the globe. We remain committed to be good stewards of Moore's Law and drive advancements until we have exhausted every element on the periodic table. Importantly, our progress on process technology is now being well validated by third parties. We have made great progress with early IFS customers this quarter, which we expect to only accelerate with the release of the 0.9 PDK for Intel 18A. 
A major customer committed to Intel 18A and Intel 3, which includes a meaningful prepayment that expedites and expands our capacity corridor for this customer. The customer is seeing particularly good power, performance and area efficiency in their design. This opportunity is very significant and highlights our full system's foundry capabilities and high-performance computing, big die designs, leadership performance and area efficient transistors, advanced packaging and systems expertise. In addition, we are extremely pleased to announce today that we have signed with 2 additional 18A customers. Both are particularly focused in areas of high-performance compute and benefiting from power performance per unit silicon area. 
We have also made substantial progress with our next major customer and are expecting to conclude commercial contract negotiations before year-end. Finally, we were also very happy to expand our growing foundry ecosystem by completing our strategic partnership with Synopsys in Q3 to include IP for Intel 3 and Intel 18A for both Intel internal and external foundry customers. With the rise of AI and high-performance computing applications, our advanced packaging business is proving to be yet another unique advantage. We have seen a surge of interest in our advanced packaging from most leading AI chip companies. With capacity corridors quickly available, this is proving to be a significant accelerant and on-ramp for Intel Foundry customers. 
During the quarter, we were awarded 2 customer AI designs for our advanced packaging and with an additional 6 customers in active negotiations, we expect several more awards by year-end. We have also established an important business relationship with Tower Semiconductor, utilizing our manufacturing assets in New Mexico, along with Tower investing capital expenditures of roughly $300 million for its use in this facility. This represents an important step in our foundry strategy, improving cash flows by utilizing our manufacturing assets over a significantly longer period of time. 
Finally, we have submitted all 4 of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, representing over $100 billion of U.S. manufacturing and research investments to the CHIPS Program Office and are working closely with them as they review these proposals. We look forward to providing a deeper update on our foundry business during our planned IFS industry event in Q1 of 2024. 
We are on a mission to bring AI everywhere. We see the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030. We are empowering the market to seamlessly integrate and effectively run AI in all their applications. For the developer working with multitrillion parameter frontier models in the cloud, Gaudi and our suite of AI accelerators provides a powerful combination of performance, competitive MLPerf benchmarks and a very cost-efficient TCO. However, as the world moves towards more AI-integrated applications, there's a market shift towards local inferencing. It's a nod to both the necessity of data privacy and an answer to cloud-based inference cost. 
With AI accelerated Xeon for enterprise, Core Ultra launching the AI PC generation and OpenVINO enabling developers seamless and versatile support for a range of client and edge silicon, we are bringing AI to where the data is being generated and used rather than forcing it into the cloud. Our expansive footprint spanning cloud and enterprise servers to volume clients and ubiquitous edge devices positions us well to enable the AI continuum across all our market segments. The AI continuum enables AI everywhere. 
DCAI exceeded our forecast this quarter with server revenue up modestly sequentially. We continue to see a strong ramp of our fourth-gen Xeon processor with the world's top 10 CSPs now in general availability and improving strength from MNCs. During the quarter, we shipped our 1,000,000th fourth-gen Xeon unit and are on track to surpass 2 million units next month. 4th Gen Xeon includes powerful accelerators, demonstrating best-in-class CPU performance for AI, security and networking workloads. 
Our AI-enhanced Xeons are primed for model inferencing, enabling seamless infusion of AI into existing workloads. This was visible this quarter with over 1/3 of 4th Gen Xeon shipments directly related to AI applications. We are the clear leader in AI CPU results as seen in MLCommons benchmarks today, and our road map provides significant further improvements with Granite Rapids expected to deliver an additional 2 to 3x AI performance on top of our industry-leading 4th Gen Xeon. 
We continue to make excellent progress with our Xeon road map. Our 5th Gen Xeon processor code-named Emerald Rapids is in production and ramping to customers and will officially launch on December 14 in New York City. Sierra Forest, our first E-core Xeon is on track for first half '24 with customers well into their validation process. Sierra Forest will feature up to 288 E-cores targeting next-generation cloud-native workloads, delivering even more price performance and power efficiency for our customers. 
Granite Rapids, which shortly follows Sierra Forest, is also well into our validation cycle with customers. While the industry has seen some wallet share shifts between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, as well as some inventory burn in the server market, we see signs of normalization as we enter Q4 driving modest sequential TAM growth. Across most customers, we expect to exit the year at healthy inventory levels, and we see growth in compute cores returning to more normal historical rates off the depressed 2023. More importantly, our successful road map execution is strengthening our product portfolio with Gen 4 and Gen 5 Xeon, Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids positioning us well to win back share in the data center. 
In addition, we expect to capture a growing portion of the accelerator market in 2024 with our suite of AI accelerators led by Gaudi, which is setting leadership benchmark results with third parties like MLCommons and Hugging Face. We are pleased with the customer momentum we are seeing from our accelerator portfolio and Gaudi in particular, and we have nearly doubled our pipeline over the last 90 days. As we look to 2024, like many others, we now are focused on having enough supply to meet our growing demand. 
Dell is partnering with us to deliver Gaudi for cloud and enterprise customers with its next-generation power edge systems featuring Xeon and Gaudi AI accelerators to support AI workloads ranging from large-scale training to inferencing at the edge. Together with Stability.ai, we are building one of the world's largest AI supercomputers entirely on 4th Gen Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi2 AI accelerators. Our Gaudi road map remains on track with Gaudi3 out of the fab, now in packaging and expected to launch next year. And in 2025, Falcon Shores brings our GPU and Gaudi capabilities into a single product. 
Moving to the client. CCG delivered another strong quarter, exceeding expectations for the third consecutive quarter, driven by strength in commercial and consumer gaming SKUs where we are delivering leadership performance. As we expected, customers completed their inventory burn in the first half of the year, driving solid sequential growth, which we expect will continue into Q4. We expect full year 2023 PC consumption to be in line with our Q1 expectations of approximately 270 million units. In the near term, we expect Windows 10 end-of-service to be a tailwind, and we remain positive on the long-term outlook for PC TAM returning to plus or minus 300 million units. 
Intel continues to be a pioneer in the industry as we ushered in the era of the AI PC in Q3 when we released the Intel Core Ultra processor code-named Meteor Lake. Built on Intel 4, the Intel Core Ultra has been shipping to customers for several weeks and will officially launch on December 14 alongside our 5th Gen Xeon. The Ultra represents the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology, delivering improved power efficiency and graphics performance. It is also the first Intel client processor to feature our integrated neural processing unit, or NPU, that enables dedicated low-power compute for AI workloads. Next year, we will deliver Arrow Lake as well as Lunar Lake, which offers our next-gen NPU, ultra-low power mobility and breakthrough performance per watt. 
Panther Lake, our 2025 client offering, heads into the fab in Q1 '24 on Intel 18A. The arrival of the AI PC represents an inflection point in the PC industry, not seen since we first introduced Centrino in 2003. Centrino was so successful because of our time-to-market advantage, our embrace of an open ecosystem, strong OEM partnerships, our performance silicon and our developer scale. Not only are these same advantages in place today, they are even stronger as we enter the age of the AIPC. 
We are catalyzing this moment with our AIPC acceleration program with over 100 ISVs already participating, providing access to Intel's deep bench of engineering talent for targeted software optimization, core development tools and go-to-market opportunities. We are encouraged and motivated by our partners and competitors who see the tremendous growth potential of the PC market.  NEX is also seeing early signs of the benefits from growing AI use cases. Our ethnic and IPU businesses are well suited to support the high I/O bandwidth required by AI workloads in the data center with growth expected to accelerate for both in 2024. 
Additionally, at the edge, as part of Intel's focus on every aspect of the AI continuum, NEX launched OpenVINO 2023.1, the latest version of the AI inferencing and deployment run time of choice for developers on client and edge platforms, with ai.io and FIT:MATCH demonstrating how they use OpenVINO to accelerate their applications at our innovation conference. We have leadership developer software tool chains that have seen a doubling of developer engagements this year. While NEX entered their inventory correction after client in DCAI, Q3 results beat our internal forecast and grew sequentially. We see continued signs of stabilization heading into Q4. 
Finally, our Smart Capital strategy underpins our relentless drive for efficiency and our commitment to be great allocators of our owners' capital while consistently looking for innovative ways to unlock value for all our stakeholders. We remain on track to reducing costs by $3 billion in 2023, and we continue to see significant incremental opportunities for operational improvement as we execute on our internal foundry model. In addition, in Q3, we made the decision to divest the pluggable module portion of our silicon photonics business, allowing us to focus on the higher-value component business and optical I/O solutions to enable AI infrastructure scaling. This marks the tenth business we have exited in the last 2.5 years, generating $1.8 billion in annual savings and a testament to our efforts to optimize our portfolio and drive long-term value creation. 
Mobileye's solid Q3 and Q4 outlook continue to underscore the benefits of increased autonomy afforded by our initial public offering last year. In addition, we added TSMC as a minority investor in our IMS nano fabrication business in Q3. And earlier this month, we announced our plans to operate PSG as a stand-alone business beginning January 1. Similar to Mobileye and IMS, this decision gives PSG the mandate, focus and resources to better capitalize on their growth opportunities. We plan to report PSG results as a stand-alone segment in Q1, to bring in private investors in 2024 and to create a path to an initial public offering over the next 2 to 3 years. 
In summary, we continue to deliver tangible progress 2.5 years into our transformation journey. We are on track with 5 nodes in 4 years. We are hitting or beating all our product road map milestones. We are establishing ourselves as a global at-scale systems foundry for both wafer processing and advanced packaging. We are unlocking new growth opportunities fueled by AI. And we are driving financial discipline and operational efficiencies as we continue to unlock value for our shareholders. 
While we are encouraged by our progress to date, we know we have much more work in front of us as we continue to relentlessly drive forward with our strategy, maintain our execution momentum and deliver our commitments to our customers. I'd like to personally thank the Intel family for all their efforts. With that, let me turn it over to Dave to go through our results in more detail and provide guidance for Q4.",2837
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2023",2023-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4025.0,2928154.0,107913589.0,Presenter Speech,David Zinsner,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter financially on top of outstanding execution on our product and process road maps as we continue to drive our IDM 2.0 transformation. We beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin and EPS. While we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks, we're pleased with the momentum and health of our business, and we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments, prudently and aggressively managing near-term expenses and driving fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term. 
Third quarter revenue was $14.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and $750 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue exceeded our expectations across all major lines of business. Gross margin was 45.8%, 280 basis points better than our guidance, driven by higher revenue and ASPs and better sell-through of previously reserved inventory. EPS for the quarter was $0.41, beating guidance by $0.21, as our revenue strength, improving gross margins and disciplined OpEx management resulted in sequential EPS growth of $0.28. Q3 operating cash flow was $5.8 billion, up $3 billion sequentially. Net inventory was down $500 million or 7 days in the quarter. We also significantly improved the linearity of our shipments, which brought DSO down by 5 days. In total, our working capital improvement initiatives have yielded more than $2 billion of cash year-to-date. 
Net CapEx was $4.9 billion, resulting in positive adjusted free cash flow of approximately $950 million, and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. In Q3, we announced the sale of 10% of our IMS nano fabrication business to TSMC, following the investment from Bain Capital in June. When combined with the Mobileye IPO, these transactions have unlocked more than $30 billion of value. Earlier this month, we signaled our intent to pursue private investment and ultimately, an IPO for our PSG business as we continue to pursue opportunities to increase value for our shareholders. 
Moving to third quarter business unit results. CCG delivered revenue of $7.9 billion, up 16% sequentially and ahead of our expectations for the third consecutive quarter. Customer inventory levels are healthy, and the market remains on track to our January consumption TAM signal of roughly 270 million units for 2023. CCG's operating profit doubled sequentially to $2.1 billion on higher revenue, sell-through of reserved inventory and stronger ASPs driven by strength in our commercial and gaming products in the quarter. 
DCAI revenue was $3.8 billion, ahead of our internal forecast. Despite continued unit TAM softness, the Xeon business was up sequentially, with MNC customers showing a better than seasonal recovery in the quarter. Favorable customer mix, along with strong adoption of newer products with higher core density, led to record Xeon ASPs in Q3. Despite sequential revenue decline, DCAI returned to profitability and contributed operating profit of $71 million, improving sequentially on better ASPs, reduced factory underload charges and continued spending discipline.
Within DCAI, revenue for the Programmable Solutions Group declined mid-teens percent sequentially. As we discussed earlier this month, after a period of strong growth and tight supply, the FPGA business is entering a period of inventory burn. We expect PSG to decline in Q4 and be depressed for the next few quarters as customers work through inventory before returning to a more normalized run rate and growth.
NEX revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% sequentially. Edge markets showed signs of recovery in Q3, leading NEX revenue to exceed our expectations. Network and telco markets continue to work through elevated inventory and weak demand, which we expect to persist through the end of the year. NEX also returned to profitability in Q3 with operating profit of $17 million, up $200 million sequentially on stronger revenue and reduced operating expenses.
Intel Foundry Services revenue was $311 million, growing 4x year-over-year and 34% sequentially on increased packaging revenue and higher sales of IMS tools. IFS operating loss was $86 million as ramping factory and operating expenses offset stronger revenue in the period. Mobileye continues to perform well. Q3 revenue was $530 million, up 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, with operating profit of $107 million on a consolidated basis, up 32% sequentially. This morning, Mobileye increased their fiscal year 2023 outlook for adjusted operating income by 7% at the midpoint.
Q3 represented another outstanding quarter of cross-company spending discipline and focused portfolio management with operating expenses down 15% year-over-year. While we're on track to achieve $3 billion of total spending reductions in 2023, we expect sequentially higher OpEx in Q4 due to seasonal marketing activities, higher profit-dependent compensation and the end of some temporary austerity measures taken earlier in the year. We also had a onetime credit in Q3 associated with an asset sale, which will impact the sequential comparison in Q4.
Now turning to Q4 guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue of $14.6 billion to $15.6 billion, delivering on our January commitment to grow revenue sequentially throughout 2023. In the client business, we're encouraged by the return of historical purchasing cycles as our channel checks, partner feedback and ASPs all point to healthy inventory levels and growing demand. We expect moderate sequential growth from DCAI, with Xeon's strength more than offsetting a decline in PSG and continued recovery in edge markets roughly offsetting persistent network weakness. At the revenue midpoint of $15.1 billion, we expect gross margin to flow through at approximately 60% of revenue growth, resulting in Q4 gross margin of approximately 46.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.44.
We continue to operate under our Smart Capital framework. In Q3, we received a capital grant from the state of Ohio and our first foundry prepay. In addition, we continue to work with the U.S. CHIPS Office on their review of our 4 U.S. applications. And we continue to work with Germany, Poland and the European Commission on our planned expansions in Europe. There are no changes to our prior forecast of mid-30s percent net capital intensity across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate. Capital offsets will trend towards the higher end of our 20% to 30% range in that time frame, though we do expect the vast majority of those offsets to land in 2024.
In closing, Q3 was Intel's strongest quarter since we began our transformation. We achieved significant milestones toward regaining process leadership on Intel 18A, delivered Meteor Lake and Emerald Rapids on time, secured multiple wafer and advanced packaging foundry customers and delivered another quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom lines. We will continue to make significant investments as we execute the IDM 2.0 strategy, and we remain confident and committed to our long-term financial targets.
We're participating in a large and growing semiconductor TAM. Our foundry and AI assets are showing great momentum in the market. We're steadily closing structural cost gaps, and we continue to make progress toward delivering the financial returns that we and our owners expect. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.",1166

You're now coming out of the year at 46.5% but you did roughly 43% for the year. And I think at that event, you said next year is going to be up but probably not a couple of hundred basis points. So did you mean off of the Q4 run rate or do you mean off of the 43% for the year? And can you kind of shape that for us throughout the year?",101
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2023",2023-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4025.0,2928154.0,107913593.0,Answer,David Zinsner,,Executives,7,"Yes. Well, let me just -- if you don't mind, let me step back. I want to talk a little bit about Q3 for a second because Q3, I was really proud of the team's performance in terms of gross margins for Q3 coming in just shy of 46%. It was great execution in terms of spending from the team. They also did work on the underloading, which helped, and we were able to sell through some previously reserved inventory, and so that really helped propel the gross margin. So we had phenomenal fall-through in the third quarter.
I'd say fourth quarter, we start to go back to what would be more of our typical fall-through range, somewhat muted by the fact that we are still going through 5 nodes in 4 years. There is spend associated with that, which kind of mutes us. So we're probably a little bit higher normally in terms of fall-through, but with that, it's probably like a 60% fall-through. That's kind of the normal range we think of, and that's what we're guiding for the fourth quarter.
Beyond that, we'll save the rest of the commentary for next year when we close out '23. I would just say, just on a longer-term basis, Pat has talked a lot about gross margins of 60%. And I feel like we are even more confident around our ability to hit that 60% threshold for a number of reasons. One, the execution that Pat talked about on 5 nodes in 4 years. When we get through that, of course, we eliminate the headwind on margins, but it turns around to a tailwind because when you're a process leader, you get better gross margins.
Also as product execution improves, that also as we launch the products that are competitive in the marketplace. And we've seen that already in the client space, that helps on the gross margin side. But then more importantly, maybe the thing that's near and dear to my heart is this internal foundry model that we've built, where we're now measuring the manufacturing and TD organization as a separate P&L. We'll officially do that next year and we'll segment report it that way. But we're already this year starting to look at it that way in operations reviews. We're starting to do the planning for next year in that -- with that lens. We're doing the long-term plan in that lens.
And all the things that we thought we would see in the dialogue between those functions, we're already starting to see now. We see the product organizations already starting to optimize around test times, around stepping, around how many samples and hot lots they do in the fab. Suddenly, things they didn't spend a lot of time thinking about before, they care a lot about now. And we're already starting to see improvements in the P&L because of that.
On the same front, in manufacturing, they're now really, really worried about loadings. They're worried about a P&L. They want to drive the most revenue they can in their P&L, try to drive the cost down as much as possible. So I just think that we will see a lot of opportunities as we progress through '24 and beyond that are really going to make an impact on gross margins and give us a lot of confidence around this 60%.",564

Pat, can you just talk about the dynamics and maybe the allocation that you're getting from your major foundry partner? They went kind of out of their way to sort of go at the idea that your -- that 18A is going to be comparable to what they'll have in that same time frame. So now that it's becoming a little more apparent that you are making progress, has there been any change in that relationship and the allocation that you're getting from them?",87

And first, I'd say we're -- come to a different conclusion than what you might have heard from them. We feel that our 5 nodes in 4 years, the leadership position that we expect with Intel 18A, this is a remarkable set of work. And as you heard me say in my formal comments, we think of 18A as a work of art. This is the finest transistor, right? And we've invented the last 30 years of transistors. This is the best one that's ever been built, right? And that and PowerVia, we feel very confident that we are on track to the leadership position that we described.
And as we've also said, hey, we're well underway on the things after that. And things like high-NA, the next generation of EUV or advanced packaging with glass, all of these are now being backed up and reinforced by the external customer commitments. 3 18A customers now making commitments, the prepay customer I spoke about earlier, 2 additional customers, partners, we announced the ARM relationship in April, and they're now seeing very positive results on power performance area from 18A.
And as we think about the relationship with TSMC, hey, this is a great company and one that we partner with, one that we are a competitor to, one that we're a customer of. We collaborate with them. As you saw, they became an investor in the IMS business this quarter as well. And as a customer of those, we're very happy with how they're supporting us in our products as we're raising many of these products forward to there, they're a critical supplier to us as we're a critical supplier to them. This is one of the most critical relationships in the industry. I spent a lot of time personally on it.
We're very confident in our road map. And this is really an exceptional quarter for 5 nodes in 4 years and getting back to process leadership. We are well on our way to doing exactly what we said we would.",342

The flip side of that is there's been reports recently of a number of people entering the CPU business for PCs using ARM architectures similar to what we've seen over the last couple of years on the data center side of things. .
Can you just talk about the competitive landscape of x86 versus ARM? And potentially, more importantly, if in fact, ARM was gaining traction, would you consider using that architecture and kind of broaden your technology internally?",98
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2023",2023-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4025.0,2928154.0,107913599.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,13,"Yes. Thank you, Ross. And overall, I think what you're seeing is the industry is excited around the AIPC. And as I declared this generation of AIPC at our Innovation Conference a couple of months ago, we're seeing that materialize and customers, competitors seeing excitement around that. ARM and Windows client alternatives, generally, they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business. And we take all competition seriously. But I think history as our guide here, we don't see these as potentially being all that significant overall.
Our momentum is strong. We have a strong road map, Meteor Lake launching this AIPC generation December 14. Arrow Lake, Lunar Lake, we've already demonstrated the next-generation product at Lunar Lake, which has significant improvements in performance and capabilities. We'll be signing Panther Lake, the next generation in the fab in Q1 and Intel 18A. We announced our AI Acceleration program, which already has over 100 ISVs part of it. We'll have -- we expect in the next 2 years over 100 million x86 million AI-enhanced PCs in the marketplace. This is just an extraordinary amount of volume. The ecosystem benefits that, that brings into the marketplace.
When thinking about other alternative architectures like ARM, we also say, wow, what a great opportunity for our foundry business. And given the results I referenced before, we see that as a unique opportunity that we have to participate in the full success of the ARM ecosystem or whatever market segments that may be as an accelerant to our foundry offerings, which are now becoming, we think, very significant around the ARM ecosystem with our foundry packaging and 18A wafer capabilities as well.",279

One for Dave. The OpEx side of things, you guys did great in the third quarter. You talked about it going up in the fourth quarter, but I still think the full year is ahead of what you originally had targeted. How do we think about next year's OpEx just conceptually? I know you said you're going to have $3 billion in total cost savings this year, $8 billion to $10 billion longer term. What are the puts and takes on OpEx as we look into 2024?",90

So again, back to the pride thing, I'm really proud of what we did in the third quarter and really what we've been able to execute for the year on that spend reduction. There was a lot of work associated with that. We had to drive a lot of, obviously, efficiency. But more importantly, as Pat talked about, we kind of end of -- or we took 10 programs or product areas and either divested of them or closed them out in an effort to improve our spending.
And as we see -- and in addition to that, I would say that we also looked at businesses where we thought we could dramatically unlock value. And we think we've done the 3 areas that we thought most likely unlock value. So I think from that perspective, we feel we're pretty done with the activities associated with spending. And so that said, we are -- we do think we'll see benefit from our internal foundry model not only on the cost side but also on the OpEx side. And so that's the area that we'll focus over the long term in terms of managing spending.
And ultimately, the goal is to get to 60% gross margins but it's also to get to 40% operating margins. So that does entail driving efficiency in OpEx and we think there's plenty of opportunity. I'd say the same thing on OpEx that I said on gross margins. We'll save the fourth quarter -- or the '24 visibility for '24 when we close out '23.",260

Can you talk to that a little bit, how much of that is training versus inference?",42
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2023",2023-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4025.0,2928154.0,107913605.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,19,"Yes, thank you. And overall, I'd just say there's a lot -- a surge of interest in this category, Joe. In the Gaudi business for us, we're coming from a small base but it's expanding rapidly. We do see a mix of training opportunities and inferencing opportunities. When we go to the inferencing side of the workload, which we think will be the significant expansion of workload going forward, a few people generate models, a lot of people use them. Sort of like how many people do weather modeling? Not many. How many people use weather models? A lot. And that's how we think about training and inferencing.
So the power, the market will be in the inferencing deployments. And that will be both a Gaudi play as well as a Xeon play. And I would point to the example that we spoke about, for instance, with Dell where they really see bringing together both of those to give us a full portfolio of adding inferencing to existing workloads where our AI-enhanced Xeons will be strong as well as creating farms for inference, inference, inference or for training where Gaudi will be more of a play.
Now the interest that we've seen in Gaudi is a worldwide statement. So we have demand portfolio that really sort of matches the Intel balance across all geographies. We've also seeing a huge upsurge in the amount of DevCloud where this provides the fast on-ramp to the Intel AI and all of our advanced silicon offerings. 
But I'd also say, Joe, that this is an AI everywhere play, as I said in my formal comments, which is also edge and client as well. So we view it as edge, client, on-premise data center as well as a cloud. And this AI continuum is a unique position for Intel that we think gives us a very large opportunity to see this upside of capabilities that the AI workload is going to drive across all elements of computing.",332

In terms of that Gaudi business, do you anticipate any impact from the China export controls? And more broadly, are there any other impacts from the China export controls on Intel's business?",35

Thanks, Joe. And I do think there's a lot of interest in that. On the export controls, as you look at them and read them, they're very much aimed at the high-end training and these accelerator, the high-end accelerators on where they are aimed. Now obviously, some of that was for us as well in China. But we also, as I said, in the first part of your question, we saw a worldwide demand for our activities there. And overall, we're now supply constrained on Gaudi and racing to catch up to that supply worldwide.
Of course, we're studying those -- the new BIS released rules carefully. We're working with BIS. We're in the 60-day comment period with BIS so we're actively working with them. We do believe that we'll have plenty of opportunity in China continuing to deploy our products there broadly even as we comply and work with BIS specifically around the regulations that they're putting in place, particularly around high-end accelerators and AI training.
So overall, we feel and have included that as part of our overall guidance for the fourth quarter. We feel good about the momentum that we have for AI everywhere, and we'll, of course, be engaging with our customers, the governments and as we build out our road map taking all of that into consideration.",223

Pat, I was wondering if you could unpack your foundry comments. You have the customer that we've known about, where there's prepays. I think you mentioned there's 2 more customers that you're signing up and another by year-end, and then there's an event in the first quarter. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more detail and talk about how that's going to flow through and the materiality into the coming years as well.",83
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2023",2023-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4025.0,2928154.0,107913611.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,25,"Yes. Thanks, Ben. Happy to unpack that a little bit more. So we announced back at the Deutsche Bank conference that we had our first major prepay customer for that. That effort has continued to go very well since that point in time, and the relationship is expanding with that customer. But we also added 2 more customers this quarter as well, so now we have 3 committed external customers on Intel 18A. At the beginning of the year, I promised you 1. Here we are in the third quarter, we have 3, and I hope to finish at least the fourth before the end of the year.
Also with 18A, this PDK milestone, and if you're inside of the industry, hitting PDK 0.9 is a really critical milestone. As I said in my formal comments, this is when the invention phase is done. And now we're into the productization phase, ramping yields, refining performance and getting the process capabilities ready for manufacturing. So a critical milestone which we also say now as we release that to external customers, now a lot of them can start looking at 18A, and we start fanning out the engagements that we have in the industry. So a critical milestone on 18A.
But the other thing that we saw this quarter, which was a little bit unexpected was this huge surge in interest for AI customers and Intel's advanced packaging technology. And this is the one that probably we didn't even quite realize. We always knew that Intel's packaging technology was the best in the industry, but the amount of interest that we've seen. So we completed 2 additional customers, so 3 18A wafer customers, 2 additional packaging customers, and we have a pipeline that we're in active negotiations with 6 additional packaging customers as well.
And I think about this as the fast on-ramp to the Intel Foundry Services. And a wafer customer is a multiple billion dollar customer. A packaging customer is hundreds of millions of dollars. And that billions of dollars takes 2 to 3 years to materialize. The wafer customers takes 2 to 3 quarters to materialize, right, in the packaging. So this is a much faster way for us to build out that business. And we're going to start to see those packaging customers start to materialize for us in revenue next year.
And you add to that the Synopsys partnership, the ARM momentum, the Tower agreement, this was really the flywheel of momentum has now begun for the Intel Foundry Services business. It really is putting points up across the board for that business, and super happy with the amount of energy that we're now seeing across the industry for the foundry business. This was a great quarter for foundry at Intel.",464

Three quarters in a row, we've seen the client business being very healthy now for us. Our customers' inventory levels are very healthy in that regard. So we see our sell-in being matched by a sellout for those customers. As we said, the 270 million consumption TAM is something we indicated earlier in the year, and now we're seeing that play out exactly. And here we are 3 weeks into the quarter and I'd say it's looking really good. So our views and forecasts of our client business is very healthy for the fourth quarter.
And we do think this idea of ushering in the AIPC generation will be a multiyear cycle. So we do think this will bring excitement into the category even starting with the Meteor Lake or the Core Ultra launch in Q4. We also have some other incremental tailwinds with Copilot launch from Microsoft coming up this quarter. We also have the Win 10 end-of-service support coming up. Those are just incremental tailwinds that just build us more confidence in it. 
And finally, our road map is great. And Meteor Lake looking good, rapidly ramping what we have coming with Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake and then Panther Lake in the future. So every aspect of this business is demonstrating health, maturity, momentum and great opportunity for tomorrow.",223

When we track the linearity of shipments, linearity was really, really good in the third quarter, and it's off to a really good start for the fourth quarter.

I just wanted to come back to the DCAI. In the PowerPoint, you mentioned competitive pressure but I think, Dave, if I heard you correct, you said ASPs were a record. Could you just explain what you meant by competitive pressure because I would have thought that would have led to ASPs being lower, or was its impact was on the unit side, right?",72
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2023",2023-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,4025.0,2928154.0,107913618.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,32,"Yes, and there's a couple of things to unpack there. Just our views of the quarter, we would have expected that we lost some market share. That was based on competitive losses from last year even that or just rolling through our customers. That said, we did a bit better than we thought we would in the quarter. We are ramping Sapphire Rapids, which has a higher ASP more rapidly than we would have expected also as we go to the higher core count versions, that drives up the per socket ASP more aggressively.
So overall, we definitely feel those competitive pressures. And as I say, we're working for issues that began years ago. But we're also combining that with Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids, Gen 5, the road map for Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids which have much higher core counts, which will drive higher ASPs as well. 
So all of that put together, we do feel like we're on a very solid trajectory for the business overall. We will see ASPs continue to rise. The road map is very healthy as we go forward. And I feel like the market and our customers are starting to feel that competitiveness come back to our business here and looking forward to the benefits that a stronger Intel road map will offer to them and their businesses.",225

I have a follow-up. Intel is showing pretty steady execution and I can't say that in the last several years, we haven't seen that. But just coming back to the long-term model that Dave you were talking about, can you just help us understand what are the parameters around that revenue, mix of the business? Because you will have an IFS which would be dilutive to gross margin, potentially not to operating margin. But what's the right way to think about that 60-40 in terms of the business mix and even size of the business?",97

I'd say I think the first thing to kind of improve the gross margins is going to be around getting ourselves finally to process leadership and getting the products completely, as Pat was talking about, the product road map improving significantly, getting to the -- to where we have definitive leadership across all products. I think those 2 things will drive a significant lift on the gross margins, irrespective of anything else we have on the business front.
And then when I look at, as I talked about this internal foundry model, I just think there's so much low-hanging fruit on the cost side, both in the business units and also in the manufacturing TD, or kind of internal foundry business, that there's significant improvement that we can make on gross margins. Yes, mix does have an impact on the business, and we have a wide range of products that  will have different margins. But almost all of them are punching below their weight right now. And as we improve all of them, that should lift the gross margins meaningfully over time.",183

Kind of going back to the prior question, just thinking about the trajectory of the ASP expansion in the Data Center segment. How do I look at that and kind of think about what the normalizing operating profit might look like in DCAI as you guys look out over time? I know that you turned profitable this quarter. I'm just trying to think about -- understand how you guys are thinking about the path of profitability in that segment.",88

Maybe I'll start. Pat, feel free to chime in. Obviously, it was, I think, pretty important for us to show profitability this quarter. That was one of Pat and I's goals written on a sheet of paper that we wanted to see this business return to profitability. That said, it's making a lot of investments right now to improve the product portfolio on the CPU side and make the investments necessary on the AI front. But this business longer term should have margins that are very similar to margins you see from its peers when they are operating at healthy levels of margins.
And so we have a lot of work to do to get there but I think the path is pretty clear. And of course, ASP will be a component of that but there's a lot of efficiencies that you can drive beyond just ASPs that will improve the margins longer term.",155

And as Dave and I think about the 60-40 model that we're driving to long term, we think about the Data Center business being above that for it, where some of the more volume-oriented businesses like client might be a little bit below that. But taken together, that's how we're driving the business. And overall, as we said, we see a lot of margin expansion potential across Data Center, Client, Networking and Foundry as we get back to process leadership and build that business up.
I'd also emphasize that as we build our foundry capacity, we build more capacity in our factory network for our internal and external customers. That's a tide that lifts all boats for us because it improves the profitability not just the foundry but the competitiveness and the profitability of our product businesses as well. So overall, we feel like this is a really important milestone for us this quarter, seeing not just great financial results but the operational results were even better than that, which is what led me to say, hey, this was an outstanding quarter for us overall.",186

As a quick follow-up, just kind of thinking about the gross margin line. I'm curious, Dave, I know last quarter, I think it was, I want to say it was 220-or-so million factory underload impact in gross margin. It sounds like you had a reversal of inventory reserve and gross margin this quarter. Are we done with the factory underload or what was that number? And how are you thinking about that embedded in the gross margin guide?",87

I mean, it was a meaningful benefit, the underload improvement in the quarter. That said, there was still a reasonable amount of underload charges in the quarter. That does improve a bit in the fourth quarter. But we'll be kind of dealing with this underload hangover, I'd call it, probably all through next year as we kind of progress, largely in part because while we will improve the loadings and probably get beyond underload charges on a quarterly basis, we'll still have all of that underload kind of tied up in the cost of the wafers in inventory, and that still has to get flushed through before we're completely done.
So meaningful improvement. I'd say we have -- we're largely out of the woods but still some wood to chop through next year to where we're completely clean in underload.",141

As my follow-up, one of the things that I keep getting asked about a ton is the CapEx swing that's happened towards gen AI infrastructure. And I guess the way that I've been kind of phrasing the question is the video killed the radio star question, right? Is this the death of CPU growth in the data center? And I don't think it is, to be clear, but there's some out there to do. So Pat, you made some comments in your script and then some other answers about return to normalcy on data center CPU from a growth perspective. Maybe you can give a few day points or antidotes that might support that.",117

And I do think there's clearly been the surge of interest in gen AI, which has, over a couple of quarters, driven a bias on the part of the cloud guys, in particular, to where do they put their floor space? Where do they put their power budgets, right? And that's been driving largely a race for the largest system environments that they can put in place.
That said, training of these large models is interesting, but the deployment to those models, the inferencing use of those models is what we believe is truly spectacular for the future. And that will -- some of that will run on the accelerators, but a huge amount of that is going to run, right, on Xeons as we bring AI into those applications or AI-ification of existing applications. And given the leadership performance that we have on our Gen 4 for AI applications, that gets better with Gen 5. And when we deliver Granite Rapids, it gets 2 to 3x better, as I said in the comments. It gets even better as we go further out into the road map.
So the ability for us to do inferencing at scale on our Xeon product line, we think, is very profound as we go forward. The road map is very healthy. The combination of Gaudi and our Xeons, that is exactly what you heard Dell announce in their road map. And we're just seeing, I'll say, the normalcy of that in the buying behavior. We saw a very good uptick for our OEMs this quarter as they're seeing their Xeon businesses. We're also seeing more ecosystem embrace our DevCloud. Lots of customers coming on it for both AI use cases on Xeon and on Gaudi.
Key announcements like we had from Deloitte as they're partnering with us across application optimization as well as AI development on Xeon platform. So overall, we feel pretty comfortable that we're in a cycle that there will be growth in CPUs led by Xeon as well as accelerators. And Intel is going to be participating in both of those capacities in meaningful ways. And this is part of what we said as AI everywhere. AI at the edge, AI at the client, AI in the data center and AI in the cloud, but inferencing will be the discussion topic for the industry as we go into '24. That will be done at scale and much of that is going to be done on Xeons.
So with that, let's just thank you for joining us. Again, I want to reiterate our thoughts for our resilient Intel team in Israel and for all of those in the region that are affected by recent events. I also want to thank you for joining us on the call again today and your interest in Intel. We appreciate the opportunity to update you, answer your questions, respond to that. Most important, we are excited by the momentum we're seeing.
As I said, the financial results were great. The operational results were truly outstanding this quarter. And it's a confirmation of our foundry strategy, of our 5 nodes everywhere, of our AI everywhere strategy. And we do hope that you're able to join us for our launch of Emerald Rapids Gen 5, Meteor Lake, Core Ultra in New York in December. And I do also hope to see you all at our Q1 Intel Foundry Day. 
Thank you. Good afternoon, good night wherever in the world you'd be. Take care and be safe.",589
