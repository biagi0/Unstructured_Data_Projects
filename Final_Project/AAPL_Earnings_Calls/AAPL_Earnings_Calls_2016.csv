24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3466.0,951990.0,40467860.0,Presenter Speech,Timothy Cook,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us. Today, we're reporting Apple's strongest financial results ever. We generated all-time record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion in the December quarter, in line with our expectations and up 2% over last year's blockbuster results. This is a huge accomplishment for our company, especially given the turbulent world around us. In constant currency, our growth rate would have been 8%. 
Our record revenue and continued strong operating performance also led to an all-time record quarterly net income of $18.4 billion. We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the December quarter, an all-time high. To put that volume into perspective, it's an average of over 34,000 iPhones an hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 13 straight weeks. It's almost 50% more than our Q1 volume just 2 years ago and more than 4x our volume 5 years ago. 
74.8 million iPhones is an incredible number, and it speaks to both the immense popularity of iPhone and the phenomenal execution of our teams to deliver a massive number of devices in such a short period of time. Our results are particularly impressive, given the challenging global macroeconomic environment. 
We're seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we've experienced before just about everywhere we look. Major markets including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and Eurozone have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies. Since the end of fiscal 2014, for instance, the euro and British pound are down double digits, and major currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and Turkish lira, had declined 20% or more. The Brazilian real is down more than 40% and the Russian ruble has declined more than 50%. 
2/3 of Apple's revenue is now generated outside the United States, so foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results. Page 1 of our supplemental material illustrates this point. $100 of Apple's non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of '14 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in our international markets. As you can see, the movement has been dramatic. 
Last quarter alone, the currency impact has been very large. Page 2 of our supplemental material illustrates our Q1 revenue and growth rates expressed in constant currency. The 8% growth rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which is $5 billion more than our reported revenue. For perspective, that difference is about the size of the annual revenue of a Fortune 500 company. 
We know the conditions in China have been a source of concern for many investors. Last summer, while many companies were experiencing weakness in their China-based results, we were seeing just the opposite with incredible momentum for iPhone, Mac and the App Store in particular. In the December quarter, despite the turbulent environment, we produced our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% over last year, 47% sequentially and 17% year-over-year in constant currency. 
These great results were fueled by our highest-ever quarterly iPhone sales and record App Store performance. Notwithstanding these record results, we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month, most notably in Hong Kong. Beyond the short-term volatility, we remain very confident about the long-term potential of the China market and the large opportunities ahead of us, and we are maintaining our investment plans.
Despite the economic challenges all over the world, Apple remains incredibly strong. We have a very satisfied and loyal customer base. We saw a greater number of switchers from Android to iPhone than ever in Q1, and we are very optimistic about our business over the long term. Innovation has always been the reason behind our success, and we remain committed to making the best products in the world and expanding the Apple experience to change our customers' lives in better and more meaningful ways. 
We've invested through economic uncertainty in the past, and we've always come out stronger on the other side. In fact, some of the most important breakthrough products in Apple's history were born as a result of investing through the downturn. We've also seen these times as opportunities to invest in new markets just as we're doing now in areas such as India and other emerging markets. 
Getting back to our record Q1 performance, let me give you some highlights of what we've accomplished since our last quarterly call together. We shipped the amazing new iPad Pro, which has been extremely well received by customers, along with the new smart keyboard and revolutionary Apple Pencil. We launched the all new Apple TV with its own App Store, laying the foundation for the future of television. We had our best quarter by far for Apple TV sales, and the number of apps developed for Apple TV is growing rapidly. Today, there are over 3,600 apps delivering everything from games to entertainment to educational programming.
We expanded distribution of Apple Watch to almost 12,000 locations in 48 countries during the quarter. As we expected, we set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales, with especially strong sales in the month of December. 
We released OS X El Capitan, refining the experience and improving performance for our Mac customers. We also updated the entire iMac family with stunning new Retina displays and introduced a new lineup of wireless accessories. 
We launched Apple Pay in Canada and Australia with American Express and announced plans to bring this amazingly convenient, private and secure mobile payment experience to China, Hong Kong, Spain and Singapore in the coming year. Consumers have spent billions of dollars with Apple Pay. In the second half of 2015, we saw a significant acceleration in usage with a growth rate 10x higher than in the first half of the year. There are now over 5 million contactless payment-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is live today, and it's soon to be accepted at thousands of Exxon- and Mobil-branded stations across the U.S. via their Speedpass+ app.
Finally, we also shared the incredible Apple Music experience with even more listeners with over 10 million paying subscribers less than 4 months since customers began paying for the service. 
Our financial position has never been stronger. We have the mother of all balance sheets with almost $216 billion in cash, which translates to nearly $39 per diluted share of Apple stock. We continue to invest confidently in our future, and we also continue to return capital to our shareholders at a rapid pace. 
Our investors have been asking for a while about the recurring nature of our business. Especially during a period of economic uncertainty, we believe it is important to appreciate that a significant portion of Apple's revenue recurs over time. 
First and foremost, our customer satisfaction and retention rates are second to none and provide us with a long-lasting foundation. For example, recent consumer surveys by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, measured an incredible 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and an equally impressive 97% rate for the iPad Air 2. They also indicate that our iPhone loyalty rate is almost twice as strong as the next highest brand. 
In addition, a growing portion of our revenue is directly driven by our existing installed base. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, they spend a lot of time on their devices and purchase apps, content and other services. They also are very likely to buy other Apple products or replace the one that they own. And because of the enduring value of the device, their replacing is likely higher to be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it often. 
So as a result, our installed base has been growing very fast and has recently reached a major milestone, crossing 1 billion active devices for the first time. This is an unbelievable asset for us. Because our installed base has grown quickly, we have also seen an acceleration in the growth of our services business, another large and important source of recurring revenues. 
Now that we have reached this milestone of 1 billion active devices, we thought this would be a great opportunity to share more information on what has become one of the largest service businesses in the world. So now I'd like to turn the call to Luca, who will provide more insight into how our platform has grown, followed by details on our record quarterly results.",1431
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3466.0,951990.0,40467861.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Each quarter, we report results for our Services category, which includes revenue from iTunes, the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing and some other items. Today, we would like to highlight the major drivers of growth in this category, which we have summarized in Page 3 of our supplemental material. 
The vast majority of the services we provide to our customers, for instance, apps, movies and TV shows, are tied to our installed base of devices rather than to current quarter sales. For some of these services such as content, we recognize revenue based on transaction value. For some of the services such as the App Store, we share a portion of the value of each transaction with the app developer and only recognize revenue on the portion that we keep. 
To fully comprehend the scale of the services that we are delivering to our installed base and how fast this business is growing, we look at purchases in addition to revenue. When we aggregate the purchase value of services tied to our installed base during fiscal 2015, it adds up to more than $31 billion. That's an increase of 23% over fiscal year 2014. In the recent December quarter, purchases of installed base services reached $8.9 billion, which is a growth rate of 24% year-over-year.
The size and growth of these services tied to our installed base compare favorably to other services companies you're familiar with. Our installed base services are also quite profitable, with gross margins that, on a purchase value basis, are similar to our company average.
Also, we are very excited by the scale and growth of our active installed base as we indicate on Page 4. We define an active device as one that has been engaged with our services within the past 90 days. Our active installed base has recently passed 1 billion devices, with year-over-year growth of more than 25%. 
Apple is in a unique position of strength. We have world-class scales in hardware, software and services all under one roof, which lets us innovate in ways that other companies can't. We have built a huge installed base around 4 platforms: iOS, Mac OS, watchOS and tvOS. We have tremendously satisfied and loyal customers who are engaged with our services at a fast-growing rate. All of this provides us with an unparalleled foundation for the future of Apple business.
Let me now turn to the details of our record-breaking December quarter. As Tim said, revenue was $75.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 2% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by all-time record iPhone sales, all-time record revenue from Services, the expanded availability of Apple Watch and the successful launch of the new Apple TV. We achieved this record revenue performance despite a very large negative impact from the weakness of foreign currency. And in constant currency, our revenue growth rate was 8%. 
We once again achieved very impressive results in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 47% sequentially to an all-time record of $18.4 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall, up 11% year-over-year and representing 34% of total company revenue for the quarter. Company gross margin was 40.1%, up sequentially and better than our expectations, mainly due to favorable commodity cost and product mix. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue and net income was $18.4 billion, a new all-time record. Diluted earnings per share was $3.28, a 7% year-over-year increase over our previous all-time record, and cash flow from operations was very strong at $27.5 billion.
For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the quarter, an increase of 300,000 compared to last December quarter's sensational results. Total iPhone sales grew 76% in India and more than 45% in Korea, Middle East and Africa. Sales were also up 20% or more in many Western European countries and grew 18% in Mainland China. 
iPhone ASP was $691 compared to $687 in the year ago quarter in spite of a very unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We continue to see very strong interest in iPhone not only with consumers but also with business users. Among corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 451 Research found that 79% plan to purchase iPhones. That is the highest iPhone purchase intent in the 8-year history of the survey. 
We started the quarter below our channel inventory target range, and thanks to an extremely successful manufacturing ramp, we were able to exit the quarter slightly above the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.3 million Macs compared to 5.5 million last year, a decline of 4%. We continued our long-running trend of PC market share gains based on IDC's latest estimate of an 11% global market contraction. And we're especially happy with 27% year-over-year Mac sales growth in Mainland China. We ended the quarter within our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad. We sold 16.1 million compared to 21.4 million in the year ago quarter, and we exited the quarter within our 5- to 7-week target range of iPad channel inventory. In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 67% of the U.S. commercial tablet market comprising enterprise, government and education.
iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In November, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next 6 months, 65% plan to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a March quarter purchase intent of 73%.
Our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. IBM released 48 new IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps in the December quarter, and there are now over 100 apps in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS catalog for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. 
Our partnership with Cisco has gained significant momentum since we announced it at the end of August. Our engineering teams are on track to deliver exciting new capabilities that create a fast lane for iOS business users by optimizing Cisco networks for iOS devices and apps, integrate iPhone with Cisco enterprise environments and provide unique collaboration opportunities on iPhone and iPad. 
We are also continuing to grow our mobility partner program. We added more than 25 partners in the December quarter, bringing the total to over 90. One great example of our progress in the enterprise is Eli Lilly, who boosted sales productivity by equipping 15,000 field-based personnel across the world with iPad. A leader in mobile technology, Lilly has eliminated laptops in the field and is upgrading its U.S. field sales teams to iPad Pro.
Turning to Services. We generated almost $6.1 billion in revenue, including $548 million we received from a patent infringement dispute. Excluding that amount, our Services revenue was $5.5 billion, a new all-time record and an increase of 15% over last year, thanks in large part to strong growth from apps. Revenue from the App Store increased 27% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes stores, the average amount spent per customer reached an all-time high in the December quarter.
Revenue from other products grew strongly, up 62% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch as well as the successful launch of the new Apple TV, both of which established new all-time quarterly records. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter, and we experienced especially strong results during the holiday buying season.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $215.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.1 billion. $200 billion of this cash or 93% of the total was outside the United States. 
We returned over $9 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $3 billion to repurchase 26 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, spending $3 billion and receiving an initial delivery of 20.4 million shares.
We have now completed over $153 billion of our $200 billion program, including $110 billion in share repurchases. As we have done in the past, we plan to provide an update on our capital return program when we report our second quarter results in April. We also plan to be very active in the U.S. and international debt markets in 2016 in order to fund our capital return activities. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2016.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $50 billion and $53 billion. We are providing a wider range for revenue than usual for the second quarter because of the volatility we are seeing in the economy and in the financial and currency markets. 
We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 39.5%. We believe these are extremely strong margins in light of the headwinds we face from foreign exchange and the sequential loss of leverage. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $325 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. 
As you know, we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, and it's difficult for us to forecast economic and foreign exchange factors. However, at this point, we believe the March quarter faces the most difficult year-over-year compare relative to the rest of the year.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1712

Maybe if you can just clarify, first of all, what FX headwind is embedded in that. And then just going to the kind of fundamental underpinning reasons for that, how much of it do you think has to do with the international markets in terms of weakening demand? And how much of that do you think is comps versus any other factors you might identify such as the response to higher prices for the iPhone in certain overseas markets?",96

Let me take this one. In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%. So we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter. You talked about a number of issues that are, in fact, included in this guidance. In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter, just to remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27%, there's a number of things that we're facing. The macroeconomic environment is weakening. When you think about all the -- particularly all the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and emerging markets but also Canada, Australia in developed markets, clearly, the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. We talked about the unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points. One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange situation has been to increase the price of some of our products in certain international markets. That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter. But inevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we're capturing that in our guidance. So I would say these are the major reasons and the drivers for the guidance on revenue.",239

In particular, do you believe that this could have measurable impact on the December quarter once we anniversary this? And then any thoughts on rolled outside the U.S. when that program would? And I guess my follow-up question would be I know you can't talk about new products, but any high-level thoughts on the virtual reality theme? Do you think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream?",93

And so that's first and foremost. Secondly, I would say I -- we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. It was the highest ever by far. And so we see that as a huge opportunity. Thirdly, the markets, the -- sort of the emerging markets, broader than BRIC but including all of emerging, when I look at our share in these markets and the LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities. In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern. How much of that plays out in the Q1 of '17 range is difficult to say. My own sense would be that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important. But I'm optimistic about the upgrade program as well.",166

Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter. We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter. Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49. So obviously, the mix of products was very strong. We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of September. Of course, we have a very strong mid-tier this year in the portfolio with 6 and 6 Plus. But overall, when you look at the outcome during December quarter was -- it was very, very strong so we feel very good about that. And just we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone. On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter and we mentioned it back in October, below our target range of 5 to 7 weeks. We have built a bit of inventory during the course of the December quarter, but we have exited at the low end of the 5 to 7 weeks. So we feel that we are in good shape there. And we've exited the quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that we want to have.",212

So that is kind of the ranking, Katy. It starts always for us with our tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and that is up a bit year-over-year. Then we got data centers.

And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base. So that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base.

To start, just on iPhones. It looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for fiscal '16. And I'd like you to address that question because the obvious follow-up questions are: is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units? Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where market is moving to much lower price points? But I'm wondering, and Tim maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.",184

We don't think that they'll decline to the levels that you're talking about. We aren't projecting beyond the quarter, as Luca mentioned earlier. But at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare. We believe it's the toughest compare because the year ago quarter also had catch-up in it from Q1. If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1 and so some of that demand moved into Q2. Plus, we're in an environment now that is dramatically different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency point of view, from the levels which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these markets and sort of the overall malaise in virtually every country in the world. And so it's really all of those factors that play in there, and it's difficult to sort out how much is due to which one.",166

Our view has always been that if we do -- if we make a great product and have a great experience, that we ought to be able to convince enough people to move over. And so as I look at sort of your -- maybe your broader umbrella point about a question on saturation, what -- the metrics I see would strongly suggest otherwise. For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone. And certainly, if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low. I mean, in some cases, it's 0, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world that will buy smartphones and a -- we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.",171

And I just have a clarification, I don't really have a follow-up question. You -- Luca, you had talked about channel inventory increasing. It was 18.4 million for iPhone last quarter. Can you tell us how many more units you had this quarter? And then I'm not sure if I misheard you, but I think you said your total installed base grew 25% year-over-year. Can you confirm that? Because if Services grew at 13% and your installed base grew at 25%, it almost implies like your penetration of your installed base in terms of your ability to sell services is going down.",103
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3466.0,951990.0,40467882.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,24,"Maybe -- I'm going to start with Services, Toni. The reason why we added this, I think it's Page 3 of our supplemental material, is to try and explain that a couple of steps. The first one is that of the services that we report, there's a portion -- about 85% of all the services that we report is directly tied to the installed base. There is a smaller portion of our services business that is not related to installed base. It's more related to when we sell a device. A perfect example would be an AppleCare agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device. And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base-driven services business, there is a part that is related to where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value. And then there are transactions, like for example App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple but it goes to the developer. So when you look at it from a purchase value standpoint, actually in the December quarter, we grew 24%, and for the fiscal 2015, we grew at 23%. So we're growing at very, very healthy levels, okay? And to reconfirm the growth of the installed base, yes, it was over 25%. To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter. Keep in mind, we started an acquisition where we were below our target range. We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.",271

Luca, your -- you've got gross margins of 39% to 39.5% in your guidance, and that includes hedging. So I'm curious about the puts or takes in there. And then can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter, that had the IP licensing contribution as well? If you can just -- any color you can give both on this quarter's gross margin puts and takes and then also the March quarter. And then I have a follow-up.",86

Let me start with Q1. I think when you say IP licensing, you mean this patent dispute that was resolved. Yes, it was included in the gross margins, and it was worth 40 basis points in the 40.1% that we reported for Q1. For the second quarter, the puts and takes are actually quite simple. From an FX standpoint, the negative impact on a sequential basis from the December quarter is 50 basis points. Then of course, I would say by far, the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now. And in a way, it's the other side of the coin of the foreign exchange situation.",140

And then Tim, can you talk a bit about leverage within the model? I know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in China and all of that, but given some of the pressures you're seeing, how do you think about where you spend that incremental SG&A dollar and that R&D dollar? And how should we think about it, given you're running $6 billion a quarter?",70

On the R&D, Shannon, we're continuing to invest with -- without pause. We have some great things in the pipeline, and we very much believe strongly in investing through downturns such as the one that sort of everyone is going through. In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek to throttle expenditures in SG&A to the business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores. And for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed. We are maintaining our investment profile and plans there. We are also continuing to invest in markets where we believe they are great places for Apple for the long term like India as an example of that one. And finally, even in the markets where today grantedly, it looks fairly bleak, from Russia and Brazil and some of the other economies that are very much tied to --  are oil-based economies. We do believe that this too shall pass and that these countries will be great places and we want to serve customers in there. And so we're not retrenching. That's not -- we don't believe in that. We fortunately are strong enough to continue investing. And we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so. Obviously, from a cost point of view, the downside of economic stress is that some asset prices get cheaper, commodity prices get cheaper and that sort of thing. And so I think this is exactly the period that you want to invest and do so confidently.",253

In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got was in the mid-20s. And so the -- there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets. Also the -- and I've talked about this before but I think it's worth mentioning again because it's easy to lose perspective in -- with some of the things you read every day, is that the middle class in China was less than 50 million people in 2010. And by 2020, it's projected to be about 0.5 billion. And so there's just an enormous number of people moving into the middle class, and we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of those customers into the Apple ecosystem. And so I think that the demographics are great. We're continuing to invest in retail stores. Angela and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout plan. We now have 28 stores in Greater China and we're on target to have 40 in the summertime of this year. And so we're continuing on distribution. Obviously, we've got product things in mind and are crafting our products and services with China heavily in mind. We remain very bullish on China and don't subscribe to the doom and gloom kind of predictions frankly. In India, India is also incredibly exciting. India's growth, as you know, is very good. It's quickly becoming the fastest growing BRIC country. It's the third-largest smartphone market in the world behind China and United States. The population in India is incredibly young. The median age there is 27. I think of the China age being young at 36, 37 and so 27 is unbelievable. Almost half the people in India are below 25. And so I see the sort of the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products. And as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. India revenue for us in Q1 was up 38%. We also had currency issues in India as everybody else did. And constant currency growth was 48%. And so it's a very rapidly expanding country. And I think the government there is very interested in economic reforms and so forth that I think all speak to a really good business environment for the future.",408

You talked a lot about the macroeconomic weakness weighing on units, but is some of the issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind of normalizing, and that's kind of a onetime headwind in terms of the unit growth that you see in that business. Is any of that going on, or is that not material in your view? And the other follow-up I had was that you've mentioned in recent calls helpfully the percent of the base prior to when the 6 came out that were now on the largest screen phones. Can you give us an update on what the number is? I think the last time it was in the low 30s.",129

The number of people who were in the -- had an iPhone prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements, and so this was in September of '14, that have not yet upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus or 6s or 6s Plus is now 60%. So another way to think about that is 40% have, 60% have not. In terms of the -- your initial question about is there some of the compare issue that are people that -- ran out quickly to buy a 6 and 6 Plus and sort of accelerated. There is no doubt that we had a unbelievable year last year and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong because of the pent-up demand that left from Q1 in addition to Q2. And so there's no doubt about that. However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side. And that's before thinking through the effect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time. It's clear that the economic piece is large.",188

As far as the question, Tim, I wanted to get a better sense from you in terms of what is the overarching message of introducing little more details here around services. Is this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise or the platform at Apple in terms of to really navigate tougher macro times in terms of the higher level of recurring revenue? Or is it a stepping stone to much more in terms of Apple service, i.e., I think about the stuff you do in the data center side?

We started breaking out Services, as you know, in the beginning of fiscal year '15. And as that business has grown and as it became clear to us that the investors wanted -- investors and analysts wanted more visibility into that business, we've now elected to break it out and show the full size, scope, growth and make comments in the profitability of it from a transparency point of view. I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge. And I do think it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on. In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any particular thing but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't be breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the future.",147

Tim, with the macro situation changing, a lot of CEOs view that and their strategy is very different go-to-market strategy. Some change the way they go-to-market. Some change their products. In the past, Apple's been very known in always having a premium product. With the slowdown in the macro FX and also GDP revision, is Apple's strategy go-to-market still always-at-premium product? Or is there kind of a need to go to more also a middle market or lower price point to attract more customers just because it seems like growing that installed base and services as you pointed out really economically could really help out Apple in the long term? And then the financial question for Luca is on that patent litigation. Luca, when you gave guidance 3 months ago, did you kind of have a view that that was coming in? And if so, was that included in the guidance or not? Or was that post the quarter guided? And I assume it's all onetime this quarter you recorded it.

24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3645.0,963881.0,40921298.0,Presenter Speech,Timothy Cook,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. 
Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution of our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world and difficult year-over-year comparisons. 
We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. 
Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. 
We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. 
To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from 3 sources: customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time. As we look at each of these 3 sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. 
First, from an upgrade perspective. During the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle 2 years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. 
Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of U.S. smartphone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smartphone. 
Second, we continue to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other 6-month period ever. 
And third, with only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smartphone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago.
Next, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue-generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. 
We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. The Services business is powered by our huge installed base of active devices, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every 3 months. 
In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. 
The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter and last week's rollout in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5x the transaction volume of a year ago and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon.
Turning to the Mac. We met our selling expectations in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 units. Overall, the Mac continues to attract a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac. And in some countries the percentage is extremely high, like in China where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area.
Turning to the Apple Watch. Unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December quarter. 
We started shipping Apple Watch just 1 year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. 
Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of users' lives from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps to helping them be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We've learned a lot and we believe it has an exciting future ahead.
We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful 4-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features and a great price without compromising performance.
Demand has been very strong and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem.
We also unveiled the stunning 9.7-inch iPad Pro with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we're hearing from customers that the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners and a great PC replacement. In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over 2 years.
iPad is the best-selling, best reviewed and most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability and versatility with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn and create. 
We also announced CareKit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. 
As always, we're contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling of the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we're actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. 
As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory target, in light of the macroeconomic environment, we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary.
But before turning over the call to him, I'll summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We're very excited about bringing together developers for our 4 major platforms in our Worldwide Developers Conference in June. We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last 4 quarters to accelerate our product and services road maps, and we're always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent and strategic fit.
Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investment in capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year as we have done each year since we started the program 4 years ago. Today, we're announcing an extension of the time frame of the program by 4 quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca?",1688
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3645.0,963881.0,40921299.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. 
As Tim said in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in Greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. However, our business in these 2 regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both these segments. 
In Mainland China, revenue was down 11% and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare when our Mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run.
Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong at $11.6 billion.
For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago when iPhone sales grew 40% as we entered last March quarter in supply-demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. Also, this year, we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units while we increased the inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter within our 5- to 7-week target range for channel inventory.
iPhone ASP was $642 compared to $659 in the year-ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year-over-year. 
iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and 5 points higher than a year ago.
Turning to services. We generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continuous strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Stores, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit Mac growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the UAE. 
And just last week, we updated the MacBook. Our thinnest and lightest Mac with the latest processors, faster graphics, faster flash storage and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad. We sold 10.3 million compared to 12.6 million in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our 5- to 7-week target range. In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 78% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the U.S. commercial tablet market comprising business, government and education.
iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next 6 months, 59% planned to purchase an iPad, more than 3x the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a June quarter purchase intent of 71%.
Revenue from other products grew 30% over last year, thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways with a range of colors, styles and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction. 
We're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our mobility partner program also continues to grow with 108 partners across 20 countries.
We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, doctors and nurses are using iOS apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively so that they can spend more time with patients and less time on administrative tasks.
Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $15.5 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt.
We returned $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $7 billion on repurchases of 71.8 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We've now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases. 
As Tim mentioned, today, we're announcing the latest update to our program, which we're increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we're allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock. The board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units.
We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we're raising it for the fourth time in less than 4 years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today and is payable on May 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. 
With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next 8 quarters, we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price. 
As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix and the pace of the program.
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year when revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. 
This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year and the strong U.S. dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets. Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth over $2 billion as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position, given the current macro environment. 
The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply-demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies. 
Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last 3 years despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales and a sequential increase in Mac sales.
We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get farther from the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and as iPhone SE enters the mix. We note that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference comes primarily from 3 areas: first, the $2 billion-plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned; second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE; and third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at the rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters.
We expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue and a different mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1809

What was that last year just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis? And then the bigger question, Tim, was with the smartphone market now reaching a pretty mature growth phase, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it as a growth company or as a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A, especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet, strategically?",102

In terms of the -- do I think the smartphone market is mature? I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of sort of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. And we're very optimistic that this too shall pass and that the market and, particularly, us will grow again. The reason that we're optimistic is we look at the sort of the 3 places that iPhone sales come from. And from an upgrade point of view, as I'd mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We're lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that, that was an extraordinary cycle that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015. And so that comparable is -- will be tougher this year but that's a transitory thing. As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half, we've set a record from switchers from other platforms, the largest we've ever seen in any 6-month period before. So we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing an increasing emphasis in these areas where it's clear there's a -- will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas. The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform with an incredible product that is at a new price point for us with our -- with the latest technology. And so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also looked at our pipeline and we're very excited about what's in our pipeline. And so all of those things make me optimistic. Your other question was on M&A. And I mean, regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we do or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we're excited about. And so as I've said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit and whether it's sort of a great technology and great people. And so we continue to look and we stay very active in the M&A market.",417

And specifically, you mentioned that the SE is going to impact, but how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there and your actual market share and using price to close that gap? Is it just the SE? Or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets? And one for Luca.

And we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category. And then secondly, it's attracting people who aspire to own an iPhone, but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. And so I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we're really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the sort of new to iPhone customers that we see from here because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained. And -- but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. And I'll let Luca comment on the ASPs.",160

So when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter it's the fact that we are having the SE entering the mix and then, obviously, it's going to have a downward pressure on ASP. And also this channel inventory reduction that we've talked about, obviously, the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models. And that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs. The question on services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element and the part of the services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our music business, which had been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point, and we really believe that this would be the bottom, and we can start growing from there over time. We have many other Services business -- businesses that are doing very well. We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base. But I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses. Tim has talked about Apple Pay. It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long term, that could be an interesting business for us as well. From a profitability standpoint, we have mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to company average. Of course, when you net out the amount that is paid to developers and you look at it at what -- in terms of what is reported in our P&L, obviously, that business has a profitability that is higher than company average. We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it is very clear, it's significantly higher than company average.",385

This is the worst gross margin guide in 1.5 years or so.

Obviously, what is different, and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have loss of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins. And the other factor that is important to keep in mind, is this different mix of products. And particularly when you look at iPhone, and what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs but obviously, they also affect margins. And it's a fact that we have a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range. And we got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so when you take into account those factors, those are the elements that drive our guidance range right now.",170

And then a question for Tim. Appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth. But with developed market penetration in the anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets. You've talked about India. Can you just spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles you have to overcome for that to be a larger of the business? When should we expect Apple to have more distribution and, specifically, your own stores in that country?",90
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3645.0,963881.0,40921313.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,17,"Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus 2 years ago, it's increased by 80%. And so when you think about upgrade cycles, upgrades cycles would have varying rates on it. As I talked about in the comments, the iPhone 6s rate -- upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the iPhone 6. But the other multiplier in that equation is, obviously, the size of the installed base. And so I -- the note of that is I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets so I wouldn't want to write those off. And it's our jobs to come up with great products that people desire and also to continue to attract over Android switchers. With our worldwide share, there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets as well. And from an India point of view, if you look at India and each country has a different story a bit. But the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really begins this year. And so we'll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India that will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. And so the infrastructure is one key one, and the second one is building the channel out. The -- unlike the U.S. as an example, where the carriers in the U.S. sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India, the carriers, in general, sell virtually no phones. And so it's out in retail and retail is many, many different small shops. And so we've been in the process -- it's not something we just started in the last few weeks. We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so. And I'm encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there and believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third-largest smartphone market in the world, but because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. But I sort of view India is where China was maybe 7 to 10 years ago from that point of view. And I think there's a really great opportunity there.",460

24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3645.0,963881.0,40921315.0,Question,Toni Sacconaghi,,Analysts,19,"I have one and then a follow-up as well. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you're kind of guiding for relatively normal sequential growth. And I think if you do the math, it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone unit growth, sequentially, relative to a normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and Q3. I guess, the question is given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter? And maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad mini in a similar move to move down market, there was great growth for 1 quarter and the iPad never grew again and margins and ASPs went down. And it looks like you're introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential basis, you're not calling for any uplift, even adjusting for channel inventory. And ASPs, I presume will go down, and certainly it's impacting gross margins as you've guided to. So could you respond to A, why you're not seeing the elasticity? And B, is the analogy with the iPad mini completely misplaced?",226
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3645.0,963881.0,40921316.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,20,"Toni, it's Tim. Let me see if I can address your question. The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone. And so that would affect the unit compare that you may be thinking about. The iPhone SE, we're thrilled with the response that we've seen on it. It is clear that there is a demand there even much beyond what we thought, and so that is really why we have the constraint that we have. And so do I think it will be like the iPad mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see that. What -- I think the tablet market, in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smartphone market. And so as you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It's incredibly high. And we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high. But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for a very long period of time before an upgrade. We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business. And as I had said in the -- in my remarks, we believe we're going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we've had in quite some time. And so we'll report back in July on that one. But I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.",261

And if I could follow up, Tim, you alluded to replacement cycles and differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was when you were going through the iPhone 6 cycle was that you had commented that the upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think your characterization was it accelerated a bit in the U.S. but international had grown to be a bigger part of your business and replacement cycles there were typically a little bit longer. And so I'm wondering if there was only a modest difference between the 5s and the 6, how big a difference are we really seeing in terms of replacement cycles across the last 3 generations? And maybe you could help us, if the replacement cycle was flat this year relative to what you saw last year, how different would your results have been this quarter and the first half?",149
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3645.0,963881.0,40921318.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,22,"There's a lot there. I -- let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycles. Let me get that out of the way. Now let me describe the -- without the specific numbers, the iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first 6 months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s 2 years ago. But it's lower than the iPhone 6 and I don't mean just a hair lower, it's a lot lower. And so without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on 6s that we did 6, there would -- it would be time for a huge party. It would be a huge difference. Now the good news is -- the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well. Because we've announced the SE, we're attracting customers that we previously didn't attract. That's really great. And this tough compare, eventually, isn't the benchmark. And so -- and the installed base is up 80% over the last 2 years. And so all of those, I think, bode well. And the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that because that's very important for us in every geography. Thanks for the question.",237

One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China? I know the Greater China revenue, I think, was down 26%. You did talk about Mainland China, but just if you could talk about some of the trends you're seeing there and how you think it's playing out and maybe your thoughts on SE adoption was in China as well?",69
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3645.0,963881.0,40921321.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,25,"Yes, Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take Greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China in the Greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet. The vast majority of the weakness in the Greater China region sits in Hong Kong. And our perspective on that is it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar. And therefore, it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar. And that has driven tourism, international shopping and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago. If you look at Mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we're down 11% in Mainland China on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, we're only down 7%. And the way that we really look at the sort of the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through. And if you look at it there, we were down 5%. And keep in mind that that's down 5% on a comp a year ago that was up 81%. And so as I sort of back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak as has been talked about. I see China as -- may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. And so we remain really optimistic on China. We opened 7 stores there during the quarter. We now are at 35. We'll open 5 more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it. And so we continue to be really optimistic about it and just would ask folks to sort of look underneath the numbers at the details in them before concluding anything. Thanks for the question.",331

And then my second question is with regard to sort of OpEx leverage or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about potential for leverage? I don't know, cost containment, maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure? And how are you kind of juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward?",77

Of course, we think about it. We think about it a lot. And so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was at 10%, which is the lowest rate that you've seen in years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see 2 different dynamics. You see continued significant investments in research and development because we really believe that's the future of the company. We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We have a much broader portfolio than we used to have. We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. And so that part, we really need to protect, and we want to continue to invest in the business, right? And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly. So obviously, we think about it, and of course, we look at our revenue trend and we take measures accordingly. And when you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% Op. And again, the focus is on making investments in R&D and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly and in a very disciplined way. As you know, our E2R, our expense to revenue ratio, is around 10%. It's something that we're very proud of. It's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way. At the same time, we don't want to under-invest in the business.",299

And how do you view services? You've obviously highlighted it the last 2 quarters. Do you view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings? Or do you view it -- and you mentioned platforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would agree with. And in that scenario, I would argue it's more a supporter of the ecosystem and a supporter of the hardware margins over time, and therefore, somewhat subservient to hardware. So it's great that it's growing but longer term, I would view its role as more creating the ecosystem that supports the high margins on hardware as opposed to independently driving earnings. How do you think about it?",123

So overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to embark on services that help that and become a part of the ecosystem. The reality is that in doing so, we have developed a very large and profitable business in the services area. And so we felt last quarter and working up to that, that we should sort of pull back the curtain so that people could -- our investors could see the Services business, both in terms of the scale of it and the growth of it. As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter. And the value of it hit just -- or was just shy of $10 billion. And so it's huge and we felt it was important to spell that out.",159

And then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you've clearly mentioned that you've kind of pulled forward some demand, which makes sense. But there does seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in the U.S. AT&T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors, I think, perceive that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less, currently, and could be less going forward. At the same time, I think you just announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess, potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening and could continue to do so?",110

If you compare to the 5s, what we're seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period in terms of rate than the 5s. But if you compare to 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. And so I think it depends on people's reference points. And we thought it very important in this call to be very clear and transparent about what we're seeing. And so I think in retrospect, you can look at it and say, ""Well, maybe the appropriate measure is more to the 5s."" And I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the 6. And in retrospect, when you look at the periods, they clearly were.",145

You're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2-plus billion reduction in channel inventory during this quarter.

We are in the process of assessing them. Frankly, from first read, we don't anticipate that they're going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, so obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use. So we don't expect any issue there. As you know, we are the largest U.S. taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full U.S. tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States. So we don't expect them to have any impact on us. On tax reform, maybe I can continue and I'll let Tim provide more color. But we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire U.S. economy. And we remain optimistic that we're going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and includes several encouraging signs. 
Revenue of $42.4 billion was near the high end of our guidance range, and gross margin of 38% was at the top of our guidance range. We achieved these results, while reducing channel inventory by about $3.6 billion, significantly more than the $2 billion inventory reduction we'd expected, so our sell-through was markedly greater than our sell-in. 
iPhone accounted for the vast majority of the channel inventory reduction. iPhone units sell-through was down just 8% year-on-year, an even greater improvement over the March quarter than we predicted. And we expect the September quarter sell-through comparison to improve further.
We feel good about our channel inventory levels and believe they position us well for the months ahead. We had a very successful global launch of iPhone SE, and demand outstripped supply throughout the quarter. We brought on additional capacity and were able to achieve supply-demand balance as we entered the September quarter. 
At its launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE to the iPhone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers, who love a 4-inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. In both cases, that strategy is working. Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers, who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years.
Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured. In absolute terms, our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any 9-month period, and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double digits year-over-year.
We saw tremendous performance from our services businesses, which grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion. The growth was broad-based, with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all-time high in addition to strong increases in Music, iCloud and AppleCare. In the last 12 months, our services revenue is up almost $4 billion year-on-year to $23.1 billion, and we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year. Most of our terrific services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active installed base of devices, with installed base-related purchases of $10.3 billion accelerating to 29% growth year-on-year.
We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7%, thanks to the rollout of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most exciting lineup of tablets and accessories in the world and exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement. Our surveys also show that about half of iPad Pro purchases are buying them for work. iPad Pro is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users, and the ultimate replacement device for customers switching from PC notebooks.
Apple Watch continues to be the best-selling smart watch in the world, and just this month, J.D. Power ranked it highest in customer satisfaction among all smart watches. With watchOS 3 coming this fall, customers will be able to update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly improved performance and all new fitness and health capabilities, including activity sharing. We're just getting started with the Apple Watch, and we look forward to even more exciting announcements in this space.
On a personal note, during the past quarter, I visited China and India, and I am very encouraged about our growth prospects in those countries. We remain very optimistic about the long-term opportunities in Greater China, and we continue to invest there. We opened our 41st Greater China retail store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing. 
Switchers and first-time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter. And our installed base of iPhones in China has grown by 34% over the last year alone. According to China Mobile, there are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users ranking first in terms of customer loyalty, data usage and ARPU.
By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply. We faced some challenges in Greater China as the economic environment has slowed down since the beginning of the year. This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year. 
Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies. Combining this backdrop with the tough comparison to last year, when revenue grew 112% and the channel inventory reduction this year, we're reporting a decline in revenue in the June quarter. 
But to keep things in perspective, when we look back on our accomplishments in this segment over the last couple of years, they are truly remarkable. In the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, our total revenue from Greater China was almost $40 billion, up 55% from the same time frame just 2 years ago, while iPhone units were up 47%.
India is now one of our fastest-growing markets. In the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51% year-on-year. We just launched, or we just announced a first-of-its-kind design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS, and we opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate Maps development. We're looking forward to opening retail stores in India, down the road, and we see huge potential for that vibrant country.
As we look forward to the fall, we are thrilled by customers' response to the software and services we previewed at our Worldwide Developers Conference last month. This was our biggest WWDC ever. And for the first time, we have 4 innovative Apple platforms for our developers' apps: iOS, Mac OS, watchOS and tvOS. In fact, iOS 10 will be the biggest release ever for iOS. The momentum of all 4 platforms shows the strong relationship Apple enjoys with customers throughout their day and wherever they go, whether it's at home, in their car, at work or everywhere in between. The Apple ecosystem is thriving and growing, and our new OS releases this fall will take these great experiences to a new level.
Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with Messages, now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share content, make payments, add stickers and more, all without leaving Messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world. 
Customers can also look forward to a broader and more intelligent role for Siri, which will work with your favorite apps from the App Store. So you can ask Siri to book a ride with your favorite ridesharing app, or send money to someone with Square. There's also beautifully redesigned apps for music, maps and news, significant enhancements to HomeKit, CarPlay and the Health app, building on our strategy to give users a seamless experience on all aspects of their lives. There's also a major update with macOS Sierra, with new features like Siri and Apple Pay that make the Mac smarter, and more helpful than ever and even a stronger Continuity features across all the Apple devices.
These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial intelligence. We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience. For example, machine learning enables Siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri does a better job understanding and even predicting what you want, then delivering the right responses to requests. To make Siri an even smarter assistant, we're opening the service to developers. And this fall, Siri will be available across our entire product line.
We're also using machine learning in many other ways across our products and services, including recommending songs, apps and news. Machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word choice while typing in Messages and Mail, and providing context awareness in Maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery life. And most importantly, we deliver these intelligent services, while protecting users' privacy. Most of the AI processing takes place on the device rather than being sent to the cloud.
And starting this fall, we'll be using sophisticated technology called Differential Privacy, enhancing our ability to deliver the kinds of services we dream of and customers love without compromising on the individual privacy our customers have come to expect from us. 
This fall, we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari, so users can easily make secure and private purchases when shopping on participating websites. Tens of millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today, at stores and in-app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year-on-year last month. 
Leading financial partners tell us that 3 out of 4 contactless payments in the U.S. are made with Apple Pay. This is amazing. There are more than 11 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is available today, including 3 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States. 
With the launch of France, Switzerland and Hong Kong, this month, Apple Pay is now live in 9 markets, including 6 of our top 10. Adoption outside the U.S. has been explosive, with over half of transaction volume now coming from non-U.S. markets.
With our latest OS releases, the unparalleled Continuity across Apple devices will become even more powerful. For example, macOS Sierra will sense other devices and use secure protocols to communicate. With an authenticated Apple Watch, I can auto unlock my Mac, when I open it without typing a password. With Universal Clipboard, I can copy and paste text, images and even video between my iOS devices and my Mac. And I can automatically access the files on my Mac desktop and documents folder from another Mac, iOS device or even a PC. Innovations like these are the kinds of things that only Apple can do.
We have an incredible lineup of products in our pipeline, and I'm very bullish about our long-term opportunity. Now I'd like to hand it over to Luca to share more details with you on the June quarter.",1823
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3663.0,1013502.0,42701149.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range compared to $49.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Customer demand for our products and services was stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. 
As Tim mentioned, we reduced overall channel inventories by roughly $3.6 billion. On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, to a new June quarter record. And we experienced healthy growth in a number of other important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India and Canada.
Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.9% of revenue and net income was $7.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42 and cash flow from operations was strong at $10.6 billion.
For details by product, I will start with the iPhone. We sold 40.4 million iPhones in the quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by over 4 million units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell-through was down by 8%. We exited the quarter near the low end of our 5- to 7-week target range for channel inventory. The rollout of our new entry-level iPhone SE, concurrent with the channel reduction of more than 4 million higher-end iPhones, resulted in a lower-than-usual iPhone ASP of $595. Therefore, we expect ASPs to improve this quarter.
We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets, with sales in Russia more than doubling year-over-year and double-digit growth in many other key countries, including Japan, Turkey, Brazil, India, Canada and Sweden.
iPhone continues to show great momentum in business markets. A recent survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones. This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the survey for the September quarter.
Turning to services. We generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over the June quarter last year. We set a new record for customers transacting on our iTunes stores. And among our customers, who purchased apps and content, the average amount spent per customer was the highest that we've ever measured. The App Store's growth rate has now accelerated for 4 consecutive quarters, reaching 37% in Q3. The App Store is overwhelmingly the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, it generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the June quarter, widening our lead from the March quarter.
Because of this continued growth, for the first 9 months of our fiscal year, services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this year. And it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.3 million Macs compared to 4.8 million last year. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, with IDC estimating a 4% global contraction. In addition to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the year-ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. 
Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new customers. And our Mac installed base has grown to a new all-time high at the end of the June quarter. We ended the quarter below our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Now turning to iPad. Revenue grew 7%. iPad ASP was $490 compared to $415 in the year-ago quarter, with increase driven by iPad Pro. And we sold 10 million iPads compared to 10.9 million in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units and exited the quarter within our 5- to 7-week target range.
In the segments of the tablet market, where we compete, we continue to be highly successful, both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the overall U.S. tablet market in the June quarter and has 84% share of tablets priced above $200. And in May, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini and a 95% rate for iPad Air. 
Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next 6 months, 63% plan to purchase an iPad, almost 4x the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 71% for the September quarter.
One recent example of iPad business adoption is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, which is adding 22,000 iPads to more than 10,000 purchased last year to deploy corporate mobility solutions across the organization and enable its consultants to serve customers in a more engaging and more efficient way. 
More broadly, we're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives, and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us. In May, we announced a global strategic partnership with SAP to reimagine business processes with native iOS apps. SAP is the world's largest enterprise software provider, with more than 130 million potential users among its 300,000 global customers. In fact, it's estimated that 76% of global business transactions touch an SAP system. 
Our partnership will deliver an SDK to fast-track iOS projects for SAP environments and iOS Academy to enable the 2.5 million SAP developers around the world to build great native iOS apps and a portfolio of industry-specific apps to accelerate mobile transformation in the enterprise.
Last month, we announced the first 3 solutions from our Cisco partnership, 2 that will dramatically improve the network performance of iOS traffic running on Cisco networks and one, that will bring the desk phone to the 21st century by integrating iPhone WiFi calling into Cisco Spark. 
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $231.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decrease of $1.4 billion. $214.8 billion of this cash or 93% of the total was outside the United States. We issued a total of $2.4 billion of debt in Taiwan and in Australia, while retiring $2.5 billion in U.S. debt, leaving us with $72 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from last quarter. 
We returned a total of over $13 billion to investors, during the June quarter as follows: we paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents; we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares to open market transactions; and we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 48.2 million shares. We also completed our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 8.7 million shares.
We've now completed almost $177 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $127 billion in share repurchases. During the quarter, we also spent $1 billion on a minority investment in Didi Chuxing in China, completed 3 acquisitions and incurred $4.2 billion in capital expenditures. 
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6,050,000,000 and $6,150,000,000. We expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.
Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2016, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2016. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.",1295

You made the Didi investment this quarter. Obviously, you've continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw -- I guess you invested in buying some of the Carpool Karaoke.

And that's sort of the main source of our capital. However, we are constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property. And we have been buying companies, on average, every 3 to 4 weeks or so and we continue to do that. And we think we've made some really great choices there. In terms of the investment in Didi, it was a -- an unusual investment in that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these, but we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in Akamai and a few other companies. It wasn't the first. From a Didi point of view, we see that as, one, a great financial investment; two, we think that there's some strategic things that the companies can do together over time; and three, we think that we'll learn a lot about that -- the business and the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know. And Didi has an incredible team there. So that's sort of the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us, but we will constantly look for things that are smart to do.",241

And this just as a follow-up for Luca. If you could talk a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance, 37% to 38%?

It's 37.5% to 38% for the September quarter. So it's -- essentially, we're guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter. And this positive is being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical of this time of the year for us.",89

So what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model? Is that affecting this? You mentioned the 451 is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next 3 months since 2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low, so it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment. So where is the strength coming from in the September quarter?",101
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3663.0,1013502.0,42701159.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,13,"We're -- Steve, we're not going to get into products or product transitions. However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia. So there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective. We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest-ever recorded, and the number of switchers through the 9 months are the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had. And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think services will continue to grow very briskly. We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion.",160

And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy. You talk about the 4 operating systems, essentially as platforms, which I agree with. And it's just interesting to me because Apple has such a control over the vertical integration of your products and yet you've somehow been able to kind of grasp the openness that's required for platforms, and I think that's reflected in WWDC as you pointed out, opening up APIs and so forth on messaging. And you kind of made the case there for apps versus messaging and kind of the anti-bot argument. I'm just curious, is that the way -- am I characterizing this roughly correctly, in terms of how you think about the business? And how are you managing that internally, in terms of having sort of this vertically-integrated somewhat closed deal of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform, where the value is created externally?",158

And so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps. And so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there's so many out there. And so that's what we're doing. The TV, and you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all the different things that they do in their lives. And so that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting a huge investment in the home, making and really bringing home automation to life, for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the reason for Apple TV and what we are doing in the living room. And so all these things together are all about user experience and making people's daily lives better.",208

And the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter. But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million of high ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter. So I guess I'd just pushed back and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better. Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to, or is there something else impacting the guidance?",124
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3663.0,1013502.0,42701164.0,Answer,Luca Maestri,,Executives,18,"Well, Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level. Of course, there's degrees of positive impact, right? We, for example, on the mix front, every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margins. And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second, and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as you know, we work with our hedging program, where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term, when these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at the spot rates. And so -- versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now strengthened, on average, against the international currencies by about 15%. And I think we need to accept and now we're living in this stronger U.S. dollar environment. We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side and obviously with hedges, but we need to deal with this situation and that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38%, given the new FX environment, I think, says a lot about all the work that we've done on the costs side to get there. Just to give you a sense, on a year-over-year basis, when I look at foreign exchange that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins.",251

And Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year? Somebody mentioned that U.S. carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone but across their installed base. The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle. And so those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low, but curious if you have a different view.",87

And so that aside, what we have seen sort of in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is that the iPhone upgrade rates for the 6s is very similar to the 5s. And I guess in retrospect maybe that was a predictable thing. Although we didn't predict it at the beginning, it took us a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that. And so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those. And so what the future holds, we'll see. But I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the smartphone itself, led by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to people's lives. It's becoming essential. And all of the things that are coming, both in the fall, the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully you're running by now, with the beta. Those and other things make it even more instrumental and AI even makes it more and more. I mean, as someone becomes more and more your assistant you, it's one of those -- you're not going to leave without it. And so I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive. I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone, and so they were waiting for the iPhone SE. And so I see lots of positive things. And so that's how I look at it.",321

Over 4 million iPhones suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were 45 million. When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question, which is in light of the true sell-through rate, which seems to reflect better-than-normal seasonality in Q3, and likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE. When I look at Q4, it looks like you're guiding for iPhone unit on a sell-through basis to be flat or potentially down, and for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the kind of seasonality we see in Q4. So I guess my question is, are you expecting any drawdowns in channel inventory in fiscal Q4? Are my inferences around sell-through rate incorrect? Or given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an earlier question and the hopefulness that you expressed in your prepared remarks, Tim, I'm actually surprised that the guidance isn't a bit stronger on the top line.",185

Starting with your comments on the June quarter, just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction that is not entirely related to iPhone. iPhone is the vast majority of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well. So that probably leads you to different conclusions to the math that you have just expressed. On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for channel inventory. But I would say in general, I think it's important to keep in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs, but we also know that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a number of places around the world, and that needs to be taken into account in our guidance.",186

Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 million iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the 40.4 million so that would suggest close to 45 million on a sell-through basis. So that was the basis for my observation. I was wondering if we could -- if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it's kind of elongated, relative to the iPhone 6 and that it's similar to what you saw with the 5s. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international. So I guess my question is you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service. And so I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing. And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly-type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion, so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?",218

And so if you take it in the reverse order from that and look at the new smartphone, the penetration around the -- smartphone penetration right now, around the world at the end of December was 42%. So there's a -- there's quite a bit of room there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets. But we have done -- we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets. And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly. On the switchers side, we really like what we're seeing. And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car, and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives, I think, becomes more important and I think that really plays to our advantage. I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience. And so I like that. From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. Some of these programs, like the one that you referenced that we've done replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock, some have a 24-month clock and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. And so there's various time schedules there. And so as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started. It really got underway, in a big way, last year; in a smaller way, 2 years ago. And so we'll see more of those this coming fall. The minus side is that the bifurcation of the smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that, and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world. Some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. They come back in and they pay less for the service, but they pay more for their smartphone. And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this, but overall, as I look at this for Apple and this is not a statement on the industry itself, but for Apple, I'm very optimistic.",507

On the Apple Pay side, the revenues from Apple Pay are in the services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small. And so for today, Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers, so that they can pay in a very simple, private and secure way. In terms of AR and the Pokémon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being -- a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. And this certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I'm sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there's great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we're investing and the #1 thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' kind of products like Pokémon. And so that's the reason you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokémons.",229

Clearly, a lot of momentum there over the last couple of years. But we're just kind of trying to figure out, how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next. Can you kind of give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&D perspective? And kind of corollary to that, does that -- is it really restricted just to products and services currently? Or can we see more of a cloud services apparatus kind of evolve over time, where you do more and more in the enterprise just given the core chips with SAP and Cisco and IBM? And then my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep getting a lot of questions around SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise. Are you seeing any sort of moderation in terms of the ASP pressures there?",179

The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis, and Luca can share the exact ones, but I think the recent quarter was in the mid-20s for R&D. The balance of the company, we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about the exact split of it. But you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products.",124

It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange. So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end, right? So the combination of these 2 things obviously, had an impact on ASPs. But I think, as I said or Tim said, during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these 2 factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat. On cannibalization, of course, we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks. But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us as we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. And we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the 4-inch phone factor. We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization, but really to us, what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem.",283

Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs and iPhone. In the last quarter, it seemed that you were quite clear that, that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company. So I understand there's other drivers going to the September quarter, but just to be clear, the 4 million or so units that you didn't sell through that were depleted in that channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well. That's the clarification. And then for Tim, on the services side, as Apple's spoken more and more loudly, I guess in the last 3 or 4 quarters, I just think about some of the comments you made about the TV market and how it's been stuck, I think, in the 60s or the 70s and the experience hasn't changed. I understand you've got the Apple TV Box out, but in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something that Apple want to do themselves? Do you want to partner? And could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple Box, we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to your overall company in terms of size.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week, we're holding another event here on the Apple Campus. All of us are excited, and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.
Our results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range. We sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last 2 quarters as we forecasted in January. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets.
As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal customers in the world, and fiscal 2016 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before. This is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other company can match.
We had a record setting quarter for services with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App Store revenue continued to skyrocket, while music revenue grew by 22%, thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music. In fact, J.D. Power recently announced that Apple Music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.
Earlier this month, I visited Japan where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments where they commute, dine and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next few months.
Apple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year-on-year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of September than we did across all of fiscal 2015. And with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners tell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.
We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last 4 years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017.
As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These are the best iPhones we've ever made with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers and the best iPhone performance and battery life ever, thanks to the custom designed Apple A10 Fusion chip. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and come in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly as possible.
We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features, including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are recognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated and connected.
One recent example is Aetna, which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to encourage them to live a healthier day.
We've just rolled out new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS, and customers are loving the many great new features, including Siri on the Mac, enhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call Memories. We've made massive advances in Messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink and handwritten notes. We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all-new App Store for Messages, and there has been a marked increase in our monthly active users.
One of the great new features of iOS 10 is the Home app, which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can easily set up and securely control all their HomeKit accessories from lights and cameras to the garage doors and air conditioners all from their favorite iOS devices. We expect over 100 HomeKit-compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple to help ensure customers' security when using them. Our Apple Stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home.
With our latest operating systems, machine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for years to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily, both through R&D and acquisitions.
Today, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10, which offers suggestions on which app you might want to use or which contacts you might want to include in an e-mail. Our camera and photo software uses advanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find. Machine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products.
Machine learning continually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding national -- natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening it to developers and most recently by making Siri available to Mac users in macOS Sierra. We're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs, and we're very happy with the engagement it's driving with Siri.
Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a ""first of its kind"" all-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country. They're offering a free year of service to purchases of new iPhones, and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their network. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity.
We're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership with Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use and security of the iOS platform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisers focused on helping businesses transform work in functions across the enterprise.
We're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20 industries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping.
As we close the books on another incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our amazing developer community for their relentless creativity and our wonderful customers, business partners and shareholders for their loyalty and support.
Now hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.",1309
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3586.0,1061372.0,44479193.0,Presenter Speech,Luca Maestri,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strongly in many emerging markets, including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand and Vietnam, and we continued to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America. Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue, and net income was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion, which is a new record for the September quarter.
For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our 5- to 7-week target range of channel inventory.
We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. iPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than our September quarter results even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago. Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus, and we're working very hard to get the new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible. 
iPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter, which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we launched iPhone SE and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the U.S., for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found that among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone with the current iPhone owners reporting a 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating and found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.
Turning to Services. We generated an all-time record, $6.3 billion in revenue, with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App Store growth rate has now accelerated for 5 consecutive quarters, reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App Store remains the preferred destination for both customers and developers.
According to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance from apps, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories, and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically as Tim mentioned.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac installed base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter, and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future Mac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our 4- to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
Turning to iPad. Revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with the increase driven by the new iPad Pro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our 5- to 7-week target range.
We continue to be highly successful, both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above $200. And in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air and a 93% rate for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next 6 months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than 8x the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured with iPad Pro, once again, the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and have purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.
In the enterprise market, we are seeing some great examples of iPad and Mac deployment. Our mobility partner program continues to grow stronger, with over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution partner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell Retail to implement Revel's iPad-based POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations worldwide, including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.
IBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more than 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs are 3x the cost to manage, drive twice the number of support calls and are 5 times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs. Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company's saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a 4-year life cycle.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. $216 billion of this cash or 91% of the total was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter.
We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows: we paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents; we spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares to open market transactions; and we launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 12.3 million shares. So total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%.
We have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the September quarter, we also completed 4 acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8 billion.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a differential graphic mix of earnings relative to our original expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%.
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the all-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.
Also, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2016.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1370

And second is, historically, in terms of new product categories, you guys have always looked for unique advantage before getting into a segment.

But from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so it's -- we're in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate, but on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win. I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products. And we're always looking at new things, and the car space, in general, is an area that it's clear that there's a lot of technologies that will either become available or are -- will be able to revolutionize the car experience. And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to -- certainly, nothing to announce today.",175

Let me say a few things on the 14th week and the revenue outlook for the December quarter. Keep in mind that the December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter. You mentioned the 14th week, and the few extra days do help us this quarter. But I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first 9 days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only 2 days last year, so the cadence is -- has moved more towards the -- Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We're certainly more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago. And then keep in mind that there was -- there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that, a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year. And also, the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect the FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.",333

What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past 3 years while sales growth was sort of 1/5 of that? Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the company's history? Or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market?,61

And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better.

But first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter. But what are your customers telling you about the demand in China?",53
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3586.0,1061372.0,44479207.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,17,"Yes. It's a good question, Shannon. So to sort of back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock and look at the full year of '16, we were down 17% compared to the fiscal year '15, which was up 84% from the previous year. So if you look at '14 to '16, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR was 23%, which is -- which really are pretty good results. Also, as you probably know, the fiscal year '16 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency, which affected about 3%. So the underlying business performance was 14% down. And so why was it down? The -- there's lots of reasons, but the largest one, in our view, is that when you look at what happened in '15 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. And this -- and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year '16 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5s as a point, it had further evolved. And so that's the main reason, in our view, that you see a difference. Now that spun or created another issue for us because we didn't forecast that accurately. So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and have been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. And so those 2 issues, which, really, the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are, in our views, the main issue. Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus had -- has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us. And from a longer-term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some -- sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so with the number of middle class or people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there, and so we continue to focus significantly in China.",470

And I don't mean the -- like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence. But there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world and especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration. So just if you can give us sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal.,97

I guess, a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray, and yet, from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single digits implied from your guidance. And I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch. But if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products, your major competitors laying down, you have an enormous -- you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably, 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish. What does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward? And is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing growing business for the company?",158

I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right. We've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned 2 issues that affects us, the onetimer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the effects that is the reality of our business right now. But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus, and so when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that the -- for the total company, of course, I mean, we believe the revenue is going to grow. You know that we don't get into a specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance. And so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward.",213

Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement if that's still the case?

It's growing on all major products, and it's growing, of course, in total. Our -- when you look at our Services revenue, the growth of the Services revenue has been accelerating during the course of the year during a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly. So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services, over time, just tend to spend more and more on our services. We've got -- customers are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal. And so you see this upward trajectory of our Services business. It's not only with the App Store but the several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we've got other parts of the business that continue to do well even, as I said, in -- during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit.",210

But I just am curious how you think about balancing AI with your focus on privacy and then also, how important it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant.",82

And we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so the advantage of having a assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there's not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying, on a balanced point of view, I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater. In fact, you can just look at the -- look at Siri today, and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac, but we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. And so it's very large, and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant-enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide. And so it's not only U.S. focused, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver globally. And so we've put a lot of energy into doing that. In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, I -- this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false tradeoff that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking, but I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's sort of like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so that, at a high level, is how we see it.",313

The largest driver is the fact that we made the change, an accounting change to our ASPs exactly a year ago. So we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not going to see the same thing going forward. And then there are -- we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories like, for example, gift cards or some AppleCare.

So clearly, this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great tradeoff to get the best device out there. So do you see more and more features being added into iPhones? Do you conceptually expect that you're anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net disruptive to demand? Or do you see more rooms to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features? And I have a follow-up.",110

And so we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. And -- but the mix that we projected on iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is, and so we are chasing supply there.

Tim, you'd mentioned in your prepared comments a little bit about India, and we've been doing a lot of work talking about the opportunity in India. And we get a lot of pushback talking about disposable income metrics and lots of things like that yet the population being so large. Can you talk a little bit about, do you see that India could, at some point, be as big of an opportunity as China? And it appears that the legal rules have kind of prevented you from going in a lot, but it looks like that's changing. Can you just kind of give us a little more clarity on India? And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should kind of think of maybe as we go forward that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to kind of be chugging along at that high rate? Or is it just kind of the rate of investing that you're going?",190

I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade and the age of the population. If you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25, and so you have a very, very young population. The smartphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. The -- we're -- but this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G, and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhones to produce that great experience for people. And so I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic because you really need the kind of infrastructure and the technology to do that. Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in the probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. I think it'll take longer for the GDP to rival it. But that's not critical for us to have a great success there. The truth is there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there's a lot of headroom there in our mind. And so we're working very hard to realize that opportunity.",332

We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think it's critical for us to invest. So you see that we make significant investments in R&D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are making important investments in data centers because we want to support our Services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. At the same time, we want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done very well over the years and want to continue to do that. So what you're seeing, for example, in fiscal '16, you've seen investments in R&D growing at 25% and then our SG&A expenses to be about flat. And this is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense-to-revenue ratio of 9%. This is extremely competitive in our industry and I would say in general. And so we want to continue to have this balance, make the right investments and remain efficient.",219

So Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin guidance. I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little bit higher. And again, that's about 50 basis points lower, and Street, it was, I think, 70 basis points lower. And I'm just curious, do you think that people are mismodeling that? Or is there something going on with pricing or mix there that you could provide us more color on? So that's my first question.",91

Rod, let me give you some details both on a sequential basis, and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from, looking at the -- at last year's gross margins in the December quarter. On a sequential basis, we are essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because, on the positive, we're going to have, of course, better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now. And we launched already a few during the September quarter, and that will have an impact on our December quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that, last year, we did -- in Q1, we did 40% -- around 40%, 40.1%, but there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And it's the fact that, last year, we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million. That is, at the gross margin level, is 40 bps. And then we got the FX situation, which I mentioned before, which is worth another 60, 70 bps. And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis, where, again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products. It is very, very important, I think, for investors to understand that -- what has happened during the last 2 years. During the last 2 years, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And we are a company that generates 2/3 of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year-over-year basis, just '16 over '15 was 340 bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely to a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program. But at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal, and we need to work with that. And I think over the years, we've made very good tradeoffs, and our gross margins have been quite stable over time.",411

I mean, Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. This is a -- it's a very large company. It's been getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500.

And so we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the company that we know really well. And so that thinking has, I think, proven out over time and I think been very good for our shareholders. And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we provided an amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so we'll be able to say more on that, I'm sure, in April of next year.",134
