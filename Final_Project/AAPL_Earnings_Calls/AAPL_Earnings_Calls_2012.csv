24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3559.0,288153.0,14176498.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Nancy. We're very pleased to report the results of our outstanding second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, leading to our highest March quarter revenue and earnings ever. 
Revenue for the quarter was $39.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 59%. That's a new record for a March quarter and is second only to the all-time record revenue we reported in the most recent December quarter. The year-over-year increase in March quarter revenue was fueled primarily by very strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales. 
Operating margin was $15.4 billion, representing 39.3% of revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion, increasing 94% over the prior March quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $12.30. 
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established new March quarter records for both desktops and portables, combining for a total of 4 million Macs sold. This represents growth of 7% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 2% growth for the global personal computer market in the March quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks. 
In February, we released the developer preview of Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of Mac OS X. Mountain Lion will bring popular apps and features from iPad to the Mac, including Messages, Notes, Reminders, Game Center, Notification Center, Share Sheets, Twitter integration and AirPlay Mirroring. We expect Mountain Lion to be available from the Mac App Store in late summer this year. 
Moving to our music products. We sold 7.7 million iPods compared to 9 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations, and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. 
We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. 
The iTunes Store generated all-time record results with revenue of almost $1.9 billion in the March quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year, thanks to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. We now have a catalog of over 28 million songs and 45,000 movies. 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell 35.1 million iPhones compared to 18.6 million in the previous March quarter. That represents 88% year-over-year growth compared to 42% growth for the smartphone market overall in the March quarter based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, led by our Asia Pacific and Japan segments where sales more than doubled year-over-year. We continue to see tremendous momentum in Greater China, where iPhone sales were 5x the level of the year ago quarter, aided by the launch of the iPhone 4S in China in January and the addition of China Telecom as an iPhone carrier in March. IPhone 4S is now available in over 100 countries and is sold through over 230 carriers. 
We ended the quarter with about 8.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.6 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. 
Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $22.7 billion during the quarter compared to $12.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 85%. 
iPhone momentum in the enterprise has evolved beyond email, calendar and contacts. IT and business line managers across industries see the opportunity to leverage both company and employee-owned devices to improve productivity and efficiencies through iOS in-house app development. In fact, the majority of the Fortune 500 companies who have approved iPhone on their networks are members of the iOS Developer Enterprise Program and are actively deploying in-house applications to their employee base. 
Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with sales of 11.8 million iPads during the March quarter compared to 4.7 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 151%. Customers are loving the new iPad with its stunning Retina display, A5X chip with Quad-core graphics and the 5-megapixel iSight camera. The new iPad is now available in over 40 countries, and we saw a very strong growth in iPad sales around the world with sales more than doubling in each of our segments. 
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $6.6 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 132%. We ended the quarter with about 2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential decrease of about 300,000 units, which placed us below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory. 
The education market's interest in iPad continues to grow. In the March quarter, we sold more than 2 iPads for every Mac to our U.S. K-12 customers while also generating a record quarter for Mac sales. The San Diego School District purchased 10,000 iPads in the March quarter and plans to purchase over 15,000 more in the June quarter for middle school and high school programs. 
iPad continues to open doors to new customers with whom Apple previously had no relationship. As we enter the K-12 institution buying season, we're hopeful that iPad will be a popular choice. 
iPad's momentum in business and government also continues to build. The United States Air Force Air Mobility Command is deploying thousands of iPads to serve as electronic flight bags, storing technical publications and operations information for flight crew members and trainers. Companies such as Bechtel and Bellflower Beatty [ph] are using iPads in the field for project management and viewing blueprints. And thousands of iPads are being deployed as mobile sales tools by companies such as Roche, Amgen, Bayer and Daiichi Sankyo. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 365 cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 50 million in the March quarter. The iOS ecosystem continues to expand and thrive with stores in more than 120 countries. 
The App Store now offers more than 600,000 apps, including over 200,000 apps specifically for iPad. We were very excited to announce the download of the 25th billionth app in March less than 4 years after the launch of the App Store. 
And iCloud is off to an incredible start, currently with more than 125 million customers signed up since its launch in October. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record March quarter results. Revenue was $4.4 billion, an increase of 38% over the year ago quarter and was second only to the record quarterly revenue generated in the December quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPad and iPhone sales, and they sold 826,000 Macs compared to 797,000 in the year ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. 
We opened 2 new stores in the quarter, including our first Netherlands store in Amsterdam and a beautiful new store in Houston. We exited the quarter with 363 stores, nearly 1/3 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 361 stores open, average revenue per store was $12.2 million compared to $9.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 23%. Segment margin reached a new March quarter record of over $1.1 billion, which was 26.1% of retail revenue. We welcomed 85 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 71 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. That translates to an average of 18,000 visitors per store per week. 
Total company gross margin was 47.4%, which was 540 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was driven by lower-than-expected commodity and other costs; about 1/4 was due to stronger-than-expected revenue and product mix, including 35 million iPhones; and the remainder was due to some onetime items that we don't expect to recur in the June quarter. 
Operating expenses were $3.2 billion and included $361 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $148 million. 
Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $110.2 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $12.6 billion. And about $74 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter. Cash flow from operations was $14 billion. 
As we indicated last month, subject to board declaration, we expect to announce a dividend of $2.65 [ph] per share when we report our third quarter results in July. And we will provide information on the record and payment dates at that time. 
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.6 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 41.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.3 billion, including about $385 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.68. 
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record March quarter performance with earnings nearly doubling year-over-year. The new iPad is off to a tremendous start and is our fastest iPad rollout ever. We're thrilled with the global success of the iPhone 4S, which is now available in more than 100 countries, including China. 
We remain very confident in our strategy, and we're very excited about the fabulous new products in our pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1708

So can you just talk about some of the headwinds sequentially you see on the top line in the June quarter relative to March?",52
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3559.0,288153.0,14176502.0,Answer,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,6,"Sure, Katy. It's Peter. The manufacturing ramps for the iPhone 4S and the new iPad were extremely successful for us. They yielded the highest launch supply and the fastest country rollouts for these product families that we've ever had. As a result, we were able to fulfill demand in the March quarter rather than the June quarter this year, and that generated revenue of over $39 billion. Therefore, unlike last year, we expect a sequential decline in revenue this year. I'd highlight 5 primary factors that have influenced our thinking: 
The first, the iPhone channel inventory changes. As I discussed in my prepared remarks, we increased our iPhone channel inventory by about 2.6 million units in the March quarter this year, and we exited within our target inventory range of about 4 to 6 weeks. Last year, we continued to add new countries into the June quarter, and we built an additional 700,000 units of iPhone channel inventory last year in the June quarter. So the combination of these channel builds in the March quarter of this year and the June quarter of last year will impact the sequential comparisons from this year to last. 
The second factor: fabulous iPhone 4S execution. As we told you in January, we exited December with significant iPhone 4S backlog, which led to a huge January. We launched China and 20 other countries also in January, which completed the rollout of the iPhone 4S into all the countries where iPhone is currently shipping. And as I said before, we exited the quarter within a supply and demand balance. 
The third factor: our new iPad execution was also fabulous. We had an incredible start with the new iPad. We launched with significant supply, leading to sales of 3 million units in the first couple of days, which was the -- and also the fastest country rollout ever. We therefore were able to satisfy much more of the demand for the new iPad in the March quarter this year compared to the iPad 2 in the March quarter of last year. This resulted in a shift of iPad volume into March this year versus last, and it will also affect the sequential compares this year to the last. 
Fourth, we decreased the entry price of the entry iPad to $399. 
And finally, the last factor to point out, the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, and we expect this to have an impact on the sequential compare, especially versus last year when the dollar weakened against most currencies over the comparable time periods. 
We -- look, we've just reported the most amazing March quarter Apple has ever had. We feel very, very good about our business and our new product pipeline.",454

You already saw a 7% sequential decline in March, which suggests that the uptake of the lower-priced iPad 2 was pretty phenomenal in March. Is that the right way to read it? And what does that demand tell you about the potential to move to lower price points on the iPad over time and see significant incremental demand?",72

It's doing well. But I have to tell you, the new iPad is on fire, and we're selling them as fast as we can make them.

But I did want to get your views on the slowdown in year-over-year growth rate within the category and what factors you would attribute that to. Are we -- is it product transition related? Were the inventories down quarter-over-quarter? iPad cannibalization? Any other color that you can provide would be helpful.,62
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3559.0,288153.0,14176507.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,11,"Yes, Rich, it's Tim. As you said, we did outgrow the market. Macs grew at about 7% where the market grew about 2%. And so this is the 24th straight quarter that we've outgrown the market, and so we're extremely pleased with that. The compare to last year is largely affected by the fact that we changed the bulk of our portable line, or the MacBook Pros, in the February time frame of 2011. And so it's a very tough compare. Specifically, the portables last year were up 53% year-on-year. And obviously, that -- so that compare was very difficult. If you look at it sequentially, you also have to factor in that we had 14 weeks in the December quarter. And so the 26% year-over-year growth in December quarter is probably more like 17% when you factor out that 14th week. And so yes, I think there was some cannibalization from iPad and the market is slow. But the much, much larger factor and in fact, in -- it might be the vast majority of the difference is the compare to a year ago.",185

I know it was asked earlier. But was the decrease in iPad price exclusively mix related? Or are there -- or is it a further broadening of your channel to indirect partners? But more broadly, Tim, maybe you could talk about elasticity, what you're learning about customer preferences for lower-priced offerings on both the iPhone and iPad. And I do have a follow-up, please.",92
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3559.0,288153.0,14176510.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,14,"Sure. Tony, on iPad 2, we're -- with the change in the entry price to $399, we're actually thrilled with the results that we've seen, although, as Peter said, it's only been a few weeks. And so it's too early to make a -- come to a clear conclusion. But from what we are seeing, this unlocks some education demand that is probably a more price-sensitive customer. Also, in several other countries, there was a marked change in demand at that price point. And so on the early going, we feel great about it. But I'd also point out that the new iPad is -- was current -- was supply constrained last quarter for the full 3 weeks or so it was shipping and is actually still constrained. And so the mix of the new iPad to the iPad 2, we're not certain of what that is yet. But we are certain, with what we've seen so far, that the absolute sales of iPad 2, at least in the early going, is very exciting. On the iPhone, we continue to be very happy with the moves that we made in pricing just a few months ago on the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4. And both of them contributed to our ability to achieve $35 million in sales, which is our second highest quarter of all time.",227

I think you've been fairly clear about saying that you believe that tablets will eclipse PCs in volume at some point. And I think you've also said they're somewhat discrete markets. There seems to be a lot of work, particularly on PC-based platforms, towards trying to combine the PC and tablet experience going forward in part because Windows 8 will be able to -- is a touch-based operating system as well. Can you comment about why you don't believe the PC or the Ultrabook and tablet markets or your MacBook Air and tablet markets won't converge? Isn't it realistic to think in a couple of years we're going to have a device that's under 2 pounds with great battery life that we can all carry around and open as a notebook or close up in a clever way and use as a tablet? Can you comment on why you don't think that product might not come or why you believe these markets are separate?",191
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 24, 2012",2012-04-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3559.0,288153.0,14176512.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,16,"I think, Tony, anything can be forced to converge. But the problem is that products are about trade-offs, and you begin to make trade-offs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn't please anyone. You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user. And so our view is that the tablet market is huge. And we've said that since day one. We didn't wait until we had a lot of results. We were using them here, and it was already clear to us that there was so much you could do and that the reasons that people would use those would be so broad. And that's precisely what we've seen. We -- the iPad has taken off not only in consumer in a meaningful way but in education and in enterprise, and it's sort of everywhere you look now. And the applications are so easy to make very meaningful for someone, and there -- the -- there's such an abundance of those that -- and as the ecosystem gets better and better and as we continue to double down on making great products, I think that the limit here is nowhere in sight. We've now -- through the last quarter, I should say, which is just 2 years after we shipped the initial iPad, we’ve sold 67 million. And to put that in some context, it took us 24 years to sell that many Macs and 5 years for that many iPods and over 3 years for that many iPhones. And we were extremely happy with the trajectory on all of those products. And so I think iPad, it's a profound product. It -- the breadth of it is incredible, and the appeal of it is universal. And so I am -- I could not be happier with being in the market, and the level at which we're innovating in both the product and the ecosystem here is incredible. Now in terms of the market itself, IDC and Gartner and Forrester had some numbers out there. I think Gartner is saying there's somewhere around 375 or so by 2015. Forrester is 375, somewhere around there. And so basically, the -- they're in the mid-300s, which is about where the PC market is today. And 2015 is only 3 years from now. And so I think even the more formal predictors outside of us are beginning to see these lines cross. And so I strongly believe that they will. Now having said that, I also believe that there is a very good market for the MacBook Air, and we continue to innovate in that product. And -- but I do think that it appeals to somewhat -- someone that has a little bit different requirements. And you wouldn't want to put these things together because you wind up compromising in both and not pleasing either user. Some people will prefer to own both, and that's great, too. But I think to make the compromises of convergence, so -- we're not going to that party. Others might. Others might from a defensive point of view, particularly. But we're going to play in both.",540

And I think the concerns are generally twofold: First, that carriers will attempt to stretch out the replacement cycle. And second, that over time, carriers across the globe will attempt to reduce subsidies significantly. I mean, how do you think about this risk? And do you think there are factors that could pressure subsidies going forward? And how would that impact Apple?",82

And a phone that delivers a -- just an off-the-charts user experience that customers want to use every day of their lives. And at the end of the day, I think that carriers, the vast majority of carriers, or maybe even all carriers, want to provide what their customers want to buy. And that's what they're motivated for. And so the most important thing by far is for Apple to continue making great products that customers want. And we are deeply committed to doing this and are innovating at a rate and pace that's unbelievable in this area. For -- from a carrier's perspective, I think it's important to remember that the subsidy is not large relative to the sum of the monthly payments across a 24-month contract period. And any delta between iPhone and maybe another phone is a -- an even smaller level of difference. And the iPhone has some distinct advantages for the carrier over competing smartphones. For example, many of the carrier executives have told me that churn from iPhone customers is the lowest of any phone they sell in their whole -- in all of the phones they carry. And that has a significant direct financial benefit to the carrier. Also, our engineering teams work extremely hard to be efficient with data and differently than some others. And we believe that as a result of this, that iPhone has far better data efficiency compared to other smartphones that are using sort of an app-rich ecosystem. Finally, we think that the -- and this is the most important, is that iPhone is the best smartphone on the planet to entice a customer who is currently using a traditional mobile phone to upgrade to a smartphone. This is by far the largest opportunity for Apple, for our carrier partners and is a great, fantastic experience to the customer. And so there's a win-win-win there. And so I think all of these factors are -- some of these factors are missed in this general discussion of subsidy.",353

Customers are using all the features of iCloud. Response has been terrific. Feedback has been terrific. Pickup on storage is occurring, but it's growing because we've just launched iCloud in October. And we've now got over 125 million users that have come on to the service since then and they're building up documents in music and other things that they want to store. And so I think storage growth will come more over time. Our real desire here was not about selling more storage. We think Match is a great product, and we recommend that everybody use it. But it's a paid for service. We just really wanted to increase the customer delight from the entire ecosystem and platform of our iOS devices and the Mac, and that's why we've done iCloud. And we just -- we couldn't be happier that just a couple months into this, there's more than 125 million users around the world on iCloud.",161

We -- the revenue was record -- was a record at $7.9 billion in Greater China, which is up over 3x year-over-year and brings the first half revenue for Greater China to $12.4 billion. That compares to a full year last year of $13.3 billion. So it is mind-boggling that we can do this well. A part of this was the pent-up demand for iPhone 4S. As you know, we launched mainland China in January of this year, and so China was not able to get into the Q1 period. So all of that is in Q2. We also have very strong demand for iPad 2. We have not shipped in mainland China yet the new iPad, although we are shipping in Hong Kong. And so it's a combination of these things. And the halo that both of these products have produced for the Mac is also incredible. Mac was up over 60% year-over-year. And that compares to a market rate of growth of about 6%. We have expanded point of sales. On a year-over-year basis, Mac is up 70% but still only 1,800 for all of Greater China. And so there's obviously a lot more opportunity there. iPhone, we're up over 11,000, which is 138%. But 11,000 is a much smaller number than we have in the U.S., and obviously, China will, in the next few years, be a bigger opportunity. iPad is only in 2,500 points of sale. And so yes, we've expanded. We've expanded a lot. However, there's a lot of headroom here in our view.",267

On the 2.6 million, our desire, just to be very clear on this, our desire was to increase inventory -- channel inventory across the quarter. As you might recall, we ended with only 6 million units in the channel coming out of December because we were extremely backlogged. And this is on particularly -- this is on 4S specifically. Our target is to be between 4 million and 6 million. The addition of the 2.6 million allowed us to get within that range by the end of the quarter. And so we feel that we exited the quarter as supply and demand balanced. Because our execution, the ops team was so good, the vast majority of the supply-demand in the different countries was reached by the end of January. And so we had the mother of all Januarys with the -- with really getting out of the vast majority of the iPhone 4S backlog and launching China as well. And so it was an incredible, incredible start of the quarter for us. Your other question was?",186

On iPad, worldwide, we're supply constrained on the new iPad, both coming out of last quarter. And to give you a current view, we're still supply constrained on the new iPad. Demand has been incredibly robust, and we are selling them as fast as we can make them, as Peter mentioned earlier. In China, I believe on a macro basis, China has an enormous number of people moving into the higher income groups, middle class, if you will. And this is creating a demand for goods, not just Apple's but other companies' goods as well. And so I think there's a tremendous opportunity for companies that understand China, and we're doing everything we can to understand it and serve the market as good as we can.",134

Keith, Spain has been weak for us and probably more broadly for many companies. We -- our revenues grew in Spain last quarter but materially less than we grew in Europe or worldwide. However, that wasn't cause and effect related to the issue you're on, that Spain is just in a, I think, terrible economic situation. And so I sort of look at that as an unusual case. To be clear about what was done, is that -- I think there's also some noise in the pike on this one. What the carriers did was they still have subsidies for their existing customers. And I don't want to talk about what the -- their existing customer-to-new customer ratio is, but you can find out numbers from different parts of the world and model that. They pulled subsidies on new customers. And so it wasn't a pull of all subsidies, it was a pull of subsidies from new. And it -- all carriers in that market did not do that. A couple of the carriers did. So I wouldn't necessarily use that as a proxy for the world, I guess, is my point.",193

And for iPad, we would have a significant -- expect to have a significant year-over-year and sequential increase in sales. And I've got a -- I want to put something out just so it gets out on the call in case it's not asked and talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance that we provided for the June quarter. We're pleased to be providing a gross margin guidance of 41.5% for the quarter. We expect about 2/3 of the sequential decline to be primarily driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current iPad lineup and lots of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. And we would expect the remainder of the difference to be primarily driven by the items benefiting the March quarter gross margin that we don't expect to recur in June.",191

Displays and NAND flash drove the majority of the favorable commodity cost benefit. In terms of the June quarter and the -- what we factored into our guidance, NAND and mobile DRAM supply continued to exceed demand. And because of that, we expect pricing will continue to be favorable. For most LCDs, we expect pricing to stabilize as the market moves to a supply-demand balance. The hard drive market has moved to a supply-demand balance, and we expect marketing -- market pricing to decline but will still be higher than the pre-flood level from the tragedy in Thailand. Most other components are expected to fall in line with or somewhat faster than historical trends.",150

So those 3 factors we see driving 2/3 of the sequential decline.",63

And then, Tim, just a question on the enterprise side. You mentioned a couple of times how the iPad is being taken into new markets, new verticals, whether it's because of the price point of the innovation. I'm just wondering specifically what resources is Apple dedicating to have a much more direct relationship with the enterprise? Can you speak on what's changed in the last 6 or 12 months and what you think you need to do to become a more credible or significant enterprise player?",88

And I'm pleased to report that 94% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPads and 75% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying the iPad. So these numbers are just off the charts for a product that's only 24 months old. And so we are moving our focus away from this and focusing on penetration within these accounts. Peter alluded to some of the wins that we have had in the -- his opening comments. The incredible things about these are that they span across many verticals, through government, through education, and many different functions within the enterprise. It's absolutely the most broad-based product I have ever seen in my whole career in terms of adoption rate into the enterprise. And so yes, this means that we're applying more resources in Fes [ph] and salespeople to interact directly with these customers. We also work with our carrier partners and our reseller partners in delivering both the products and services that are wrapped around that to these customers.",193

We are incredibly confident in our business, our strategy and what we're doing. When we give you guidance, we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving.

24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3578.0,331043.0,16013764.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Nancy. We're pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly record for iPad unit sales and new June quarter records for iPhone and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest June quarter revenue and earnings ever. 
Revenue for the quarter was $35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The $6.5 billion increase over the prior June quarter's result was driven primarily by strong growth in iPad and iPhone sales. Operating margin was $11.6 billion, representing 33% of revenue. Net income was $8.8 billion, increasing 21% over the prior June quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $9.32. 
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold 4 million Macs, establishing a new June quarter record. This represents 2% growth year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published estimate of a 1% contraction of the global personal computer market in the June quarter. Last month, we updated the entire MacBook line with faster processors, graphics, memory, flash storage and USB 3 connectivity. We also introduced the all-new 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display, all flash architecture and quad-core processors and customer response has been excellent. 
While we're seeing tremendous momentum for the iPad in education, which I'll discuss later, we also experienced our best quarter ever for U.S. education institution Mac sales with portables representing nearly 3 quarters of total Mac sales. Notable large education transaction closed during the June quarter include Rutherford County, North Carolina, which has purchased 6,000 MacBook Airs to support its 21st century digital learning environment and Pueblo Colorado School District 70 where all high school students and K-12 staff in the 22 school district will convert to MacBook Air. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks. 
Tomorrow, we will release Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of OS X. Mountain Lion introduces more than 200 features including all new Messages app, Notification Center, systemwide sharing and Facebook integration. We built iCloud into the foundation of Mountain Lion, making it easier than ever for customers to keep content up-to-date across all their devices. 
Moving to our music products, we sold 6.8 million iPods compared to 7.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectation, and iPod touch continue to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of U.S. market for MP3 players remained at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most counties we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. 
The iTunes Store generated very strong results in the quarter with revenue of over $1.8 billion, thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and other content. We are pleased to launch the iTunes store in 12 countries including Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan last month. Customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download from iTunes. 
We're continuing to see great interest in iTunes U. Since rolling it out in January, there have been over 14 million downloads of the iTunes U app. Over 700 new K-12 schools and districts and over 125 colleges and universities have enrolled in the iTunes U program, while over 750 new courses have been published. 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We sold 26 million iPhones compared to 20.3 million in the previous June quarter. That represents 28% year-over-year growth and was ahead of the amount we factored into our guidance following very strong sales in channel inventory build we achieved in the March quarter. We added several small regional carriers during the quarter and now have iPhone distribution through over 250 carriers in over 100 countries. We ended the quarter with about 8.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 300,000 iPhones, and we remain within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. 
Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $16.2 billion during the quarter compared to $13.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. Enterprises across the globe continue to choose iPhone as the standard device for their employees. We estimate that the number of iPhones in the Fortune 500 has more than doubled in the past year. iPhone is helping businesses and employees be more productive wherever they are. 
PepsiCo has deployed thousands of iPhones with an in-house app built specifically for their field merchandisers. This app has eliminated paper reports and provides real time information to managers, sales teams and delivery drivers. And German insurance provider, ERGO, has built an in-house app for iPhone that thousands of agents used to process insurance claims, which has significantly reduced paperwork and improved processing time and customer satisfaction. 
Turning to iPad, we were thrilled with sales of over 17 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 9.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 84%. We saw a very strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales around the world and are pleased to be selling iPad in 97 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $9.2 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 52%. 
We ended the quarter with about 3.2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.2 million units, which left us just within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory. The iPad continues to be a great success in the U.S. education market, with sales setting a new quarterly record and nearly doubling year-over-year to just under 1 million iPads. While interest in the new iPad was high, sales of the reduced price iPad 2 in the K-12 market were particularly strong. And even though, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved all-time record Mac sales to U.S. education institutions during the quarter, we sold more than twice as many iPads as Macs to U.S. education institutions. We are extremely pleased with these results. 
One great example of iPad adoption in education is the Mansfield Texas Independent School District, which has purchased 11,000 iPads. This fall, every Mansfield high school student and teacher will receive an iPad under the district's Power Up! initiative. Some teachers will use a flip classroom concept, putting their lessons and resources online where students can access them anytime with their iPads. As a result, students take responsibility for their own learning, and teachers are able to increase their interaction and personalized content time. 
iPad continues its rapid adoption within the enterprise. We estimate that the number of iPads in the Fortune 500 has more than tripled in the past year. iPad has become an indispensable tool worldwide to help employees across industries do their jobs more effectively. British Airways has incorporated thousands of iPads across their business from customer support at check-in to cabin service directors, replacing paper printouts that detail customer preferences and provide real time updates. And home builder Daiwa House in Japan is actively building smart homes that will be controlled by iPads. And their sales reps are using iPads to show floor plans and upgrade options. 
Combining the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 410 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 45 million in the June quarter. With App Stores in 155 countries, the iOS ecosystem continues to grow. The App Store now offers more than 650,000 apps, including over 225,000 apps specifically for iPad. We are extremely pleased to report that we have surpassed $5.5 billion in payments to developers. And customers are loving iCloud. Since its launch in October, more than 150 million people are using the iCloud services. 
In June, we previewed many of the exciting new features of iOS 6 at our developer's conference, including our fabulous new Maps app, new functionality and broader language support for Siri, direct Facebook integration, shared photo streams via iCloud and Passbook, the simplest way to get all your passes in one place. We believe iOS 6 will significantly enhance the experience of owning an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, and we can't wait to get it into the hands of customers this fall. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.1 billion, an increase of 17% over the year-ago quarter, with growth fueled primarily by all-time record iPad sales and strong growth in iPhone sales. The store sold 791,000 Macs compared to 768,000 in the year-ago quarter, and almost half the Macs sold in our stores during the quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened a total of 9 new stores in the quarter and exited the quarter with 372 stores, including 123 stores outside the United States. With an average of 367 stores open, average revenue per store was $11.1 million compared to $10.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was $868 million compared to $802 million in the year-ago quarter. 
We welcomed 83 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 74 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 12%. That translates to an average of 17,000 visitors per store per week. 
Total company gross margin was 42.8%, which was 130 basis points higher than our guidance. We experienced upside from better-than-expected commodity, warranty and other costs. These factors were partially offset by a stronger mix of iPad sales, a higher mix of lower-priced iPhones and a stronger U.S. dollar relative to our expectations. Operating expenses were $3.4 billion and included $378 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $288 million, and the tax rate was 25.6%. 
Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $110 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $7 billion. And about $81 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the June quarter. Cash flow from operations were $10.2 billion. 
Today, we are announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share, payable on August 16, 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 13, 2012. Going forward, subject to declaration by our board, we expect to announce record and payment dates for future dividends concurrently with our quarterly earnings announcements. Also, as we've previously announced, our board has authorized a 3-year $10 billion share repurchase program starting in our fiscal 2013, which begins on September 30, 2012. 
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.5 billion, including about $390 million related to stock-based compensations. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $7.65. 
In closing, we're pleased with our record June quarter results, including sales of over 17 million iPads. We established new June quarter records for unit sales of iPhone and Macs and posted our best quarter ever for U.S. education. We remain extremely confident in our strategy and the investments we are making in our business. We are very excited to be launching Mountain Lion tomorrow and iOS 6 in the fall. And we have some more amazing new products in our pipeline that we look forward to discussing with you later. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2011

I understand mix may go against you a little bit in the near term, but it should be structurally higher than 2 years ago. You have NAND pricing moving in your favor, and the products that you're selling in the market are relatively mature, so manufacturing cost should be favorable. Can you just talk about the dynamics that are pushing gross margins down again in September? And then I have a follow-up.",99

We expect the gross margin, as I said, to be about 38.5%, which is down about 430 basis points sequentially. We expect most of this decline to be primarily driven by a fall transition and to a much lesser extent, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The warranty benefit that we saw in the June quarter not repeating and a full quarter of the back-to-school promotion. So that's what we see doing it, Katy.",77

And then as a follow-up, Tim, you've obviously seen spectacular growth in China over the last several years. But there are some macro concerns in the market, and your Asia Pacific growth rate did decelerate from over 100% to, I think, 25% this quarter. So can you talk about what you're seeing in China as it relates to overall demand?",61
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3578.0,331043.0,16013770.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,8,"Yes, Katy. It's Tim. The growth in Asia Pacific was 25%, as you indicated, and the vast majority of the difference in our sequential growth rates was a result of Greater China, which represents about 2/3 of our revenue of that region. As we reported for Q2, our Greater China revenue was $7.9 billion. And in Q3, our revenue was $5.7 billion. Now the $5.7 billion is up 48% year-over-year increase. And so it still is growing at incredible rates. Virtually all of the $2.2 billion sequential revenue decline was due to iPhone sales in Greater China, and about half of that $2.2 billion is attributable to changes in the channel inventory, not the underlying sell through of the iPhone. As a reminder, in the previous quarter, in our fiscal Q2, we launched the iPhone 4S in China in January. We added China Telecom as a second carrier in March. And as we proceeded across the quarter, we increased the channel inventory to accommodate sales and to reach our target inventory of 4 to 6 weeks. The remainder of the sequential revenue decline is mainly attributable to normal seasonality after the very successful iPhone 4S launch. We did not see an obvious impact in Q3 that we would associate with the economy in Mainland China. We look at the economic reports as all of you do and see the press, but again, we did not see something that we would attribute to the economy in China. In terms of iPhones in general in Mainland China, we were incredibly pleased with our results. We were up over 100% year-over-year. And as you probably know, just last Friday, so in Q4, we launched our New iPad in China after we resolved the iPad trademark issue. And so our sales did not benefit from the New iPad in the June quarter in mainland China. Also, our new portables that we announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference begin to ship in mainland China last week after we received a routine regulatory approval. And once again, the June quarter sales did not benefit from these products. So net, we remain really confident about our plans and are very excited about our opportunity in China and are very much looking forward to incorporating more local services as you probably saw in the Worldwide Developers Conference announcement of iOS 6, which will be coming in the fall.",400

Let me start off, and if Tim wants to add something, he can. I'll first talk about the products and then a little bit about how we're thinking of revenue. For iPhone, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase in sales in the September quarter. For iPad, we would also expect to have a year-over increase, but we would point out that we increased channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units. And in the year-ago quarter, we also increased the iPad inventory that time by 1.5 million units. And for Mac, we would expect a sequential increase. As we think about revenue, we're providing revenue guidance that is up 20% year-over-year. We've included several things on our thinking. The first, we're not expecting the economies in Europe or the natural resource-based countries, including Australia, Brazil and Canada, to improve from what we saw in the June quarter. As Tim said, we saw no obvious evidence of the economy impacting our sales in China in the June quarter or in the U.S. But we're reading the same things that you all are about these economies. So we'll have to see. Our weekly iPhone sales continue to be impacted by rumors and speculation regarding new products. We exited the June quarter in supply and demand balance, and we were within our 4 to 6 week inventory target. We also don't expect to add any significant new country or carrier additions in the September quarter. Regarding iPad, as I said, we're able to increase our iPad channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units. And we ended the June quarter just within our 4 to 6 week channel inventory target, and we increased last year by 1.5 million units in the September quarter, which also put us in our 4 to 6 week inventory target. These increases in channel inventory will impact both the year-over-year and sequential compares for iPad. The current iPad line-up that we're selling includes the very successful $399 price point, which we did not have in the year-ago quarter. So this, along with mix in the line will impact the ASPs in the September quarter. And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies around the world, including the euro, Brazilian real, the Chinese RMB, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Swiss franc. We expect this to have an adverse impact to revenue in these countries in excess of $400 million sequentially net of our hedges. All that being said, we very much look forward to introducing iOS 6 in the fall, and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.",450

And just a follow-up, if I could, on the sequential iPhone decline. You gave us a pretty good outline on what was going on in China. But can you walk us through some of the trends that you saw for iPhone demand sequentially in the other international regions?",49
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3578.0,331043.0,16013775.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,13,"Yes, Bill, it's Tim. First of all, at a global level, I think it's important to understand, as you compare our Q2 iPhone sales to Q3, there's a fairly large channel inventory difference that is embedded in that. As you'll recall in January, we completed the iPhone 4S rollout in all the major countries, including China. It was our fastest iPhone rollout ever. We were also able to get the channel at a -- within our target inventory range of 4 to 6 weeks by the end of March. And so what that did was it increased sell-in over sell-through by 2.6 million units. In the quarter that we just finished, our sell-in was less than sell-through by 300,000 units. And so the net change in channel inventory across the quarter is about 3 million units. And so I think it's important to understand that to look at the underlying sell-through trends. In terms of what we see happening in the different geographies, the U.S. was very strong, running at 47%. Japan was strong at 45%. I've already mentioned Greater China. Greater China was up 66%, but Mainland China was over doubled, as I said before. It was over 100% up. The geography that did not perform well was Europe. Europe was essentially flat, slightly positive year-on-year. And that really hampered our total results. Within Europe -- now I'll switch from iPhone to talking about more of the gross revenue level. We see a marked difference between the countries. The U.K. was relatively solid at 30% growth, but France and Greece and Italy were particularly poor. And Germany was also only a single-digit positive growth for the quarter. Eastern Europe was strong, materially stronger than Western Europe, but obviously, the Western European countries drive the preponderance of the revenue in that segment. And so we are certainly seeing a slowdown in business in that area. Fortunately, the U.S. and China, although I realize it's getting a lot of press, we're not seeing anything there that we would classify as an obviously economic issue.",343

It's difficult to sort out. But I'm fairly convinced, based on what I've seen, that there's an incredible anticipation out there for future products and as you would expect, given what we've been able to deliver in the past.

I mean, it was up 2% year-over-year, clearly still outperforming the market. But can you talk about what you were seeing, how much of the slower growth was from, say, the product transition versus weak economy? And then any thoughts on cannibalization of Macs by the iPad?",56

It's clear the PC market is weak based on the latest IDC data. But frankly, we believe the primary factor for our lower growth rate in the Mac area is the timing of our portable announcement within last quarter. As you know, we announced an entirely new portable line-up that's been incredibly well-received. That was done with 3 weeks -- or less than 3 weeks remaining in the quarter. The year ago compare we made a transition in the portable area in February. And so we were selling our new line-up for the entire Q3 period. And so if you look at the data underneath that to further illustrate this, prior to the Developers Conference, our weekly Mac sales were running below the prior year. After the Developers Conference, the MacBook Pros and the MacBook Airs drove year-over-year increases in weekly sell through. And they were to the level that got us back to in overall positive territory for the quarter and our 25th consecutive quarter of growing faster than the market. The MacBook Pro with the Retina display was incredibly well-received. We ended the quarter in backlog, and we still have not caught up with demand yet, but anticipate doing so next month. Also to further illustrate the portable point, for the month of June, the NPD data that just came out in the United States showed our portable share at 25.5% and a record 47% of revenue share in the month of June. And so I would attribute the -- a large amount to what has happened in terms of the timing of our portable announcement.",271

And then could you talk a little bit, Tim, about what your conversations are like with the carriers in terms of pricing, subsidies? There's been a lot of talk about that over the last few months. So just how are your discussions with the carriers going clearly into the product transition that's coming?",55
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3578.0,331043.0,16013785.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,23,"Well, let me avoid talking about product transition, but you're very smart to ask that. I don't want to get into specific topics about -- with different carriers, but generally, I would just say that our role is to make the very best smartphone in the world and -- that has an incredible user experience, far superior than anything else that customers want to use every day. And I think at the end of the day, the carriers want to buy -- or want to provide their customers with what their customers want to buy. And so the most important thing for Apple, by far, is to continue making the best products in the world. And we are very deeply committed to doing this, and we're maniacally focused on it. From the carrier's perspective, I think it's also important to remember that the total subsidy that they pay is fairly small relative to the monthly payments that they collect over a 24-month contract period. And I think many would tell you, they certainly told me, that iPhone has several advantages for them over other smartphones. The churn rates are much less. You see carriers now focusing on shared data plans, and I think an iPhone customer is likely more -- is more likely to have a tablet or an iPad. And so I think they really value these customers quite a bit. Also, our engineering teams are very sensitive to working with carriers to find the most efficient way to deal with data. And we think that we're the most efficient smartphone on the market for smartphones that are in an app-rich ecosystem. And so we're going to continue focusing on making the best product. And I think that the carriers will be very motivated to make sure that they provide that to their customers.",305

Sales of each of our products did exceed what we have factored into the guidance. That was especially true of the iPad, which set a new record at 17 million units. And the $35 billion of revenue that we've reported grew by 6.5 billion year-over-year. We do think some things did impact us in the quarter, so let me comment on that. The economy in Europe is not doing well. We think this impacted our results. We also saw some economic impact in the natural resource space economies including Australia, Brazil and Canada. As Tim discussed regarding the iPhone, we're reading the same rumors and speculation that you are about a new iPhone. And we think this has caused some pause in customers' purchasing. The timing of availability of Intel's Ivy Bridge and resulting rumors about the new portables impacted our sales in April and May. Tim talked about how after WWDC, we saw a large increase in sales, both in terms of weekly sales before WWDC and on a year-over-year basis. And customers are loving the new MacBook Pro. And we did not get the benefit of launching the new iPad in China or the new portables as we are pursuing routine regulatory approval. And finally, the dollar strengthened against most currencies around the world, which reduced our revenue growth sequentially by over $200 million net of our hedges. So we think these things impacted the quarter. We're very happy with how the business is performing and are excited about our new product pipeline.",271

China is obviously the biggest one. Some of the data that I've seen suggests that about 70% of the phones that are -- smartphones that are being purchased in places like China and other emerging countries are under $300, and in many cases, under $200. Do you agree with that market characterization? And at some point, does that become a limit -- does that limit your ability to gain share in a marketplace where it's 70% of the units are at a price point that you currently don't play in? At what point does that math prevent you from gaining share? And what are your strategies for ensuring continued share going forward if, indeed, that's an objective?",139

But let me try to answer your general question without that specific. We've been very focused, as you know, on China because we see it as an enormous opportunity for us. And I'm -- we're very pleased that we were able to grow our iPhone sales over 100% last quarter. And so I feel very, very good about that. And I firmly believe that people in the emerging markets want great products like they do in developed markets and so forth. And so we're going to stick to our knitting and make the best products.

And then that's just not the case with iPad, but it's the case with all products. I know that there are some companies out there that refer to their channel inventory in terms of their gross sales.

And it did very well in the quarter. But the most popular iPad is the new iPad, but iPad 2 did very well. It was particularly key in the K-12 area that Peter spoke about earlier where we sold about 1 million units for the quarter. And so we have been very aggressive in this space, and I don't see changing that. In terms of competition, I've -- we've all seen, I think, many different tablets, hundreds of them, come to market over last year. And I have yet to see any of them really gain what I would call any level of traction at all. We have over 225,000 apps that have been optimized for iPad. There's an incredible experience on iPad. And I still think the market very much or most customers feel that they're not really looking for tablet. They're just looking for an iPad. And we're going to keep innovating in the space and keep making great products. And I think keep a very, very strong business going forward. The 17 million iPads was up 84% year-over-year. And we've now shipped over 84 million. This is as of the end of the last quarter, iPads, which if you look at that on a trajectory rate, it took us more than twice as long to achieve that on iPod and a third longer on -- or we achieved it in a third less time on iPad than iPhone.

The iPad and the iPhone, the blended ASPs seem to have declined a little more this quarter versus the prior quarters. Is that a function of the product portfolio or Apple just testing price elasticity as you expand into the emerging markets?",48
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2012",2012-07-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3578.0,331043.0,16013809.0,Answer,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,47,"It's Peter. The iPhone ASP, we don't talk specifically about iPad and iPhone ASPs, but I would like to give you a little bit of color this quarter because they did change some sequentially. And in the case of the iPad, year-over-year. Beginning with the iPhone, the ASP was down due to a higher mix of lower-priced models and a stronger U.S. dollar. And that was the case generally on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. Regarding the mix, we believe that this was largely driven by all the new product rumors, economic conditions, particularly in Europe, and we had a change in the ending inventory by model that also influenced the ASPs. For the iPad, it was down more year-over-year than it was sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was really attributable to 4 things. We had a higher mix of lower-priced models; we reduced the price of the iPad 2 to $399; with our expanded distribution, we had a higher mix of indirect sales this year than we did a year ago; and the dollar impacted us as well.",180

I don't want to comment specifically on that point, but Passbook, in general, is a very key feature. I think all of us has found that we were getting many passes and many tickets and so forth that were scattered all over, maybe boarding passes, et cetera. They were scattered all over our iPhones in different apps. And so Passbook does an incredible job of pulling all of those to one place, whether it's offers or passes or tickets or whatever it may be. And so it's a important feature of iOS 6. And I wouldn't want to speculate about where it might take us.",106

In other words, were your sales incrementally higher, or as a result of this economic environment, did you see customers migrate downmarket to lower-priced products because spending is a little tighter these days?",66

The reason we did it was because we believe that the sales would be incrementally larger, that there was price elasticity, and that there was a buyer that really wanted the best product and -- but needed it to be a little less expensive. And so I believe that we saw that. I think our -- I think it did help our sales. I think it's particularly helping in K-12. The adoption rate of iPad in education is something I've never seen from any technology product in history. Usually, education tends to be a fairly conservative institution in terms of buying or K-12 does, and we're not seeing that at all on the iPad. And so I think it was -- it's been a big help for us. I'm really glad that we did it.",138

And that doesn't mean that we're not putting emphasis in India. We are. We have a business there. That business is growing.

In terms of new products, I obviously don't talk about new products, nor the parts that are in them.

Our north star is to maniacally focus on making the world's best products. And economic turmoil may push us side to side, but we're going to stay on that journey and stay focused on making the best product and not deviate from that. We've seen, again and again, throughout the years that during these type of periods are where we distance ourselves further from people that don't innovate. And it increases the gap between us. And so that's what we're focused on. Now when we can do that and hit more aggressive price points, we're also going to do that. And I think you've seen that with what we did with the $399 iPad just a few months ago. And the iPhone 3GS is free in the United States and in several other countries. And there's been quite a lot knocked off the price of that in certain other markets. And so our north star though will be making the best products in the world. And that's why we breathe.

Thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report the results of our fourth fiscal quarter. We established new September quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest September quarter revenue and earnings ever. Revenue for the quarter was $36 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. That's a $7.7 billion increase over the prior September quarter's result and was driven primarily by strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales. 
Operating margin was $10.9 billion, representing 30.4% of revenue. Net income was $8.2 billion, increasing 24% over the prior September quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $8.67. 
Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold over 4.9 million Macs, establishing a new September quarter record. This represents 1% growth year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published estimate of an 8% contraction of the global personal computer market in the September quarter. Portable sales grew 9% year-over-year and represented an all-time high of 80% of Mac unit mix, thanks to strong sales of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. 
Earlier this week, we unveiled a stunning new design for iMac that packs high-performance technology in a brilliant new display, with reduced reflection into an incredibly sleek aluminum and glass enclosure. We also introduced an even thinner and lighter version of our most popular Mac, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, featuring a Retina display with over 4 million pixels and all flash storage. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks. 
Moving to our music products. We sold 5.3 million iPods compared to 6.6 million in the year-ago quarter. iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the September quarter based on the latest data published by MPD, and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. 
We're very excited to be shipping our newest iPods as of 2 weeks ago. The new iPod Touch is the thinnest iPod touch yet, comes in 5 great colors and features a 4-inch Retina display, a 5 megapixel iSight camera, our powerful A5 chip and Siri. 
The new iPod nano is the thinnest iPod ever, featuring a 2.5-inch multi-touch display, convenient navigation buttons and built-in Bluetooth for wireless listening. The nano comes in 7 great new colors, and we think our full range of iPods will make wonderful gifts this holiday season. 
The iTunes Store generated all-time record results, with revenue of almost $2.1 billion, thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and video. We look forward to launching the new iTunes featuring a completely redesigned player, seamless integration with iCloud and a new look for the iTunes Store. The new iTunes has a dramatically simpler and leaner interface so customers' music, movie and TV purchases on any of their iOS devices or computers are conveniently displayed in their iTunes library and are available whenever they want them. 
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We're very pleased to have sold 26.9 million iPhones compared to 17.1 million in the previous September quarter. That represents 58% year-over-year growth compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 45% growth for the smartphone market overall during the quarter. We launched iPhone 5 in 9 countries on September 21 and 22 more countries on September 28, and demand has been phenomenal. Customers have responded tremendously to the iPhone 5's all-new thin and light design and beautiful new 4-inch Retina display, the powerful performance of the A6 chip and the great new ultrafast wireless technology. Demand for iPhone 5 continues to outstrip supply, and we're working very hard to get more into customers' hands as quickly as possible. 
We ended the quarter with about 9.1 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 800,000 iPhones, and ended the quarter below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $17.1 billion during the quarter compared to $11 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 56%. 
Businesses around the world continue to make iPhone an essential device for their employees. Virtually every type of enterprise and small business is using iPhone, along with the business apps from the App Store and custom apps developed in-house to drive efficiencies that were simply not possible before. 
Canon has provided its field sales team iPhones with secure access to its customer relationship management system. Sales reps can now access customer information and input meeting notes anywhere, giving them more time with customers. 
Amtrak has deployed thousands of iPhones to train conductors who use an in-house app that changes the entire ticketing and reporting workflow. The app enables print-at-home ticket validation, delivers a more accurate passenger manifest and makes accounting data available to Amtrak's revenue systems in near real time, revolutionizing the paper-based process the company used in the past. 
And news organizations around the world are using iPhone to transform the way they capture and deliver news. Reporters for BBC, The Wall Street Journal, Mexican newspaper Milenio, and Canada's CTV News are using their iPhone cameras to capture HD video on location and send it directly back to headquarters for broadcast on TV or streaming on the web. 
Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with sales of 14 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 11.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 26%. iPad sales were ahead of our expectations, and we saw strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales in every geographic region. 
Earlier this week, we introduced the iPad mini, the thinnest, lightest, smallest iPad we've ever built. It has all the power, performance and capability customers have come to expect from an iPad, and you can hold it in one hand. We also introduced the fourth-generation iPad with a beautiful 9.7-inch Retina display and A6 chip with twice the performance of the iPad we announced earlier this year. Together with the iPad 2, these 2 new iPads run more than 275,000 apps in the Apps Store. 
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad Accessories during the quarter was $7.5 billion compared to $6.9 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 9%. We ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which left us just over our 4 weeks of iPad channel inventory target on a look-back basis. 
iPad is fundamentally changing work processes across industries around the world. With apps developed in-house, iPad is helping companies deliver better service, streamlined manufacturing and empower workforces with critical data and information. 
Volkswagen has developed more than 30 in-house apps for vital processes across the company, including monitoring and tracking of vehicles on the production line, scheduling of vehicle transportation at assembly plants and greeting customers when they pick up new cars.  
Ping An Insurance in China has deployed thousands of iPads to their sales agents and service teams. Apps developed in-house are used by car accident inspectors to carry out on-site inspections and file claims, which significantly shortness processing time and improves customer satisfaction. 
And Brazil's Banco Bradesco is using iPads to redefine the customer experience in their bank branches. Beyond completing customer transactions, employees use iPads to inform and educate customers about bank services and Bradesco apps in the App Store. 
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we sold over 44 million iOS devices in the September quarter. The App Store now offers more than 700,000 apps, including over 275,000 apps specifically for iPad. We established a new all-time record for quarterly app sales in the September quarter, and we were very pleased to report that we've reached $6.5 billion in cumulative payments to developers. 
Customers are embracing iCloud in growing numbers, with over 190 million account sign-ups in the first year of the service. With iCloud, customers can access their music, photos, calendars, contacts, documents and more from whatever device they're using. And it's built into every new iOS device and every new Mac. 
And we launched iOS 6 last month, and it's already on over 200 million devices. iOS 6 includes over 200 new features, including broader language support for Siri, Facebook integration, shared photo streams and more. We've made a number of improvements to Maps over the past month, and we will work nonstop until Maps lives up to our incredibly high standards. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was $4.2 billion, which is a new September quarter record and an increase of 18% over the year-ago quarter with growth fueled primarily by the store's best iPhone launch ever. The stores also established a new quarterly record for Mac sales, selling just over 1.1 million Macs. We opened a total of 18 new stores in 10 countries during the quarter, including our first store in Sweden. We also opened our second store in Hong Kong at Festival Walk to overwhelming response, resulting in our biggest store opening of the year. 
We exited the quarter with 390 stores, 140 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 376 stores open, average revenue per store was $11.2 million compared to $10.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was 848 million compared to 652 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 94 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 77.5 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. That translates to an average of 19,000 visitors per store per week. 
Total company gross margin was 40%, which was 150 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better-than-expected commodity and other costs. Another core to the difference was due to leverage on the higher-than-expected sales and more favorable foreign exchange. The remainder was due to some items that we do not expect to recur in the December quarter. 
Operating expenses were $3.5 billion and included $379 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was a net expense of $51 million. Interest income and investment gains were more than offset by higher-than-expected currency hedging expense. Under the accounting rules, foreign exchange fluctuations late in the quarter required us to accelerate recognition of premium expense related to Q1 and Q2 hedges. This will result in less premium expense being recognized in Q1 and Q2. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%, bringing us to a tax rate for the full fiscal year of 25.2%. 
Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $121.3 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of over $4 billion. The increase in cash was net of $2.5 billion of dividends paid in August. About $83 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion. 
Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share, payable on November 15, 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2012. In August, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase program with a financial institution to purchase up to 2 billion of Apple's stock during fiscal year '13. In addition to shares purchased through the accelerated share repurchase program, we may also purchase shares in open market transactions in compliance with all applicable securities laws. 
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by the fact that our December quarter this year will span 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter last week year included a 14th week. As we indicated previously, revenue in that 14th week last year was approximately 1/14 of the quarter's total revenue. 
We expect revenues to be about $52 billion compared to $46.3 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 36%, reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $4.05 billion, including about $485 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $380 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. We are targeting EPS of about $11.75. 
In closing, we're extremely proud to conclude an amazing fiscal year 2012. We generated revenue of over $156 billion, which is up 45% year-over-year and reflects growth of $48 billion in revenue. We sold over 200 million iOS devices, including 125 million iPhones, reflecting 73% growth year-over-year and 58 million iPads reflecting 80% growth. 
We sold a record 18 million Macs and shipped 35 million iPods. And we expanded the reach of iTunes music stores to 63 countries around the world. We launched stunning new versions of OS X and iOS. And tying it all together, we launched iCloud with customers reaching over 190 million and growing. 
And finally, we generated net income of $41.7 billion, an increase of 61% year-over-year. We entered this holiday season with our strongest product line-up ever, and we remain very confident in our new product pipeline. 
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2270

The bears will point out maybe the company's price premium or supply chain advantage is weakening, so just curious how you would respond to that. And then as a follow-up, Peter, if you can comment on what's driving the significant gross margin downtick in December, given you should have decent iPhone mix.",91

I'll address many of the things you asked, and then Tim can add a few points. The change year-over-year is being driven by a couple of things. So first of all, last year included a 14th week. This year's Q1 is a normal 13-week quarter. That, along with a stronger U.S. dollar and the changing gross margin. So let me talk to you about what we see for gross margin. But I'm going to go through some detail on a sequential basis, not year-over-year. As you pointed out, this is the most prolific product period in Apple's history. We have an unprecedented number of new product introductions over the last 6 weeks, and this has led to record levels of demand. Newer repriced versions of our products announced during this time frame represent over 80% of the total expected December quarter revenue. But there are costs associated with such dramatic change and demand. The iPhone 5, iPad mini, iMac, MacBook Pro 13-inch, iPod Touch and iPod nano have completely new form factors with great new features, and we've never before introduced so many new form factors at once. All of these products have higher costs than their predecessors and, therefore, lower gross margins as they're at the height of the cost curve. This has been the case with new product in the past, so nothing new. The difference this time is the sheer number of new products we are introducing in a very short period of time. Additionally, we lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4, delivering incredible value to our customers. We head into this holiday quarter with the strongest iPhone line-up that we have ever had, with the iPhone 4 starting at free in the subsidized markets. We also added the iPad mini to our iPad line-up. The iPad mini has the full iPad experience, and we priced it aggressively at $329, delivering incredible value to our customers. Its gross margin is significantly below the corporate average. So in summary, we expect our gross margin to decline by about 400 basis points sequentially. We expect to benefit from positive leverage on a sequentially higher revenue and a greater mix of iPhones, but we expect these benefits will be more than offset by a number of factors. First, margins on new products are lower than their predecessors, including the iPhone 5, and we have been aggressive with the iPad mini. Second, we've lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4. Third, we will experience transitionary costs associated with multiple new product ramps. Fourth, the high anticipated volume of iPhone and other new products will generate significantly greater deferred revenues sequentially. As you're aware, we defer a portion of our revenue with every device we sell and amortize it back into revenue over the life of the device. In periods of exceptionally strong sales like the December quarter, the deferred amounts are significantly higher than the revenue amortized in from past sales. And fifth, the favorable items that benefited the gross margin in the September quarter are not expected to repeat in the December quarter. We will work hard to try and get down the cost curves and improve our manufacturing and other efficiencies, as we successfully have done in the past. We entered this holiday season with our strongest product line-up ever, and we have great choices for customers. To be in a position to anticipate over $50 billion of demand for our products in a single quarter is a reflection of the incredible strength of our products and our business.",603

Do you continue to anticipate rolling out to all 100 countries this quarter as you had announced at the time of the iPhone 5 announcement?

In regard to your first question, we still continue to anticipate rolling out to the 100 countries as we announced before. It is our fastest rollout ever. There will be some large countries in the month of December. But we anticipate still achieving the 100. In terms of costs, with each new product, we see learning curves associated with ramping production. And the new products we have now are no exception to that. The difference is the number of new products that we have moving at once. As Peter said, and as you can tell from the announcements we've had the last couple of months, this is the most prolific period in our history in terms of the new product introduction and innovation. The past 6 weeks have been phenomenal in terms of new product introduction. And so we do see all of these costs associated with each of these. But I don't see those costs accelerating on a per-unit basis as we go through the quarter. I see it very much being a production ramp across many, many new products.",184

You've talked before about how you believe that the iPad will be and the tablet market will be an enormous market, bigger than the PC market. Clearly, you've made a move to expand that market and make it more accessible by introducing the iPad mini. I'm wondering if, over time, you could see this market evolving to larger tablets going forward that would address different needs in the marketplace, take on incremental PC functionality? And then I'm wondering when you talk about the iPad market being bigger than the PC market going forward, do you see larger form factors in the marketplace evolving? And I guess the question is, why not?",117

But let me make some comments on your question. We are -- we continue to be very confident that the tablet market will surpass the PC market. There is incredible development in both ecosystems and product going on in the tablet space. It is already extremely compelling for many, many customers to choose a tablet, in particular, an iPad over a PC. And when you look at the size of the PC market, there is an enormous opportunity for Apple there. Pretty much each quarter, you see 80 million to 90 million PCs being sold. And so we do think that the iPad and the iPad mini and the iPad 2 will all be extremely attractive offerings for people in lieu of PCs. And we're going to continue to very much focus on the future of iPad. And we're very, very confident with the -- with what we have in the pipeline. And we're extremely pleased to have launched iPad mini and can't wait until next Friday when we begin selling the very first units.",193

In terms of what we saw in China for Q4, revenue was $5.7 billion. That's up 26% year-on-year. Mac was up extremely strong, up 44%. As you recall, we launched portables for the first time in July or the portables that we have previously announced in the U.S. in June, we announced this in China in July. iPad was up 45% in Greater China. iPhone was up 38%. And so all in all, a fantastic quarter. That brings us to a full year, fiscal year revenue number of $23.8 billion for China, which is really phenomenal when you think about it. That's up over $10 billion year-on-year, up 78%, and Greater China now represents about 15% of Apple for the fiscal year. And so we're extremely happy with how we've done in China. As Peter alluded to in his opening remarks, we are continuing to invest in our own retail stores there. We continue to expand distribution in -- with channel partners as well.

I haven't personally played with the Surface yet, but the -- what we're reading about it is that it's a fairly compromised, confusing product. And so I think one of the toughest things you do with deciding which products is to make a hard trade-off and decide what a product should be. And we've really done that with the iPad, and so the user experience is absolutely incredible. I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don't think it would do all of those things very well. And so I think people, when they look at the iPad versus competitive offerings, are going to conclude they really want an iPad. And I think people have done that to date. And I think they will continue to do that.",134

We provide an incredible fourth-generation iPad and iPad mini and an iPad 2. Customers will decide which 1 or 2 or 3 or all 4 that they would like and will buy those. And so we've learned over the years not to worry about cannibalization of our own products. It's much better for us to do that than somebody else to do it. And the far, far bigger opportunity here are the 80 million to 90 million PCs that are being sold per quarter. There's still over 300 million PCs being bought per year, and I think a great number of those people would be much better off buying an iPad or a Mac. And so that's the much bigger opportunity for Apple. And so instead of being focused on cannibalizing our sales, I'd look at it much more that it's an enormous incremental opportunity for us. And so that's how I look at it.",174

For Q4, we sold 1.3 million. That's up over 100% year-on-year. That means that we sold up more than 5 million Apple TVs during the fiscal year, which is almost double the previous year. We had sold 2.8 million the previous year. And so the business continues to do very well. But if you look at the size of revenue of this business versus our other businesses, it's quite small. And so it's still has the hobby label. However, it's a beloved hobby.

The thing to -- first thing to note there is that as we talked about in the July call, the June quarter contained 1.2 million increase in channel inventory. And so the actual sell-through sequentially looks -- compares and looks very different than the -- our reported sell-in numbers do. The second thing is that the 14 million exceeded what we had expected to do in iPad. And the reason we had expected it to decline is that we believe based on the 2 or 3 years of results that we've got is that normally, we would see a seasonal reduction in the September quarter versus the June quarter. And part of this reason is because K-12 heavily buys in the June quarter. K-12 doesn't buy very much in the September quarter. It becomes a higher ed kind of move, and higher ed is still buying notebooks for the most part. And so there's some kind of normal seasonal. That's exaggerated further when we announced a new product in March and have an enormous full quarter of demand in the June quarter. And then when you compare that to the September quarter, there will be a natural phase down. In addition to all of that, people -- it's clear that customers delayed purchases of tablets due to new product rumors, and these intensified in August and September. Some of that was anticipated and some of that I wish wouldn't occur, but it did occur. And so that's how I'd explain the sequential difference. On a year-over-year basis, because of the year-ago quarter having also a channel inventory build as we start the channel to the proper level, the sell-through year-over-year actually grew 44%. And so the underlying sell-through was extremely strong. And so we continue to feel great about how iPad has done and with announcing the fourth-generation iPad just as week and adding iPad mini to the family, we think it's going to be an incredible holiday season.",340

The balance of the quarter, we plan with an eye toward the supply and what we think the demand will be. But we do plan these in advance. And so it is not a precise science. And we obviously have to plan those with several weeks of notice. And so occasionally, it can be different than what we think.",87

I think many people on the street seem to have a slightly different view. Could you maybe talk a little bit about your pricing philosophy? And was it driven by costs, or is it just more to keep a premium brand given the quality of your products?",58

When we set out to build the iPad mini, we didn't set out to build a small, cheap tablet. We set out to build a smaller iPad that offered the full iPad experience as our customers would expect. As a result, the difference between the iPad mini and the competition is profound. Our iPad mini begins with a 7.9-inch display, which is 35% larger than 7-inch tablets, providing a much better experience. We are shipping 2 great cameras, FaceTime HD front and a 5-megapixel 1080p iSight rear camera versus typically one from our competition. We are shipping our fastest communications with dual-band WiFi and we included the A5 chip, which has higher performance than our competitors. And finally, the fit and finish of our precision unibody aluminum enclosure is breathtaking when held in your hands. And so that's what we've done. The iPad mini has higher costs, and the gross margin is significantly below our corporate average. We are beginning at the height of the cost curve. But in addition to wanting to make a large number, we're going to work to try and get down the cost curves and be more efficient in manufacturing, as we have been in the past with our other products.",209

So that's what iPad mini has been designed to do. And you can really see that more broadly on iPad by looking at the usage statistics. As I've mentioned earlier this week, over 90% of the web traffic from tablets are from iPads. And so Apple will not make a product that somebody may feel good about it for the moment that they're paying for it and then when they get it home, they rarely ever use it again. That's not what we're about. It's not the kind of experience we want our customers to have. And I think when you -- I would encourage you to use an iPad mini. And I don't think you'll be using anything other than maybe another iPad or something after you do that.",165

In terms of iPad and iPhone, I don't see a component shortage gating us for the quarter in the numbers that we've given you in the guidance. I think we've solved the -- some challenges there and feel good about our position. In terms of general shortages on the iMac, we'll be constrained for the full quarter in a significant way. Part of that is that we're beginning shipping the 21.5-inch iMac in November and the 27-inch in December. And so there will be a short amount of time during the quarter to manufacture and ramp those, and I expect the demand to be robust. So we will have a significant shortage there. The others are more based on how big is big from a demand point of view, and that is very difficult to predict. But you can tell that we're extremely bullish on the demand with the revenue guidance that Peter talked about earlier. So hopefully, that answered your question.",165

I'll take the OI&E question. I will expand on Peter's remarks just a little bit. While interest income was about what we expected, foreign exchange hedging expense was higher than we expected relative to our guidance. Without getting overly detailed, dollar weakness late in the quarter and accounting rules required us to accelerate and recognize a large amount of foreign exchange premium expense related to future quarter hedges in the current quarter. All things being equal, premium expense in Q1 should be lower. This has been factored into our December OI&E guidance of $380 million.",99

But when you look at that same dynamic for the iPad, it's actually started to break down slightly over the past couple of quarters. In fact, this most recent quarter, it looks like revenues grew 3x faster than the unit growth. So I guess the question is, is this just simply the market migrating down to the sort of low end of SKU stack, or is this less accessories from an attach or dollar spend? And I have a quick follow-up.",104

I didn't quite follow your 3 times. But the iPhone ASPs were relatively flat in the September quarter year-on-year and were up slightly on a sequential basis. The iPad ASPs were down year-over-year in a low double-digit way. But this really was reflective of our price reduction on the iPad 2, the stronger dollar and a little bit of change in mix. And that's what drove the ASP change year-over-year. On a sequential basis, iPad ASPs were actually pretty flat.",83

Just in terms on the iPad minis, there's obviously been a fair of debate within Apple over the years whether to even do a smaller screen iPad. And I guess can you just speak about what you learned over the last couple of years as to why the time for that now is right, or was the technologies right? Just any insight there would be helpful. And then for Peter, my question is on gross margin. I just want to revisit it slightly in the sense that you guys have spoken about various higher-cost structures before as well and the move from, I think, the 3GS to the 4 on the iPhone. And even when the iPad, I think, was launched, in the end, what we've seen is that the scale that Apple are building, the size of revenues you're getting to, the component reuses meant do you actually very quickly got through these potential gross margin dips? Is anything structurally different this time around?",173

And let me be clear, we would not make one of the 7-inch tablets. We don't think they're good products. And we would never make one, not just because it's 7 inches but for many reasons. One of the reasons, however, is size. And so I am not sure if you saw our Keynote, but the difference in just the real estate size between the 7.9, almost 8, versus 7 is 35%. And when you look at the usable area, it's much greater than that. It's from 50% to 67%. And also, the iPad mini has the same number of pixels as the -- as iPad 2 does. And so you can -- you have access to all 275,000 apps that are in our App Store that have been custom-designed to take advantage of the full canvas. And so iPad mini is a fantastic product. It's not a compromised product like the 7-inch tablets. So it's in a whole different league.",185

And we believe that over 80% of the revenue that we will see in the December quarter will come from products that we've just introduced in the last 6 weeks. And so while having lower gross margins on a new product is not something that's new for us, what is different this time is just the sheer number of new products that we've introduced in the last 6 weeks. We just did not have that magnitude in the past. So I don't see something that's structurally different. And we'll have a big focus on wanting to make a lot of these products to get them in customers' hands as quickly as we can. But we are also going to work to try and get down the cost curves and improve manufacturing and other efficiencies as we have successfully done in the past.

We are thrilled to report the results of a tremendous quarter, generating the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We established numerous new records during the quarter, including all-time highs for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud of these results and are extremely pleased with the momentum of our business.
Revenue for the quarter was $46.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 73%. The increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, and was also aided by the inclusion of a 14th week in the quarter, which we indicated previously.
Operating margin was $17.3 billion, representing 37.4% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, increasing 118% over the prior December quarter's results, and equaling half of the net income generated in all of fiscal 2011. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $13.87.
Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new all-time quarterly record with sales of 5.2 million Macs, setting new records for both desktops and portables. Mac sales grew 26% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 0 growth for the market overall in the December quarter. While total Mac sales benefited from the 14th week, average weekly Mac sales were up strongly year-over-year across the quarter. Mac sales outgrew the market in each of our geographies with particular strength in our Asia-Pacific segment where sales were up 58% year-over-year. The increase in Mac sales was fueled by very strong growth of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as the continued strong performance of iMac. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
As we announced last month, the Mac App Store has been a great success with customers downloading over 100 million apps in less than a year. The Mac App Store offers thousands of apps in education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity, utilities and other categories, and has rapidly become a favorite shopping destination for Mac software.
Moving to our music products. We sold 15.4 million iPods compared to 19.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.
We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-forward basis. The iTunes Store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion. During the quarter, we launched iTunes music stores in Brazil as well as 27 other countries in Latin America and Europe, now offering a catalog of over 20 million songs from major recording labels, as well as thousands of independent artists. And iTunes customers were amazingly busy on December 25, generating over 140 million downloads of apps and content that day.
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 37 million iPhones compared to 16.2 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 128% year-over-year growth compared to 40% growth for the smartphone market overall in the December quarter, based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, thanks primarily to the tremendous popularity of iPhone 4S.
Customers have been captivated by Siri, which let's them use their voices to send messages, place phone calls, schedule appointments and more. Siri understands what users say, knows what they mean and helps them with everyday tasks and information requests. iPhone channel inventory increased sequentially by about 200k, leaving us with a little under 6 million iPhones in the channel at the end of the quarter, and below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks on a look-forward basis.
Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $24.4 billion during the quarter compared to $10.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 133%. Nearly all of the top companies in the Fortune 500 now approve and support iPhone on their networks. This includes companies in markets such as financial services, consumer products, transportation, healthcare and insurance.
iPhone is changing the way companies across the globe use mobile devices for work. In addition to accessing e-mail, calendar and contacts, many of these companies are developing and deploying mission-critical iPhone apps to help improve productivity and give employees secure and immediate access to information anywhere. Many companies around the world have thousands of employees using iPhone and business apps. Some new examples include Royal Dutch Shell, Credit Suisse, Kimberly-Clark, St. Jude Medical, Providian, Teradata, Nike, [indiscernible] and Facebook. We were very pleased to begin shipping iPhone 4S in China and 21 additional countries earlier this month. iPhone 4S is now available in over 90 countries, making this our fastest iPhone rollout ever.
Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with record sales of 15.4 million iPads during the December quarter compared to 7.3 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 111%. iPad was extremely popular with holiday season buyers, and we remain very excited about the potential for this market.
Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter increased by 99% year-over-year to over $9.1 billion compared to $4.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales surpassed our expectations with sell-through exceeding sell-in by about 200,000 units. We exited the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
iPad continues its unprecedented adoption in business. Nearly all of the top companies within major Fortune 500 markets including pharma, manufacturing, hospitality, consumer products, financial services, healthcare and retail are actively using iPad to improve workflows, business processes and customer engagements. We are delighted to learn how iPad enables businesses to change the way they work. Real estate agents at Coldwell Banker and Sotheby's access sales presentations and use custom iPad apps in the field. Retail chains such as Bed Bath & Beyond use iPads to deliver key business metrics on the sales floor. Wineries are using iPads in their vineyards to call up weather data and soil profiles, record quality assessments and make decisions on the spot about whether to harvest their grapes. And in this past quarter, Chinese airline, EVA, has also deployed iPads to pilots and crew for flight manuals, documentation and training. 
iPad is extremely popular with students, teachers and administrators as a wonderfully engaging and powerful tool for teaching and learning. Today, 1.5 million iPads are already in use in education institutions, including over 1,000 one-to-one deployments.
We were very pleased to announce iBooks 2 last week featuring iBook Textbooks to deliver educational content that is more interactive, current and portable than ever from leading publishers, including Houghton Mifflin, McGraw-Hill and Pearson, as well as thousands of independent publishers. And with iBooks Author, anyone with a Mac can create iBook textbooks, cookbooks, picture books and more, and publish them to Apple's iBook Store. And over 600,000 copies of iBooks Author have already been downloaded since last Thursday's announcement.
We were also happy to announce the all-new iTunes U App last week, allowing students using iPads to have access to the world's largest catalog of free educational content, along with over 20,000 education apps and hundreds of thousands of books in the iBookstore that can be used in their school curriculum. And as of today, over 3 million copies of iTunes U App have already been downloaded.
Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 315 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 62 million in the December quarter. We were very pleased to launch iOS 5 and iCloud during the quarter. Customers are loving the new features of iOS 5, including Notification Center, iMessage and Reminders. And iCloud is off to a great start with more than 85 million customers signed up as of today. With iCloud, customers can store their music and photos and documents and keep their personal information and content in sync across all their devices, automatically and seamlessly.
The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 550,000 apps available, including 170,000 apps specifically for iPad. We are thrilled that by the end of this month, our developers will have earned over $4 billion cumulatively from App Store sales, including over $700 million in the December quarter alone. 
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record results. Revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% over the prior year. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, establishing new records for all 3. iPhone sales were extremely robust, more than doubling year-over-year thanks primarily to the very successful launch of the iPhone 4S.
Sales of iPad were also up significantly year-over-year, thanks to continued strength of iPad 2 and strong holiday season buying. The stores also sold 1.1 million Macs compared to 851,000 in the year-ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.
We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including our spectacular new store at Grand Central, as well as 3 stores in Europe, bringing us to a total of 361 stores. With an average of 358 stores open, average revenue per store was $17.1 million compared to $12 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 43%.
Segment margin reached a new record of over $1.8 billion and 30.3% of retail revenue compared to $1 billion and 26.2% in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic reached new record levels with 110 million visitors compared to 76 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 45%. That translates to an average of almost 22,000 visitors per store per week, reflecting incredible interest in our stores and our products.
Our EasyPay checkout process has significantly enhanced our ability to handle such high customer traffic levels. And now, with personal pick up, customers can order Macs, iPods or iPads from the Apple online store and pick up most in-stock products within 1 hour at the Apple Retail Store of their choice, making shopping for Apple products that much easier and faster.
Total company gross margin was 44.7%, which was 470 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference was driven by lower commodity and other product costs. Another quarter was due to leverage on the higher revenue and some onetime items benefiting the quarter. And the remainder was due to better-than-expected mix largely from the record iPhone sales.
Operating expenses were $3.36 billion, and included $357 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $137 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.25%.
Turning to our cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $81.6 billion at the end of September quarter, a sequential increase of $16 billion. About $64 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter.
Cash flow from operations was over $17.5 billion. We are actively discussing uses of our cash balance and don't have anything specific to announce today. In the meantime, we continue to be very disciplined with the cash and are not letting it burn a hole in our pockets.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, which will be 13-week quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
We expect revenue to be about $32.5 billion, compared to $24.7 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 42%, reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.05 billion, including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation.
We expect OI&E to be about $125 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.50.
In closing, we are extremely pleased with customer response to our products and the record-breaking results in the December quarter. We launched iPhone 4S to rave reviews, delivered iOS and iCloud to millions of customers and surpassed all previous records for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud to be delivering the strongest product lineup in Apple's history and we are extremely enthusiastic about our new product pipeline.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",2141

We were thrilled with the 37 million iPhones that we sold. It's up 128% against a market rate of growth of about 40%, according to IDC's latest projection. And this is substantially above the 20 million unit previous record. We would attribute it to a -- just a breathtaking customer reception of the iPhone 4S with iOS 5, and key features such as Siri and this incredible camera with advanced optics. Customers are absolutely loving this product. We also attribute it to -- we made a very bold bet entering the quarter as to what the demand would be. And as it turns out, despite it being a very bold bet, we were short of supply throughout the quarter and did end with a significant backlog as Peter has said. That situation has improved some since the end of the quarter, but we still are short in some key geographies currently. I would also attribute the performance to the delayed purchases from the prior quarter as we discussed in the October call as the -- people were anticipating a new iPhone being announced. I think we made the correct decision to go with a broad range of iPhones. It turned out to be a benefit as we thought it would. And of course, the 14th week, as Peter said, is a part of this, although everyone knew that, as we did as well, and factored that into our guidance. Geographically, we saw strength in literally in every key region. But in particular, I would call out that U.S. and Japan, which got billing early in the quarter and had most sale -- many more sales days than most countries. I would also say that was particularly huge with the iPhone sales in Greater China, particularly considering that we did not launch the iPhone 4S in China until in January. And therefore, had no sales into mainland China during last quarter. And so we could not be happier. We felt we were betting bold, as I think many of you would have thought if you would have known what we were doing. But as it turns out, we didn't bet high enough. Our customers are loving iPhone and we're very happy with that.",377

Tim, can you talk about whether the pent-up demand at the end of December and today -- is both countries like U.S. and Japan that had the phone all quarter? Or is it just countries that recently received and are able to sell the phone? So if can you talk about that, and then the second part would be, does the component environment and your production capacity or your suppliers' capacity allow you to start to address that catch-up demand, address China, which is new this quarter, and also help you start to rebuild inventory in March? Or are there any constraints that you see in the near term?",117

But I would -- given that we just launched in China, I would say the demand there has been staggering. We are selling through our reseller stores and our online store. We're not currently selling through a retail store. And the demand is off the charts. And so we're very happy with the demand response there. The other countries that we launched in earlier this quarter were smaller countries in a demand sense. And so we'll see how the quarter goes from a supply-demand point of view. We did make progress as we moved from the end of the quarter until now, as I alluded to earlier, and got caught up in some countries, but there is still some that we are not caught up. So we'll see how we'll do going forward.
In terms of the component environment, generally speaking, the component environment is favorable. That was one of the things that allowed us to overachieve on gross margin. And we would predict that, that component environment stays favorable on most key commodities with the exception of hard drives which, as you know, was very much affected by the tragic situation in Thailand. And I don't predict Apple having a material supply issue during the quarter, but we will pay more for drives during the quarter. And that's reflected in our guidance that Peter gave earlier.",249

And then for the December quarter, you obviously -- you saw some pretty dramatic declines in key components like NAND, down about 10% and DRAM down almost 40%. Can you talk about, within that context, how favorable you expect pricing to be for some of those key commodities here on the March quarter and whether the overall industry shortage of HDDs is having a material impact on pricing and other categories?",72

Last quarter -- not confirming the percentages that you gave out, but we did receive better costs than we had rolled in our guidance on -- particularly on displays and NAND Flash and DRAM. And we would expect that NAND, DRAM and most LCDs would continue to be in a position that supply exceeds demand for the industry, and therefore those price trends should continue to be favorable in this quarter and we reflected that in our guidance. The big exception is the hard drive, which I pointed out earlier, which is constrained on an industry-wide basis, and where I believe we can navigate the supply issue that we are paying more for them and that's rolled in our guidance.",121

I'd like to just talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance to put the component environment in context. We do see that helping us sequentially in the March quarter. But overall, we would anticipate our gross margin to be down by about 270 basis points.

I have a question on the iPad. Obviously, a very strong shipment number for the December quarter. But with that said, did you see any impact at all from some of the new lower-priced tablets in the market? And I guess looking forward into 2012, how do you think about competition from the lower-priced content, subsidized tablets like that of Amazon's models in 2012?",66
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3562.0,1697859.0,66762554.0,Answer,Timothy Cook,,Executives,22,"We're really happy with the 15.4 million iPads that we were able to sell. And as Peter said, we did take down the channel inventory slightly. There's the -- underlying sell through was slightly higher than that. This is consistent with our long-term beliefs that we've had since -- before we introduced the product, that this is a huge opportunity for Apple over time. And as I've said before, I truly believe, and many others in the company believe, that there will come a day that the tablet market and units is larger than the PC market. In fact, it's interesting to note that in the U.S., it's clear from the IDC's recent data on desktop PCs in the U.S., that tablets exceeded desktop PC sales last quarter in the U.S. And so I think you can already see different indicators that there is significant momentum in this space. In terms of our competitiveness, the ecosystem for iPad is in a class by itself. We strongly believed in optimizing applications from day one to take advantage of the larger canvas, and we now have apps totaling over 170,000 available for customers. And that compares to what appears to us to be only a few hundred for the competition. And so I think people really want to do multiple things with their tablets. And therefore, we don't really see these limited function tablets and e-readers being in the same category. There is clearly customers that will buy those. I think they'll sell a fair number of units. But I don't think that people that want an iPad will settle for a limited function.
And in terms of other tablets, last year was supposed to be the year of the tablet. I think most people would agree, it was the year of the iPad for the second year in a row. And so we're just going to continue to innovate like crazy in this area. And we think we can continue to compete with anyone that is currently shipping tablets or that might enter in the future.",346

And I know in the past, you've talked about the iPhone and the prepaid market that sort of an evolving strategy that you all were approaching with sort of an open mind.

And so we're glad to cover the broad range with great products. But the iPhone 4S was clearly the most popular among those. In the postpaid markets, as you know, there's a much smaller difference between what the customer pays in each of these. It's larger in the prepaid markets, and so it's too early to tell given we just started this October as to how this will play out over time.

They are the loss of leverage from the revenue, so we reported $46.3 billion this quarter, which included a 14th week. We see our revenues being $32.5 billion next quarter. So against our fixed cost that will have a significant impact. We did have some onetime items in the December quarter which won't recur, and the dollar is much stronger. So those are the principal 3 reasons. I would also say that 44.7 is a high, high, higher than we have seen since I've been with Apple in 15 years. And it's hard to compare this year versus last because we're in different commodity cycles and different currency levels and where we are with our product cycles as well. Last year, we did have a sequential increase in iPhones, and that was a big contributor to our going up sequentially. We don't see that reoccurring  this year, especially from the high of $44.7 billion.",171

It's solved a lot of problems that customers were having and made their lives incredible, much, much easier.

We added carriers last quarter with KDDI in Japan and Sprint in the United States. And both of those carriers, they can speak for their own results, but we are extremely pleased with both companies, and while the incumbents that were in the market also did incredibly well.

And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about your revenue guidance for the March quarter. If you assume kind of weekly sales are adjust for the 14th week, it looks like you're guiding revenue down to about 25% quarter-on-quarter. However, you started the quarter with a pretty significant backlog of iPhones, et cetera, pretty strong momentum. Why would revenue be down more than normal seasonal or just historical seasonal end of March?",74
24937.0,"Apple Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Apple Inc.,3562.0,1697859.0,66762580.0,Answer,Peter Oppenheimer,,Executives,48,"Chris, this is Peter, I'll take that. Let me first start with units and then I'll talk about some points on revenue. iPhone, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase and be down sequentially, as we reported from the 14-week December quarter. For iPad, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase, and also be down sequentially as reported from the 14-week December quarter and the end of the gift-giving season. And for Mac and iPod, we would expect to be down sequentially consistent with our typical seasonality. From a revenue perspective, I completely understand the question that you're asking, and I want to talk to you about 5 reasons why I expect the -- us to be down in greater percent sequentially this year than we were last.
The first, the December quarter this year included a 14th week, which was the week between Christmas and New Year's. That week accounted for approximately 1/14 of the December quarter's revenue. Second, that week between Christmas and New Year's, fell within the March quarter last year and it will not be included this year. And sales in that week are typically greater than the average for the weekly sales in the March quarter. So when we think about our March quarter on a sequential basis, we would have loved to add that week in the quarter that we're now heading into. Last year, we increased the iPhone channel inventory by about 1.7 million units in the December quarter, so -- or this March quarter, so that benefited the quarter and reduced the comparable. The fourth, our December quarter results this fiscal year benefited from the launch of the iPhone 4S. We believe there were significant pent-up demand for the iPhone 4S heading into the December quarter, and it's been our fastest iPhone rollout ever. The previous iPhone launch took place at the end of June 2010. So in the year-ago December quarter marked the second full quarter of new iPhone availability. So we have some differences in launch timing. And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent weeks, particularly against the euro, and we expect this to have an impact on our sequential compare. Last year, the dollar was relatively flat within the comparable time period. All that being said, we just reported an amazing quarter and we feel very good about the momentum of our business.",400

I take the point of your focus in China, but it's also like -- I think if given what you said, you may be at 230 or 235 carriers now. There's about 500 carriers in the world, and I was wondering what your ambitions are and what you think the reality is over the next 12 to 18 months of I think at least a sizable share of them. And I had similar question on geographic expansion, Tim, just in terms of country rollout, you seem to have at least addressed part of China on the retail side, and it sounds like Brazil is next. But when can we look forward, Tim, you maybe addressing markets like India or Russia more aggressively with your retail presence?",139

We're selling in Russia through carrier partners and reseller partners. And we're selling in India through some carrier partners and reseller partners. And so we're in all of those countries today. But I've tried to be very clear in the past, and I'll do so again, that we have a ton more energy in the China market today. That doesn't mean that there is a lack of effort or focus on the others. It just means that it's less than what we're investing in China today.
On the second country on the list of those 4, for us, would be Brazil. I think there's a huge opportunity for us there, and we've more than begun to go deeper into Brazil. But I don't want to signal that, that means that Apple Retail would be there, because I don't envision that occurring in the near term. In India where it is small, the revenue went up over 3x last quarter, but that's on a small base. And so we're beginning to see traction in most of these, but we recognize we have to focus to deeply understand the point that we can really get to a large revenue figure like Greater China currently is.
In terms of more carriers, we have been adding carriers. I anticipate we'll continue to add carriers. We have nothing specific to announce today, but you can bet that we're looking at the same list that you are. In terms of major carriers there, the number is much smaller than the number you quoted, as you know, there is a lot of smaller carriers on there. And the same thing with countries, there's many smaller countries. But all of those are important, I'd like to get into all of them over time.",314

Obviously, the iPhone was scintillating in terms of the growth, but I think the iPad growth also really outpaced a lot of our expectations. And the question really is -- it's kind of a loaded question. The question is really around -- do you think that Apple actually benefited from some of these lower cost, reduced features that tablets come into the market, where folks came in to check them out and realized not really that good, so they trade up to the iPad? And do you see that may be happening as well with the MacBook Air this year? Because this year seems like to be the ultrabook's version of ""Let's try to be like Apple as well.""",130

And I wouldn't, in my view, there wasn't an obvious effect on the numbers plus or minus. The theory that you've got, I have heard clearly from some customers that, that occurred, that they went in thinking that they would buy that, they'd look at it and decided to buy an iPad. Whether that's happening on a very, very large basis, I don't know. Again, my own view is looking at our data in the U.S., there was no obvious change in the data, for what it's worth. That's how I see it. There is cannibalization clearly of the Mac by the iPad, but we continue to believe there is much more cannibalization of Windows PCs by the iPad and there's many more of them to cannibalize. And so we love that trend. We think it's great for us. The thing that is very different about the iPad is you can see it beginning to appear virtually everywhere. The enterprise has adopted it in a very large percent of the Fortune 500, as Peter talked about earlier. That number is also quite large when you look at the Global 500. In education, in K-12, we sold twice the number of iPads as we did Macs. And generally speaking, education adopts new technologies fairly slowly, so that's somewhat surprising. And of course, the consumer is -- has moved in a huge way to iPad. And so it's winning market by market, by market. I think that consumers that go in and look at it and think about the ecosystem and the huge advantages and the overall customer experience, I think we will win a fair number of those. And I think you can see that in the results. And so we couldn't be happier with doing over 15 million. And I think it's remarkable that we sold over 55 million iPads, and we've only been in the business April of 2011, I think, when we shipped the first one -- or 2010, excuse me.",353

And the iPad moves after the iPhone. And in several accounts, we've seen the Mac follow that. And so there are clear examples where one product has pulled the other. And at a macro level, how much it's happening, it's very difficult to put our fingers on, but many customers, consumers, enterprise, education, they're all pointing that out. And as you know, we've seen that phenomenon before with the halo that the iPod created for the Mac back at the early 2002, 2003, 2004 range. And so it's not a phenomenon that is new to us.",114

The Mac has outgrown the market for over 20 quarters in a row, but still has a single-digit percentage of the worldwide market, where iOS, if you look at phones and tablets, and the iPod touch, we've sold over 315 million iOS devices. And so I think this compares very favorable to any comparison, and over 62 million of those were done in the last quarter alone. I don't have comparable numbers, Mike, on Android. I haven't found a way to get very crisp quarterly reporting like we do that is straightforward and transparent. However, you can see from a momentum point of view, if you look at the MPD data that just came out a few days ago, it shows in the U.S., and this is just looking at October, November and so this had part of our launch in October and then all of it in November, it shows that just the iPhones, looking at phones not total iOS, it shows iPhone at 43% and Android at 47%. The Nielsen data that just came out a few days ago shows iPhone in the October, November, December timeframe at 45% versus Android at 47%. And the comScore data that also came out on October, November shows iPhone at 42% versus Android at 41%. And so it seems like all of the data that I've seen in the U.S. would say that it's a very close race in iPhone.
I think on the iPad side, although I don't have specific numbers to share from third parties, I think that all of us inherently believe that iPad is way ahead there. And there's really no comparable products to the iPod touch out there. And so iOS is doing extremely well. I wouldn't say it's 2-horse race. There's a horse in Redmond that always suits up and always runs, and will keep running. And there's other players that we can never count out. And so what we focus on is innovating and making the world's best products. And we'll just keep on doing that and somewhat ignore how many horses there are. And we just want to stay ahead and be the lead one.",373
