Starting this quarter, we are providing written CFO commentary, which will contain additional information regarding AMD's results and outlook and can be found on the IR section of AMD's website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com. Participants on today's conference call are Thomas Seifert, our Chief Financial Officer and interim CEO; and Rick Bergman, Senior Vice President and General Manager, AMD's Product Group. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number for the replay is (888)266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703)925-2533. The access code for both is 1502479. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening. I would like to highlight a few dates for you this afternoon. Thomas will present at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on the 16th of February in San Francisco and our first quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, March 18. 
On December 27, AMD announced that starting with the first fiscal quarter of 2011, the company will begin accounting for its investment in GLOBALFOUNDRIES under the cost method of accounting and will no longer recognize any share of GLOBALFOUNDRIES' net income or loss and its statements of operation. The transition to cost-based accounting was triggered by the contribution of Chartered Semiconductor to GLOBALFOUNDRIES and amendments to certain agreements. 
As a result of the contribution, AMD's ownership of the newly combined entity on a fully diluted basis is approximately 14%. Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call is included in our financial tables that accompany our earnings release available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com. 
Before we begin today's call, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. 
The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast especially in light of the current state of the economy. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our most recent SEC filings, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 25, 2010. Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Thomas.",445

Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to thank Dirk Meyer for his leadership as AMD's CEO over the past two and a half years. Indeed, he leaves behind a much stronger company than the one he inherited heard, a much nimbler AMD with the people, the IP and the spirit to fully realize the breadth of opportunities in front of us. 
As you know, AMD announced last week that our Board has formed a CEO search committee led by Bruce Claflin, Executive Chairman of AMD's Board of Directors. The Board has retained an executive search firm to assist with this process. The search is obviously a priority and the committee is moving the process forward to ensure that we select a person with the right vision, experience and track record to lead AMD into the future and to create increased shareholder value over time. 
While we don't plan on communicating further until the search process has concluded, we will update you should events warrant. That being said, we are here to focus on our fourth quarter and full year earnings results. 2010 was an important year for AMD. It was a year in which we achieved many of our major milestones, resulting in a company with solid momentum and well positioned for the opportunities immediately ahead. 
First, we demonstrated that our  fabulous business model works, restructuring our balance sheet and reducing our overall debt by $400 million excluding GLOBALFOUNDRIES, improving our 2010 non-GAAP gross margin by nine percentage points over the prior year, and generating $553 million in non-GAAP operating income and $355 million in adjusted free cash flow in 2010. 
Second, we showed that our execution engine is on track, delivering Bulldozer, our impressive new x86 core designed to bring a new level of performance and performance-per-watt capability across the full spectrum of clients and servers, taking a clear leadership position in discrete graphics, having shipped over 35 million DX11-enabled GPUs to date. 
And introducing the first of our AMD Fusion family, which for the first time combines our expertise in x86 computing and graphics into a single new architecture, arguably the most significant advancement in processor architecture in decades. And third, we proved that we have indeed changed the game. We made graphics matter, irreversibly shifting the focus of the industry to a more balanced combination of CPUs and increasingly robust graphics capability. 
And we introduced a new category, the accelerated processing unit or APU, changing the trajectory of processor design and development from here forward. Focusing more specifically on the fourth quarter, industry momentum for Fusion is strong and growing. OEM adoption of Brazos is excellent. We shipped more than 1 million Brazos platforms in its debut quarter to world class OEMs including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba. 
Brazos' technical performance is superb, offering a unique combination of [indiscernible]  ADP HD video and all-day battery life. At CES, Brazos-based notebooks received several significant innovation awards, including Laptop Magazine's Editor's Choice Award. Our AMD Fusion software ecosystem is maturing rapidly with key partners such as Adobe, Arcsoft, Corel, CyberLink, DivX and Microsoft, announcing applications optimized for AMD Fusion APUs. 
And finally, customers are discovering that Brazos is ideal for more than notebook platforms, earning design wins in everything from tablets to Internet ready set top boxes, thin clients and point-of-sale kiosks. On the technology side, we have entered a new phase with our 32-nanometer RAM and are now sampling thousands of nano products to a wide variety of OEMs and ODMs as they prepare for production in Q2. 
We have begun sampling our 32-nanometer Bulldozer-based Orochi parts in volume with customers worldwide. We expect Orochi for desktops to ship in production in early summer and the Orochi for servers in late summer. Turning to the fourth quarter financial summary. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.565 (sic) [1.65] billion, up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2010. We reported non-GAAP net income of $106 million and a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.14. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $141 million. Fourth quarter gross margin was 45%, down one percentage point from the prior quarter, at the high-end, however, of our target model for the year of 40% to 45%. Operating expenses continue to hit within our target model. R&D was $352 million and SG&A was $250 million for the quarter. 
Total operating expenses came in at $602 million, slightly less than the guided $610 million. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $241 million, down $4 million sequentially, and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $11 million, down $80 million from the prior quarter. 
Now switching to the business segments. In our Computing Solutions segment, fourth quarter revenue was $1.22 billion, flat sequentially and operating income was $91 million. In the Graphic segment, revenue for the quarter was $424 million. The sequential growth of 9% was mainly due to first double-digit growth unit sales through the AIB channel due to the success of our second generation DX11 enabled GPUs, the AMD Radeon HD 6800 and 6900 series, as well as seasonally higher game console revenue. 
Operating income for the Graphic segment was $68 million. Turning our attention to the outlook. The following statements concerning AMD are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially from current expectations. For the first quarter of 2011, AMD expects revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $650 million due to an extra week in the first quarter and a separation payment of about $12 million to Dirk Meyer. 
Tax is expected to be approximately $4 million. In my first days in my new role, I've never been more confident in this company and our capacity to succeed. We have world-class people with a propensity for solving the world's most difficult technical challenges and the passion to see the next cycle of innovation come to fruition. I really want to thank them for their commitment and achievement over the past year. 
We have unparalleled assets starting with the strongest combination of x86 and graphics technology in the world, a business model now much more attuned to embrace industry shifts and a loyal and expanding group of customers and partners all looking for AMD to succeed. And we have solid gross margin expansion opportunities. We're just beginning to launch some of the most exciting products into the sweet spots of our portfolio. 
Our products are aimed to some of the largest most established margin pools in the industry and we have lots of headroom in which to grow. My priorities and those of the company are clear. We must stay the course of execution in delivering what we promised. We will, however, increase the pace of converting our significant potential into shareholder value and we will embrace the changes in the market where our prospects for success look good. 
In summary, we will continue to both execute our leadership strategy and generate increasing momentum for our customers, our shareholders and ourselves. And at this point, I would like to turn it back to Ruth.",1186

I think we entered this year with tremendous momentum coming out of CES and seeing the excitement for their first Fusion products, bringing really computing graphics performance to a form factor that had not seen that before and our customers excited by that and they are excited by the battery life that goes along with it. We have a terrific roadmap this year ahead of us, I mentioned it. We're looking forward to ship Llano products and Orochi products in the site. And this really focuses the organization pretty much. There will be opportunities that are incremental to that, that we will have to look at but for the near-term, it's really making sure that the focus stays on execution, that we accelerate the pace with which we look at some of the opportunities, especially when it comes to margin expansion. And then also consider that there are the changes that we have been talking about over the last year that we have enabled in this new AMD business model really work to our strengths. We are now an IP generating company. We're focused there the company where the strength always was designing and innovating great products and bringing them to the market in an efficient manner, that will be the near-term priority. And then we will be able to, based on that, think incrementally on where other opportunities are that make us successful.",248

Can you frame for us how we should think about the OpEx going forward for the year in terms of the shape of the OpEx? Is it going to be -- how it turns sequentially is what I'm trying to get a feel for. And separately, given that you are guiding for a fairly flattish revenue outlook, should we assume a fairly flattish gross margin or are there other puts and takes for the beginning of the first quarter?",104
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2011",2011-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3173.0,93549.0,6537085.0,Answer,Thomas Seifert,,Executives,15,"So you really should look at operating expense guidance for the first quarter really in a flattish way. If you take out the additional week and correct for the separate payment, and keep in mind that our guidance for the fourth quarter last year was around $610 million, OpEx development in the first quarter is rather flattish. I think we have shown in the past that we managed the company in a very disciplined way when it comes to operating expenses and we have no intent to change that. The gross margin question is a good question. We see in the current quarter some ups and downs, of course, we will see gross margin opportunities just because of product mix and Fusion launches. However, we also will see some headwinds because of the significant ramp of 32-nanometer capacity. The ups and downs probably equal each other out so I would assume around a flattish gross margin development in the first quarter.",161

Your small rival from across town is expecting low- to mid-teens if I remember correctly. And the second question is on the GPU side, last quarter you guys had talked about meaningful share losses to NVIDIA. This time around, is it just market drilled or it shouldn't appear that? Share losses should abate in one quarter, so just some more perspective on that please.",73

We were excited by the response of our new product launch in the Graphic segment. We launched two high-end products that certainly caused excitement and revenue flow. And that were driving the performance of the company. If I -- Rick, you could go into more detail.",70

We're the leaders in the DX11 category and we just launched an entirely new second generation both on the desktop and notebook side. We have obviously or had 62% share in the third quarter.

If you look at the ecosystem that supports us, GLOBALFOUNDRIES just announced a investment of more than $5 billion this year. They're our second largest provider of manufacturing capacity. TSMC gave guidance of around $6 billion. So in terms of manufacturing infrastructure and scale, we are supported by a really substantial ecosystem also and that makes us pretty confident moving forward. And then I think we discussed those issues at length. We are moving into an environment where people do not buy processor frequency anymore. But look at what capability the products deliver. And I think we have demonstrated now, with our launch of the Brazos platform and at CES, what kind of a experience we can deliver in this form factor. And we are really looking forward to the Llano launch in summer to put things into perspective.",151

The impact that this will have are, of course, were part of the guidance we gave at our Analyst Day in November of last year.

We saw some price deterioration in the quarter because it was a very consumer-driven quarter in terms of demand. We also managed, I hope you saw that, our inventory in a very good way. But that also meant that we had some -- -- a higher degree of underutilization in the factory in placement [ph].   We are still in obligation to pick that up.

I mean one of the areas where we've seen AMD especially when the results just reported you had weak server ASPs, and what I found that if you look at Intel's numbers, servers was probably one of the strongest that they had. So question here is what are you doing to kind of start to regain traction specially, as you now about to launch new processor architectures? Is there anything you'd change from an execution standpoint to make sure that you will be able to get more traction within this market? That's the first question. And also if you can talk about what you see as underlying growth expectations for servers through 2011, that will be helpful.",126

This is one of the areas where we see significant room for improvement and that is one of the areas I would like to being referred to when we talk about picking up the pace.

I apologize if you answered this earlier, but on the strength of selling GPU, what is your sense about attach rates in this kind of big platform? Because one of the big question's obviously how attach rates for graphics will fare as we see more AP-type products through 2011. So we've seen some strong numbers this quarter, which probably suggests that you took fairly nice market share [ph], good attach rates.

But at the end of the day, AMD wins whether it's a Fusion processor or a discrete GPU. Now saying that, what we've seen on attach rates is they're basically the same as they've been in 2010.

As you ramp this new -- as you start to ramp the 32 nanometers, what is the focus? Is it market share gain or gross margin optimization? Can you do both? And does this new pricing model allow you to do both?",58

However, in that case, in that instance, both things come together because a strong expansion of our Llano ramp will allow us to grow into market segment and product SKUs that allow us to command a higher price performance.

I think what we can say, however, is just looking at the product roadmap and what we have been delivering with Brazos shows us that if we continue to develop products with ever lower power consumption while at the same time delivering really superior graphics and processing performance, that we can address applications that are outside of market segments that we currently serve and we will entertain that.",81

I've been in the PC industry 20-plus years, we really struggled to get into the living room and it's clear that tablets are finding their way into the living room, a real consumer experience.

Your products from a power standpoint right now probably aren't ready for the tablets-based. There a lot of other competitors there. The margins might not be as attractive, and overall the opportunity's probably smaller. And frankly, I'm glad to hear that the Llano looks like it's on the way but you're not done executing on what's in front of you right now.

There is no deviation from the near-term priorities within the company. Focus on execution and delivering the promises and the guidance we gave is the top priority for the company and that's my top priority. So let there be no doubt. The question on the future outlook, it shortened in what was reported. I think the discussion was more than just a tablet strategy. The mobility discussion, as well as clients, as well as an infrastructure question. And it was also a topic that you've heard from the press that we talked about picking up the pace for the company and addressing some of the near-term opportunities that we have to improve our profitability in a more aggressive manner.

Participants on today's conference call are Thomas Seifert, our Chief Financial Officer and Interim CEO; and Rick Bergman, Senior Vice President and General Manager of AMD's Product Group. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number is (888) 266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703) 925-2533. The access code for both is 1522169. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening. 
This is the first quarter AMD is accounting for GLOBALFOUNDRIES under the cost method, and AMD's ownership of GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 12% as of the end of the first quarter. Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed today is included in the financial tables accompanying our earnings release available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com. Written executive commentary, which contains additional information regarding AMD's result is posted on AMD's website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com. 
I would also like to highlight a few dates of interest for you. Thomas will present at the JPMorgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on the 17th of May in Boston. Our second quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 17. And we will announce our second quarter earnings on Thursday, July 21. 
Before we begin today's call, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. 
The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast especially in light of the current state of the economy. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our most recent SEC filing, AMD's annual report on Form 10-K for the quarter ended December 25, 2010.

AMD's performance in the first quarter of 2011 were solid. We launched the first of our revolutionary AMD Fusion APU platforms based on our low-power Brazos processors, and we're pleased to report excellent OEM adoption and sell through to end users.  In the first full quarter of availability, roughly half of our notebook shipments were based on Brazos, a product rapidly gaining credit for redefining the user experience in both the Netbook and Thin & Light notebook segment. 
We also began shipping Llano for revenue on the first quarter, and it is very simply, the most impressive processor in history, featuring a modern graphics architecture. Llano gives mainstream PC users something they've never had before, a brilliant digital experience coupled with AllDay battery life. It delivers a better end-user experience than anything else on the market and our customers have told us that. 
You should expect to see Llano-based systems widely available in this quarter. Beyond its unique performance characteristics, Fusion is also a key part of our overall profitability strategy. We delivered on our top line guidance. We were right on target with our non-GAAP gross margin guidance at 45% and we managed operating expenses carefully. As a result, we delivered solid free cash flow in the period. 
In the commercial market, improving performance in our Embedded and Professional Graphics segments was masked by continued softness in our overall Server business. While disappointed with our top line trajectory in the Server business, we've taken a number of steps that we believe should lead to improved results in the second half of the year. 
First, we have on-boarded a larger team of experienced customer account engineers who are now engaged with customers. In addition, we are working more closely with our OEMs and ODMs to drive the new AMD-based systems into the hands of key cloud virtualization customers. And finally, we continued on track to ship Bulldozer-based server platforms towards the end of the summer. Our new Bulldozer core delivers substantial improvements in floating-point performance in a platform featuring superior memory utilization and I/O throughput. 
In Graphics, we continued to advance our leadership in a number of important ways. First, we launched the HD 6990, truly the world's fastest graphic card. Second, we set an all-time record for mobile discrete revenue. And third, we are now the exclusive provider of discrete graphics solutions for Apple's iMac and MacBook Pro platforms. In short, we believe that we continue to gain market share in the mobile GPUs in the quarter.  Our continued leadership in discrete graphics and our exciting new Fusion APUs prove the world's best PCs have AMD Radeon graphics on board. 
Turning to our first quarter financial summary. First quarter revenue was $1.61 billion, a 2% sequential decline and within the guided range for the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $56 million or $0.08 per share calculated using 740 million fully diluted shares. Among other adjustments, it excludes a noncash gain of $492 million related to the dilution of our equity interest in GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 
Non-GAAP operating income was $92 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 45% and flat quarter-over-quarter. Lower than anticipated 32-nanometer manufacturing costs and the ramp of margin-accretive APUs offset the negative impact of seasonally lower game console revenues, lower ASPs and the weaker product mix in legacy microprocessor products. Operating expenses for the quarter came in below the guided range of approximately $650 million due to tight expense management. R&D was $360 million and SG&A was $261 million.  Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million, down $43 million from the prior quarter. 
Now switching to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. We are excited about our APU platforms, which are gaining traction in the market. We tripled unit shipments over the prior quarter. In addition, we started shipping Llano, our high-end APU late in the first quarter.  Computing Solutions operating income was a $100 million, up $9 million from the previous quarter primarily due to improved gross margins from a higher mix of APU sales compared to the prior quarter. 
Graphic segment revenue was $430 million, down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to a seasonally driven decline in game console revenue. Graphic segment operating income was $19 million, down $49 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily due to seasonally lower game console revenue. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $1.75 billion. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $797 million, down $171 million, primarily due to the timing of sales during the quarter. 
Inventory was $648 million exiting the quarter, and long-term debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $154 million, up $143 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 due to higher non-GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. 
Turning to the outlook. The following statements concerning AMD are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially from current expectations. For the second quarter of 2011, AMD expects second quarter revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially. Operating expenses are expected to be $620 million. 
As mentioned in the last call, our priorities remain clear. I said, we would stay the course of execution and we continue to do so, bolstering our discrete graphic leadership, tripling unit shipments of our first APU Brazos and shipping Llano for revenue in the quarter. I said we would increase our pace, and in addition to meeting or exceeding all of our major engineering commitment, we've launched a number of key cross-functional initiatives designed to improve productivity and scalability, optimize our go-to-market activities, improve R&D productivity and generate greater supply-chain efficiencies. 
To close, we know we have the best IP portfolio in the Processor business, and with our new Fusion APUs and Bulldozer on the way, with our strongest product portfolio in the company's history and we have a business model tuned for agility and profitability. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication, creativity and commitment to delivering on our commitment. 
Before we turn it back to Ruth for the Q&A, I would like to make a brief comment on the state of the CEO search at AMD. The Board is very happy with the interest we have received and is actively interviewing candidates. And we are pleased with our progress to date. Ruth?",1084

I think, I said in the last couple of calls that our expectation is around 11% for PC growth for this year. And to be very honest, at this point in time, we don't see a reason to deviate very much from that opinion. And actually, data is moving more towards the feel we had on the market for some time now. You can discuss, whether it's now 10.5% or 10.7% or 11%, but we don't see any reason to deviate from that expectation for this year.",91

And then perhaps, as a follow-up, on Llano, where we understand the volume is coming in the third quarter, one question that comes up a lot is how compelling to the consumer will your advantage in graphics be?

So just to be clear, the volume is actually coming in Q2. So certainly, we expect to ramp the production in that platforms launched on Llano. I think the best answer to your question is the success we've seen with our Brazos platform. It was just fantastic success in Q1, and our OEMs are now really onboard with bringing even a better, more-compelling, higher-performance solution with Llano. And to a certain degree, we hear the reception around, that great visual graphics video experience even from our competitor, and how important that is in the marketplace.

So I guess, the first point is, is that accurate?

So you heard right, 50% was the share we had in the first quarter. I think the implication for gross margin in the second quarter are that gross margin is going to be up quarter-over-quarter. And we will see a balanced impact on ASP performance because, as you know, while highly margin-accretive, Brazos ships at a lower price point, and we have to see how the mix is going to balance itself out flat as today, a very good assumption, but with gross margins moving upwards.",91

That's great. And then I want to ask another question, which is, you sort of talked about some progress you're making or some growth you saw in emerging markets.

Obviously, we have much greater success in the consumer market and to a certain degree, our focus. However, the value proposition on Llano is strong as an example in the corporate market as well. Now certainly, video playback, video conferencing, all those factors are becoming more and more important in the corporate environment. In addition, of course, as we're seeing, consumer devices and notebooks and desktops and so on are increasingly being also used in the commercial marketplace. Certainly in SMB but even in enterprise. Now they are adopting those consumer platforms.",96

People appreciate, of course, that we have significantly higher visibility in the marketplace, not only in terms of feet on the street, but also in terms of trying to get the lion's share.

And I guess, given that the server continues to be an area of weakness, I wonder if you can help you understand the relative size of servers in the revenue line and the profit line, and what you think the trend will look like going into the second quarter? And I guess, more importantly, at what point will Bulldozer start to be a positive impact? Is it really a this-year event or do we have to start thinking about 2012?",101

So I'm not going to get more granular in terms of the revenue lines. But I think it's fair to say that we pretty much -- I think, we stabilized market share in the first quarter on the Server segment. And we will see Bulldozer impact in terms of revenue in the second half as early. We said we would start to ship product in the summer, and that means that we see revenue in the third and, of course, in the fourth quarter.",85

So, of course, we are really proud that we are able to keep this technology lead. Moving forward, we have climbed to a high level on the market share side. The focus is now to make sure that profitability moves in the right corner too -- I think, that is going to be the focus moving forward. For this year, we expect attach rates not to change. Early, there was indications that in the first quarter it might have even gone up, which is also partly reflected in our strong mobile GPU shipments. Moving forward, we'll see that at least at the low end of the graphics pack level, there will be some replacement because especially in our side, the APU performance is really compelling. But for this year, attach rate seemed to be holding up or maybe even ticking up slightly.",145

So in some cases, the market just won't need to add an additional GPU. But on other platforms out there, certainly, if you're buying a $600, $700 notebook, you want the latest and greatest GPU architecture, which today, is defined by DX11 solutions. And so in that case, you're going to have to add discrete graphics. And that's actually pulling up the attach rate on the other platforms.

So I think for the second quarter, it's fair to expect that -- or at least, we expect that the both ramps equal each other out, so to speak.

So I think we were quite open on our last call, so our foundry strategy has not changed. We are pleased with the progress we see. As I said, we expect several 28-nanometer tape-outs during the current quarter. And we balance our loading according to risk performance and price. But we also said that there is, of course, a natural incentive for us at this point to work closely with GLOBALFOUNDRY, and that is, of course, something we continue to do.",82

I think, you mentioned the 11% unit growth reasonable for the year. Could you perhaps, give us some more color on where you are seeing the positive sell through? Is it consumer? Is it corporate? Is it developed market? Is it emerging market?",57

I think our opinion here doesn't end the visibility we have, does not differ materially from what you hear from others. North America and Western Europe was weak, and we don't expect that to change materially. We saw strong demand in emerging countries all over that spectrum, China, India, especially Latin America for us. We've been putting resources into those regions. I think we mentioned that of several calls in the past that we ramp up our infrastructure in emerging markets. And of course, our exposure to this Consumer segment is significantly higher than to the commercial sector. We have been seeing that the products and the price points we hit, especially with Brazos are right on the spot of what those market segments demand. And yes, that's pretty much it. Very strong channel business.",136

And as a follow-up, Intel recently raised their CapEx, and they're planning to be very aggressive at the next generation 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer nodes. How do you look at that, Thomas?

So from my CFO perspective, I think, that it is very positive. No, joke aside, you saw that our partners, GLOBALFOUNDRY and TSMC, spend an aggregate amount of money that I think even outperforms the Intel investment. I think it's $8 million on both sides, so $8 million and $7 million. Don't quote me here, but significant amount of money. And of course, we work with our partners in terms of the technology we need to be competitive. But I think, we have also reached the point, competitiveness in this market segment as defined by more than just the technology roadmap. We just have seen that on Brazos. And I think moving forward, we see a lot of more levers that help us to differentiate ourselves and bring highly competitive products into the market, but just take into account, the business model we have and the skills that we have, the IP we have and especially the agility that this business model offers us.",174

And just one last question, if I may. I think in the past, you have given long-term targets of getting to 50% gross margin, perhaps, better than that. What about the APU gives you better margins? What are really, the main drivers from here on to get to that kind of target?",54

So we said that this pretty much comes from different levers for the low end of our APU strategies, the Brazos product that we're shipping currently that are still hugely successful. For those products, it's much more a cost optimization. They're highly gross margin accretive because of good design and chip size efficiencies. On the APUs, or the spectrum that is covered by the Llano products, that is a much more a margin-accretive gain through price performance and price points at which we can play now.",87

As I said before, we have seen strong demand patterns out of the emerging markets. We're seeing good demand out of the Channel business, and I think, we saw some uncertainty in some market research that came out early. I think, those numbers will be corrected as we move forward.

But of course, we are looking forward to see a higher mix of Llano-based products in the second half.

As we mentioned in the first quarter, based in our shipments, it appears, actually, that we gained some share. We'll see here at the end of the month, when Mercury Research numbers come out. You also heard that we picked up the Apple business as well, which we're thrilled about. And of course, in light of their success in the marketplace, that's a big boost for our business as well. And we'll see how it plays out. We feel like we can win in the notebook section in a very interesting way, both with our APUs, which is going to bring an entirely different kind of value into this platforms, as well as our GPUs. And in some platforms, they actually play together, where we can actually use dual graphics. So we feel real good about our position in the overall graphics market.",144

And if I follow on with a question on servers, and understanding that you're talking about late summer for Bulldozer. But obviously, customers move more slowly in that segment.

Thomas, what is the -- and I didn't catch it if you did give it, I do apologize, the expectation for graphics, units and ASPs in the second quarter? And then the second question on the quick side is what should we expect for the APU percent mix as we head into the back half of the year? And lastly, on the server side. Is it a matter of just your share is so low that it's going to go up? Or architecturally, can you help us understand what your offering will have an advantage over Intel's?",103

I will start with the back half here on the server question. So one important point to keep in mind is we have a two-year cadence on our platform, where the processor can be used in the same platforms as the prior year. So as we move into the Bulldozer-based solutions, they're going to leverage that platform capability. So that allows us a shorter time-to-market, as well as a broader platform availability right out of the gate. And then some of the key advantages that we have with Bulldozer certainly are our floating point, our memory bandwidth. And then obviously, performance-per-watt, performance-per-dollar is very compelling with these products. And we've been sampling for multiple months now with Orochi, or the Bulldozer-based products and the reception is fantastic. And on the former part about graphics, do want me to take that? Okay, on the graphics portion, we're not going to give you anything -- exact guidance on the units, but on the ASPs, roughly flat. No big change in our product line going forward there.",175

I mean, it kind of would take that sort of a profile through the year to get anywhere near double-digit PC shipments could be. I'm just trying to get a better feeling for where you think the discrepancies in the data are and what do you think kind of Q2 seasonality for PC shipments to actually be in order to get the kind of unit guidance that you're talking about?",138

And our own model has been rather stable around this value now for a significant period of time. I think that a significant discussion came out about what really was expected for PC shipments to happen in the first quarter. And part of that negative sentiment came from an expectation that year-over-year, the first quarter will be negative. And I think the numbers that we start to see now are not reflecting a negative growth year-over-year in the first quarter.",108

So you're saying it was actually maybe down five sequentially? Or was it flat? I mean, literally, the way it is, you need to have PC growth up 10% in Q2 from the numbers in Q1 to get anywhere near, even close to a double-digit growth. I'm just trying to get a better feeling for where the discrepancies are, because it's just either the bigness...",80

So let's just see how we align that. And I think the negative expectation was that it would be down by minus 3%, minus 4% year-over-year on the first quarter. We've seen now research that will, I think, come out more in the next days that now will change that into a probably up 7% range. Our own expectations, I think, are somewhere in the middle between plus 3% to 4% of shipment growth in the first quarter. And I think that is, if you put that on a line, and keep our guidance of Q2 in mind, that is a consistent statement.",116

And I guess, one last question for you. In terms of that wafer supply, my understanding is you give them a fixed wafer forecast. And you're on a dye by this, you go to a cost plus in 2012 [ph]. What that means is if the yields are badder or bad in 2012, you get fewer good dyes, but you don't make the fixed payment. If yields are really good, the same way, because you get more good dyes, so your dye cost goes down. But you make for fixed payments. So it's sort of a buffer to you. You don't benefit from yield upside, I mean, 2012 versus the way you would in 2011. I'm just trying to figure out -- so that sort of implies if yields are very good, you get a lot more good, you have to be able to sell all the good dyes that you actually receive. Are you sort of baking any kind of -- what sort of, I guess, cautions or anything else in your wafer forecasts are you giving them to make sure that no matter what the yield situation at GLOBALFOUNDRIES is in 2012, you'll be able to actually sell everything that you get?",206

I think, in 2012 we move more towards a normal foundry relationship. We also have the forecast wafer and product demand with TSMC, right? I mean, that is not significantly different. And also, in normal foundry relationships, you have situation especially when you ramp up new technologies and new products that you start with a dye buy, a dye-based purchasing agreement and convert to a wafer-based agreement once the yield is up or the product has matured. So there's nothing that dramatic different from what we do with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. We've extended the period of the dye buy for this year to protect, when we originally started, as I said, to protect our downside with the progress they have been making, it's really a more downside protection at this point in time. We are not worried at this point in time by overforecasting demand. I think, we have a degree of sophistication with which we handle such processes that -- and have learned to handle such processes is well established within the company.",184

How do we think about you setting the goals for the company financially here? We're running into -- this is sort of the first quarter year-on-year where we didn't get earnings growth, and it's largely because of growth in OpEx. Can you discuss with us what actions you would take on the OpEx side to return to sort of a year-on-year earnings growth type of scenario? Or how many quarters, how long do we need to search for that revenue growth, and how we should think about you trying to make some of those challenging decisions?",121

And we provided a guidance of $650 million, and we've been really tough on ourselves and on how we manage operating expenses. This allowed us to come significantly under the guidance we originally gave. I mentioned that we have a significant amount of cross-functional activities started in the company across our core processes to redesign them for scalability, but especially also for productivity across R&D, across sales and marketing and also supply chain, and we expect significant productivity levers out of those initiatives. And I think, you also see it already partly reflected in the guidance we gave for Q2. I said it's going to be around $620 million for operating expenses in total, but it includes, as I said, the first couple of 28-nanometer tape-outs already. So we will be tough on operating expenses. And I think, the discipline that we try instill in the company is something we will keep our grip on.",175

We feel very strong channel demand, partly driven by the products that we started to ramp, also in part, restocking and of Q4 burn down. The visibility we have into their inventories does not indicate any alarming things. Inventory seem to be lean and in line with what you expect for the business at this time in the cycle. And we had a couple of emerging markets where our products or our platform-based products were sold out on the shelf. So not much more to add to that.",107

Chuck Moore will present at the Citi Technology Conference on the 7th of September in New York and Thomas Seifert will present at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on the 13th of September in Las Vegas. 
AMD's third quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, September 16, and we will announce our third quarter earnings on Thursday, October 27. AMD's ownership of GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 11% as of the conclusion of the second quarter. Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed today is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings release available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com. I'd like remind you that AMD's second quarter has 13 weeks of business compared to 14 weeks for the first quarter. Please note that a more detailed review of our financial performance is outlined in the CFO commentary as I mentioned, which is filed with our earnings release and posted on our website. 
Before today's call, I'd like to caution everybody that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. 
The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast, especially in light of the current state of the economy. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss these risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our most recent SEC filings, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2011.

In 2011, AMD kicked off the Fusion era of computing, bringing to market the industry's biggest architectural change since the invention of the microprocessor. Brazos, our first APU for the Thin & Light notebook and netbook market, is an unqualified hit and is one of our fastest driving processors in our history. 
In June, we expanded our Fusion offerings with the launch of the A-Series APU for mainstream notebook and desktops, codenamed is Llano. We shipped more than 1 million A-Series APUs in the second quarter. Based on strong demand signals and SKU assortment for the second half of the year, we expect Llano, the Llano RAM, will outpace the Brazos RAM. 
Customer adoption of Brazos and Llano-based platforms is strong and sell-through is excellent. We have more than 300 APU design wins and 11 of the world's top 12 notebook OEM are shipping APU-based products. 
APU momentum is driving increased sales with our newest notebook customers, helping to increase our footprint across emerging markets and in the Commercial Segment. For example, in the second quarter, the Lenovo ThinkPad X120e was one of the top-selling commercial notebooks among SMB distributors exceeding demand forecast.  
As a result, in the second quarter, we achieved record mobile processor unit shipments and direct card overall microprocessor unit shipments. We improved notebook processor ASP sequentially and we drover a richer mix of notebook processors, which have increased gross margin sequentially. 
The success of our APUs demonstrates we have the right strategy to deliver the differentiated products that the market wants over long term, paving the way for AMD to take a more equitable share of the 360 million unit per year and growing computing market. We remain committed to delivering the world's best APU every year, continuing to improve performance across multiple dimensions while lowering power consumption. 
In June, we publicly demonstrated Trinity, our mainstream notebook APU for 2012, which we believe will further extend our graphics and media processing leadership. We plan to introduce a version of Trinity that will consume less than 1/2 the power of today's lowest power, 35-watt Llano APU, bringing performance computing to the ultra-thin notebooks.  
Further power improvement will drive our tablet APU roadmap. By tablet usage models and form factors differ from the PC, the IP required for success is ideally suited for our Fusion APUs. We have accelerated our tablet roadmaps to ensure we take advantage of this opportunity. Also in June, we launched our first tablet APU and announced the addition of a new tablet APU for 2012 that provides a great hardware complement to the advances Microsoft is making on the tablet operating system front with this next generation of Windows. 
Turning to the Server business. We expect to begin shipping our first server platform featuring the Bulldozer X86 this quarter. The Interlagos platform is our first server offering, optimized for today's cloud datacenters and the architecture excels at compute-intensive and HPC workloads, where it will deliver up to 35% performance improvements compared to our current offerings. Customer excitement for Interlagos is high. All of our major customers are expected to introduce servers based on the new platform this year. We are committed to the server market and are focused on returning the business to a growth trajectory. 
Turning to the Graphics business. The importance of graphics has never been clearer and the growth opportunities resulting from our graphics IP have never been more persuasive. Our graphics technology is fueling the success of all APUs and opening up significant growth opportunities in adjacent markets. 
We strengthened the competitiveness of our discrete graphics offerings in the quarter, delivering the industry's highest-performing desktop and mobile GPUs. The continued ramp of APUs resulted in a record 20-plus million direct X11 discrete level graphic engines shipping in the quarter. 
We also passed several critical milestones in the second quarter as we prepare our next-generation 28-nanometer graphics family. We have working silicon in-house and remain on track to deliver the first members of what we expect will be another industry-leading GPU family to market later this year. We expect to be at the forefront of the GPU industry's transition to 28-nanometer. 
In the quarter, Nintendo also announced that its next-generation game console, the Wii U, will be powered by an AMD HD graphics engine. The successor to the widely popular Wii is expected to launch next year. As a reminder, AMD graphics technology power 2 of the 3 current-generation gaming consoles. Approximately 130 million game consoles are expected to ship over the next 3 years. 
Our graphics IP and Fusion APUs are a great match for the next generation of media-rich consoles. We have an opportunity to increase the amount of AMD silicon shipped in this market by delivering customized Fusion silicon, significantly expanding the TAM for our APUs and serving as a strategic  beach hats to drive APUs into adjacent market segments. 
Operationally, we continue to demonstrate the earnings power of AMD's business model, generating nearly $300 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year. Key to this performance is our ability to work with both GLOBALFOUNDRIES and TSMC to meet our manufacturing needs. At the 28-nanometer node, all of our products will be based on bulk  process technology, providing increased flexibility to work across these 2 committed and valued partner. 
Last quarter, I described a set of initiatives to streamline business and decision-making processes across our operations, R&D and go-to-market functions. We are in full executional deployment across each of the key work streams. These efforts are aimed at accelerating our transformation to a world-class design company, growing revenue, lowering costs and reducing time to market. We expect to see material benefits from this project in 2012. 
Turning now to the second quarter financial summary. Second quarter revenue was $1.57 billion, a 2% sequential decline. Non-GAAP gross margin was 46%, up one percentage point quarter-over-quarter due to a stronger mix in margin accretive APU platforms. Operating expenses were $606 million, less than guided due to the timing of expense recognition related to new products. R&D was $367 million and SG&A was $239 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $114 million, and non-GAAP net income was $70 million or $0.09 per share. Both exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets of $9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $205 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter due to lower operating expenses. 
Now switching to the different segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.2 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. And higher mobile revenue was offset by lower server and desktop microprocessor revenue. Record mobile processor unit shipments were driven by the strength of APUs, which now account for more than 70% of total mobile platform unit shipments and revenue in the quarter. 
Computing Solutions operating income was $142 million, up $42 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to improved gross margin from a richer mix of APU sales compared to the prior quarter. Graphics segment revenue was $367 million, down 11% compared to the prior quarter, mainly due to lower discrete mobile unit shipments and seasonality in the desktop discrete graphics at inboard market. Graphics segment operating loss was $7 million, down $26 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a lower revenue and increased important investments in our next-generation 28-nanometer leadership graphic offerings. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable security balance at the end of the quarter was $1.86 billion, up $160 million compared to the end of the first quarter. The increase is primarily due to cash generated by operations. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $759 million, down $38 million compared to the end of the first quarter 2011 due to the decline in revenue. Inventory was $642 million, exiting the quarter slightly down from the prior quarter. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. 
Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $143 million, down $11 million from the prior quarter. We'll continue to be strategic in our debt reduction efforts based on generating non-GAAP free cash flow, and we expect to be opportunistically looking to reduce our debt based on market opportunities. 
Turning to the outlook. The following statements concerning AMD are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially from current expectations. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect third quarter revenue to increase 10% plus or minus 2% sequentially. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $625 million. The increase from the second quarter operating expenses of $606 million is mainly due to the timing of expense recognition associated with certain product tapeout. Had this expense been recognized as planned in the second quarter, operating expense guidance for the third quarter would have been flat quarter-over-quarter. 
In conclusion, whether for PCs, tablets, game consoles or new form factors, the APU is the superior processing platform. The graphics performance of AMD APUs is stunning and drives differentiation. But then APU is much more than the creation of CPU and GPU and processing a piece of silicon. It's an optimized combination of multiple types of computing cores capable of efficiently delivering unmatched levels of computing performance often called heterogeneous computing. 
Tapping into this potential turns the APU into a unified, turbo-charged SLC perfectly suited for numerous market segments inside and outside the PC sector. As an example, in 2013, we plan to introduce an optimized tablet APU capable of redefining what users will expect from a tablet. 
Industry support to enable the full potential of the APU is critical, and we believe best delivered through open standards capable of creating a critical mass of hardware and software support.  Last quarter, we provided additional details on our Fusion system architecture and open standards-based approach to enable heterogeneous computing that we believe the industry will rally around. We are bringing FSA to market in the same way we drove the adoption of other industry standards. We believe the approach will work with FSA just as it did with AMD 64 architecture and HyperTransport. Software developers and other processor companies are attracted to FSA because it allows the use of programming models that has been in place for decades. 
FSA also has the potential to work across the multiple types of CPU and GPU cores found in different devices, whether they are powered by x86 or ARM or both. We are seeing great response from other industry leaders like Microsoft and ARM. We'll recognize the benefits of a standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing. FSA can enable alliances that reach beyond traditional hardware barriers, allowing AMD to grow within an expanding ecosystem inside and outside of x86 computing. This is the future of the industry and AMD is leading the way. 
And with that, I will turn back to Ruth for the Q&A",1803

So as you know, we entered the market rather conservatively talking about the PC, growth expectations in the very low teens. In the last 2 quarters, we have been talking about expectation in the 10s. Mercury now is at 8.9%. And we still think we don't have any indication why we should materially differ from that opinion today. However, I think we see now in the second quarter that the momentum we have started with the process launch, as I've said before, on our first APU family with that accelerated ramp, we have now seen over 2 quarters. The demand, it's in the market. It's going to be on this level and better for our Llano products that we launched this quarter. We promised we would ship about the same volume of Llanos as we shipped in the first quarter of Brazos. And from the demand signals we see today, we expect the RAM to be even higher and better accelerated, and this is really driving our guidance for the third quarter.",176

I think we receive all the support we need, and to be honest, also that we deserve by bringing advanced technology to our foundry partners. We have been putting guidance in place for Q2 that we hit, that we fully expect to deliver our guidance that we put in front of you today. And I think that's a statement in itself. When we moved to 28-nanometers, we made good progress on the graphics side, especially as you heard, we have working silicon in hand, and we have great confidence that we will deliver and lead the transition on the graphic GPU business to 28-nanometer. And I think the important statement is also that with the 28-nanometer, all of our products will be based on that technology. And with that, our flexibility to manage risk across the foundry partner ecosystem that we have has significantly increased.",156

I think we understand that the APUs bring greater margins, certainly the lower-end ones but perhaps some lower ASPs as the previous questioner was getting to. I guess one question I have is, where do you think gross margin can go in the second half and in 2012? And how do you see mix evolving to bring that about? And perhaps, specifically, you can provide some sense of the relative contribution of the Brazos versus Llano versus Bulldozer to get to those gross margins over the next few quarters.",97

So we said then that all 3 products are going to be margin-accretive, however, for different reasons. In the Brazos' case, it was primarily a matter of cost position, really being accretive from a very favorable cost position, and I think that played out nicely over the last quarters. You see margin accretiveness on the Llano side because of better price performance and playing in SKUs that we have not been able to play before. And the Server business traditionally, I think, is a higher gross margin business than our corporate average. So I'm not going to update any guidance for 2012. I think we, at our Investor Day, we outlined where we think we can take them, the company in terms of gross margin that we have line of sight of a world beyond 50%. But that is something for next year. And the years after that, we'll talk about our Analyst Day. Without any doubt, however, we expect that our gross margin is going to go up in the second half.",176

There are some that are, well, concerned that the absence of a CEO over there may create some additional risk for the supply at 32 and at x28. So I'm wondering if you can provide an update on your wafer pricing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES and the incentive program that you have in place and whether that kicked in and whether there are additional charges on that? And whether you think, given the, perhaps, additional uncertainty of GLOBALFOUNDRIES, whether you could possibly extend per die or per good die structure that's in place this year into next year? And if not, how would the reversion to the older policy affect your gross margin potential?",126

So first of all, let me make a statement upfront. Despite the management change at GLOBALFOUNDRIES, we cannot complain at all of a lack of support or attention from GLOBALFOUNDRIES to us. So actually, the relationship has developed very good and rather strengthened them in this transition period. The wafer supply agreement for this year that we have announced is in full effect. It had been completely negotiated and fine, and we are operating under the umbrella of the new WSA agreement, that's why we are confident in the statements we make. And then, it was always the intent then, that the companies would sit down and look at the past and the present and the future both companies have in front of them and then readjust the wafer supplier agreement on a long-term basis.

Your second quarter, Brazos, I think you shipped just an excess of 3 million. So we'd expect, I guess, 3 million or more Llano shipments next quarter. Now we had now 6 million Brazos this quarter. I'm just curious if you can give me some feeling for at least your expectation for next quarter relative contributions of Llano versus Brazos given you expect 100% of your mobile shipment's essentially made up of these 2 things. And what is the effect on margins? I know you said during your last quarter's call, you expected gross margins by the end of the year to be at the high end of your annual guidance, which you've put around 48%.

And one more if I could squeeze it in. So you mentioned in your CFO commentary and even on the call here, your prospect to opportunistically delever going forward. So I think, I don't know where your net debt position is sitting this quarter, it's probably somewhere around $300 million. Do you think you can be reasonably close to cash debt neutrality by the end of the year? And what would it take for you to potentially -- I suppose to have enough -- do you think you could basically have enough cash on the balance sheet, maybe by the end of next year  to conceivably, completely  delever or essentially to pay off all of your debt and still have enough cash to run the business? I think you've probably talked before about needing about $1 billion on the balance sheet to be comfortable running the business. Do you think that's actually a realistic possibility potentially?",162

I think what is fair to say is that our commitment to delever is as strong as it was.

And then now sort of a bigger, a little bit bigger-picture question. At the beginning of the year, you guys talked about sending some people into -- FAs into the field and you talked to the buyers of servers and get a sense -- you sort of prime the pump as you get Interlagos into the market. Can you give us a sense as to how those discussions have gone? So really not talking to the OEMs but actually talking to the ultimate-end customers of servers and what's their level of interest in Interlagos? And what specifically are they saying they like or dislike?",105

That's one of the critical things that our Interlagos server product brings to these customers is they extend data centers or in some cases, the mega-data centers of the cloud providers, big, big criteria. And that plays in the sweet spot for our Bulldozer core that I talked about earlier, really providing a higher level performance at a given power level. So the reception has been good. In fact it out-leverages existing platforms out there already. Our many-cores platforms, you can just drop in, in the Interlagos family. It gives a great opportunity for them to test it out, and then use the same platforms into new installations over the next multiple quarters.",137

No doubt, this is a competitive environment and it always was and always will be. And of course, competitive dynamics are a part of the factors that we consider when we talk about guidance, and this competitiveness is not going to disappear.

First, as far as Q3 guidance is concerned, what is your expectation for graphics business?

Srini, the latter part of your question is related around the attach rate. And to sort of explain out exactly as we expected in 2011, certainly, our Llano-type of processor, now that it's publicly out there, shows that we truly have discrete level graphics with a modern discrete level architecture. So certainly, from a AMD platform perspective, the need for a low-end graphics GPU is not there, unless you want to use it in a crossfire-type of configuration. Conversely though, the competitive platforms don't have that modern GPU architectures. That's actually driving the need for mainstream or performance notebooks to use discrete graphics. So what's the net add of that from an attach rate, it's kind of what we're seeing, it's basically flat at this juncture.",127

But then, to answer your question with respect to Q2, most of the revenue adjustments we have seen were very much seasonality driven. The second quarter, traditionally, is the weakest quarter for the discrete GPU business and I then think that was the main contributor to the decline, the quarter-over-quarter revenue decline.",66

But we also said that in the long run, parts of this business will be cannibalized and the low-end discrete GPUs will be replaced with Fusion-type products.

I'm just curious on Windows 8 and want to follow up on this one, but what are the some of the things that you can leverage in what you see in notebook today to maybe help you succeed on that? And then on that same note, I guess, based on the current x86 software ecosystem out there and your experience with hardware drivers and such, do you feel like you've got an advantage versus ARM guys? Does it even matter? Can you talk about some of the puts and takes there?",103

So let's talk first about the mainstream notebook. I mean we are pretty happy with the review that we had on our Llano processor. Obviously, we expected that the graphics and the video and media capabilities to shine through, which it did. But also, the message about how AMD's focused on battery life, and we really turned that into an advantage at this juncture with our Fusion architecture. It gives us something to leverage into the future, and we're just going to double down on that area. You'll continue to see us bring low-power solutions into the marketplace. So we can grow our presence in notebooks and our market share. On the ARM- and x86-type of questions, certainly there's a large body of software out there that leverages the x86 architecture. But our focus is really delivering the entire experience. And again, we have all the right processors, the right GPUs. And yes, compatibility will certainly matter as we look forward to 2012, 2013 and so on. When somebody walks into the store, they want the confidence that they're going to get that same PC experience. And we feel AMD is the best capable company to deliver it into the market.",202

Okay, that's helpful. And then just my second question here. Just wanted to ask about the competitive environment that you're seeing in Graphics today. I know you talked about the attach rate being fairly stable here, but how is the competition faring up there? How are the inventories that you're seeing out there in the channel? And then also just lastly, I was hoping you could comment on that 17- or 18-watt Trinity part that you talked about. That sounds interesting.",83

Again, I'll touch on the Graphics business first. So obviously, we have a full line of products that we fully launched now in Northern Irelands, both in the desktop and notebook area. Just a couple weeks ago, we introduced the industry's highest-performing notebook GPU coupled with the industry's highest-performance desktop card that we have available in the marketplace. We feel our position for the next couple of quarters is very good. And as Thomas mentioned, there is an inflection point coming with the 28-nanometer process technology. Again, we've invested a lot in that area, and we expect to maintain our leadership position that we've enjoyed the last several years in the GPU marketplace. And the Trinity part, that's a product geared for 2012. We put out a pretty interesting power specification. I don't know if we really want to go into more details about that product at this time, other than the fact that we're going to continue to invest in leading in the mobile space.",167

On the Brazos type of platform, we haven't seen a lot of attach rate. But again, it's geared for more the mainstream and netbooks, where you don't historically see a lot of discrete GPUs anyway. As we move up Llano, our value proposition's pretty good there for any of the discrete GPU, and there are some markets, China, Western Europe that greatly value the graphics and media capability in what we call ""a crossfire mode"". How that works out worldwide, to a certain degree, we're just seeing what the sellout is and which platforms. A large number of the Llano platforms do have the discrete GPU option.",119

By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and CFO commentary. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on AMD's website at quarterlyearnings.amd.com. Participants on today's conference call are Rory Read, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Seifert, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number is (888) 266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703) 925-2533. The access code for both is 1554016. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight a few dates for you. Thomas Seifert will present at the Barclays Global Technology Conference on the 7th of December in San Francisco. Rory Read will present at the Raymond James Annual IT Supply Chain Investor Conference on the 13th of December in New York. Additionally, our 2011 Financial Analyst Day has been deferred to February 2, 2012. And lastly, our fourth quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, December 16, and we'll announce our fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, January 20, 2012. 
AMD's ownership of GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 9.6% as of the conclusion of the third quarter. The 2-year time period after which we no longer have the right to designate a representative to the GLOBALFOUNDRIES' Board of Directors was triggered in September of this year when our ownership interest in GLOBALFOUNDRIES decreased below 10% on a fully diluted basis. 
Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed today is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings release available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com. 
Before we begin today's call, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our most recent SEC filings, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2011.

AMD's third quarter revenue was $1.69 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter and up 4% year-over-year. And AMD's non-GAAP operating income grew by 28% quarter-to-quarter and was flat year-over-year. 
In my first 60 days at AMD, I'm excited by the energy and resources I see here and I'm encouraged by what I hear from our customers and partners. AMD clearly continues to play an important leadership role in the industry but there's more to do.
There is a lot of interest in our products, and customers are looking for us to improve our execution in order to help them to grow even faster. 
Third quarter demand for our new AMD platforms was strong, particularly in the mobile processor space, where we saw revenue grow 35% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, clearly outpacing the market in a significant way. Additionally, in the server space, we saw a solid 27% gain in revenues sequentially with solid customer demand for our next-generation Opteron offerings. 
However, we also had our challenges. We saw both 32 and 45 nanometer supply challenges in the third quarter. No doubt, we must improve our execution and we are taking action to improve our ability to consistently deliver our products on time, day in and day out. We are working with our key partners to improve the processes, disciplined to deliver on our commitment to our customers. We have more to do, but we are clearly making progress and we are on the right path. 
Now let's take a deeper look at the mobile segment. In the third quarter, we saw a record AMD processor shipment and revenue in the mobile space. Over 90% of our mobile units were Fusion APUs, which are uniquely suited to meet the advanced processing needs of today's mainstream and entry-level mobile PC buyers. For example, we believe AMD's worldwide share of the $200 to $600 retail price bid is now over 28%. These bands make up 45% of the retail notebook volume across the planet, and we believe AMD gained consumer notebook share in the key emerging markets year-over-year, particularly in China, where our microprocessor revenue grew 23% quarter-on-quarter. 
We also set another record for Brazos shipment in the quarter, up 36% quarter-to-quarter, and our mobile AMD processor unit sales in total are now up over 50% in the last 2 quarters alone. We clearly outgrew the market in the mobile segment and we believe we took share in the quarter. 
Now for our server business. The third quarter was the beginning of a move in the right direction, with server revenue up 27% sequentially. Initial production shipments of our new AMD Opteron products gained traction in the high-performance computing space, where with the help of our key partner, Cray, and some of our most notable customers which included the National SuperComputer Centers in Stuttgart, Germany, in the U.K. and in Switzerland, as well as the United States Department of Energy Titan project at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This project, in fact, is likely to be one of the world's fastest supercomputers. We are excited about our key partners, including HP and Dell, who are launching new products based on our new Opteron platform this fourth quarter, and we are confident they will do well against competition, particularly in key workload areas like the cloud and virtualization. 
Now let's turn our attention to the graphics business. AMD's graphics segment continued to be a solid business for us. Segment revenue was up 10% quarter-over-quarter and up 4% year-over-year. This growth was driven largely by strong seasonal revenue increases in the AIB channel. Our AMD Radeon HD GPU was also recognized as the world's fastest mobile product in the most recent quarter. This continues to show outstanding graphics innovation from AMD. We also publicly demonstrated our next-generation 28 nanometer GPU product during the third quarter, and we look forward to building on our performance leadership position in the graphics area throughout 2012 and the years ahead. 
Now let me take a moment to focus on execution. From an execution standpoint, you know and we know, we faced significant manufacturing challenges in the quarter. Having said that, demand was strong and interest in our products is significant. We will continue an aggressive effort with our foundry partner to improve manufacturing performance at this important 32-nanometer technology, and we have already seen steady improvement day after day, week after week, but we are not out of the woods yet. 
In the last few quarters, you've also heard Thomas describe our initiatives to streamline our business processes. We will continue to explore ways to accelerate this effort, both to unlock these efficiencies and productivity to better compete in the current marketplace and also to enable our organization to better capture the trends for which our technologies are so well suited, namely the move to low power platforms, the continued rise of the emerging markets and the emergence of cloud and mega data center computing. 
So in summary, our exciting new AMD Fusion architecture is a unique and differentiated approach and we are seeing strong interest from the marketplace. It is particularly well targeted to lower power form factors and a high-volume price bands. And our new Opteron server technology is well tuned to increasingly important workloads, like virtualization and cloud-based servers. We are seeing a nice uptick in our server business, which is in fact long overdue. Customer demand is strong and momentum is clearly there. And while we face challenges in supply and execution, we are making steady improvements with a maniacal focus on execution across the entire company. 
In short, I believe AMD is uniquely positioned to take advantage of today's largest and fastest-growing market opportunities. Through better execution, we will accelerate our growth. Through innovation, we will lead in this changing technology landscape and capture the emerging inflection points already underway. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas, who will cover the financials for our third quarter.",1008
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3478.0,180341.0,11079134.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Seifert,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.69 billion, up 7% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Revenue growth in the third quarter of 2011 was adversely impacted by 32-nanometer and 45-nanometer product supply constraints. The sequential revenue increase was driven primarily by record mobile processor revenue and unit shipments, partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to lower 45-nanometer supply and seasonally higher graphics segment revenue. In addition, since our preliminary third quarter results announcement in September, we saw unanticipated sales strength in the channel through the end of the quarter. 
Gross margin was 45%, down 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter due to lower than expected supply of 45-nanometer products, lower than expected supply of higher ASP and higher margin 32-nanometer products and therefore, a higher percentage of revenue in our lower margin GPU business. 
Operating expenses were $610 million, less than guided due to lower than expected revenue in the quarter and ongoing discipline in expense management. R&D was $361 million and SG&A was $249 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $146 million and non-GAAP net income was $110 million. Interest expenses declined by $5 million compared to the prior quarter. Additionally, we repurchased $150 million of our 6% convertible notes in the quarter, which will result in over $2 million of quarterly interest savings moving forward. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.15, calculated using 741 million fully diluted shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $239 million, up $34 million from the prior quarter due to higher operating income driven by higher revenue. 
Now switching to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by record mobile processor revenue and unit shipments partially offset by lower desktop revenue, and double-digit growth in server processor revenue driven by significantly higher ASP. 
Computing Solutions operating income was $149 million, up $7 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of APUs and improved server microprocessor ASPs. 
Graphics segment revenue was $403 million, up 10% compared to the prior quarter mainly due to seasonal strength in the add-in-board market, strong demand for mobile discrete graphics at OEMs and an improved product mix. 
Graphics segment operating income was $12 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher GPU shipments and ASP. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable security balance, including long term at the end of the quarter, was $1.86 billion, down $4 million compared to the end of second quarter of 2011. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $908 million, up $149 million compared to the end of the second quarter due to higher revenue and the timing of sales. Inventory was $540 million exiting the quarter, down $102 million from the prior quarter due to a decline in 45-nanometer inventory driven by a transition to 32-nanometer products and deficiencies in the back-end manufacturing. Long-term debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion. The non-GAAP free cash flow was $131 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. AMD expects revenue to increase 3%, plus or minus 2%, sequentially for the fourth quarter of 2011, and operating expenses are expected to be approximately $620 million. 
APU traction in the marketplace and demand for AMD's leading-edge technologies dropped. And while we exited the quarter recognizing we could have done better, we continued to deliver to our business model, improving profitability and free cash flow, and we fully expect our strategy to be successful and deliver improving shareholder value going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.",597

Thomas, in your comments, you indicated ASPs were up. It sounds like quite noticeably in the quarter and obviously, gross margin is impacted by yield. But how should we think about the recovery of gross margin as yields improve, particularly given the ASP trends you have. And then specifically, how should we think about gross margins for Q4?",65

Thank you, Glen. A very good question. So as we  said in the script, in the third quarter, we had to fight a couple of headwinds, mainly on 32-nanometer supply impacting really the product mix we had in terms of high ASP and highly margin accretive 32-nanometer product. And we also had to make some trade-off decisions on 45-nanometer capacity that hit us from a cost of goods sold perspective. And then we had to deal with a higher relative share of graphics product in the overall revenue picture. So how is that going to change moving forward? So a couple of trends you have to keep in mind, headwinds and tailwinds. There are tailwinds, certainly there are. We will recover gross margin by shipping a higher share of Llano products and we will increase gross margin, of course, by increasing our server revenue. And we will face some headwinds in the current quarter. 45-nanometer supply is still going to be not where we want it to be because we continue to trade off capacity towards 32-nanometer. We also will see some ramp-up costs from a 28-nanometer technology perspective, and then we will have a one-time effect in the fourth quarter just cleaning up manufacturing start-up costs around 32-nanometer to make sure that it's clear. And that alone, that one-time effect, is going to hit us probably with just under 1%. So if you add up all the headwinds and tailwinds, we think we're going to be about flat moving into Q4, but continuing to execute to our model, if you keep the one-time effects out of the picture.",270

As I've started my first 60 days here at AMD, when I've met with customers, partners across the planet, they told me that they're really interested in the products that we're creating and the solutions that we're making here at AMD. And they also want to believe and trust more and make bigger investments to grow with us. But we have to focus not only just on the margin items that Thomas said, but across execution. Improving our execution and improving our supply position has to be one of our top priorities. And we have more -- much more still to do in that space. You heard in Thomas' comment that impacted our margins and our results, and we're not out of the woods yet, but we're making steady and clear progress day after day, week after week. And we're working with some really outstanding technical leaders from here in AMD, our partners like GLOBALFOUNDRIES, but also key partners like IBM and PDF. And we're going machine by machine, step by step to improve that activity and our yields. That, I think, will help improve, over a longer period of time, our margin performance. And that's really a little bit more background on that item, Glen.",234

So just based on the comments, again, it sounds like what fell short must have been desktop. And I wonder as I think about the execution issue: One, do you sense that there is a longer term impact from that? Did you just turn some customers off forever because you screwed up on the execution side? And the reason I bring up desktop is I wonder if that's less impactful when it's in desktop than it would have been were it to be seen more in your notebook results. Because I think that's where your customers are probably depending on you more.",110

I've had the opportunity over the first 2 months here to really meet with just about every major partner across the planet, and the feedback has been very consistent. They really believe in this AMD APU kind of strategy based on the Fusion architecture. It's not a surprise that we saw our revenues increase 35% sequentially based on the strong APU demand in the mobile space. And think about it, to date, we've already shipped 20 million Brazos in that area. And clearly, from being a customer in my past job, it's about building trust, trust in execution, trust in technology. We have to continue to focus on that. That is Job 1 from my perspective. If we execute better, we'll enhance that trust. I don't think we've irreversibly damaged that trust at this point, but we eroded some of it. And we need to make sure that we execute every day to our commitment. You're right. In the desktop space, there's a little less pressure, but we had to choose where we did our manufacturing capacity in order to support our notebook growth and to make sure that we try to deliver on the commitment that we made to our customers. And they felt some of that pain in the third quarter because we weren't able to execute as cleanly as we would like. In the notebook space, we're making progress. In the desktop space, I think we know how to manufacture in that space. We just need to be able to move more of the wafers in that direction. So net-net, I don't see it as an irreversible trend. I believe this is a trend we can build from, but it's all about execution. We need as a company, AMD, deliver on our commitment, whether it's a roadmap, our features, our supply. That's the first lift to creating shareholder value in this market. Then we can go tackle in parallel how to intercept the very interesting inflection points going on in the industry, inflection points around low power, around the cloud, around emerging markets. These are real opportunities. Sorry, Glen, but I got fired up on that one.",365

So keep in mind the good die agreement we have is an agreement we have on the 32-nanometer process. It's not an agreement we have on the 45-nanometer process. And I think I described it in the last -- the first quarter conference call pretty much as a downside protection. And this is how you have to look at it. It's when yields fall to lower a certain level, the downside is protected, and we built it from there. On the 45-nanometer side, it's a different picture. We pick up the cost for that capacity and pretty much in the old model, and since we have allocated 45-nanometer capacity towards 32-nanometer capacity, we got some margin impacts there.",123

And I guess 2 somewhat housekeeping issues, I guess. The first one is a little more, I guess, general. On the flood side of things over in Thailand, any commentary on what you think that would do to impact you? And then one housekeeping one. On the interest expense, are you more or less seeing that the $2 million benefit per quarter is what you'll see in the fourth quarter so that we can just model that down $2 million?",81

Let's start, I mean, with the second question first. That's the easier one. Yes, that is exactly as you described it. It's a $2 million benefit on a quarterly basis moving forward, and that's what you'll see then in the fourth quarter to 100%. The floods, I think the supply chains in the industry have become rather efficient for maybe the wrong reasons with all the disasters we had to deal with. So overall, the reaction time, finding out where their bottlenecks could be, worked out really well and the information flow across the supply chain seems to work rather well too. So from this point, in perspective, we don't see an impact in the fourth quarter, to be very honest, at least after discussing with our customers. We'll have to see how this is going to impact the supply chain moving forward and into 2012. It depends on a lot of things, how long this situation is going to continue, and then how much damage needs to be repaired. But short term, not much of an impact.",179

As I've been meeting with the key partners in the OEM space, their feedback is, ""Well, that's a challenge."" Thomas is spot on. Those supply chains are quite resilient. They're working hard to work around that and make sure the mix is there. The feedbacks and signals that I've gotten from each of the major players is they're looking for us to improve our execution and deliver more product to them. They see opportunities to continue to deliver and execute, and the flood doesn't appear to be a major factor at this point. We're going to continue to monitor it, but all indications at this point that this shouldn't be a major impact.",125

You remarked a little bit about the channel strength picking up towards the end of the quarter and that's why it ended up a little bit higher now.

And since 2 quarters ago, we were already up 50%. So there is clearly a couple of major factors that are going on in the marketplace, one around consumerization at the PC market and also around convergence and around the cloud. The APU strategy that we put in place with the Fusion architecture, with the Brazos and Llano chipset, really takes advantage of the idea of the CPU and GPU together. And the idea of delivering the graphical -- the user experience from the cloud is very well positioned. And customers are clearly reacting to that in the mobile segment in terms of those entry to mainstream price bands. And I think that's a reflection that we've been listening to the marketplace and we've been reacting to it. At this point in the third quarter, the APU mix of our total client business is up to 90% of that client mix, and I think that's pretty telling. We're going to continue to double down there, focus on building out that APU strategy, continue to drive for low power. These are the trends that the customers in those segments are saying, and we're seeing it across the planet.",262

Everyone expects that the success of this line will continue. It's been very appealing. We understand that the next generation coming will use more advanced manufacturing. And there are some concerns about the readiness of one of your foundry partners to contribute to production of the next-generation Brazos, Krishna and Wichita. And I'm wondering if you have plans for dealing with those challenges your foundry partner may be facing and whether you still think you'll be able to tell the same sort of time zone for releasing the new Brazos at the beginning of the year, like you did last year. Do you think you need a new revision to capture the same interest in the market? And what your strategy is there?",135

So let me get started here. Sorry, I don't want to make -- give any specific statements on roadmap and launch dates for 2012. But I think in general term, of course, we are pleased with the success of the low-power version of our Fusion product and we're excited by the prospective and the opportunities that it creates throughout in the marketplace. And I think the first big follow-up on that is actually the second generation of Llano products, Trinity, that is going to launch very early next year and where we pretty much cut the core performance in half. And of course, we'll try the Brazos and Bobcat based high-end products further down and then have a big focus on that. And I think we mentioned it also in our last call that moving forward, we think we've found a way our risk profile in terms of manufacturing and foundry partners. And this also, I think, will help us to better mitigate the ups and downs that are just part of this business model.",176

And as we're tracking execution each week across AMD, we're looking at the design win activities with our key OEMs. We're looking at the momentum of sell-through. And the buy-in around the product continues to show strong interest, strong demand. They're counting on us to improve these execution items that allows us to move forward. And I think what we're seeing with the progress that we're making since late September, it's slow. It's steady. We clearly have much more to do, but there are those signs of clear improvement and the demand and interest in this architecture and solution is spot on. And Thomas mentioned the emerging markets.

We're spending just an intense amount of time across our business units to really understand the market data. Where are the customer paying points? What's the feedback we're getting from the key retailers? What is the feedback from the customer sets that are interested in the product?

And if you think about that, in this set, I really think that we're building on that same set of success. And what we're trying to do is to continue a nice drumbeat of products throughout the year and to make sure that we're keeping a fresh set of improvement that allows us to improve the experience for that customer. The customer is telling us low power. They're talking about faster boot times. They're talking about a better experience in terms of the graphical representation and the experience on the screen. That's what they get with AMD's Fusion architecture and the APU set. That's why we'll bring it to market as we have those solutions and make sure that we're hitting the customer.

When we took a look at the data throughout the quarter, it was clear that we were going to miss the original guidance. And there's no doubt that was the case. It was our prudent decision that we needed to represent that to our shareholders, to our investors and to the marketplace. And that's what we did. I think, as you looked at it, we had the impact that we saw in terms of the margin down 1 point quarter-over-quarter and we saw us outside of the range of guidance on revenue. We did see some activity that quite frankly surprised us a little bit in the channel at the very end of the quarter in terms of some sell-through, of some channel inventory, that was a little bit higher. But there's no doubt that was the prudent decision given we were going to miss the guidance that we had shared. And think about it, take a look at our inventory position. Our inventory position hasn't been in a better position in a long time, and that's a reflection of a maniacal focus on improving productivity but also we've got that bit of surge of channel sell-through at the very end that kind of pushed us a little bit higher on that. But in no way you look at it that was the right call, the prudent decision.",236

In terms of -- we knew what happened with the cycle time and the yield issues, how better controlled is that now? And specifically, what lessons have you learned with this that you think can apply to Trinity? And from the early signals we've seen with Trinity, are you comfortable with where you think that yield could be within a few months of launch? And then also, the same question would apply to both of the -- just kind of get a sense of what you learned from this and how we should be able to feel comfortable when you give us a good guidance around Trinity in the future.",117

From a standpoint, clearly, we were disappointed with the execution around the yields in the 32-nanometer space, and that occurred over a sustained period of time. And as I mentioned in my comments and earlier questions, we're not out of the woods yet. We're making progress and we're focused on it every single day, and we're seeing progress. But again, we are focused at a machine-by-machine levels, step by step, and trying to improve both our sort yields, our total yields across the board. This is something -- based on some strong results here from your perspective, you might get the wrong read on this. We have work to do in the execution space, and while we're making progress, we need to continue that progress. I think we're seeing that steady improvement and step by step, machine by machine, we'll make that progress in 32. And clearly, we'll shift significantly more 32 nanometer product in the fourth quarter than we did in third quarter. And then what we're doing is to apply the learnings to 28 nanometer. The difference between 32 and 28 nanometer quite frankly isn't gigantic. And the experiences that we're learning there, in terms of the machine-level data, the flow through the recipe, those we're applying in the 28 nanometer space. Again, we have much more work to do, but we are -- we believe that we're making steady progress day after day. We have more work to do, but we're on it and this is really Job 1 from my perspective. We must execute better as a company. In my experience as a customer of AMD for 5 years, this is an area that we must improve on, whether it's on the roadmap, features or supply. Our customers have been telling me that in the first 60 days every single day, and we cannot let them down. We need to improve. Not out of the woods yet, making progress, and 28 nanometer very close to 32, we're taking the learnings and applying them.",338

I assume -- let me try to give you some color on that and of course, you will understand that we will not disclose specific yield figures. But then, going into the quarter, we were, based on the information we had and the data we looked at, pretty confident that we could outperform the ramp of the Brazos product line. And if we look back today, then we did not really achieve that. We are pretty much on the same slope, but we could not outperform our -- that slope as we have previously expected. And it's not so much only a matter of, ""here's a product issue and we have product yield issue."" It's really -- it was much more a matter of how do you get a significant and very steep capacity ramp handled at our foundry partner. A lot of new tools had to be brought on place, had to be ramped, had to be qualified and how disciplined and how successful the steep ramp up process was handled gave us a lot of headache over the quarter and a lot of volatility. So not so much only in terms of, did we lose good product on the wafer but just not getting enough wafers out the door, so to speak.",215

But at least, the volume we lost from -- it's a pure volume and capacity bring in place perspective that will be recovered without any doubt and without any gap. And once you have a little delay on your on yield curve, on the product yield curve, that obviously leads to a time delay. But we saw steady improvement.

That's the bottom line. We have more work to do on it. We had to shift volume away from 45-nanometer and away from desktop in order to get the yield and to try in to fill as much of the customer demand as we possibly could. Well, that's -- we're seeing some improvements. We're still not at the right levels, and we need to make more progress. And I think what we're doing with -- I think what we've done with our key partner there, I've spent a lot of time with their executive team, and they're bought in just as significantly at GLOBALFOUNDRIES as AMD to work with us and to find the right path here. And then bringing of the other key partners, like IBM and PDF, as I suggested earlier. These things are the things that will help to lift that honest, sustainable base. Again, we are not where we need to be yet and we'll have to make choices to get the best outcome to satisfy as many of our customers as possible, but we have more work to do, Cody.",201

Well, I believe the PC market is going to continue to grow, and it is going to grow for the foreseeable future. I think there's going to be hundreds of millions of new PC customers over the coming years, and I think there is going to be a lot of them in the emerging market. And that's why I'm so pleased with the progress that we're beginning to see in our emerging market focus. So we're going to double down in that space. We need to continue to build momentum in the emerging market. We know that a lot of that growth, a huge portion, is going to come in those entry and mainstream price points. This is right smack where we can reach with the Brazos and Llano technologies that APU is a value proposition that works. And you look at that combination, emerging market, right technology, even as it moves to more delivery of content, you're going to see the importance of the APU and the GPU built into that APU become even more critical. So I believe that the market, the PC market as represented by IDC, is a fair representation. There will be growth and it will continue the growth and grow and it will continue to grow consistently over the next several years. Now if there's some huge macroeconomic event, I can't predict that. But clearly, the market, I believe, is solid. It's growing and it has opportunities for us, particularly with the products and technologies that we have.",285

I guess, what are your initial thoughts on pulling their architecture down into those lower power envelopes or is it something you would consider moving to bring an encore for that usage?",61
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3478.0,180341.0,11079171.0,Answer,Rory Read,,Executives,40,"Yes. I think it's a fair question but remember, I'm here 60 days. We'll have an Analyst Day in February. But I think you're on the right trend here in the idea that low power is a trend that's here to stay. Thin and light, convergence, consumerization, those are core trends. They're not going to change. We're listening to the customer. We want to focus on what that customer needs, how we can create leadership and then drive that through. You're going to see us, as I mentioned, double down in those key areas around low power. That is a trend Thomas mentioned  next year, and the kind of power envelope productions that we're driving in the Brazos and Llano family. You think about that the work that we'll do across the APU and how to continue to extend that architecture and the Fusion architecture so that, that customer experience is even better. Low power is definitely the right trend. I also think the trends in the emerging market, where I think low power, thin, light, a bit longer battery life, those are trends that are going to play. Customers like them. They're going to want them, and they want them in a value proposition that works. I can promise you that we're going to look at the market data and make sure that we're understanding it and fill the areas that give us the return and the benefit that leverage the capability across AMD. And you think about it, across 60 days, I've been very impressed with the technical capabilities of AMD. We just announced Mark Papermaster joining our team as the Senior Vice President of Technology and Engineering, our CTO. He comes from a background of some of the most innovative companies in the industry. I think that -- a teammate like that, coming on board and who's focused in this segment, there are a lot of very important inflection points. You talked about tablet. I'm not sure the tablet just in the form factor itself is the real game in hand. I think the impact in terms of proprietary control points and chips in the marketplace that's going to occur both in client server over the coming months and years are going to be exciting opportunities. And for us, in AMD, with the capability we have, the first focus on execution, execution, execution, deliver on our commitment, then focus on innovation. Where is the pot going? And those areas, get the right technical team. We have thousands of engineers that we've created the capability to tackle this. How many companies have that capability? And the status quo is going to change. That's an opportunity for us. We're at a market share position where the upside is in front of us. We have to embrace those changes and move forward. We'll get into a little more detail around the specifics in our February session, but clearly, our capabilities, the kind of talent that we have here that we're developing that we already have and the talent that we're beginning to attract into the team are the kinds of solutions to react to the marketplace. And you're right. Low power is right. Emerging market is right, and that trend is going to continue.",544

Our original intent was to really outperform the Brazos brand in terms of steepness of the slope. And we were, for the reasons we've discussed now at length, not able to achieve that.

So the agreement that we have in place is around 32-nanometer and it's pretty much limited until the end of the current calendar year, and then we would default back to the original agreement. I think I also said already on the last call that we have started negotiations with our partners and they are progressing well. And as soon as we have an update and something to announce, we'll talk about it.

When you look at his resume, he's very strong in PowerPC, a very rich ARM history, not necessarily a rich x86 situation. So I'm just kind of curious if this is a subtle signaling that perhaps you're moving to a multi- architectural strategy. And if it's not, I guess, what core skill set does Mark bring to the table that you think are a good fit with the challenges at AMD today?",83

From the standpoint of what I've seen here over the first 60 days, I really have been impressed with the technical capability. And when you look at the technology industry in this silicon space, there is very few players that can match the capability that AMD has in terms of its engineering capacity, the talent that we have on board. We have some great leaders and we have a large contingent of just super-talented engineers that are fighting everyday to find out what the customer needs and how to tackle it. And there was an opportunity to go out and work with Mark, and he saw the same kind of excitement around AMD that I did and that Thomas has shared over the past several quarters. I think the marketplace is -- definitely has a very interesting inflection points, whether it's architectural, whether it's form factor base. There's things that are occurring in the marketplace that will change the status quo, and I said in an earlier question, I believe that it's key for us to embrace, be the innovative disruptor, to make sure that we continue to build on that. We have a long track record in x86, and we're going to continue to build on that. It just makes sense. And from a standpoint of Mark, what he brings to the table? Innovation, leadership. He knows the market. He's been a customer. He knows about architectures. And you combine them with the talent that we have in place, which we keep in, and the leaders across the engineering teams. This is an opportunity for us not only to leverage our existing businesses but to see where the puck is getting next. Where is the next evolution of APUs? What -- how do we take that further? We're on the right track there and the right kind of execution. How far can we go on power? How can we leverage these kinds of solutions into server? We're a design organization, a design company, and we need to take those actions to move this ball forward.",350

And then as a follow-up, it looks like your yields are improving but you really haven't figured out the root cause. It looks like it's an iterating process. Do you have a Plan B in place or on the table? Perhaps using your other foundry to kind of fix the problem because it seems they have no issues whatsoever with Brazos and the Llano would be just a continuation of that kind of architecture.",75

I think it's unfair to kind of suggest that we don't have an understanding of the root cause. The analysis that we're doing is machine by machine, step by step. We're making those changes as we speak, and we've begun to see over the past several weeks with this kind of intense maniacal focus on execution with starts of improvement across that set. So I don't want to leave anyone with a feeling that we aren't working that, understanding the issue and have our hands on the rudder and driving this boat. We have work to do. I'll for sure share that, and you know it and I know it. We have to improve our execution. But we have the experience, the expertise that's getting underneath that, that we believe will drive further improvements as we go through the quarter. Thomas,  do you want to add anything?",148

I think it's a every important correction to make. It's not like this is an -- it's a risk process where we don't know where we go. It's a complex situation. It takes a maniacal focus, that's what we already said. We put lots of teams on this problem, from our partner, from our company, from outside, from the ecosystem. And we work hard in that direction.
