With that, let me hand it over to Brian.",244
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679030.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year. Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016, Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy. And our memory business set an all-time record revenue.
At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I also detailed our top 4 priorities for the year: growing the data center and adjacencies; ensuring a strong and healthy PC business; growing IoT and devices; and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far.
First, the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year-over-year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate and analyze data.
We're also on track for midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads. For example, Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating point operations per clock over the current generation, a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads.
And last month, we announced the formation of the artificial intelligence product group, bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products.
Second, a strong and healthy client business. Our annual cadence of product innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year.
Third, we've highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IOTG revenue was up 11% year-over-year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments. We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The transaction will combine mobilized expertise in computer vision with Intel's expertise in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and connectivity. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost.
And finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 55% year-over-year in a tight supply environment; while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter.
In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to a weakness in the data center and comms segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service.
We're making good progress against our 4 top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. These are purposeful investments that will position Intel for years to come. At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can achieve without compromising our most important investments: our transformation or our future.
Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent cybersecurity company just weeks ago, and it is with efficiency in mind that we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which I expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted an additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017, and we're now expecting to do a little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to play a role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities.
To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our client business. We're growing our data center, IoT and memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set of important new productivity goals intended to create value for our owners.
With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.",1058
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679031.0,Presenter Speech,Robert Swan,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel, and 2017 is off to a strong start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We delivered on innovative product and technology road maps across the business. Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp. And Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group.
Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year-over-year. And earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year-over-year, and gross margin came in at 63%, up 0.5 point year-over-year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year-over-year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program.
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels. Client ASPs were up 7% year-over-year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations.
The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A cost, higher product cost as we transitioned to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products.
Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year-over-year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending.
Our memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts.
Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million, and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter.
Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress: first, invest in our business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter, we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $235 million of pretax gains. At quarter-end, cash and other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total debt was $25.8 billion.
Today, we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $10 billion. Currently, we have approximately $15 billion authorization. We expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time.
Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, while we see strong momentum in client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts. We feel great about our annual cadence and product innovations with new product launches planned this year, including Skylake for data center, 8th Generation Core, 64 Tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line. 
Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels. 
Third, the data center business has solid momentum with the midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor. 
And fourth, as I indicated earlier, we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group. We expect to realize a pretax gain of approximately $375 million and a tax liability of approximately $850 million. This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter.
And last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company, and we are making an important commitment to our owners today. We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017, and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which we expect to reach no later than 2020.
As a result, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share. As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security.
We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year-over-year; gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63%; and spending to be approximately $5.2 billion, flat year-over-year. We expect our spending as a percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus last year as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year-over-year.
We feel good about where we are 90 days into our 3-year journey. We exceeded our expectations for Q1 and increased our profit expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing in the future by expanding our TAM from $45 billion to $220 billion. We are already seeing an impact with our growth-oriented businesses up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark.",1135

The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to the high single-digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you could just give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over the next few years.",86
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679035.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,7,"Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is, absolutely, we're still committed to the high single-digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year, it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add that 1 extra week, that's a couple of percent that you're competing against on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general, if you just look at our seasonality, in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in that business, in the data center business. And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we are absolutely committed to that high single-digit growth rate for the rest of the year.",155

And as my follow-up, the very rich mix in PCs, ASPs were up very strongly, how sustainable is that? And are you seeing any effect of competition from AMD's product launches?",34
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679037.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,9,"Sure, I'll start. Bob may want to jump in. Each quarter, we come in here and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that. So we always forecast, if you take a look at the -- what we forecasted for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted a slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now that said, we are continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products. And the demand for those high-end, high-performance products from 2 in 1s, gaming, high-end workstations continues to grow faster than we are even able to project. So right now, we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year. And we -- but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And I -- and we really believe that's a function of our products and our road map. From a competition standpoint, we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as -- there's always some level of competition in this market, but -- and I'd tell you, for Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary from what we normally see.",204

The only thing I would add, Brian, is the -- in the -- with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full year revenue to be up $0.5 billion versus where we were 90 days ago. And I would say one of the contributors to that is kind of how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year.",74

So I'll start. First, I thought it would be good to give you a little background, right, why we do we come out and commit this now and kind of what's our thinking behind this. And part of it is we had good progress, brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016. We're a quarter in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another -- slightly more than 1% as we look at this year. And so we just really took a look at do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February, which is that mid-single-digit type of growth for the overall company. And that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And then the cost reduction and the efficiencies are driving the rest of it.",164

And I would just say that the -- we kind of -- our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was, over the next 3 years, low single-digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income. And that's the -- against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the 3-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward.",130

I guess, as my follow-up, was hoping to take a look at memory and here, would love to hear from you as to how we should think about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year, next and when you would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line.",54
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679044.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,16,"Yes. On the depreciation, we kind of implied in our guidance really no change on a depreciation through course of the year. And what that assumes is roughly $2.5 billion additional CapEx from memory in the year. In terms of profitability, for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, Rob kind of laid out a plan where the Core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really 3 things: good performance on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year, and we said that near the end of 2018, as a whole, the memory business would be profitable. And to the first quarter, growth was stronger than we expected, and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected.",180

So I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. What we said is we're -- for DCG as a business, we're in the high single-digits growth rate. So we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow. From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for some period of time, in fact, backed into latter half of last year, but you really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the server side. And that's absolutely what we had forecasted, and there's no change in that forecast whatsoever.",143

I can start with the modem, and Bob can talk about -- I'm not going to break it out financially. Bob can talk about -- jump on top of this. But for us, on our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it. We are on schedule to bring our next-generation modem into production and customer qualifications this year. And really, looking out over time, we have the next several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective, and then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked at our output from MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side, which is both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication space, is in a space like 5G where the modem and the base station and backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end-to-end solution. From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers, and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new products. But for right now, we're just saying we're continuing to invest and grow that business.",222

And the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will -- particularly because of modem, will have a relatively easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half. And as Brian said, we -- the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year. But given the products we have, we feel relatively good about where we are.",107

You guys just had an Analyst Day like 2 months ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about then. So what's changed in the last 2 months that means you need to roll the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target with some of your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were fairly gung ho about the need to invest to fund growth?",87
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679053.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,25,"So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're kind of asking a couple of questions. So first, from the growth standpoint, our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. And I'd tell you, Q1 is a great example of that with year-over-year growth, another record quarter coming off a record year. And raising the year and forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments we've made, both short term, medium term and long term, to drive that growth. That said, Bob and I have both been looking at now how do we do that and also at the same time, become more and more efficient. And what we've looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent of revenue was very successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually. And then I think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so taking 1% a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth. And that is the effort that we've spent over the last couple months really digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We understand the details behind it. And we've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence.",330

For my follow-up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 35% this quarter. It doesn't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else we've discussed. But it's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected. How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? And do you think, for the full year, you'll actually be within the data center margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day?",101
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679055.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,27,"Yes, I would -- Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG. Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digits and at the lower end of that range, of the 40% to 45%. In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9-point drop in margin, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it will be first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer. As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9 decline are simply a result of how we allocate costs to the business segments. I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year. As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margin seasonality -- from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22- to 14-nanometer. So it's in line with our long-term expectations, no change; our outlook for 2017, no change. The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the data center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology that bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year.",300

The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down just because the percent doesn't change but the dollars are going up?",68
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679060.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,32,"Yes. I mean, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year. Again, it'll be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business. It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs. But you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated, I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs. And then the third thing, higher -- yes, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with an outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations, it'll grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full year operating margins, despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs, at roughly 40% for the year.",176

And then, Brian, as my follow-up, one of the strengths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business. And you're clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year-over-year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful.",122
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679062.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,34,"Sure, John. I'd tell you that the increase in CapEx that you're seeing this year is something that we kind of see as unique. But my guess is that we'll have to continue it for maybe 1 year more or so as we continue to build out that memory factory. But look, if you take a long-term view, I don't expect us to run these kinds of CapEx levels. I -- we'll always make good investments. So in a place like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a positive NPV. But from this current view, we probably have another year and then probably go back down to what we'd consider a more normal rate.",133

And also, you mentioned acceleration services at Alibaba. Can you fill us in on any other key customers adopting Xeon Phi, FPGAs or any of your other accelerators?",47

So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have some additional products that we'll launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill. And from an FPGA or other accelerators, we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers who are continuing to use our FPGAs. But again, we don't break out on a -- by customer standpoint. But we still are committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was down just because of some unique -- there was some extra buying in the latter half of last year around some cloud. And the networking guys are typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year-over-year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year from an FPGA. And then as we go out through the second half of this year, the first of the products comes out in silicon from our Nirvana acquisition, which is another form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with customers, and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional accelerator adding to our full AI portfolio.",222

One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And second, our R&D costs, particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, goes up a little bit. So during the course of the year, our overall costs will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses. And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically.",140

So from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it goes breakeven and beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next year it goes to breakeven. And the overall business does as well. We haven't gotten any more granular than that for right now.",90

It's good to see that commitment. But I wanted to focus a little bit more in the near term. In the first quarter, it was about $100 million above what you had guided. In the second quarter, it's a bit above what I expected, too, especially given McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in the first quarter and where we are in the restructuring benefits and the McAfee benefits? If you can do anything to size either of those in the near term, that will be helpful.",116
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679073.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,45,"Yes. I think first quarter, a little bit over, I'd characterize it primarily in the round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx, and we're committed to our $20.5 billion for the first -- sorry, for the full year. So $10.6 billion in first half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half, and there's really 2 primary drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondly, just the completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half, $10.6 billion; second half, $9.9 billion; McAfee exit, continued execution and feel good about full year of $20.5 billion.",136

It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your revenues and ASPs were a big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good follow-through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it in fact just rounding?",93
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3146.0,1183428.0,48679076.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,48,"I don't know if it's rounding or not. I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through an additional $0.05 of EPS. So we feel great about that. I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for data center. As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the client business and the fast growth of memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margin. So I think when we take that all together through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout through the course of the year. And Q1 was where we expected; Q2, consistent with Q1 and full year.",136

So a, yes, the growth in the memory business that goes through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian factory along with some assumptions around strong ASPs as demand continues to outpace supply the market in general. And so if you take a look from here on, in fact, 2017 by then, as we go out into 2018 and beyond, Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business.",80

I don't think we've actually ever given a bit growth. So that's not a public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always talked about is growth of the business from a profit or revenue standpoint and overall growth, partly because, remember, more and more of that business will become things like 3D XPoint/Optane, and bits will be a little bit different there, right? Not all bits are going to be created equal. That's a very differentiating technology. It's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different than, say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that -- it's around 5% of the business this year, but as you go out into next year and beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology.",209

Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities. And after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%. Our data-centric businesses were up 16% year-over-year. 
Technology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing, the data center and memory. With industry-leading products and a strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year. 
As we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I outlined our top 4 priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The data center business grew 9% in Q2 and remained on track to high single-digit growth for the year. Strong public cloud growth continued, with revenue up 35%. Enterprise was down 11%, as workloads continue to migrate to the cloud and memory and solid-state drive constraints impacted server deployment. Comms service provider revenue was up 17%, while adjacencies, which serve all customer segments, rose 12%. Cloud and comms service provider together are the growth engine in the data center and together now make up 60% of our DCG revenue. 
In 5G, we're demonstrating end-to-end leadership in client and infrastructure. We have 5 ongoing trials with leading global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline. And we're on track with our development of IA, FPGA and ASIC silicon platforms based on new radio standards. 
Earlier this month, we launched Xeon Scalable, formerly known as Skylake, and with it the industry's biggest platform advancement in a decade. Using Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party-verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real-world workloads.
For example, the new AVX-512 instructions, double floating point performance, benefiting use cases like HPC, VR and AI. In fact, artificial intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen-to-gen. And when this silicon innovation is combined with our AI software frameworks optimization, customers, like Amazon Web Services, are seeing inference performance for improvement of more than 100x. The enthusiasm for Xeon Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever. We delivered more than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright performance leadership. The data center is central to our strategy and is a remarkable opportunity. By 2021, we expect the data center to be a $65 billion silicon opportunity, and we're less than 40% of the total available segment today. 
As we build out the adjacencies like Ethernet, silicon photonics and 3D XPoint memory and pool them all together with rack scale design, we'll be positioned to deliver even higher levels of performance and efficiency to our customers and increase our percentage of the total TAM. 
The Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic result. Revenue was up 12% over last year, as product leadership, combined with a disciplined segmentation strategy, led to rising core mix. We, along with our customers and partners in the PC supply chain, are driving the evolution of the PC experience, as users seek out high performance and new form factors. 
We launched a powerful, new Intel Core X-Series processor family, including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition Processor, extending our performance leadership. And we'll be shipping our first 10-nanometer product near the end of the year, beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple SKUs and a volume ramp in the first half of 2018. We've seen some modest improvements in the PC consumption, but we continue to expect a mid-single-digit TAM decline for the full year. 
We also began shipping our next-generation 4G LTE modem, known as the 7480, to customers. As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make great progress with our wireless ecosystem laying the groundwork for 5G. And starting in 2018, Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G showcase at the Olympic Games. 
In our Internet of Things business, we're focused on 4 key verticals: retail, video, industrial and transportation. We saw strong growth across all 4, leading to a 26% increase in revenue. We're specifically excited to see the ramp of our IVI designs with both Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota. We're also about to mark a very important milestone in our transformation. 
We expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, several months earlier than expected. Autonomous driving is a massive compute workload that will disrupt industries and save lives, and we are investing to win in this important segment. I'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving system, data and services market opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud to car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And we're looking forward to talking with you in more detail about our plan and the progress we're making in the segment later this quarter.
Memory and FPGAs round out our priorities for the year. Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record. A cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology. And that differentiation was on display earlier this month when we announced availability of the industry's first and to date only 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs. Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry-leading density at 32 layers. And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64. 
We also shipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane memory for clients, which are available via our OEM partners and channel partners, and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs currently, which will ship for revenue this year. Optane DIMMs remaining on track for availability next year. 
Our memory factory, Fab 68, continues to exceed expectations, ramping ahead of schedule in terms of both output and yield. This will be a big part of our overall supply growth in the second half, which we expect to be greater than 20%. The combination of strong execution and favorable market condition is accelerating our path to profitability. Core NAND returned to profitability this quarter, ahead of our earlier estimate, and we expected it to remain profitable for the balance of the year. We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target. 
Lastly, our FPGA business was down 5% over last year on weaker data center and comp sectors but remain on track to our mid-single-digit growth target for the full year with broad re-acceleration in the second half across markets, including the data center segment. At their Build Conference in May, Microsoft disclosed a major advancement in the deployment of Intel FPGAs, resulting in the industry's fastest public cloud network and new technology for acceleration of deep neural networks. Audi selected Intel for the level 3 autonomous driving systems in its upcoming A8, where our Cyclone V SoC FPGA technology will perform object and map fusion as well as parking pilot and sensor data preprocessing. We're also seeing strong adoption of our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs. We continue to gain key design wins in our focus segments, and we're on track to production later this year. 
To sum it up, I'm very pleased with our progress, and I'm more confident than ever in Intel's future and growth. Based on our strong first half and higher expectations for the PC business and the expected close of Mobileye, we're raising our full year revenue forecast from $60 billion to $61.3 billion and our non-GAAP EPS forecast from $2.85 to $3. 
We continue to see intense competition across our businesses. That's the reality of the attractive markets in which we participate. The competition makes us stronger, and we're ready for it. We're executing well to our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. The PC TAM is down more than 15% versus 4 years ago. Despite that headwind, our revenue is up more than 15%, and our operating profit has grown more than 30%. More than 40% of our revenue now comes from our data-centric businesses, outside the PC sector. And those businesses together are growing at double-digit rates. And while we're growing the top line, we're intensely focused on operating efficiency. 
We now expect spending as a percent of revenue to decline about 160 basis points versus last year, bringing it below 34%, on track to the 30% goal we're committed to, to hit by 2020. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.",1538
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120243.0,Presenter Speech,Robert Swan,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. Like Brian said, we had an outstanding quarter and executed on several important milestones. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, excluding the Intel Security Group. From an earnings perspective, operating income was $4.2 billion, up 30% year-over-year, and EPS of $0.72 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was the result of strong top line growth, good gross margin improvement and excellent spending leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, returned $2.6 billion to shareholders and have capital in place to fund the Mobileye acquisition. The planned acquisition of Mobileye, which will fuel our growth in the automotive segment, is expected to close in Q3, well ahead of our schedule. 
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, a company well positioned to power the cloud and the billions of smart and connected devices. Our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation, with the data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, up 16% year-over-year. Our PC-centric business executed extremely well in a declining market and was up 12%. Our data-centric businesses are more than 40% of the company's overall revenue.
Moving to earnings. We are seeing broad growth across the business, driving 4 points of operating margin leverage and 22% EPS growth year-over-year. Earnings growth is driven by strong top line growth for both the PC and data-centric businesses, improving unit cost with 14-nanometer ramp and gains from the sale of a portion of our equity investments in ASML. 
On our Q1 earnings call, Brian and I talked about our commitment to achieving spending target of approximately 30% of revenue no later than 2020. We've made great progress in the second quarter, as total spending was down 330 basis points year-over-year. We've continued investments in our key priorities, including artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and Moore's Law, while at the same time capturing benefits of our previously announced restructuring program and significant leverage from strong top line growth. R&D spending was down 1 point, and our SG&A costs were down 2.2 points. On a full year basis, we expect direct spending to be below 34%, approximately a 0.5 point better than our prior guidance. 
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on Slide 5. The Client Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.2 billion was up 12% year-over-year. Client ASPs were up 8% year-over-year, as we continue to see strength in our gaming segment and strong core mix. We also continue to see the worldwide supply chain operate at healthy levels. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 58% from a year ago. And the business continues to execute and benefit from a continued improvement in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending.
Moving to Slide 6. The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in both the comms and cloud service provider segments, which are nearly 60% of our DCG revenue. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased technology development cost and higher artificial intelligence and adjacency spending. Versus the first quarter, our revenue accelerated 3%, and our operating margin improved by 3 points. We are on track to our full year guide of revenue growth in the high single digits and operating margin of over 40% for the full year. 
The IoT, NSG and PSG business segments are well positioned to capitalize on the explosion of data and are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 28% year-over-year. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $720 million, growing 26% year-over-year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit was $139 million, up 56% year-over-year on higher volume and ASPs, offset by continued investment in automotive. 
Our memory business had a record revenue of $874 million, up 58% year-over-year, with strong demand from data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $110 million, largely driven by cost associated with 3D XPoint and start-up cost for our memory capacity. Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great progress and is ramping several weeks ahead of schedule. Yields continue to improve, and unit costs are well ahead of expectations. 
The core NAND business returned to profitability in the second quarter. And we expect the core NAND business to be profitable for the full year and the memory business as a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our prior estimates. 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $440 million, down 5% year-over-year. Operating profit was $97 million, flat year-over-year after acquisition-related impacts. We're making good progress in realizing cost synergies with the integration of this business.
Moving to Slide 8. Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and progress. Our priorities: first, invest in the business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, in the quarter we generated $4.7 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased about $1.3 billion of stocks. In addition, we received cash of approximately $900 million as a portion of our Intel Security divestiture. And we generated approximately $1.3 billion from the sales of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $796 million of pretax gains. At quarter end, cash and long-term investments was $34 billion, up $11 billion, and total debt was $32 billion. Offshore cash investments and proceeds from the sale of our ASML investments are being used to fund the Mobileye acquisition.
Now let me turn to guidance on Slide 9. Some context. First, while we see slightly higher PC TAM and supply chain inventory replenishment contributing to higher expectations for annual revenue, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts. Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year, and we expect the memory fab in Dalian to support higher second half demand levels. And third, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter and as such are including expectations for this business into our guidance. Based on these factors, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $1.3 billion to $61.3 billion, operating income guidance by $600 million to $17.9 billion and EPS guidance by $0.15 to $3 per share. The improvement in revenue outlook is driven by a strong first half, higher expectations of the PC business and the inclusion of Mobileye. The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook.
Our outlook for full year spending is $20.7 billion, as we expect modest increases related to revenue growth and the integration of Mobileye. The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue, coupled with gains on sale of our equity investments and the inclusion of Mobileye. We expect Mobileye to contribute approximately $200 million of revenue, $100 million of operating income and $0.02 of EPS in the second half of the year.
And on Slide 11. As we look to the third quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, excluding Intel Security Group. And we expect operating income of $4.8 billion and EPS to be approximately $0.80. 
2017 is shaping up to be another record year for Intel. We feel great about where we are 6 months into our 3-year transformation. We exceeded our EPS expectations for Q2 and increased our profit expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanding market fueled by the growth of data. We are already seeing an impact from our data-centric-oriented businesses, up double digits collectively, as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark.",1384

Thanks, Blayne, for the question. So I'll start, and Bob can add some comments at the end. We think the data center continues to be just a great growth engine for the company. And you saw the 9% growth this quarter. What we have really been also focusing on at the same time is really increasing operating margin, and I want to make that point. You saw our operating margin increased to 38% this quarter. You'll see us continue to raise that operating margin so that we're back at the 40-plus-percent operating margin for the back half and for the year. First, kind of want to kind of lay that groundwork. What we've projected for the second half is quarters that are pretty much in line. We continue to expect enterprise to continue to decline. It declined a bit more in the second quarter than -- I think we had really projected a decline at about 11%. But if you look at Q1, it declined a little less than we expected at 3%, but we still expect it to decline in those high single-digit numbers. Cloud though grew greater than what we expected at 36%. We expect it to be in the mid-20s, probably more likely. And then data center -- I mean networking and comms, 17%. Adjacencies at 12%. So we expect that trend to continue. We don't need any big shift in those trends to really get to that high single-digit growth rate for the data center. We talked about Xeon Scalable. The initial reaction has been extremely positive. You see the largest number of prequalification samples sent out to customers. You see the cloud applications. We try to talk about it. It's the largest performance improvement in a decade gen-to-gen. So we're seeing a very large ramp in the second half as we move on with the Xeon Scalable. And so I think that's what's going to fuel second half '17. And then -- but it's going to continue on into '18 as well. So I think that's kind of how we see the second half playing out.",352

And kind of 2 months in, we see nice acceleration on both top and bottom line. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're comfortable with the full year outlook that we've given. And the only dynamic other than the things Brian highlighted as Q3 comps are a little tougher as we enter the second half of the year, but we feel good about kind of the mix of the business as we go through '17 and beyond. Just to reiterate a point Brian said, with the strong cloud growth and the strong performance in the comms and networking space, we now generate 60% of our revenues from the higher-growth aspects of the business. So we think that, that bears well for us in 2017 but also going into '18 and beyond.",164

You're looking for a breakeven next year. What is driving that? Obviously, memory pricing has been strong, but I was just wondering if there's any other factors you're now adding to that outlook.",45
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120250.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,10,"Sure. So let's make sure we clarify, right? So on traditional NAND, we are breakeven this year, and we broke even actually this quarter. And we expect to remain there the rest of the year. When we talk about for next year, that's inclusive of 3D XPoint. And so the difference is really as we ramp products on 3D XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68, both of those -- whenever you're ramping a factory, you always -- because you have a certain amount of underutilization of the equipment just as you start to get it going, you tend to have slightly higher cost. And so that's what you see as the driver for the rest of the profitability growth as we go into next year. And what I'll also say that the 64-tier NAND product gives us cost and performance advantage just because they're leading-edge products as well. Now it's going to play into as we move to the remainder of this year and next year. So it's 64-tier products on traditional NAND, the ramp out of Fab 68 and then the real start-up and continuation and getting the rest of the products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us everything profitable next year.",210

The trend of -- look, enterprise is going to continue to decline. We estimate, and again, this is just based on what we get from our customers, talking to the industry, it's going to be in a high single-digit decline. I think you'll see quarters like Q2 that was 11%. You'll see quarters like Q1 that were 3% or 4%. We've seen quarters higher than the 11% over the last couple of years. So it's going to be lumpy as we see this shift, but the overall macro shift of enterprise to cloud or traditional on-prem systems to cloud is going to continue. I think we'll also see -- we still, again, talking to our partners, thinking that mid-20s for cloud growth. But I think we'll see quarters like this quarter that was a little bit high. Other quarters we've had in the past have been more in line. So I don't think we're talking about something going normalizing. I'd say it's still going to stay relatively lumpy like this. But if you look at it over the long haul, even if you look at the first half of the year, 11% down this quarter, 3% down last quarter, you take a look at that as on average and you get to that high single-digit number. So I still feel like that's going to be roughly about where it goes down. And then the cloud will continue to grow at that rate plus additional as more of the growth goes into the cloud.",278

I guess for my follow-up, if I could shift gears over to the margin side of things and specifically the fall-through. It was great to see that you guys beat your OpEx guidance for the second quarter. As we think about the full year with revenues going up, why isn't gross margin changing at all? And then the OpEx increase ex Mobileye, is that just the variable comp that comes in with bonuses, et cetera? Or is there something else in that roughly $150 million increase to your spending line?",94
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120256.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,16,"Yes, just on the second one first. The short answer is yes. The combination of the incremental growth and the addition of Mobileye are the primary drivers for the slightly higher spend. I would -- your initial comment on flow-through, to put it into context, from where we were in January, our full year outlook, the revenue is up roughly $1.8 billion. And with that $1.8 billion, there'll be roughly $200 million of costs, primarily Mobileye. So in context, we feel like we're managing the cost and spending side of the business effectively as we position to a 30% spending of revenue by 2020 at the latest. In terms of the gross margin dynamics, I think the trends that you've seen over the last couple of quarters we expect to continue through the year. And it's really ASP improvements, good unit cost performance, volume leverage to the fab kind of working in our favor. And on the flip side, the strong growth of the memory and the modem business and the ramp cost for 10-nanometer are partial offsets. Those dynamics are what has driven the strong gross margins in the 63% range in the first half. And we expect those same dynamics to play out in the second half as well.",211

My question is on the competitive landscape and the data center. There's been a lot of discussion about AMD perhaps posing more competition than it has in the last several years. And I appreciate it's early days and you have a very strong product out. But are you hearing about them more in your customer conversations? Is that a more real threat than it has been in the past? Because they did have an event, they did show up with 10-plus potential customers. And some of the benchmark data, they are showing some performance that is perhaps better at a lower price. So how real is that competition and how are you reacting to it?",120

So I think in general we see competition across almost every one of our platforms, whether it be in the data center or in the client business. And it's come from a variety of sources. You're right, AMD has kind of raised up a bit with their more recent products, but you see us responding. This is a traditional performance battle that we're very accustomed to and we're comfortable in reacting and competing very aggressively in. And so you see us coming out with our Xeon Scalable. You'll see us make maneuvers like we accelerate our Core i9 products, which are all the way up to 18-thread systems on the client-based products. So I'd tell you that, yes, we're seeing increased competitive pressure from a variety of places. But that actually will just drive us even harder, make us better in the end. And we're comfortable that we can make the right products to deliver the right performance against those.",162

What is the timing of products around that node? And as part of that if Bob could remind us how the CapEx and depreciation and OpEx for that node are flowing through the financials?",54
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120261.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,21,"Sure. So on 10 nanometers, we are sampling engineering samples to customers currently. We -- the yields on 10 nanometers are continuing to improve pretty much right in line with the forecasted ramp rates. It's a new technology, so you always have some problems to go solve, but we're pretty comfortable with where we're at right now. Like we said in the earnings script, we are set to qualify the first production products right at -- right towards the end of the year. You'll see those start to ship in the first half of next year, and you'll see a ramp of SKUs. One of the things we're seeing is each one of these technologies -- and actually products that we generate, we're generating quite a few more SKUs, Vivek. And so you'll see a variety of SKUs progressing through to 2018 as we ramp the 10-nanometer products, starting with, I'll call it, more simpler SKUs at the beginning, going all the way through the high-performance, high-complexity SKUs towards the middle and back half of the year, which is -- it's a traditional ramp like you see us push out on a new product ramp.",195

We did indicate that approximately $2.5 billion of that would be for memory. So underlying that, you have $9.5 billion CapEx for the logic business. For 10 nanometer, specifically, you have TD lines and pilot lines going in this year and beginning to scale, as we match the capacity with the production that scales in the first half and second half of next year. So that's reflected in the CapEx guide and the depreciation guide that we gave you earlier in the year, and that hasn't really changed.",111

And to be honest, I'm still wondering why you don't think you can do better than high-single digits. I mean, I know you're calling out the tough comp in Q3, but it's only like 10%, right, which is roughly in line with the full year guidance. It's below kind of the longer-term CAGR. So you're going to seek no comps at that level or higher kind of in the perpetuity. I guess, why call that out as an excuse? And what are the issues in terms of hoping and driving for a bigger lift in the second half versus what you're still currently guiding for with the Skylake SP launch on its way?",128
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120265.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,25,"So I think Stacy, first, we're quite proud of the growth rate we're seeing and especially the growth rates in the growth segments. We're forecasting mid-20s for the cloud business, the networking and storage business and adjacencies on down. What we're having to counter is not only the comps that Bob talked about but the declining function of the enterprise, right? And so that -- those 2 things counter those growth rates. Now as the enterprise continues to shrink, it'll become less and less moving forward. So we agree that over time this will become a smaller and smaller impact to the growth rates. But right now it's still a large enough percentage. It weighs on our ability to get the growth rate higher.",124

We feel great about where we are. First half, up 7%. Full year, up high single digits. Profit expanded during the course of the year and continuing to win in those segment of the market that have differentiated growth rates. So 6 months into the year, we feel good about where we are, and we're excited about the new product that we launched.",81
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120267.0,Question,Stacy Rasgon,,Analysts,27,"Got it. So my follow-up. On the PC side of things, I know you said that the channel's healthy, but you -- it's sound like you also had channel fill in the quarter, and it's also included in the guide going forward. So I guess if the channel's healthy, why is there inventory filling up? And what does that imply as we kind of get to the year and look into next year for the likely trajectory of your product sales into that market?",84
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120268.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,28,"Yes, I think as we look at kind of the quarter performance -- I should start with kind of the TAM overall, and Brian highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We have assumed that PC TAM will continue to decline in the mid-single digits for the full year. On the margin, that might be a little bit better today than what it was 6 months ago. But we're still -- we're not counting on a dramatic change in the PC TAM consumption for the year. That being said, we've taken up our guidance quite a bit. So in that, there's a stronger Q2 performance with a little bit of more healthy inventory channels as we go into the second half of the year. So I wouldn't -- if they were -- if the inventory was maybe a little bit leaner over the last 3 to 4 quarters, I think we'd characterize them in the healthy level now. And we think the ecosystem is building for a second half that's consistent with our outlook for PC TAM.",176

My first question is just around pricing in DCG. It was down about 1% sequentially. There's always a lot of mixed things there. You usually have some commentary about ASPs per bucket. Were they still strong? And I guess more importantly, as you think about the product launches in the back half of the year, at least some of our initial checks are suggesting that customers are kind of chomping at the bit to high -- to buy higher up into the stack, which could drive some good ASPs. Can you talk about your expectations around ASPs and/or attach rates for adjacency data center businesses with the launch of the Xeon Scalable?",123
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3577.0,1262002.0,51120275.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,35,"Sure, John. So we expect the second half of 2017, from an ASP perspective, to be pretty much what you've seen in the past where ASPs continue to increase on the various platforms of Xeon, right? So looking at each one, you'll see ASPs overall increasing. What you're seeing on this is a little bit of mix, right? So as you saw networking and storage grow at 17%, the adjacencies at 12%, those are starting to become a little bit more percentage of that business, and those draw down overall ASPs a little bit. But if you look within just the Xeon core function, those ASPs continue to decline -- to increase at about the normal rates that you'd expect as we move into -- especially as you move into a new architectural like Xeon Scalable.",136

And for my follow-on, just turning to the client compute group. Your ability to sort of segment that market and drive higher mix has been sort of a multiyear endeavor with a lot of success. What inning do you think you guys are in, in that process, especially with AMD coming to market with new product? Is there still a mix -- a potential story here? And what would drive that?",74

I think if you take a look at this, John, what's driven this has not been clever segmentation necessarily. It's been the ability to segment into specific markets and specific performance. And so things like Core i9 are a good example, where you're really targeting performance. And so what you -- what I believe is that what -- the growth areas in the client space gaming, virtual reality, thin and light, they're requiring performance and power. And remember, those are always somewhat tradable as you take a look at the -- and so those trends are going to continue. And that's why -- that's -- as we talk about how do you feel about competition, where do you see competition playing, we believe our leadership in performance will continue to allow that trend to continue and continuing to allow the trend within CCG to continue as well. And that's part of what drove the forecast for the second half.",164

Revenues were up 12%. And I think there's a debate out there as to whether or not you deserve credit for this performance, with skeptics really pointing toward -- to sustainability more than anything else. When you break down that 12%, as you guys mentioned, ASPs are a big part of the increase. My question is as you look at sort of the mix in that business overall is there room to drive ASPs higher and effectively capture more value inside of the PC TAM?",98

Remember, this isn't necessarily us raising prices. So it's not we're out there and going and saying, ""Okay, I'm going to charge $10 more for the next Core i7."" It's actually the percentage of units that are being bought at those higher units. And we continue to deliver higher performance at the same price with each one of these generations. So what you're seeing is actually an overall trend that, yes, units are down. We talked about that, both [ Brian ] and Bob, around TAM being down somewhere in that low- to mid-single-digit range. And that's pretty much in line with what I'm seeing third parties. Sure, some third parties are a little bit better than that. But for the most part, we're within a couple of percent. But yes, we believe that there is room for continued demand for movement upwards. So if you a numbers of Core i7s, a number of Core i9, the number of people buying the performance thin and light laptops, those are going to continue. And you see it in our OEM partners and the type of systems they're producing and the type of systems they're bringing to market. Now they're targeting that more and more as well.",212

It's growing not by raising prices but, to Brian's point, by a market that increasingly values performance. And the operating margins of the business for the first half of the year were up over 50%. So this team through its segmentation is executing extremely well. And then as we mentioned earlier, yes, with that great margin performance, we are redeploying our resources to invest in these data-centric set of businesses that have high-growth characteristics that collectively were up 16% again in the quarter. And through this journey of a PC TAM decline, we have a bigger business, a stronger business and a more profitable business, with an increasing portion, over 40%, coming from high-growth-oriented businesses. So great performance in a declining market, continuing to invest in it and reallocate across our portfolio and feel good about our -- the portfolio we have and with the addition of Mobileye as we head into the second half of the year.",175

But is the core mix as a percentage of units a metric that we should be focusing on? And I -- if I remember correctly, that percentage was close to 70%. I'm curious where it is today.",48

It is, but don't forget even within that core mix, Romit, you have the ability to continue to scale up, so Core i3 versus Core i5 versus Core i7. And now we've introduce the Core i9, right, which is even a higher performance. So we saw earlier on people choosing Core over Pentium or Atom, for example, and you saw the core mix move up. You're now seeing not only that continue to climb, but you're going to see within Core the amount of Core i7s, Core i9s, Core i5s continue to climb as well. And that's why we continue to see that there's legs behind this. And you kind of said, hey, are we getting credit for this, right? We don't think when you look at overall this business, last year's performance with great growth in all of the segments, you look at this year's performance so far in the first half and our projections now in the second half, we think that our ability to segment, to drive better operating margin and to continue to drive performance into the PC and keep it more and more profitable while we invest and grow these other businesses, we think that there's an option around Intel that is quite good.",214

It's very little. We don't give out exact percentages by SKU like that. But I can genuinely tell you that it is really just the beginning of the ramp of the Xeon Scalable. And so its impact into Q2 was minimal at best. What you'll see is as it ramps into the second half it becomes a higher and higher percentage. And really, the big volume is going to be 2018. So that's when it really takes over from way -- the way the data center looks from a revenue and profit standpoint. What we're excited about is -- we talked about the 500,000 units that are out there. That was the highest number of pre-samples. That shows you the demand by the big infrastructure guys around the performance. They were willing to take the product even before, ""We are ready to start shipping it."" And then the number of records we've broken already in performance, we talked about 50 records worldwide already, those are laying the groundwork for how this ramp is going to look and feel as we move into the second half and into '18.",190

In enterprise SSD, I think you guys are still the #2 global market share leader there. And it looks like based on the first half performance you guys are outpacing the market. So I guess the question is, where's the team winning? Is it high capacity? Is it high performance for these enterprise and cloud drives? And similar to maybe some of your peers, is the team currently capacity constrained?",80

So our whole strategy around the memory is that we are focused on differentiation and performance and specifically around supporting the data center. We do sell into client as well, but that's not the main focus of this business. And so I tell you that's -- when we talk about our growth and when we talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we're investing in the future, that 64-tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but at the high-performance end. So we're not going after commodity SSDs that you're going to see even in higher-end workstations necessarily. It's really focused towards the data center products. Even still, there's -- not all SSDs and data centers are high-end performance. So we're comfortable with where we are in the market share. We want to balance those investments against the demand for these high-performance areas and make sure we stay -- we keep that in balance. And our real goal is then to move more and more of the business towards the 3D XPoint as we move into next year because that really differentiates us again as we really change the hierarchy between memory and storage as the data center DIMM memory systems come out.",212

The third quarter exceeded our expectations with revenue of $16.1 billion, which was $400 million better than our outlook. Operating income of $5.6 billion was more than $700 million better than our outlook. Our data-centric businesses grew 15% year-over-year, reaching 45% of our revenue, proving that Intel is becoming a data-centric company. 
The fiscal discipline that Bob and I have talked about is delivering results even faster than we had forecasted, while simultaneously allowing us to focus more on innovation in our key growth segments. 
Revenue grew 2%, or 6% after adjusting for the McAfee transaction. Operating income grew 8%, and earnings per share grew 26%, both reaching all-time records. Added all together, and this was a remarkable quarter in what is shaping up to be a remarkable year. 
Our strategy is to be the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. Our data-centric businesses are the company's growth engine. Individually, these businesses provide great value to our customers. Collectively, they're solving our customers' problems in a way that no individual business or product could. 
We've built a collection of capabilities that is unmatched. At the same time, our PC business remains central to our success. It's a source of great profit, cash flow, scale and intellectual property. We've made great progress in both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses over the last few months, and I'll share a few important milestones that illustrate that progress.
I'm going to start with CCG, which produced exceptional results despite a declining PC TAM. PC market conditions continued to improve, and we achieved record Core i5 plus Core i7 client mix. Our focus on an annual beat rate of innovation and thoughtful segmentation, combined with an investment strategy designed to produce results even in a declining market, is paying off. We're especially excited about the launch of our latest Eighth Generation Core processor, codenamed Coffee Lake. 
The Coffee Lake family includes our first 6-core desktop CPU. And it's our best gaming processor to date, with up to 50% better performance than the competition on top-game titles. We're on track to ship our first low-volume 10-nanometer part by the end of the year. That will be followed by the initial ramp in the first half of 2018, with both high volume and system availability in the second half of 2018. We shipped our first modem into the auto industry, and our modem revenue was up 37% in total over last year. 
Moving on to our data-centric businesses, DCG revenue grew 7% in Q3 and remains on track for high single-digit growth for the year. We saw strong cloud growth outgrew the comm service provider in market. And while the enterprise decline moderated sequentially, we still see workloads moving to the cloud. Cloud and comm service provider revenue combined is nearly 60% of DCG revenue now. 
In less than 3 months, we've had more than 200 Xeon Scalable OEM systems begin production shipments. And our customers across all of our segments are beginning deployments that will continue to ramp in Q4 and through 2018. 
In our Internet of Things business, revenue was up 23% with strengths across the retail, industrial and video segments. We also continue to build momentum in the vehicle infotainment market, winning designs from our competitors at leading automakers. 
Earlier in the quarter, we closed the Mobileye transaction, a full 4 months ahead of schedule. So far this year, Mobileye has won 14 ADAS designs across 14 automakers, a pace well ahead of the 12 wins they recorded all of last year. These designs provide for typical features like automated emergency braking, lane keeping and adaptive cruise control, but several also include next step functionality like highway autonomous driving. 
We're also winning marquee designs for Level 3 and higher levels of autonomy, including our strategic partnership with BMW and Fiat Chrysler.
Most recently, we announced that Waymo's newest vehicles, the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans, feature Intel-based technologies for sensor processing, general compute and connectivity. With 3 million miles of real-world driving, Waymo cars with Intel technology inside have already processed more self-driving car miles than any other autonomous fleet on the U.S. roads. 
Intel and Mobileye provide the auto industry with unmatched product breadth, the architectural flexibility to support open and closed implementations and technology leadership. Our progress in just a few short months illustrates the benefits of our combination. And together, we can deliver the promise of autonomous driving and a safer collision-free future. 
Let's move on now to memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 37% over last year. And operating margin improved significantly as Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continued to beat both its ramp rate and yield goal. Fab 68 accounted for more than half of our supply in the quarter, where more than 70% of the total bits were 3D NAND. Our memory innovation and technology leadership is having an impact. We shipped the industry's first 64-layer data center SSDs and have a strong Optane design win pipeline. That leadership technology has also resulted in strong customer interest in long-term supply agreements, and we've already signed 2 such agreements. Bob will share more about our approach, but this is an important step that will mitigate the short-term cash flow impacts of ramping our memory capacity. 
And finally in our FPGA business, revenue was up 10% over last year with growth in the data center, embedded and automotive segments, where we're ramping designs like the Level 3 autonomous 2018 Audi A8 and DENSO's stereo vision system. Strength in these segments was partially offset by continued weakness in comms infrastructure. 
Our design win revenue value was up more than 10% in the third quarter, its highest level in more than 3 years. This business is essential to our success in artificial intelligence. In Q3, Microsoft announced that it would use our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs for its accelerated deep learning platform that's codenamed Project Brainwave. And as part of a broadening engagement between our companies, Alibaba is using Intel FPGAs to power the acceleration of the service of Alibaba Cloud.
We made tremendous progress in AI and advanced computing technologies over the last few months. In addition to our FPGAs and autonomous driving wins, we launched the Movidius Myriad X, the world's first vision processing unit with a dedicated Neural Compute Engine to deliver artificial intelligence capabilities to the edge in a low-power, high-performance package. 
We also achieved new research milestones, as Intel scientists pursue exciting, emerging forms of compute. We delivered a 17-qubit superconducting test chip for quantum computing to our research partner, QuTech, and we'll follow that up with a 49-qubit test chip by the end of the year. We also unveiled the Loihi, a self-learning test chip that mimics the brain's basic mechanics and makes machine learning faster and more efficient. Later this quarter, we'll ship the Nervana neural network processor, the industry's first commercially available processor of its kind. I also announced last week that Facebook is working in close collaboration with us, sharing their technical insights as we bring this new generation of AI hardware to market. 
Together, these accomplishments reinforce several things for me. First, Intel is the leader in AI inference from the core of the data center to autonomous vehicles, out to the edge devices where low power is especially critical. Second, artificial intelligence takes many forms and will require computing solutions that are tailored for the workload, the environment and the user, rather than a one-size-fits-all. And third, our investments and pipeline of innovation position us to lead for years to come.
We had a quarter any CEO would be proud of. And I'd like to take a moment to remember our former CEO and my friend, Paul Otellini. Paul had an enormous impact on the industry and this company, and his Intel family will miss him. He would be proud of our growing momentum, and it's an important part of his legacy. 
Wrapping things up, I'm excited about both our progress and our prospects. And we're competing aggressively for our $260 billion TAM, the largest opportunity in our history with lots of room to grow market segment share. In some of our segments, we're facing new or resurging competitors. In other segments, we are the new competitor. But in all cases, competition brings out the very best in our company, as our third quarter results demonstrates. 
We're now well ahead of our commitments we made to you in January. Our transformation is accelerating. And we're raising our full year expectations for revenue by $700 million and for operating profit by $900 million, our third consecutive increase this year. This puts us solidly on track to deliver the best year in the company's history for the second year in a row. And with that great news, I'd like to hand it over to Bob.",1479
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187385.0,Presenter Speech,Robert Swan,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. This was an excellent quarter for Intel. Versus the expectations we set out at the beginning of the quarter, our revenue is better, our gross margins were stronger and our spending was lower. As Brian said, we're on track for another record in 2017.
Revenue in the quarter was $16.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year, excluding McAfee, and we achieved record earnings. Operating income was $5.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. And EPS was $1.01, up 26% year-over-year. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we closed the Mobileye transaction and funded a significant portion of the purchase price through the sale of noncore assets, including reducing our position in ASML and proceeds from the partial exit at McAfee. Additionally, we signed long-term NAND supply agreements providing more than $2 billion in prepayments through 2018, significantly improving free cash flow for our memory business. We generated $6.3 billion in cash flow from operations, and we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders.
At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Our Q3 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation. Intel's data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, grew 15% year-over-year and now represent 45% of our revenue, up from approximately 30% in 2012. This collection of businesses is well positioned to capitalize on industry trends, create great value for our customers and represents the company's growth engine going forward.
Our PC-centric business generated flat revenue in the quarter and improved operating margin by over 3 points. The CCG team continues to execute extremely well in a declining PC TAM environment. Our focus on performance-leading products and a smart segmentation strategy is working. This business provides scale, funds IP and generates a significant portion of the company's profits and cash flows. 
Moving to earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 26% year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by solid platform execution, strong growth from our adjacent products and businesses and lower spending, resulting in $408 million growth in operating income. Additionally, we continued to monetize some of our ICAP Portfolio position, resulting in a gain of $0.13 per share.
We made a commitment at the beginning of the year to reduce spending to 30% of revenue by 2020 at the latest, while continuing to invest in key growth areas and capabilities. We are making great progress. Total spending was down 6% year-over-year in the third quarter. We've continued investments in our key priorities, including driving Moore's Law forward, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. 
At the same time, we're executing with operational discipline and generating significant leverage from higher revenue growth. Our R&D spending as a percent of revenue was flat, and our SG&A costs were down 3 points as we rationalize our marketing and sales programs and generate significant leverage in our G&A functions.
In addition, we made changes to our co-marketing programs to provide more flexibility and efficiency to our customers. These changes resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $200 million during the quarter, reducing year-over-year growth in CCG by approximately 2 points and DCG by just over 0.5 point, with a corresponding reduction in spending. These changes collectively have no impact on operating income. The impact of these changes will continue into Q4 at a slightly increased level. 
On a full year basis, we expect direct spending to be approximately 33%, 1 point better than our prior guidance and down over 2 full points from last year. 
Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on Slide 5. The Client Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.9 billion was flat year-over-year and operating margins grew by 3 points. Flat revenue was driven by client ASPs up 7%, unit volume down 7% and our adjacency business up 15%, partially offset by the changes to our co-marketing program. 
We saw a typical Q3 inventory build ahead of the holiday season, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth with operating income growing 8% from strong core mix, continued improvement in 14-nanometer unit cost and lower spending. 
The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year. And operating income of $2.3 billion grew 7%. Q3 operating margin was 46%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in both the comms and cloud service providers segments, which are nearly 60% of our DCG revenue. 
Overall unit volume was up 4%, ASPs were up 2% and adjacencies grew 16%. We launched Purley in Q3, and in less than 3 months, we've had more than 200 OEM systems begin production shipments. 
Revenue scale from leadership products and spending leverage and efficiency drove strong operating income growth for the business. We expect DCG to meet our full year expectations of high single-digit growth and operating margin percent in the low 40s. 
The IoT, NSG and PSG business segments are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 25% year-over-year. Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $849 million, up 23% year-over-year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our retail business. Operating profit was $146 million, down 24% year-over-year from continued investments in the automotive segment. 
We closed the Mobileye transaction early August, 4 months sooner than we expected. The Mobileye team executed extremely well in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations with $82 million in revenue and $39 million in operating income. Going forward, results for the Mobileye acquisition will be included in our all other segment. Increases in spending in this segment will correspond with reductions in the IoTG segment as we realize cost synergies from this acquisition.
Our memory business had record revenue of $891 million, up 37% year-over-year, with strong demand from data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $52 million, an improvement of $82 million versus last year. Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great progress. Yields continue to improve and unit costs are well ahead of expectations. The core NAND business continues to be profitable, and we expect the memory business as a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our prior estimates. 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $469 million, up 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in advanced products, data center, automotive and military. Operating profit was $113 million, up 45% year-over-year. We're making good progress in realizing cost synergies with the integration of this business. 
Moving to Slide 8. Our cash position of $17.5 billion at September 30 is basically unchanged from the beginning of the year, but we've had lots of moving pieces during the year. First, we have generated $7.2 billion in free cash flow year-to-date. And we've returned $7.4 billion to shareholders through the form of dividends of $3.8 billion and share repurchases of $3.6 billion, including $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in the quarter. 
Second, as we mentioned earlier, we closed Mobileye in the third quarter for $14.5 billion in cash and funded over 50% of the purchase price from the sale of noncore assets during the year, including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares. 
Earlier in the year, we received $924 million from the sale of 51% stake in McAfee. And in the quarter, McAfee re-
[Audio Gap] 
notes of $2.2 billion and issued a dividend of $735 million. 
Third, we expect to generate $1.5 billion to $2 billion more free cash flow versus where we were at the beginning of the year. The additional free cash flow is driven by higher earnings, lower CapEx, customer prepayments on supply agreements, partially offset by increases to working capital associated with stronger growth and NSG and modem momentum. 
Based on these factors, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $62 billion, operating income guidance by $900 million to $18.8 billion; and EPS guidance by $0.25 to $3.25 per share. The improvement in revenue outlook is primarily driven by higher expectations of the PC business and continued momentum in memory. 
The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook and lower spending. The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue, coupled with gains on the sale of our equity investments. 
And on Slide 11 as we look to the fourth quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year, excluding McAfee. We expect operating income of $5.2 billion, with gross margins flat year-over-year and spending as a percentage of revenue to be down approximately 2 points. We expect EPS at $0.86 driven by operating margin expansion and higher revenue. 
2017 is shaping up to be a record year for Intel. We feel great about where we are 9 months into our 3-year transformation. Since January, we have raised our revenue outlook by $2.5 billion, our operating income by $1.7 billion and our EPS by $0.45. 
At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanded market. Our PC-centric team continues to operate very well in a down market. And our data-centric businesses are up double digits collectively, as we continue to transform the company to power the cloud and smart connected devices. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",1572

You rattled off a number of AI advancements that Intel is having, whether it be on the Nervana side or the Stratix side. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in there? You mentioned that it's not going to be one size fit all -- fits all. But if you could give a little bit of how Intel does have an advantage versus some of the early movers in that space? And then perhaps more importantly, when will we, externally as investors, be able to start to see the financial benefits of these new products?",104
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187389.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,7,"Sure, Ross. So let's talk about this. We can kind of break this down. So first, we are already seeing the benefits of AI in that number -- as I said, we lead in inference, which is the actual application of artificial intelligence, and we're continuing to really grow in that space. I think AI, if you take look at, in general, machine learning, it's the smallest segment or workload, if you look at the data center, but the fastest growing. So you're going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business. You're seeing the effects in our numbers already around Xeon, Xeon Scalable, the FPGAs. We talked about Microsoft Brainwave's launch that's occurring. So those products, you're going to see, I'll call those more of our traditional products. And also at the lower end outside the data center, things like Movidius and now Mobileye, you're seeing those hit our P&L as well real-time now as we speak. The other products like Nervana, you'll start to see really more towards the back end probably of 2018 from a P&L perspective. If you take a look at Nervana, it actually -- we get our first silicon out. It will be handed out as test silicons. We have a yearly cadence of products. And so I expect the first instantiations to be more people, figuring out how to use it. It won't be a big impact. But as we go through next year and move on beyond that and get the second generation and beyond, that will grow, we believe, quite considerably. And then products like Loihi, which is our neuromorphic, are same thing. That part we put out so far is really a chip for people to begin to use and learn how to program with neuromorphic, which is a very different type of machine learning. It lets you learn at hundreds of times faster rate than traditional, I'll say, GPUs and CPUs, especially around visual learning. Those as well, you'll start to see next -- late next year and beyond, as people really begin to learn how to program with these. So seeing it already and those newer products, I really think late '18 and beyond before they really start to hit P&Ls.",379

And then the follow-up question I had was actually for Bob, and it's on the OpEx side. And congrats on the great operating leverage in the quarter. As we think about the way you can get that operating leverage in the past, Intel seems to have focused mainly on keeping the OpEx relatively flat, and then revenue growth driving that leverage. But in the quarter and then the guide that you just delivered, it looks like OpEx is down about 6% year-over-year. Conceptually, as we go into the next couple of years, how do you think investors should think about the balance of delivering that cadence up to the 30% mark that you're looking for over the next couple of years? Is it more revenue growth? Or you are you indeed going to be cutting the absolute level of OpEx?",141
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187391.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,9,"Yes, Ross, great question. First, as you mentioned, we had great progress in the third quarter. We kind of started the year at a spending level which was a little over 35% of revenue. And we came into 2017 saying that we would get that down to roughly 34%. Reflected in our guidance is it will be closer to 33%. So we're delivering well ahead of our expectations, which have been a function of the 2 things you highlighted: one, much stronger growth; and two, lower spending levels. And those lower spending levels from the first half of this year to the second half are a function of continuing to look at every dollar that we spend, whether it's R&D, whether it sales and marketing, or whether it's G&A and making sure that those dollars are allocated towards the biggest growth opportunities. And we're not to redeploy that capital or to get it out of the ecosystem. So our first half to second half spend levels will be down roughly $700 million on a business that will be roughly $2.5 billion bigger in the second half versus the first half. So we're making great progress and making real trade-offs on our spending levels and getting the benefit of stronger growth. And we expect the combination of those 2 to continue as we go forward.",224

But it continues to look to be the same trend, almost entirely from PC and memory. In the meantime, I mean this is, in your words, your biggest server refresh in a decade, and we're not seeing any upside. We're doing 7% year-over-year pretty much for the full year, which I guess I would classify as barely high single digit. We're not really seeing meaningful ASP increases from mix as Purley. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a view on, I guess, your expectations for data center, where it's coming in, why we're not seeing more upside from the Purley ramp versus what we've seen from prior platform introductions, and whether or not 7% actually would qualify as high single digits by your definition.",154

First, because you've kind of got a couple of questions in there, the way I would tell you is that the Purley ramp has just really started. It starts with the big comm service providers. You saw Google talk about it a couple of weeks ago. You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this week. Those ramps are just beginning. I talked about the 200 design wins or design-ins at customers. Those are starting to come out. So we are really early. These ramps, remember because we have to -- it will go through the cloud service providers and then the Tier 2 cloud service provider, then on into comms and eventually into enterprise as well. This is going to be -- take a year or more. So it's -- I think it's early to make this judgment. The ramp's right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product. Your second part of your question is 7% high single digits. I will just make it simple and say, look, if you look, mathematically, I think it would meet a minima of high single digits, but it's certainly not necessarily where we're targeting to get to, but it's a high single-digit number. I'm not going to -- the math doesn't lie.",226
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187395.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,13,"Just to maybe add a little bit, I think the first part of your question, overall growth for the year relative to the expectations back in January, revenue will be up $2.5 billion. Obviously, PC is a significant part of that. Memory is growing faster. IoT is growing faster. PSG and data center -- PSG faster in the second half versus the first half, and DCG in line with our full year outlook at the beginning of the year to be high single digits. So real good strength on clients, on memory, on IoT and in line with the other businesses. The other thing I would just offer to -- follow up on Brian's commentary on DCG growth -- maybe 2 things. One, we started out at 6% in Q1. We were at 9% in Q2. We're at 7% in Q3 off a real tough comp last year of double-digit growth in the third quarter. So I would say from a top line perspective, we're right in line with kind of the guide that we gave at the end of the year. And secondly and as importantly, our operating margins has continued to grow significantly quarter-on-quarter through the course of the year, with 46% operating margins in the third quarter. And we told you early on despite a relatively slow start, we expect that operating margin for DCG to be above 40% for the year, and we're well on track to hit that important metric as well. So 9 months through the year, a great start to the year for us, and DCG in line with our expectations and building momentum as we exit the year.",276

I want to ask about gross margins really quick. So revenue was up 0.6%. I guess, year-over-year, excluding McAfee. Gross margins are down like 90 bps year-over-year. I was wondering -- I was hoping you could give us some color on the drivers of that shift. And in particular, how should we think about the trajectory exiting the year into 2018, puts and takes on gross margins as we go into next year and given what we've seen this year?",82
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187398.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,16,"Yes. On your first part, we laid out for the year 63% gross margins, and we're pretty much in line with that throughout the first -- in the first 9 months. And our outlook for Q4 is another 63%. So in line with kind of full year outlook, which is in the high end of our historical guide range. So we feel pretty good about where we are. And for the dynamics underneath the covers, the trends have been very consistent, volume leverage with good scale going through the fabs. ASPs modestly better, much better in the first half on easier comps, slightly better in the second half on tougher comps. Unit costs continues to come down. The ramp costs associated with 10-nanometer are lower. And offsetting those, you really have 3 things going on. One, we have a high growth in our adjacent businesses, memory and modem, that weigh on -- that are a big contributor to improved earnings, but they weigh on our gross margin. Secondly, we have higher engineering samples in the -- as we go into the fourth quarter. And third, the co-marketing change that we -- that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Stacy, that has no impact in operating income, but a modest impact on gross margin, but offset by lower spending levels. So you take those all into account, and they have delivered solid Q3 dynamics, solid Q4 outlook. And the one change between Q3 and Q4 is primarily attributable to the mix of the higher growth adjacency businesses. Those trends and those dynamics, we'll talk much more about 2018 in January, but those trends have been fairly consistent for the last 4 quarters.",281

In DCG, op margin was up a ton. It's actually above your kind of full year. So just kind of curious where those cuts came from. And then as you look forward, I know you're not going to forecast for next year. But is there any reason why the spending will go up and down from here?",71

The first half gross margin -- I should say operating margins were lower, second half much stronger. Fundamentally, it's less about cuts, to be honest with you. It's more about continuing to grow the top line, continuing to get ASP improvements or compensated for the performance that we're delivering; modestly -- and modestly lower unit costs. So the combination of those 3 are getting really good leverage and allow us to expand operating margins while we continue to invest in obviously Xeon, but also in artificial intelligence. So that's what's driven the kind of first half to second half dynamics. And as I indicated, we kind of started out the year saying that we were highly confident we'd be above 40 for the year. And that's kind of how it's played out during the course of the year.",139

And then I wanted to go back to a question on AI and inference. Brian, I was wondering if you just comment on today -- I think you said it was small. Just curious, out of the cloud spend, how much is inference today? And when you look at future workloads driving server units, where could that be in a couple of years?",64

We don't separate out inference. So we -- what we said is simply in the past publicly that AI is -- one of the smallest workloads, but one of the fastest growing. We haven't broken out. We don't -- beyond just saying there's -- here's what cloud is growing at and here's what comms and here's what enterprises, we don't break out by workloads. And there's a variety of reasons for that. Part of it is it's sometimes hard. The mixture of what -- when somebody goes out and build a rack, what is it going into, how much of its workload is really being used by AI is -- anybody who tells you exactly what that number is, is just wrong, to be honest with you. So it's hard for us to say with precision, x percent of our units went into AI workloads, because it's rare that a rack is purely AI except for in rare cases. But we know that's it's small, despite the type of interactions we have, but also fast growing and one of the biggest areas of interest.",185

In the calendar third quarter, you actually I think had revenue up about $500 million sequentially in that business roughly, and operating profits grew by about $600 million sequentially. Can you just help us understand what drove that dynamic? Where there any onetimes? And just given how strong the operating margin is, I know you've reaffirmed for the full year. But is the Q3 level the new sort of norm we should start basing operating profit off of? Or was there something specific in Q3 that drove the op margin leverage above 100% sequentially?",109
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187406.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,24,"No onetimers. It's in one sense, John, it's no real surprises for us. We anticipated growing throughout the year. We anticipated higher ASPs, i.e., sequentially ASPs being a little bit stronger, and that would drive incremental operating income. And some of the benefits, just a lower overall G&A spending for the company is benefiting all the different P&Ls that G&A is actually lower. So that's what's really been driving the improvement sequentially. And as you can tell from our full year guide, there'll be more of the same in Q4 relative to Q3. And then we'll, in terms of implications going forward, we got a great business. We've redefined the role we play in the data center business to be a not high 90% share player, but a 30% share player with lots of room to grow. And we expect that to be a continued important source of growth, both top and bottom line for the company. The specifics around that, we'll talk more about it in January.",168

Maybe for my follow-up for Brian, Brian, I know this is not a big part of your growth strategy going forward. But as you mentioned in your prepared comments, CCG is still very important to scale advantages, to profitability, to free cash flow, to your ability to invest in growth markets. And that's been a business that's been sort of remarkably stable over the last 4 or 5 quarters. It's grown over the last couple of years, in part because we've had relatively easy compares in the PC market. So I'm kind of curious as you think about this business over the next, call it 4 to 8 quarters, how are you guys thinking about the corporate upgrade cycle or refresh cycle on PCs, the consumer refresh cycle, the gaming market, and I guess importantly, the modem business, which is becoming a bigger and bigger part of this business over time? Do you think you can still keep this business sort of on a flat growth trajectory? Or how are you thinking about it?",177
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187408.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,26,"Sure. So you've captured that quite well, right? Let's just talk about there -- we can talk about it from a unit standpoint and then we can talk about it from how has our business done. From a unit standpoint, the decline has certainly slowed down, right? We -- if you go back a year or 2 ago, we were high single digits to low teens declines at times year-over-year from a unit basis. And that slowed into the low single digits that we're seeing today, but we still are seeing a decline on a unit level. And I always remind people, we've taken probably something like 25% of the annual units out of this business, yet grown in that time frame the profitability of that business significantly. So that I think just talks about both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the leadership that, that team, at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg Bryant, have really delivered to the company. So our view is, John, that if you take a long-term view, we see the pattern kind of stabilizing at about where it is. I think we'll come in here, and there'll be quarters when the units are up slightly, and there'll be quarters when the units are down a little more slightly. But when we looked at it over the long haul, they're probably going to be down, those low single digits. But we also see segments that are growing that are very performance-focused, which allow us opportunities. So you talked about gaming, 2-in-1 devices, thin and light, the Ultrabook, as we like to think about it from the old. Those products are continuing to see growth actually. And they are pushing that record Core i5, i7. They're pushing the desire for Core i9, which is a new product that we introduced, right? Those are what's driving the segmentation, the ASP uplift and the increased profitability. We think to some level, that trend will continue. How long, I -- I'm not going to be that good of a prognosticator, but certainly for the near-term future, we don't see this trend shifting very much.",361

I'm excited about the modem business. We -- we've I think really gotten a team together that is world-class. We believe we now are on a yearly cadence of world-class modems, which is really critical. That's a big hurdle to get that technology to where you can reliably put out a yearly cadence, a world-class modem. We believe we're there now.

I -- Bob, I think some of us who are more on the optimistic side definitely see a path to $4 of EPS, which makes look -- makes Intel look compelling. I think some of the pushback, though, has been among value investors who look at free cash flow. In this year for example, even with the equity gains, it looks like free cash flow is tracking down. So I know that this is an investment year, but how should people be thinking about free cash flow growth relative to EPS growth next year and maybe even 2019 as well?",103

Because we're saying that our current forecast is -- will be much better than kind of where we started the year. And that improvement is really a function of 3 things: one, earnings growth, more operating earnings growth as opposed to the ICAP gains, but real solid operating earnings growth; secondly, we reduced our CapEx outlook for the year from $12 billion to $11.5 billion this year; and third, we -- the long-term agreements that we signed in the year. One of the benefits on what we're trying to do is really match our net capital deployed in memory in conjunction with demand from strategic clients and partners, which has the effect of reducing the impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flows of the business that makes sense for our customers and makes sense for us. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. The biggest gap between our earnings performance and our free cash flow performance has been the higher capital associated with growth, number one, but in particular, memory. And we're really looking for opportunities to reduce our net capital deployed into memory, which in turn will grow free cash flow over time, just closer and closer to our EPS growth.",241

So if we look at the 4 subsegments, cloud, comm service provider, enterprise, adjacencies, if you just look at those buckets as a silo as you ramp Skylake, did ASPs move higher in all of those subsegments?

So as we continue to transition -- we're still transitioning Haswell to Broadwell, which all else equal, there is positive ASP implications as we transition to Xeon Scalable and deliver higher performance. That growing mix of higher performance products is the single biggest contributor to ASP. We're still in the early days, as Brian mentioned in Xeon Scalable, but that is a higher performance product. And we would expect that will share in the benefits of high performance for our clients with higher ASPs, but that's the biggest dynamic.",117

It's not going to be the early part of the 10-nanometer, though. It just -- you got to look at the design cycles. And you make a decision like that, even you make it last year. You'll start to see the effect of the back end of 10-nanometers, and you'll really see it affect, 7-nanometers. So not these early products on 10, no.

You talked about in the script and in some of the Q&A here, some changes to the co-marketing programs and the like going forward in both the PC and the data center business. Is there any way you could maybe bound for us the size of those and their contributions to what the run rate has been of overall OpEx, and what kind of opportunities there are potentially to further restructure those going forward?",88

That's the intent of what we're trying to accomplish. And we're pretty excited about the change. The quantification of that strategy, in essence in the third quarter, was roughly $200 million that, in essence, shifted from spending to contra revenue. So no impact on operating income dollars, but roughly $200 million lower revenue, $200 million lower spending. And we expect that to be modestly higher as we go into the fourth quarter. So again, more effective and efficient way to spend our marketing dollars in conjunction with tailoring programs for -- with the OEMs. That drives a change in the geography of how those dollars were reflected in our P&L, but doesn't really impact our operating income.",171

And then as a follow-up, Brian, in automotive space, I think you mentioned 14 ADAS wins from Mobileye versus 12 of all last year. And that's sort of in the ADAS space, and you have some of your competitors making quite bold announcements about wins towards autonomous driving programs long term. Maybe you could talk about how commitments are being made in ADAS versus autonomous, and then how the acquisition that you've seen so far of Mobileye has maybe pulled some of your computing assets into these conversations for longer term with autonomous?",97
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2017",2017-10-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3772.0,1323903.0,53187425.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,43,"Sure. That's a great question. So we kind of mentioned that even out of those 14, many of those continue on up into Level 3, Level 4. The Level 5 work that you see out there is pretty far out there. And I'll tell you that's -- there's a lot of just kind of experimental work going on there. If I take a look at though kind of a bigger picture, which is what you're asking is, this whole picture that we've been putting together is, I kind of said in the statement that, individually, these businesses are great. But when you pull these together into one package and you're able to walk into a customer with a complete solution, they're truly world-class and something nobody else can deliver. So you're right, when we go into and we talk to somebody about autonomous driving in general, whether it's Level 2 plus, Level 3, Level 4, Level 5, we bring with us a suite of products, depending on what kind of architecture. And they're -- what we're seeing is different OEMs, different customers thinking about those architectures even differently across that spectrum. Some are thinking, ""Well, by Level 5, I think my skills will be up. I want a closed system. I want to have much more of the control of the software."" So we have a set of solutions we bring to them there. Some of them want to have more FPGAs for how they bring their software down onto the silicon earlier on. But what we're able to do is bring our modems. We shipped -- and we mentioned it in the release that -- our first automotive modem. So we're able to bring automotive modems all the way through 5G. Most of these car companies are having to build data centers. And not just data centers, centralized data centers, but really a data center kind of architecture that goes all the way out with data and compute at the edge. You're going to want to be able to manipulate and transfer mapping, high-precision mapping to the cars and data back from the cars to change those maps, construction and things like that. So we're building that architecture. And we have the products and the talent to uniquely work with them all through that infrastructure. And then you get out to the car again and we can bring the FPGA, the Mobileye for center fusion or compute. We can put Xeons in there. And so we -- in each one of these discussions, they're all a bit different. They all have multiple phases as you go to 3, 4 and 5 on the levels. And what we're able to do is say you don't just have to take this one solution. This is not the only solution there is. What would you like to do? What best solves your problem in the most cost-effective lower -- lowest power efficient way? How much work do you want us to do in software development versus how much work do you want to own and have IP within your company? And that's changing, as we said, over time. And that's part of also why we're building out that 100-car fleet. Amnon has really has driven a vision that says it's one thing to bring foils to a meeting. It's another thing to bring a car and say now let's go out and drive, and show you how all of these fit together. And so all of that is -- this package that we have is unique, and it's resonating quite well as we walk into the various car OEMs. And I'm out there with them in various modes almost every week, every other week. Amnon's out. We're all talking about a complete package.",631

I'd like to cover 3 things with you today before handing off to Bob: a brief review of our results for the year, an update on the transformation of the company and a look ahead at 2017 and Intel's future.
First, the review of our results. Q4 was a strong finish to a record year in which we grew revenue 7% and net income 9%. The Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things and Intel Security all grew in 2016, with DCG and IoTG setting full year revenue and volume records. The acquisition of Altera added 3 percentage points to our overall growth rate. In the Data Center, cloud service provider revenue grew 24%, while enterprise revenue was down 3% for the full year. Additionally, we are very excited that com service provider revenue grew 19%; and across all of our customer categories, adjacency revenue grew an incredible 21%, with strength in Ethernet controllers, Omni-Path product controllers and switches and network ASIC.
IoT revenue was up 15% for the full year, driven by strength in the video, retail and industrial segments. 
In Q4, we launched new Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake products, and we won key designs in automotive and video. Our memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue, while full year revenue was down 1%. This was an investment year for the memory business, but NSG operating margins improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter. We are now shipping 3D NAND from our Fab 68, and we just qualified our first 3D XPoint-based octane SSDs, which we expect to ship for revenue in the first quarter. And our 3D XPoint memory DIMMs have sampled to data center customers.
The Client Computing business achieved impressive results, driven by strong execution and higher ASPs as customers bought a richer mix of Intel Core products. This was also a breakout year for CCG's wireless communication product line. Our 7360 LTE modem ramped into high volume, and we shipped record WiFi units. I'm very proud of the Client Computing business and what this team has delivered in 2016.
Our strategy of delivering consistent product leadership, segmentation and differentiation paid off. We achieved record i7 units and overall Core mix in 2016, and Client Computing revenue was up 2% for the year despite a declining PC market.
The Programmable Solutions Group was up about 7% on a non-GAAP basis over Altera's 2015 results. PSG saw strength across many segments, with particular strength in compute and storage. The Programmable Solutions business sampled the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGAs this year, known as Stratix 10. This product line has the largest demand pipeline in Altera's history. The integration of Altera into Intel was an important milestone in what was a transformative year for Intel. This team did a great job of meeting integration objectives while continuing to deliver new products and grow the business.
In 2016, we took other important and, in some cases, difficult, steps to position the company for future success, improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy and accelerate our transformation to the company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Our restructuring initiative focused on our investments on the product and technologies that will fuel our growth. And that work, combined with improvements in 14-nanometer costs, drove a 30% operating margin improvement in our client business.
Our decision to establish McAfee as a separate independent company was another transformative move. This transaction will give McAfee the flexibility to invest independently, tighten our focus, and allow Intel to share in McAfee's future success as the market demand for world-class security products continues to grow.
And finally, looking ahead to 2017 and Intel's future, I'm confident we're making the right investments to compete and win, not only in the segments where Intel's strong today but also in new areas that are poised for growth driven by the emerging flood of data. By 2020, the average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes of data per day, while smart and connected devices of the future will produce data at many times that rate. Autonomous cars, for example, will generate about 4,000 gigabytes of data each day. The resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous opportunities. But data alone isn't valuable. It's the transmission, aggregation and analysis of the data that results in value and impact. Intel will play a central role in those steps because our products are key to turning raw data into high-value insights and information. 
Our investments in advanced research and development are making this all possible, while significantly expanding our TAM at the same time. These investments are creating opportunities in segments from autonomous driving, where we are uniquely positioned to be the compute engine in the vehicle and the data center, to 5G, where we are building on our momentum in 4G to establish leadership, to artificial intelligence, where we are providing the industry's most complete range of products to accelerate all AI solutions from the edge to the data center.
We're already seeing signs of progress. In autonomous driving, we are winning key designs like BMW, Delphi and Baidu. In 5G, we are leading in the definition of standards, prototyping and field trials. Our network business saw strong growth as infrastructure moved to Intel Architecture in anticipation of 5G. Our design wins and network virtualization innovation position us for leadership share in the wireless access market. Other proof points of our progress include important partnerships with AT&T, SK Telecom, Korea Telecom and Verizon. And the announcement earlier this month of the industry's first global 5G modem.
Finally, in artificial intelligence, we believe we have the industry's strongest product portfolio. Intel processors power well over 90% of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads and we are winning the vast majority of AI solutions based on strong product performance and customer value.
Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with Intel's performance in 2016. We have important work to do in 2017 as we continue to transform the company, but the progress we've made leaves me increasingly confident in Intel's growth and Intel's future. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.",1033
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603018.0,Presenter Speech,Robert Swan,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter. Revenue was up 10%, operating income was up 11% and EPS was up 4% year-over-year.
Revenue set an all-time record of $16.4 billion, and operating income was $4.9 billion. Fourth quarter operating margin was 30%, flat year-over-year. Gross margin, at 63%, was down 2 points, primarily driven by a couple of onetime events related to product warranty costs and long-term IP agreements. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, up 4% year-over-year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue. Earnings per share of $0.79 was up $0.03 from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had a revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy and we saw some inventory burn during the quarter. Client ASPs were up 7% year-over-year, and Core mix was at an all-time high as a result of the success of our segmentation strategies and strength in gaming and high-end systems. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 30% from a year ago as the business continues to benefit from lower spending, richer product mix and continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit costs.
The Data Center Group had a record revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see robust growth in the cloud and com service provider segments of the business, which both grew approximately 30% year-over-year, partially offset by a 7% decline in the enterprise and government segment over the same horizon. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.9 billion, down 14% year-over-year. Operating margin was impacted by about 2 onetime items I referred to earlier and the ramp of 14-nanometer on our server products, which we expect to generate continued cost improvements over time.
Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $726 million, growing 16% year-over-year, driven by strength in both retail and industrial segments. Operating profit for the business was $182 million, up 37% year-over-year.
Our memory business had a record revenue of $816 million, up 25% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions, with demand signals outpacing supply. 
We've made great progress ramping Fab 68, with yields and unit cost well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $91 million, largely driven by cost associated with 3D XPoint and startup costs for our memory capacity.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $420 million, and operating profit was $80 million. 
Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $550 million and operating profit of $103 million.
Turning to the full year 2016, revenue grew 7%, operating margin grew 11% and EPS grew 9%. Operating margin percent improved by 1 point while gross margin was approximately 63%, flat to 2015. Spending was $21 billion or 35.4% of revenue, down 1 point from 2015, primarily from the restructuring programs we began earlier in the year.
Operating profit for the year was $16.5 billion. Earnings per share for the year was $2.72, up $0.23 from the prior year.
In 2016, the business generated record cash from operations of $21.8 billion. 
We purchased $9.6 billion in capital assets, paid $4.9 billion in dividends and repurchased about $2.6 billion of stock. 
Total cash balance was $17.1 billion, down $8.2 billion. Total debt was $25.3 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is approximately negative $2.3 billion.
Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, our guidance assumes a stable macroeconomic environment but we have taken a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third parties, particularly in our outlook for the emerging markets, including Russia, China and Latin America. 
Second, for the data center. We continue to expect similar growth rates in the cloud and com segments but we are not expecting an improvement in enterprise. This gets us to an expectation of high single-digit growth in the Data Center business. 
Third, as a reminder, we have 1 less week as a result of the inclusion of an extra work week in 2016. 
And last, we have assumed the Intel Security transaction will close in Q2, and our full year guidance reflects 1 full quarter of the group's consolidated results. We have lots of work to do to close this out, and in the event the close happens at the end of the second quarter, we would update our full year guidance by approximately an additional $500 million of revenue and $100 million of operating income.
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2017, we are forecasting a midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year and down from the fourth quarter. This is at the lower end of our seasonal range and reflects an expectation of lower Core brand mix and ASP, coming off a strong holiday selling period for gaming and other premium PC systems.
For the first quarter, we expect operating margin percent to increase 4 points year-over-year, gross margins to be flat at approximately 63% and spending to be $5.3 billion, down 1%. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.65, up 20% year-over-year.
Turning to the full year 2017, we're expecting revenue to be roughly flat. Revenue is expected to grow in the low single digits after excluding the Intel Security Group from both years. We expect operating margin percent to be up 1 point year-over-year, with flat gross margins and direct spending as a percent of revenue down 1 point versus 2016.
Let me provide a bit more detail on our year-over-year direct spending. Our restructuring plans are on track, including reducing our headcount by approximately 15,000 heads and generating gross savings of $1.6 billion. We are reallocating investments from CCG to higher growth segments and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership position in Moore's Law and expand TAM opportunities such as memory and autonomous driving.
We anticipate the net benefit of these actions to result in an additional point of improvement in direct spending as a percent of revenue in 2017. 
We expect EPS of approximately $2.80, up 3% year-over-year.
In 2016, we had a fairly significant gain from our ICAP portfolio. Our 2017 guidance assumes that we'll have gains roughly in line with 2016 levels. The capital spending forecast for 2017 is $12 billion, up $2.5 billion from 2016 as we continue to ramp our memory capacity.
In closing, 2016 started out slow but finished strong. Our CCG business is focused and executing extremely well in a declining market and provides scale that's required to advance Moore's Law, generate significant cash flows and enables investments for growth. Our growth-oriented businesses were up 15% collectively as we continue to transform the company from PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud.
We are excited about our plans for 2017 as we continue with our transformation, and we look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in February.
With that, let me turn it over back to Mark.",1188

So the CCG operating margins were, I think, the highest in the last few years. DCG was kind of the lowest in the last few years. Can you just talk about the trend in operating margins for those 2 segments for this year, given the guidance?",52
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603022.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,7,"Yes, Chris. The CCG performance, a couple of dynamics that are driving the kind of record margins: one, higher ASPs on the strong mix that Brian referred to; secondly, real strong unit costs. It's been on 14-nanometer for a while, so we expect that to continue. And then constrained investments in the CCG business as we focus more on investing heavier in the higher-growth businesses. So real good performance, and those are the dynamics that we're expecting in 2017. On the DCG front, good in kind of Q4, and then project forward, nice ASP performance in the quarter as we migrate from Haswell to Broadwell. And as we think about Skylake in 2017, we expect that to continue. Unit cost in DCG is a little bit higher because we're coming off more great unit cost performance on 22-nanometer. But as we migrate to 14-nanometer in the earlier stages of that cycle, unit costs are a little bit higher. And then we're increasing our investments in DCG on a year-over-year basis. So dynamics are relatively good. The one -- I referred to it a little bit earlier that in terms of Q4, we had a couple of onetime items that really weighed on the profitability or operating margins of DCG that we think are well bounded and do not expect to continue in 2017. And just quickly, one, we entered into a long-term cross-license agreement and patent purchase agreement, particularly in the com space in the quarter. And DCG was impacted by a portion of that cost in the quarter. But secondly and a little bit more significant, we had a -- we were observing a product quality issue in the fourth quarter, with slightly higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints. And we established a reserve to deal with that. We think we have it relatively well bounded with a minor design fix that we're working with our clients to resolve. So those 2 one-timers in the fourth quarter weighed on DCG margins, and we do not expect that to continue in 2017.",346

How sustainable is it? Any thoughts on PC unit growth for this year?",28
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603024.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,9,"So this is Brian. I can start, and then Bob can add in. If you take a look -- Bob mentioned in his portion of the talk of hey, we've taken a slightly more conservative view of 2017 than third parties for what we see the overall PC unit market has. And we had extremely strong -- I mean, record Core i7, just record Core mix in the fourth quarter that we've -- as we look at Q1 and we look at 2017, we've factored a little bit of caution into that as well. Those 2 things put us in the PC market at the unit level in the mid-single digits decline. That's better than if you went back a year or so ago, we were in the high single digits depending on how you looked at it and the way you counted some of the 2-in-1 devices. So it is starting to get better, but I don't think we're back in to 0 unit or positive unit. But as Bob said, what we really have been focusing on in that space is how do you make money, how do you sell up, how do you do better business performance in that kind of market. And we're comfortable that we can continue that into 2017.",215

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603027.0,Question,Joseph Moore,,Analysts,12,"I wonder if I could ask about the DCG commentary of being up high single digits. Obviously, it's a little bit more conservative than the longer-term numbers you had talked about. And I guess as you think about that, is that -- is there an element of the cloud spending that you think is causing the enterprise to be weaker? Or maybe give us some qualitative underpinnings for that change.",70
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603028.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,13,"Sure. So let me start, and then, again, Bob can kind of jump in on this one. As we said, we took a look at the 2017 view on the enterprise to be relatively equivalent to what we saw in 2016, which says that enterprise continues to decline. I think that's certainly -- some of that is that it's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected. It's also been a little bit slow about developing private clouds, and we're working with several partners like Microsoft Azure and others around the private cloud segment as well for the enterprise. But if you take a look at the long term, we still see this as the growth engine and still getting into that double-digit regime. Remember, for us, enterprise is now less than 50% of our overall data center business. And the areas that are growing even faster or as fast as cloud, in most cases, are the networking and storage space, which we have very low market share in still, and it's a great opportunity for us; and then the emerging areas like silicon photonics, Omni-Path fabric, rack scale design and 3D XPoint. And those areas are really what we've always forecasted to be the growth engine of the Data Center Group as we exit -- go towards the back half of this decade. So for us, our view is this is a -- any time you're going through a market transition, you're not going to get the cloud-to-enterprise mix perfect. And this is an anomaly right now that we've forecasted, we think, accurately and adjusted for the way it is. But our long-term growth was actually based on other factors, and we're still very, very confident in those growth areas. I don't know if Bob wants to add.",310

And then separately on the PC market, the ASP growth that you guys saw over the course of 2016, is that strictly mix shift and kind of strength in the higher-end segments, as you've been talking about? And any thoughts on your ability to continue that price momentum over the course of this year?",57
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603031.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,16,"Sure, yes. It's mostly, if not, in almost every case, all mix shift. And it's our customers buying up. And a great example was the case SKUs, the enthusiasts, the 10 Core systems that we've put out there. And they far and away exceeded our original sales forecast for people who are out there buying 10 Core gaming systems. So we do believe that, that market, that enthusiast market, will continue. We factored a little bit more caution into this as we go into the -- 2017 in the first quarter. Some of that seasonality -- holiday, people try to buy a lot of gaming systems, and some of it's just how much more can people buy up, and so how much more growth in ASP can we see? But we don't see a decline or anything of the average ASPs.",141

On flat revenues, it's great to see some OpEx leverage on there, but I think some people are hoping for a little bit more, as you had the restructuring only halfway done and then the McAfee sale that's pending. So can you talk conceptually how you balance the desire to reinvest versus the desire to get the profitability up to your long-term targets?",80
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603035.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,20,"Sure. I'll let Bob talk about the McAfee financials and how that affects OpEx; it is a little complex with Q1 -- in the Q1 target there, but let's just talk about it in general. What we've always said is that we were going to go through the program that we went through at the end of last -- or the middle of last year, which we called ACT [ph], just continue it through the end of last year, 2016, and we said would be completed about the middle of '17. And we always said there'd be some mix between taking that to the bottom line and reinvesting it in those growth areas. And so as we've done acquisitions like Nervana or artificial intelligence, we want to invest in those businesses now, then bring them onto our silicon, then integrate them into our software stack. And so we're going to make those kinds of investments in key areas. We said that key areas are around artificial -- or data center in general. We have rack scale design, we have 3D XPoint, we have artificial intelligence around IoT, and we're making big bets around autonomous driving. And so you'd see us making the investment in here, there are investments with BMW. And that's really -- when you take a look at autonomous driving and why are we doing that, it's around data and data centers, again. Remember, every one of those high-definition maps is going to require data centers. They're going to require small data centers at the edge. So it's all around are we understanding and managing how data is going to flow in that system. And then memory itself. And we're going to go make those investments around 3D XPoint and really bringing that and 3D NAND to market in a big away. And so we'll balance between those, and I think you'll see some mix of bringing it to the bottom line, but if I can invest and think I can turn that into additional profitability in the future, I'm going to go do that.",347
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603036.0,Answer,Robert Swan,,Executives,21,"Yes, the only thing I'd add is -- just to maybe make it a little simple for people is we look at our full year guidance that we gave and then we extract out 3 quarters of McAfee. At the macro level, we're looking at low single-digit growth and mid-single-digit EPS growth. So that's kind of the year-on-year apples-to-apples dynamics. On direct spending itself, we'll be down roughly -- our guidance implies we'll be down roughly $0.5 billion year-on-year. And that's just a function of 3 things. One, continued benefits from the restructuring actions that we took in 2016 and continued to execute on in the first half of 2017. Secondly, obviously, the direct spend of McAfee kind of goes away. And third, as Brian mentioned, during this transformation, we continue to make investments in the higher-growth businesses. We'll continue to invest in 5G and ADAS, and then we'll continue to invest in Moore's Law as we bring 10-nanometer to life in 2017 and continue to invest in 7-nanometer. So net-net, the implications of all that for direct spending was 1 point down as a percentage of revenue in 2016 and another point down as a percentage of revenue in 2017. And then the only other thing I would add is in terms of the milestones that we employ during the course of the year for these big bets, we'll continue to build milestones and to make sure those bets that we're making are turning out in the medium to long term the way we expect.",256

I guess as my follow up, you talked about the ASPs in answering a prior question. I'm wondering about the competitive intensity in the PC market. You're taking a more conservative tack than the third-party vendors are forecasting, but your primary x86 competitor is coming out with a new architecture for the first time in many, many years. So I wonder, whether it's on the ASP or the unit or the market share side, how you're factoring that into your forecast for the year.",88

And we're always focused on really our own product road map and making sure that we have the highest performance products. So when we look at 2017, we still believe that our product road map is truly the best ever it's been. As we look at the Kaby Lake and as it really ramps up through 2017, where it came out really just at the end of 2016 and now we'll ramp with many more SKUs and higher-performance products as we go into '17; and then we showed at CES the first working 10-nanometer Cannonlake product, which we're still planning to ship by the end of this year and really ramp into 2018, we still believe that our round road map and our leadership will continue to give us the performance that customers want and desire. And so that didn't necessarily factor into that more cautious forecast. That forecast was really much more a function of where we think the PC market really is overall.",190

Unless I'm doing the math wrong, to get to $2.80, I need a fairly sizable reduction in share count. So is that true? Could you tell us how you're thinking about shares for next year? Are you intending to use the cash from for McAfee to buy back shares to get to that number?",65

I think philosophically, our approach is to offset dilution from our comp-based programs. So all else equal, share count, relatively flat year-on-year. I think the one thing worth noting is we -- in our ICAP portfolio in 2016, we had a fairly significant gain. And what I indicated in the prepared remarks is we expect roughly, in 2017, that gain to be in line with what 2016 generated. I think just in terms of implied share count in our guidance, it's essentially flat year-on-year.",100

For my follow-up, I wanted to again dig into the OpEx. So you talked about like a mix of the restructuring, the cuts versus the reinvestment. But I mean, if I throw the McAfee cost back in, you've actually got OpEx going up fairly sizably year-over-year, and your employee count is actually up year-over-year even though you supposedly had a pretty big layoff. I guess can you talk a little more specifically about exactly what the additional spending is going on? Is it people versus technology versus something else? Where is it going? And do you view those investments as looking to open up new markets versus being defensive in nature or maybe a mix of both?",118

Yes, people, and yes, technology/Moore's Law at the macro level. And that expresses itself in higher depreciation year-on-year. So in our guide, our depreciation is up quite a bit, and a portion of that will flow through direct spending. On a -- again, on a more macro basis, at the risk of maybe repeating myself, we are investing more in DCG, and in particular, bringing some of these adjacent products that Brian referred to, to market. We continue to invest in memory, and particularly, 3D -- the 3D XPoint product. And we continue to invest in IoT. So those 3 businesses are getting a disproportionate share of the investment because those are the businesses that we've seen really strong growth in 2016 and we're counting on continued growth in 2017. Yes, the second area, and again, we talked about this a little bit, but we see real opportunities in autonomous driving that play to our strengths and our capabilities. And we will -- we are making a step-function increase in our investments to position ourselves very well for that industry and that market as it evolves. And then again, third, 7-nanometer technology investment and the spend associated with building a new pilot line in 2017 is also an additional investment. So we're executing on our restructuring programs It was -- we took out roughly -- we made the tough decisions in 2016 that resulted in roughly 11,000 fewer people as a result of our restructuring program. We're not quite done, but I'd say we're on track. At the same time, we're making investments both in technology and people to strengthen and enhance our competitive position in the areas that we see as real opportunities for us.",296

So even when you look at the places where we're going in the data center, and this was my point earlier about enterprise versus cloud, enterprise is now less than 50% of our total makeup for the Data Center Group. And the cloud's growing great and that will continue. But if you look at the areas -- the majority, the rest of the growth for the rest of this decade in the data center alone, it's networking and storage, where we have very low market share today, but we're bringing things like software-defined networking and NFV to those. And so that's growing and expanding TAM as those markets move to Intel Architecture. And then it's going into rack scale design, Omni-Path fabric, silicon photonics. Those are all, again, new either nascent or expanding TAMs for us. Autonomous cars in the IoT space are new and expanding TAMs for us. 5G is a TAM that's brand new that'll be -- really being built out over the rest of this decade. And then memory, if you still -- if you look at the large part of the investment we're making, it's 3D XPoint, which really rearchitects memory and storage and will create a new market, in our mind. And we believe we're unique in having that technology. So to me, when I look at the investments, they're all focused around data, they're all in support of how the data center ecosystem works and they're all in either expanding or new TAMs for Intel. And so that's why I see the growth in those areas. It's not just enhancing the technologies that we already have. We'll do that, but the new investments are really focused on the new areas.",327

They were up 4% year-over-year, which kind of reverses, I think, a 4- or 5-quarter trend of ASPs going down. I know that you've had some mix headwinds that have been driving blended ASPs down. I'm kind of curious: what happened in the fourth quarter to drive ASPs up, and do you think it's sustainable? Is this just what we would expect to see the first quarter of the Broadwell launch and then it normalizes going forward? Or how do you think about ASPs from here?",103

One, the continued transition from Haswell to Broadwell is helpful, and then as we project forward, the next transition of Skylake, we believe, will be helpful as well. So those dynamics where we're delivering better performance for our customers, we're able to capture some of that in ASPs, and we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter. And secondly, in the coms and network space, which is a share gain opportunity for us in DSG, getting those clients to move up the stack in terms of the higher-performance server CPUs is the second dynamic, both of which we think are helpful as we exit 2016 and go into 2017.",126

And the only thing I would add, John, is we'll -- as we go back into the second half of this year through this Skylake transition, and that is a technology that will increase performance and the performance per cost to our customers, in one of the largest improvements in a long time if not ever on the data center. So we expect typically when that happens, people see the value in that and they tend to have -- they tend to buy up, they tend to buy the better SKUs. So we -- to my view, this trend of higher mix should continue.",105

And then maybe as my follow-up, Brian, relative to the full year guide, you're kind of expecting a pretty significant drop in free cash flow this year with the increase in CapEx. And you highlighted that CapEx is going to the non-volatile memory group. I'm just kind of curious, given that, that business, even though it made some improvements in losses in the calendar fourth quarter, it's still in sort of a loss position. I'm assuming the higher CapEx is going to be a headwind to getting to profitability. But I guess how do you think about the path to profitability, the longer-term business model in memory and what it might do to the DCG growth rate longer term, if XPoint is successful?",126
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603051.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,36,"Sure. So let's talk about memory in kind of a big picture, John, and then we can -- I'll let Bob talk a little bit about how the CapEx weighs and what our kind of view on CapEx is in this space. But we are in this space for one reason -- because I understand it's a cyclical business that's -- it tends to be fairly difficult from a price capacity standpoint. So we believe we're coming at it with 2 very unique technologies. Our 3D NAND technology has some of the best performance and best cost in the market. Our current version of 3D NAND has a 15% price -- or cost value over the competition. Our next version, second generation, has even a higher -- when you look at it on the density basis. And so we believe we're going to be able to bring differential cost and performance in 3D NAND that will give us a unique position. And that, combined with our knowledge of the data center, should allow us to really provide compelling products for Data Center SSDs. 3D XPoint is very different in that it's a unique technology that bridges between memory and storage. And we believe it can re-architect how Big Data applications, artificial intelligence applications, where you want large amounts of data being brought up as close to the compute as you can, will really transform not only the architecture of those systems but the performance of those systems. And we've demonstrated onstage, even on client systems, using these types of SSDs. On an equal price, you can get 5 to 7x performance improvement using 3D XPoint as a large memory storage kind of combination. So we're investing purely because we believe we have this differential technology, and that's why we're in this business. I think if I didn't have that differential, I'm not sure it's a business that Intel would necessarily be in, right? But with that leadership and that we believe we can sustain that leadership, we believe it's a good business and a good investment. Bob, talk about how long and how we view the capital.",357

One, memory, obviously, but also bringing 10-nanometer capacity online. If I just go down a level to memory, roughly $1.6 billion CapEx in 2016. Expectations, it'll be roughly $2.5 billion in 2017 as we bring the incremental capacity online. And as we look at memory specifically in 2018, we think it begins to drop off a little bit as we focus that capacity on 3D NAND and, increasingly, 3D XPoint.",91

We've always been roughly between a little bit more than 1/2 to 2/3 of our capacity in the U.S. We're the second-largest exporter in the U.S., and we're proud of that position.

And as my follow-up, back to DCG, there seem to be 2 moving pieces. You have this declining but very profitable enterprise part but a faster growth but perhaps less profitable networking and cloud and other areas. Is that fair characterization? And do you envision a point at which the non-enterprise parts become dominant enough so you can actually see an acceleration in DCG back to your traditional double-digit type growth rate?",74
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2017",2017-01-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3927.0,1364787.0,54603057.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,42,"So let me start, and then -- we can see -- I think our view is that enterprise will continue to decline. A lot of that is those workloads moving to the cloud. It will get to a point, though, where it starts to stabilize, and those -- because there are still things that workloads that will want to be in a private cloud. At the same time, we believe as the world becomes connected, cloud will grow at a much, much faster rate. And I made a point in the prepared remarks, where, if you look at the cloud of today being mostly based on people, the average person will generate about 1.5 GB of data a day. When autonomous car -- when those things start hitting the road and we've started to build these data centers for some of the trials we're working with, I mean, you're talking about petabytes of data that you're having to deal with and 4,000 gigabytes a day off the average autonomous car. You put a couple of those on the road and you need petabytes of storage to handle that. So we do believe that the cloud will move at a faster rate as these connected devices become basically more available. That said, the cloud is becoming bigger than the enterprise. We said enterprise is now less than 15%. And we believe the other areas that will grow, networking and storage; the adjacencies like Omni-Path fabric; silicon photonics; rack scale design, which we're working with our partners on, it really lowers the cost of the system and re-architects how the rack is laid out; and 3D XPoint should dramatically -- that will drive the growth for us as we go through the rest of this decade. We believe when you add those up together, this thing will go back to double digits. When exactly that is, because it's a pretty hard -- we're trying to grow these new nascent areas and manage the decline of enterprise, it's going to be hard to call exactly when. But we do still have a strong belief, and we believe the products are very compelling, that these will drive us to double-digit growth long term.",369

That'll be the same. Secondly, we'll continue to look at M&A that'll strengthen our capabilities, so that's no different than the past. Third, in terms of capital returns, our expectation has been, and I think we'll continue to think it this way going forward as it relates to dividend, grow it in line with non-GAAP earnings and have it be roughly 40% of the free cash flow of the company. Those change around the margins over time depending on the CapEx intensity of the business, but I don't expect that to change. And we'll continue to look at how we move the dividend in line with that philosophy. As I said earlier, in terms of the more holistic capital returns bucket, we will continue to offset dilution, which, I think, is pretty consistent with what we've done in the past. And then third, we have a great balance sheet. And I do think that opportunistically when it makes sense, reducing our outstanding float is an opportunity we have as we get closer to the net cash 0 position that we've been tracking towards over the last 12 months since the Altera acquisition. So philosophically, no dramatic change: dividend in line with non-GAAP earnings growth, but trying to stay in that roughly 40% free cash flow world; and maybe if opportunities present itself, be opportunistic in share count without limiting our financial flexibility relative to the things that matter most, which is strengthening our business.",269

Coming back to the storage market, trying to understand how you view growth this year in light of, obviously, good sequential growth in the entire quarter, but also overlaying that with the Optane qualifications that are going on around part of this.

So if you take a look at it, as I said, this is a cyclical market. If you take a look at 2016, it started out with an oversupply, came into the back half of the year with an undersupply really of capacity. We're entering 2017 with a continued tightness in supply. That makes pricing stable to better. So we expect that at least right now, the estimates are through the first half. It's pretty hard to project out through the second half, so we'll -- we've kind of kept the second half relatively calm and cautious. If you take a look at 3D XPoint, as we said, we've qualified. We've started to ship DIMM samples to the big cloud service guys. Those are targeted for 2018 revenue shipments. On an SSD basis, we'll start shipping for revenue this quarter. And if you take a look at the full year, I think the estimate is it's around 10% of our total revenue is 3D XPoint. And that'll be -- it could take off and it could be a little bit more than that. It could take a little while to qualify some things if it's a little off, but you should think it's around 10% of the revenue and really ramping much, much more into 2018. What we're proud of is you get past that first hurdle of getting the first one to production ready and starting to ship samples to their cloud guys and actually getting ready to start shipping SSDs for revenue to the client devices and all. That -- we're pretty excited about just getting to that point right now with 3D XPoint.",277

So let's talk about that. If I look at 2016, as we showed, we had about 7% growth over what Altera had in 2015. If you take a look at it, there's a couple of big segments that are driving that: telco, data center. And we're starting to see -- and in the networking space as well. Those are kind of the big 3 segments. And we're starting to see, as we went through the -- especially the back half of the year, good connection between our ability to go in, and we're better together with Xeon and the FPGA as we go into that networking space. So again, as our footprint grows in networking and storage, I think it also gives us the ability to continue to bring both products to those markets. So we think in 2016, we actually gained share relative to the competition. As we look out into 2017, we forecasted, again, above-market growth from what we understand are the current estimates, and we believe we'll gain a little bit of share again in 2017. And remember, these markets are slow moving. You don't grow 10% share instantly because the design cycles and design conversions are relatively difficult. It's again driven by data center, networking and the telco industry. And with Stratix 10, as we said, largest design enablement in the history of Altera, so we're really excited. We believe it brings a performance and a cost to our customers that has -- is truly industry-leading and shifting, and so we are very comfortable -- or confident in that. But again, that will really start to ship in the second half of 2017, and so I think that will be really driving growth in 2018. And really, if you think about these design cycles, that product will really continue to drive growth for probably the next 3 years plus just because these cycles are fairly long.",321

I just -- maybe as you look into the back half, I just want to make sure I heard it straight. It sounded like 14 on the server side; may have some initial yields and that'd be a headwind. But I'm just curious on the PC client as well, can you maybe talk about the puts and takes as you ramp in 10, but you still ship a lot of 14? I just wanted to figure out what are the headwinds and tailwinds to gross margin.",104

Secondly, unit cost being a little bit better, and we anticipate that more on the CCG side. And again, as I mentioned earlier, for DCG, as we transition more from 22- to 14-nanometer, all else equal, that will be a little bit of a headwind in the early stages of yield for server on 14-nanometer. The headwinds, particularly, are strong growth coming from memory and modem. So those 2 dynamics themselves, good growth, increasing profitability, good earnings. However, they're at a lower margin, so the mix dynamic of those are real on a year-over-year basis. So good ASP, good unit cost, but mix is a challenge. And then year-on-year factory ramp, both 10-nanometer and memory are a headwind for the full year, but it gets a little bit better in the second half -- the dynamics of first half, second half, it gets a little bit better in the second half.",179

And then I guess you should get at some point this year, potentially at the end of the year, to that net cash 0? Should we think about buybacks at that point?",66

In terms of then just the net debt position during the course of the year, you can assume that we have some maturities in 2015 that we'll take out -- sorry, 2017 that we'll take out. And we believe by the end of the year, given those dynamics, we'll be closer to a net cash 0 position. In terms of that, and that gives us a much stronger balance sheet and how we think about that, we'll continue, as I've said earlier, invest in the business, return capital to shareholders, and opportunistically, whether it's reducing outstanding float, that's one that we'll continue to look in -- to look at and be opportunistic as opportunities present themselves.",160
