25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, May 24, 2011",2011-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3617.0,131438.0,8661631.0,Presenter Speech,Hock Tan,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Jacob. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start today by reviewing some of the recent business highlights, and then Doug will provide summary of second quarter financial results. 
As you may have seen from our earnings announcement earlier today, both revenue and earnings for the quarter of fiscal second quarter 2011 were at the top of our guidance, with net revenue up 2% from the preceding quarter and up 9% year-on-year from second quarter of 2010. 
Now there's little doubt that the catastrophic events in Japan have and will continue to impact the global economy, especially for the electronics and semiconductor supply chain. Thankfully, it appears to date that our own business has been impacted only in minor ways by these events, a lengthy and ongoing review of our supply-chain has identified no critical material shortages that we haven't been able to manage around. 
So stepping back despite these events we see global demand for our products to be improving. Most OEM customers are continuing to grow and have worked through most of the inventory buildup that occurred late in 2010, and most of this work through would have been finished by the end of last quarter. Accordingly, from our view, demand for products appears poised for sustained growth for the balance of the year on top of normal seasonality.
Now within our wireless communications target market, as background, we manufactured FBAR duplexers, power amplifiers, light and proximity sensors, and optical navigation devices for feature reach in smart mobile phones. We also manufacture RF components for the wireless base station market.
Sales from our Wireless Communications Target market represented 36% of our second quarter revenue, our revenue from this market remains flat from Q1, but only rose 3% above Q2 last year. This performance was roughly in line with our expectations for the quarter and in line with normal seasonal trends for us. During the quarter, we were excited to see the launch of the first smartphone utilizing a 4G/LTE Band, a category of devices that we believe will include considerable RF content from Avago, given the strength of our FBAR filter and power amplifying lineup. During this quarter, 19 new handset and tablet platforms were launched with our components. 
Now looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we still expect the launch of several Next Generation phones, utilizing 4G wireless capabilities. We anticipate revenue in this target market -- we anticipate that revenue in this target market will get a shot in the arm and increase in the high single to low double-digit percentage points. As you will all recall, the second half of the year is also seasonally strong for wireless end markets.
Within our wired communication infrastructure markets, you may recall we design high-speed SerDes ASICs and manufacture optical transceivers for enterprise networking, data center switching, and high-speed computing applications. Compared with Q2 last year, our revenue from this end market grew 30%. Our sales from the Wired Infrastructure market grew 5% sequentially over Q1, and accounted for 29% of our total Q2 sales. 
Revenues from Wired Infrastructure grew better than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. We saw strong demand from our proprietary 25G and 50G gigabit per second parallel optics using core routing as carriers invested heavily to expand backhaul capacity. During the quarter, we also ramped our 12 channel 120G proprietary transmitter receiver modules to major supercomputing OEMs.
This growth from our Fiber-Optic Transceiver business was offset partially somewhat by temporary weakness in our ASIC business, caused by customer inventory adjustments in data networking. Nonetheless, we expect growth in the ASIC business to resume in this coming quarter. Thus looking forward to Q3, we believe revenues from the overall wired infrastructure target market will continue to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage points quarter-on-quarter.
Turning to industrial. We manufacture, as you know, and sell optocouplers, motion encoders, and industrial fiber for various server drives, factory automation, and power generation and distribution. Net revenue from this target market grew 1%, compared to that of the prior quarter. The end market grew 14% from the same quarter a year ago, and accounted for 30% of our Q2 2011 net revenue.
Now net inventory adjustment in the supply chain here seems to have run their course. The recovery of developed economies, as well as sustaining industrialization of emerging economies like China, have driven very robust resales growth 7% quarter-on-quarter by our distributors during this quarter. Notwithstanding, we continue to manage inventory in the channels very tightly. Consequently, we expect to see mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q3. 
In our Consumer and Computing Peripherals market, our smaller segment, we manufactured navigation sensors for optical mice, motion sensors for printers, and reflective encoders used in optical disk drives. Revenues from these target market increase 3% from the preceding quarter. On the other hand, year on year, revenue shrunk 38% and represents today, only 5% of our second quarter results. 
During this seasonally soft period, the market for PCs and printers remain subdued and we continue to experience inventory correction in our supply chain for optical disk drive.
With this color as background -- I'm sorry, however, we do believe we will see a seasonal uptick in demand due to the remaining portion of the year. And consequently, we estimate our Q2 revenue from consumer to increase above mid-to-high-single digit percentage points compared to Q2.
Now with all this background, looking forward to Q3, after weak first half, we expect wireless to return to being a major growth driver on the back of multiple next-generation smartphone launches happening now in fact. Revenue from our industrial and wired infrastructure target market should continue to show moderate, stable growth, building on solid performance during Q2. 
In sum, we expect to see our revenue Q3 2011 to increase between 5% to 8% over last quarter. With that summary, let me now turn the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of our second quarter fiscal results. Doug?",1003,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, May 24, 2011",2011-05-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3617.0,131438.0,8661632.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon to everyone. Before reviewing the second quarter fiscal 2011 financial results, I want to remind you that as always my comments today will focus primarily on the non-GAAP results. Reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release we issued earlier today, and is also available on our website at avagotech.com.
Revenue of $560 million in Q2 represents an increase of 2% from last quarter, and an increase of 9% versus the same quarter of last year. And as Hock reviewed, the sequential increase was as we expected at the beginning of the quarter, although revenue from our Wired Networking target market was stronger than we expected, and revenue from our consumer and computing target market was a little bit weaker.  Resales from our distribution partners grew sequentially in Q2. 
At the end of Q2, distribution inventory was at a level consistent with the prior quarter in dollars, and it was actually down in terms of days on hand. We remain very comfortable with the level of inventory that we're holding in distribution.
Q2 gross margin was 51.8%. This was down about 20 basis points from Q1 primarily due to product mix. Growth in our Wired target market, and to a lesser extent, our Consumer target market as compared to our higher margin industrial market brought gross margin down a little bit.
During the quarter, R&D expenses increased $3 million sequentially to $73 million. SG&A also increased by $3 million to $50 million. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 13% and SG&A remained at 9% of revenue. Income from operations decreased by $2 million sequentially to $167 million, and represented 30% of net revenue. Q2 income from operations compares with income from operations of $169 million last quarter, and was $135 million in Q2 of last year. And I'd like to point out from Q2 2010 to Q2 2011, revenue has increased by 9%, while income from operations has increased 24%.
Taxes for Q2 were lower than I expected and they came in at $2 million. Essentially, we generated a higher percentage of income this quarter and more tax efficient jurisdictions. These results translated into net income of $165 million, which is the same as it was last quarter. Q2 earnings per diluted share of $0.64, compares with $0.65 in Q1 due to a slight increase in share count. 
Net income in Q2 of 2010 was $117 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Total share base compensation in Q2 was $9 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q2 includes $1 million in cost of goods sold, $3 million in R&D, and $5 million in SG&A. 
In Q3, we anticipate share base compensation will be approximately $12 million. This increase is the result of new restricted shares and options granted to employees during Q2. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
So now let me turn to the balance sheet. I'm pleased with the performance of our team here this quarter. Days sales outstanding was 47 days. This was 1 day lower than last quarter. Inventory came in at $194 million and that's down 4% from last quarter. This translated to days on hand of 65 days. And this is down 5 days from last quarter, and is consistent with the midpoint of our inventory model. 
At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $596 million. The primary change in cash came from $251 million of cash that we generated from operations. In particular, our management of working capital was very strong in Q2. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $19 million and that's compared with $32 million last quarter. Quarter-to-quarter capital expenditures fluctuated due to the timing of deliveries of equipment and assets. Our expectation of CapEx for Q3 is in the range of $20 million to $25 million. And on March 30, 2011, we paid an interim dividend of $0.08 per ordinary share, which consumed $20 million of cash. This dividend was raised $0.01 from the prior quarter.
Now let me review the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance.
As Hock told you, revenue is expected to be up 5% to 8% sequentially reflecting strong seasonality in wireless as well as growth in both our consumer and industrial target markets. Gross margin is expected to be 51.75% plus or minus 75 basis points. I expect operating expenses to be about $132 million. This is up due to certain selected areas of our expansion within the business, especially new R&D programs, some increases in litigation expenses, as well as increases in employee compensation consistent with our annual salary review cycle.
I expect interest and other to be approximately 0. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $4 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 258 million shares. 
And so let me summarize, during Q2 we generated revenue at the top-end of our expectations and essentially maintained margins near record levels. Heading into the third quarter, we see strong seasonality coming from our wireless target market.
In addition, we expect growth from both our consumer and industrial target markets. The management team here continues to remain committed to driving the business towards our long-term business model. 
And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions at this time.",918,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Well, I guess put in perspective right now our -- in the Wireless business, our frac capacity in Fort Collins runs at around 60, 65 maybe in that range. And no surprise this is first half fiscal '11 and first half is usually a weaker part of the year. We see that changing pretty dramatically in the second half and we see the fabs running close to being full by the end of or close to our fiscal Q4. All right? And longer term, beyond that, we probably would contemplate some level of capacity expansion, but that's probably for fiscal 2012.",103,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It seems like maybe by taking inventory down a little bit this quarter that may have been a gross margin headwind. I was wondering a little bit longer term, what are the main drivers to gross margin, what sort of a natural gross margin target over the next several years and perhaps if you could give us an update on the mix of proprietary versus non-proprietary products.",82,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

It's really our product mix and the product mix relates to the level of proprietary products versus more standard, non-legacy, non-proprietary products. That all has been and continues to be the biggest driver. Inventory movement does vary a little and the reason for that, Terence, is our entire back-end and a lot of when we use silicon is all outsourced. What we have insource are really proprietary 3.5(GHz) processors. And while important as a percent of cost of goods sold, they don't represent such a big percentage of our overall cost of goods sold. So it's really coming down to given how variable our cost of goods sold is. It is really all about product mix and proprietary and the level of proprietary fiber and the level of proprietary product, and the level of proprietary product because thing it's about time. It's a percentage we have been changing, moving up since 5 years back. We're now at a level of in the high 40s%, 50%. Now it's not over a year as we go through each quarter. There's obviously -- it's a bit hard to predict precisely what it is, but it does have a minor, some minor impact as we see this quarter on the overall gross margin. And we can bounce back up or more than bounce back up the following quarter. And you can see that from the way we guide our gross margin numbers. So it's easier for me to tell you probably year-on-year next year, what's likely to be that for me to tell you this quarter, versus next quarter, versus last quarter what a precise gross margin would be. But we kind of know where the last general level of it is overall. So to cut the long story short, we've guided -- we have used a long-term model on gross margin, which we have been able to keep to pretty reasonably, accurately that we would grow our gross margin in the range of 100 to 150 basis points each year.",354,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

But there's a core group of products which are very, very proprietary and very, very unique in the sense of they kind of bridge between transport and Enterprise Network. I'm talking for instances one big area we got a lot of benefit of in Q2 was those parallel optic, high bandwidth optic fibers that goes very importantly into the core routers, the core routing and H-routing environment that is used a lot in wireless infrastructure backhaul. As obviously, the carriers were investing a lot, and we've been seeing a lot of up demand for those products, not just in North America, even in China. And then we also, as I mentioned ramp up delivery in Q2, in a major significant way into those fairly unique inter-fiber, interconnects chip-on-chip for the next-generation supercomputers that Big Blue push out. And that also made a fairly significant addition to our Fiber Optics business.",190,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

I mean, for instance, a lot of the LTE -- LTE is a lot very much favorable towards data and, but a lot of phones also need to have simultaneous voice as well. And so, when you start running in to do both, you start having a lot of RF from a content which leads to the issue of coexistence more and more, and we stand to get a favor as because of FBAR technology.

You're talking about a lot, a lot of very high bandwidth, very low, very high density interconnect that needed to go from say supplied service to top of direct switches and aggregating it all in very tight spaces. Basically you need very high bandwidth interconnect transceivers that is at the same time these transceivers have to take low-power and do not create a lot of emissions to interfere with each other signal integrity so to speak. What it comes down to is fiber optics. So we're seeing a lot of that, we're seeing an increasing amount of that. Where that will grow? We obviously think this is a business by itself on proprietary large fiber-optic and parallel optics, large bandwidth fiber optics. That could grow from where we are today, and where we are today, it's roughly about, I would say 20%, 25% of our entire Wired Infrastructure business, 20% to 25% of Wire Infrastructure business. And is a business that we see that can grow much faster than normal Wired Communication business. Talking about at least 2x, 3x that rate.",206,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I assume your question really relates to industrial, and most of our Industrial businesses as you know go through distributors. So it relates to what you're saying. You may have missed an earlier remark I made, but in Q2 last quarter, our global distributor resale, which is all mainly industrial, largely industrial, grew sequentially 7% actually. Even though our -- and you know we recognize revenue on a shipping basis. We grew our revenue industrial just about 1%. But our resale, the resale numbers are industrial, on our distributors grew closer to 7% sequentially. So that there indicator in fact of a resumption as you correctly pointed out of growth not in developed economies globally. Not just something pulled along by emerging economies like China, industrializing themselves. As to why there's a differential absolutely it's hard to measure the 2 because the fact is a lot of our customers in Japan, Europe, exports into emerging economies. So it's really hard to say, to have any meaningful comparison to say what does industrial developed economies versus developing economies, what is the difference between the two in terms of your growth rate because a big part of, for instance, Central Europe's industrial growth that we see today are through large OEMs who export systems, huge systems, to China. As is the case in Japan too. In fact that's a big engine in countries like China, Brazil are big engines of growth for the industrial powerhouses of Europe and Japan. So it might not be that meaningful if I give you data but just enough to say that our resale in places like China is at a much higher trajectory than our resale growth in say, Europe or in Japan.",288,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I was wondering if you can give us any culture or color on kind of the attach rate of your PAs with filters when you garner a design win meaning your filters obviously you guys have a very strong product there. I was wondering what the pull is of the percentage of times you get wins with your filter, how often you guys actually get the PA to, or how should we think about that attach?",102,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And occasionally, where we have the filter and in some cases, many cases we pull along the PAs as well. But that doesn't happen or has happened. Obviously a front end module is 100% attach rate PA in filter but on the case of filter alone, the attach rate for our PA going to the filter is much, much lower.

It's also, together with the fact that we can offer a lot of value added in a lot of the sockets we want by its sheer nature of that we win those sockets. So we have an increase in number of sockets out there too in the next generation smartphone launch especially on the 4G whether it be WiMAX or LTE. We've got them both.

I think most of that has largely been done and as people, as time elapse and the best way to describe, so there were some of it and the question, and we saw it too on our side the difference perhaps is we were very tight in delivering on some of those what we consider to be pull-forward demand, so to speak. We were very tight and as I mentioned, which is why we under shipped against our disti[ph] resale purposefully in Q2. We'll probably continue to do that in Q3 to some extent. Just against, just to be wary about that. But as I see time elapse from that, the concerns of supply chain disruption, the reason of that, I think it's been mitigated more and more. Time passes, Japanese are very resourceful people, very flexible people, so are their customers. People find second sources factories get up to production, find ways to produce it. So we see that if the impact of that been mitigated quite substantially as time passes.

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start today by reviewing some of the recent business highlights, then Doug will provide summary of the first quarter financial results. 
Now as you may have seen from our earnings announcement just released, revenue for the quarter was seasonally down, as expected, with net revenue down 4% from the last quarter but up 21% year-on-year from the first quarter 2010. Now during the past year, calendar 2010 in particular, we had seen semiconductor companies grow faster than their end markets. However, by late 2010, rising inventory levels at OEMs and distributors caused the industry to slow production in order to bring supply more in line with end market demand. Now we are not entirely immune from these micro trends, and we expect our revenue and the semiconductor industry's revenue growth to more closely align with the end market demand for calendar 2011. Fortunately, our wire end markets have continued to grow but at a more moderate pace than in the prior year. In the near term, however, our revenue is expected to be impacted by an inventory adjustment in the OEM and distribution supply chain and, as was the case this quarter, the return of normal seasonal selling patterns. Having said all this, we saw strong quarter-on-quarter growth in our wired networking business, driven largely by increased sales of proprietary parallel optical transceivers using enterprise and data center networking applications as well as high-speed computing applications. 
So start -- another thing to note before I get into commentary on how our various businesses are doing is that starting with this quarter's commentary, I won't dispense with providing specific color on trends in each of our 4 target markets. I will instead provide further information on our own performance within those targeted markets. 
Beginning with wireless communication target markets. Now as you know, we manufacture duplexes, power amplifiers and Optical Finger Navigation devices for feature-rich and smartphones. We also manufacture RF components for wireless base stations. Now sales from our wireless communication markets represented 37% of our first quarter revenues, and our revenue from this target market fell 8% from there of the preceding quarter, Q4 fiscal '10 and -- but rose 17% above the same quarter a year ago. This performance on my --- was roughly in line with our expectations for the quarter, better than normal seasonal trends we have observed in the past.
Normally, OEM demand in this market rose over late November and December. This year, we did not really experience a slackening in demand until January. Additionally, we experienced favorable product mix, we saw stable pricing in the quarter, better than we would normally expect for first quarter. And during this same -- this quarter, our parts were designed into over 20 new smartphones and tablet platforms on major OEMs worldwide. Now looking ahead to this second quarter fiscal 2011, we anticipate revenue in this targeted market to remain largely flat, in line with difficult seasonal patterns. 
In wired infrastructure, we design high-speed SerDes-based ASICs and as well as manufacture optical transceivers for enterprise networking, data center switching, high-speed computing applications. Compared with Q1 last year, our revenue from this end market grew 27%. Our sales from this wired networking market grew 7% sequentially over that of the preceding quarter and accounted for 28% of our total Q1 sales. 
Revenue from this market grew better than we expected at the start of the quarter. We saw strong demand for our proprietary parallel optics using high end unified computing environments. During the quarter, we experienced an improved demand for our proprietary 25G and 50G parallel optics using call routing infrastructure, and we have began shipping the 12-channel and 20G proprietary transceivers to a major supercomputing customer. We also saw strength from 1-gigabit per second and 10-gigabit per second migrations and from 8 gigs storage optical transceivers. In the meantime, I should add our market share in supplying our SerDes-based ASICs to major enterprise, networking and computing OEMs continue to grow. Consequently, we expect revenue from this target market to be able to sustain growth in the low single digits quarter-on-quarter sequentially, which expect over the rest of this year. In industrial and automotive electronics, we manufacture and sell optocouplers used in electrical isolation, motion encoders used in industry control and industrial fiber optics used for data communication in harsh factory environments. Net revenue from this target market decreased 3% from the prior quarter. This end market grew 42% from the same quarter a year ago and accounted for 30% of our Q1 2011 revenues. 
Despite holiday shutdowns during this quarter, resale of our industrial products held up well in all geographical markets as exports to emerging economies supported demand in Europe and Japan while the Americas showed some recovery. Having said this, significant inventory adjustments in distribution channels and OEMs reduced shipment revenue sequentially in Q1 as compared to Q4 and will likely keep revenue flat in this current Q2 quarter despite expected resale improvements.
In our consumer and computing peripheral market, we manufacture navigation sensors for optical mice, motion sensors for printers and reflective encoders using optical disk drives. Revenue from this target end market declined 26% sequentially on a year-on-year basis. Our revenue from this market has shrunk by 36% and now only represents 5% of our first quarter 2011 sales. During this quarter, revenue from optical mice and the printers experienced weaker-than-normal seasonality, reflecting generally weaker PC and consumer demand. Now with respect to optical disk drives, however, we saw significant inventory adjustments as our OEM customers had accumulated inventory in a weakened environment during calendar '10. While we foresee end demand to now remain flat for Q2, we currently estimate that our revenue from this market will increase in the high single to low double digits percentage points as compared to Q1 with the completion of investment within this end market and given our expectations for recovery in demand for our components.
So to sum up, while substantial follow-up business is tied to general market conditions, we believe with the -- we are seeing significant market share growth due to the launch of proprietary solutions. As we move forward, we see we are ramping our high-bandwidth embedded fiber optics in high-performance computing applications. Our SerDes-based ASICs are very well positioned with major OEMs in the next-generation data center switching that you see have been announced today. In smartphones, we are securing major design wins that will give us very strong momentum into the second half of 2011. For 2000 -- for Q1, we have seen our bookings sustained, continuing so far into fiscal Q2. We accordingly expect to see revenue in Q2 to be in the range of perhaps a downside of 1% and, on the upside, we could be up as much as 2% over that of the last quarter. With that, let me turn this call over to Doug.",1157,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being on the call. Before reviewing the first quarter of fiscal 2011 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today, as they always do, will focus primarily on the non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release we issued today and is also on our website at avagotech.com. 
Revenue of $550 million in Q1 represents a decrease of 4% from last quarter and an increase of 21% versus the same quarter a year ago. And as Hock reviewed, the sequential decline was maybe a little bit better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter really due to the strength of our revenue in the wired network end target market. 
Resales from our distribution partners were down modestly in Q1. Adjusting for the normal holiday effect in the quarter would have resales fairly flat. 
At the end of Q1, distribution inventory was at a level that was roughly consistent with the prior quarter. We remain well within our inventory model and are comfortable with the amount of inventory that we have in distribution today. 
Q1 gross margin was 52%. This represents a new record gross margin percentage for the company. Gross margin was up sequentially from Q4 and was better than our expectations for the quarter due to a beneficial product mix as well as strong NRE [ph] revenues at our ASICs business. 
During the quarter, R&D expenses increased by $2 million sequentially to $70 million. SG&A decreased by $1 million to $47 million. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 13% and SG&A rounded up to 9% of net revenues this quarter. Operating expenses came in $2 million to $3 million lower than we expected at the beginning of the quarter really due to a onetime reversal of bonus accruals. 
Income from operations decreased by $2 million sequentially to $169 million, but it actually increased to 31% of net revenue. Q1 income from operations compares with income from operations of $171 million last quarter and with $104 million in Q1 of last year. But I should point out, from Q1 of 2010 to Q1 of 2011, revenue has increased 21% while income from operations has increased 63%. Taxes for Q1 were lower than we expected and came in at $1 million primarily due to the reinstatement of U.S. R&D tax credits.
These results translate into the net income of $165 million or $0.65 per diluted share. This net income compares with net income of $190 million or $0.76 per diluted share in Q4 and with net income of $88 million or $0.36 per diluted share in Q1 of 2010. And just a reminder, net income last quarter, Q4 of 2010, included a $28.7 million discrete tax benefit related to our debt reduction, which equated to roughly $0.11 per diluted share. 
Total share-based compensation in Q1 was $7 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q1 includes $1 million in cost of goods sold, $3 million in R&D and $3 million in SG&A. In Q2, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $8 million. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income continues to exclude share-based compensation expense. 
So now, turning to the balance sheet. I have to admit I'm a little disappointed by our performance through this quarter. Days sales outstanding came in at 48 days, and this was 3 days higher than the prior quarter due to the linearity of sales in the quarter. Inventory came in at $203 million, which was up 7% from last quarter. This translated to days on hand of 70 days. This is up 9 days from Q4 and is at the high end of our desired model. We intend to manage this inventory lower next quarter, and I expect it to be down several days from where it is this quarter. 
At the end of the first quarter, our cash balance was $363 million. The changes in cash included $67 million in cash from operations and $230 million used to redeem the notional amount of our remaining debt. I should point out that cash used in operations in Q1 included our annual bonus payments of $37 million, a $14 million call premium related to our debt redemptions and $40 million in final interest payments. And Q1 is typically our lowest cash generating quarter. 
Capital expenditures in Q1 came in at $32 million, and this compares with $30 million last quarter. Our expectations for CapEx in Q2 is a range of $23 million to $28 million. We also spent $8 million during Q1 to acquire a small motion encoder chip company in the U.S. to complement our portfolio of industrial and automotive electronics businesses. The financial impact of this acquisition will be immaterial to our financial results for the year.
Now let's review the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we don't intend to update this guidance.
Revenue is expected to be in the range of down 1% to up 2% sequentially, which is consistent with normal seasonal patterns for this quarter. Gross margin is expected to be 52% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be $124 million. This is up due to the timing of spending on new R&D projects. Interest and other is expected to be approximately 0, and I should point out this excludes $1 million of expense from the anticipated replacement of our outstanding revolving credit facility. Taxes are forecasted to be $4 million. And finally, the share count forecast is for 256 million shares. 
So let me summarize. During Q1, we generated revenue a little bit better than we expected. We achieved record gross margin of 52% and operating margin of 31%. Our improvement here is primarily the result of an improving product mix. Heading into the second quarter, we see a continuation of normal seasonal patterns. We remain encouraged by the designing momentum in our wireless and wired target markets. The management team here continues to remain committed to driving the business towards our long-term business model. And that concludes my prepared remarks.

As you know, we -- it's typically very hard for us to forecast gross margin quarter by quarter beyond the current quarter we are in because it's very, very dependent on product mix. But given the trend, and we do it on a trended basis, our product -- our proprietary products, more for our proprietary products into our mix of revenues on a continuing basis, and, as we see, achieving a threshold level of cost structure then enables us to basically perform at a much higher level now. We do not see why this gross margin could not maintain in the near term going forward.",111,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I should preface, and you probably know this, Terence, is that -- or you have heard us say it before. We're pretty much focused on smartphones. That's pretty much where our focus is, smartphones and a lot of the feature-rich phones. So we don't participate across the entire handset market. The positive path with all this is, of course, the fast-growing portion of the handset market, in this smartphone market, which has been growing -- which has grown over last year something like 40%, 50%, so -- on unit terms and on price terms probably, somewhat slightly less but still fairly substantial. And we intend to maintain our market share in this growth. So yes, I think this is -- this will be a very exciting market over the next couple of years for us, and it's a market we intend to focus a lot of resources in terms of achieving a significant market share.",158,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I'll go first in terms of the inventory question. I'll turn it back to Hock from the channel inventory perspective. What ended up happening with our own on-hand inventory this quarter is supply was tight with some of our suppliers call it 6 months ago. We made longer term commitments to take some wafers so we had an assurance of supply when we needed it. And the practical reality of where we ended up this quarter is some of those wafers came in and it was over what we needed this quarter. And so it's going to take us a quarter to work that back down to the level that we want it to be at. So that's what's going on with our own on-hand.

Just now also, this adjustment, so to speak work down of inventory last quarter, we expect to see it again this quarter. And then I think by the end of this quarter, we should be pretty largely done because underlying all this, what we are seeing in our distribution business, which is largely, as I said, related to our industrial business, industrial and automotive business, and some infrastructure business. The underlying resale demand has been strong. And for this quarter, Q2, we expect it to actually be up from the preceding quarter, Q1. So the underlying demand, fortunately for all of us, is that it's not as obviously phenomenal in growth as last year same time, but that was more of, as I mentioned, a situation of a major rebound from the recession or downturn of 2009. But we're now more in a more moderate or normal pace, and that normal pace, especially emerging economies showing continued strength and in developed economies like the U.S. and Germany showing decent recovery, I should say.

Tim, we expect to be plus or minus a few million dollars as we go through the next several quarters. I have told you guys over the last several quarters that we're trying to spend more on R&D to generate future revenue growth. We're seeing some of that happen this quarter. Last quarter was a couple of million dollars lower than it normally would have been on a run rate basis because we had some bonus reversal from the prior year, actually. So when you bump that up, we're actually up maybe $4 million quarter-on-quarter, and it's due to the timing of R&D projects.",119,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

We see that in particular as we track resale very closely, and we see that. And we sense that the main cause of that is still -- the main reasons why it is still very much that end demand in emerging economies, the China, India, Brazil or wherever, is still -- they may have slowed down, but they're still absorbing a lot of products from developing economies as well us on their own. We also see obviously improved -- improvement in developed economies in Central Europe, in North -- in Americas, and those are the drivers of why we say -- why I say industrial demand continues to be growing.

And you can think of many applications which needs that. And we are in fairly and -- very well engaged in many, many designs right now. Now when revenues might show up for this product?

And typically, if you consider such a thing as real typical. But in the past, we have seen on a normal year that our Q1 drops from our Q4, which is usually the peak quarter for consumer and wireless, something like high to 10 -- high single digits to 10% sequentially, usually even -- many times even over 10%. The fact that we did not get that far is somewhat better than normal seasonality. But to answer your question more precisely, yes, in -- and we participate in the smartphone markets. And really, your market share and your performance is very much tied to the specific performance of the OEMs that you have significant share with and have certain content with. So it does vary. But on an overall basis, Romit, I would say we weren't disappointed nor surprised by the number -- the performance of our wireless business for this Q1. And for Q2, we expect Q2 is also seasonally not the strongest quarter in wireless, especially in handset business, not surprisingly. But we'll probably expect, as we -- as I indicated, some gradual improvement from Q1 because usually, it's the back half of the year that you see the bulk and the ramp in major new design wins in any handset business.",228,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

As you see, it's continued to expand as we go into 3G or we go into multibands that co-exist with each other, which creates issue. Now going into -- and which comes to your question on LTE. In the case of LTE, I think an interesting point that's going on. But yes, it depends. Again, the same thing. It depends on their particular bands that their LTE is implemented in. And you probably may be aware that the LTE that's coming out in North America, the first at 700 megahertz approximately, LTE is right next to the public safety radio band. So the possibility of co-existence is very real there. Co-existence means one band interfering with the other. For instance, your phone crossing over to somewhere else into the other band, which might interfere with. But, of course, very sensitive is the public safety radio band. And therefore, the likelihood of FBAR coming in for that kind of band will -- is very rare just to avoid interference and to improve signal quality.",215,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

No, no, of total business, of wireless business, number one. And number two, it's still very relevant because it's a very viable alternative to touch screen. Not all phones switched -- all smartphones, that is I mean, moved to touch screen. And point of fact, there are so many phones out there that -- not many but enough, that have both a keyboard and touch screen. And on the keyboard side, it's an obvious opportunity for optical -- OFN to be -- to play a role there. So we sell to those guys -- those phones who need it. And we -- there's a significant portion -- just I'll say, it's growing significant portion in touch screen. And I think the 2 will co-exist in smartphones, feature-rich phones down the road. We don't see that dying off. What we did see last year, a sharp ramp up of products, our business. That's right. But that's the initial ramp that you only see the sharp improve -- increase. The way it is right now is still -- it's stable. It's growing. It's not growing as fast as it used to be, but it's a very, very viable product line for us right now. And by the way, we -- you're right. We have extended it beyond phones to remotes, TV remotes, Google TV remotes, keyboards, for instance. Some keyboards have that versus having those touchpads that you see more typically. You can use an optical -- OFN on a keyboard.

Frankly, I like to think it will grow. That makes our growth easier. But why we are growing, as I said, is because we are very well positioned, both in ASICs, chipsets, that is ASIC chipsets, as well as in fib new -- our proprietary fiber interconnect with very high bandwidth in those next-generation products. I do an example. You heard the announcement, a preliminary announcement today from a major OEM of a new data center product called the Gnome, they call it, otherwise, called QFabric. We have chipsets in those things. We have also interconnects with those things. More and more of this will come out. Some have already come You hear about the Nexus 2 -- 5000, 7000. We are in all those next-generation products. So we believe we are gaining share both in our SerDes ASICs-based -- our SerDes-based ASIC as well in proprietary fiber interconnect.

As you know, in Asia Pacific, the lies of that -- the data is more suspect in those areas. And that's a big growing portion. In fact, that's the largest growing region of our sales universe. So it's very hard to quantify that accurately. But the sense we have is, yes, we're going through them, and one I call inventory adjustments, which is ship-outs, is probably going faster than ship-ins. But also, don't forget another big part of inventory. It sits at OEMs, contract manufacturers and Os. And in calendar '10, those guys, because of the fear of shortages of key components, have also stocked up their share of components, which they have been working down over the past, I would say, 4, 5 months.",147,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

And so I'm just kind of curious, as you think about some of the new applications in that market, what's your view of kind of the new Avago growth rate in the industrial and automotive cause that sector has been leading year-over-year growth now, I think, for 4 quarters consecutively?",93,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And a big part of why they -- 2 reasons why those 2 are or why this is happening, one is, in one -- one is emerging economies, places like China, are just spending enormous amount of money upgrading infrastructure, and we are very, very in infrastructure especially as it relates to -- see, I think in the case of China, at the beginning, while some of -- when you talk infrastructure, that's about power, power, power. And we do a lot of products and I like to call isolation, optical isolation that goes into power generation and power conversion. Since then, from power, we ventured into transportation. And then, the -- China and their cost of labor is going up, labor laws are putting in place -- they're putting in place some very strict -- so factories are automating in China, believe it or not. Your little mom-and-pop shops in China are even automating. And we sell our different set of products into factory automation. So that's like the second round of kicking. Then we -- of course, we -- while all this was going on, we have this additional new business that we talked about, which is basically renewable or alternative energies: solar, wind, other things, even nuclear. And we sell more and more components in that. So this 41% growth rate is selling to a different set -- an increased set of end markets than we saw in 2008, say, or 2009. And that's why you see a 41% that's -- growth year-on-year. That seems to be sustainable. And they're showing no signs of going -- heading the other way like it did in 2009. It is sustainable. It's holding out. How long will it hold up? My view of it is more than a year, definitely. Definitely more than a couple of years because there are more new -- there are new opportunities. Another area of sustainable growth, we think, is -- in renewable energy is automotive. All these electric cars, hybrid cars, no doubt they are still small in quantities, but they're buying a lot of components in its power generation, in the conversion of battery power to driving basically -- or driving those automobiles, those transportations. They use a lot more of those components than the current vehicle we see here today. And that's also a growing, increasing opportunity for our industrial products.",402,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

They're coming -- wireless connections. And the wireless connection they are putting in are getting more -- not less but more sophisticated. I mean, I could see a path towards LTE coming in because LTE is for data and tablet is really data. You don't put or you don't -- it's very hard to stick a tablet on your ear and the same on your head. So we see that opportunity exist in so many ways similar to what we see in smartphones. Is this coming from the PC side perhaps as opposed from the phone side but coming to the same converging area, which is wireless data transfer, which means they needs a lot of RF front end in terms of duplexers, filters and power amplifiers.

That's the legacy standard products and the future proprietary products. That has strength -- and that was -- it used to be -- 4 years ago, our -- longer, I think, in that time frame, not in few quarters, I'm sorry. But, say, 4 years ago, our standard legacy products was like 80% of our fiber revenues. Today, it's about close to 50-50 and maybe 40-60, but that much difference. And that has tremendously improved, obviously, the product mix and the margin in our business. It also enables us to get into sockets, in -- with OEMs in a very strategic manner where our fiber interconnects makes a difference in the ability of their system, their boxes to perform both -- and that's been a very great set of drivers for us. As I say, it's down to -- and the mix is up to a point where it's almost 50-50. It was down 40-60. And our revenue in our fiber business has grown pretty significantly since that time.

It's slowly picking back up. So we don't see end demand recovering, and there's no reason people will use mouse, printers that are still being made by HP. And as you know, 1/4 of business is in that area. And optical disk drives are still very much alive. And we are pretty much key players in those markets, niche but key players. Our consumer business is rarely a very niche business for us. That's really what it comes down to.",145,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

Is it more continued penetration of smartphones in the more mature, developed Western markets? Is it -- or is it potentially LTE coming on and being additive? Or might it also be conversion of, let's say, Chinese base of 2G, 2.5G phones, which are probably 600 million units per year? As they convert to 3G, is that conversion from Chinese 2G to 3G, is that requiring FBAR filters?",86,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

If I look at it over the next 3 years, yes. First and foremost, as you know, Terence, we are very much focused only on smartphones. So for us, smartphones, we believe, is an area -- is an opportunity that continues to grow faster than the overall handset markets. As you correctly call -- pointed out, 2Gs will move to 3Gs and more. So that will have a -- and so that will be a big driver. On top of that, smartphones, as you know, the driver towards it is they're getting -- they are pushing it in smartphones that work over multiple carriers, multiple regions, multiple modes, so to speak. So you're ending up with multimode, multi-band sets across various carriers across various geographies. You want a phone that works in Japan, that works in the U.S., which works in China. And so what you do is you start putting in more content into those phones and including Wi-Fi. And as you put in more bands, the bands start to run very close to each other, a comment I made earlier. Then you create a phenomenon called co-existence. When too many bands are operating close to each other, they tend to interfere, cross-talk, so to speak. And the way to avoid it is to put in on FBAR. So there's great demand for FBAR. But as you move from 3G to LTE, you start to put more and more content. And the most interesting thing is, one of the phones that has come out in the U.S, one of the first 4G phones in Sprint has $6 of content of our products in it. That's an example of what an LTE phone gets you to.",293,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. 
During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Doug will be providing details of our Q3 fiscal year 2011 results, background to our Q4 2011 outlook, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.
In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. To provide it in addition to and not as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financials is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results.
Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could affect our business and financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start today by reviewing some recent business highlights, and then Doug will provide a summary of the third quarter financial results.
As you may have seen from our earnings announcement, revenue for the quarter was at the top end of our guidance at a record $603 million, with net revenue up 8% from last quarter and up 10% year-on-year from third quarter 2010. Interestingly though, each of our target markets performed much as we guided during the course of the third fiscal quarter. 
Now there's little doubt that exist today, uncertainty with regard to the direction of the global economy, the electronics equipment supply chain will undoubtedly be adversely affected, probably has been, by any economic downturn, with semiconductors at the tail end of this chain, which could obviously, have knock-on effects for our business. Nonetheless, we have continued to gain traction with our large OEM customers. And largely as a consequence, we continue to expect to see our business grow through the balance of this fiscal year.
Now let's turn to the results from each of our target markets. Within our wireless communications market, we manufacture, as you may know, FBAR duplexers, power amplifiers, light and proximity sensors and optical navigation devices for feature-rich and smart mobile phones. We also manufacture RF components for the wireless base station market.
Turning to Q3, fiscal Q3, sales from our wireless communications market represented 37% of our third quarter revenues. Our revenue from this target market grew 10% from the preceding quarter and rose 8% above the same quarter last year. This performance was roughly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Growth in Q3 was driven by increased strength in our wireless infrastructure business and by the seasonal growth in handsets, driven particularly by the launch of new LTE and WiMAX smartphones in North America. 
This was offset somewhat by weakness with a large OEM in our optical finger navigation product line. We continue to be encouraged by our momentum, as our parts were designed into 37 new handset platforms during Q3.
I have to add that our -- while it is of interest to note, I should say that our business model in wireless is predicated upon certain handset OEMs pushing for differentiated performance, which we can deliver to our components. Obviously, our success in this segment is based on those OEMs being winners in the marketplace. We believe we have recently been successful with those winners. As a result, we anticipate revenue in this target market will again increase in the high single to low double digits compared to Q3 as those winning OEMs launch their next-generation smartphones.
Turning to wired infrastructure, as you may know too, we design high-speed SerDes, ASICs, and manufacture optical transceivers for enterprise networking, data center switching, and high-speed computing applications. Now revenue from the wired infrastructure market represented 28% of our total Q3 sales. Our sales from the wired infrastructure market grew 6% over Q2 and grew 37% over the same quarter last year. Again, revenues from this target market grew pretty much as we expected at the beginning of the quarter. 
We benefited from strong demand in storage networking, which drove growth in our 8-gigabit and newly introduced 16-gigabit fiber channel solutions in Q3. We've also ramped our 12-channel, 120-gigabit proprietary transceiver modules for supercomputing applications. 
During the same quarter, Q3, we saw strong double-digit growth from our SerDes ASIC business due to strength in next-generation data center switching. Finally, demand was saturated during the quarter by strong orders for proprietary parallel optics sold into core routing applications in China during the same quarter.
Now looking forward to Q4, we believe the Q3 bounce in the core routing business in China will likely recede, but this will be offset by continued strong ASICs SerDes ramp. Accordingly, we expect overall debt revenues from the wired infrastructure market will be flattish for us quarter-on-quarter.
In our industrial and automotive electronics target market, we manufacture and sell optocouplers, and in addition, today, motion encoders and industrial fiber. During Q3, net revenue from this market accounted for 30% of our total revenues. It grew 7% compared to the prior quarter, and grew 5% from the same quarter a year ago.
Now during this Q3, growth came mainly from continued strength in demand in Japan and China. This was offset somewhat by softness in North America and Europe, due largely to supply chain adjustments during the quarter.
All indications however, are that our large industrial OEM customers will continue to grow in this coming Q4. However, we do expect inventory adjustments to continue in the supply chain, particularly among component distributors. Nevertheless, inventory of our parts has remained tight in those channels, and consequently, we expect our industrial revenue to be roughly flat sequentially during Q4. 
Finally, in consumer and computing peripherals, we manufacture, as you know, navigation sensors for optical mice and motion sensors for printers. And revenue from this target market represented only 5% of our third quarter 2011 revenues, and increased 10% from the preceding quarter, but shrunk 34% year-on-year. We muted seasonality expected in this market. We estimate that our Q4 revenue from the consumer side will be roughly flat again as compared to Q3.
So to summarize, 3 basic points. With the volatile and uncertain environment that we currently see, we forecast conservatively that 3 of our 4 target markets, namely: wired, industrial, and consumer, to be roughly flat sequentially in Q4. Secondly, given lean inventory levels in our supply chain, we do not expect to get whipsawed by external adjustments during this quarter. 
And thirdly, [indiscernible] in wireless, we believe we have picked winners, and we are benefiting from the launch of the next-generation smartphones during the quarter, which will drive our growth in our wireless target market. All of this put together leads us to expect revenue in Q4 fiscal '11 to increase between 2% to 5% over last quarter. 
With that summary, let me now turn the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of third quarter fiscal 2011 financial results.",1024,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2011",2011-08-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3607.0,161956.0,10208605.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Great. Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing third quarter fiscal 2011 financial results, I want to remind you that as always, my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. And as Jacob pointed out, a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today, and is also available on our website at avagotech.com.
Record revenue of $603 million in Q3 represents an increase of 8% from last quarter and an increase of 10% versus the same quarter a year ago. And as Hock reviewed, the sequential increase was at the top end of our guidance and revenue from each of our target markets came in much as we expected at the beginning of the quarter.
Resales from our distribution partners grew slightly in Q3. At the end of Q3, distribution inventory was at a level consistent with the prior quarter in terms of days on hand. And we continue to keep a very close eye in our supply chain and remain comfortable right now with the level of inventories that we see. And I think Hock has already talked to you about that.
Q3 gross margin was 51.7%. This was consistent with our expectations going into the quarter. Stronger growth in our wireless target market was balanced with growth from our higher margin industrial market to keep gross margin roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. 
During the quarter, R&D expenses increased $8 million sequentially to $81 million. The majority of this increase was from investments that we've made in our Wired and Wireless businesses. SG&A also increased by $4 million to $54 million. Some of the increases in both R&D and SG&A were driven by higher salaries that resulted from our annual review cycle, as well as higher bonus accruals that we made during the quarter. Higher operating profit and design win momentum drove the increase in bonus accruals. Additionally, higher sales pushed commissions up a bit. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 13% and SG&A remained at 9% of net revenue. 
Income from operations increased by $10 million sequentially to $177 million, which is a new record for Avago, and it represented 29% of net revenue. Q3 income from operations compared with income from operations of 167 in Q2 and with 164 in Q3 of last year.
Taxes for Q3 came in lower than guidance at $1 million due to a change in estimate related to the utilization of certain R&D tax credits, the timing of which was driven by the filing of our U.S. federal returns. These results translated into net income of $176 million, which is up 7% from last quarter. Q3 earnings per diluted share of $0.68 compares with $0.64 in Q2, and net income in Q3 of 2010 was $152 million or $0.61 per diluted share. 
Our total share-based compensation in Q3 came in at $11 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q3 includes: $1 million in cost of goods sold; $4 million in R&D; and $6 million in SG&A. In Q4, we anticipate share-based compensation will again be approximately $11 million. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. So now let me move to the balance sheet.
Days sales outstanding was 43 days. This was down 4 days from the prior quarter. Inventory came in at $200 million, which was up 3% from last quarter in dollar terms. This translated to days on hand of 63 days, which was down 2 days from Q2 and is at the lower end of our inventory model. I think we were pleased with our management of working capital in Q3. 
At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $704 million. The primary change in cash came from $211 million in cash provided by operations. Capital expenditures in Q3 was $24 million and that compares with $19 million last quarter. And we expect CapEx in Q4 to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million. The sequential increase will be driven by new mask sets in our ASIC business, as well as capacity additions in our wireless factory. 
With Q4 CapEx in the range I referenced, our full year spend will be very close to the estimate we provided at the beginning of fiscal 2011. On June 30 of 2011, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per ordinary share, which consumed $22 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.01 from the prior quarter. And finally, during Q3, we repurchased and canceled approximately 1.9 million of our ordinary shares, which consumed $68 million of cash. 
Now let me review the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. Revenue is expected to be up 2% to 5% sequentially, driven by anticipated growth in our wireless target market. Gross margin is expected to be 51.5%, plus or minus 75 basis points. This decline is due to the projected growth in our wireless target market. 
Operating expenses are estimated to be $132 million. This was down slightly from Q3. Interest and other is currently expected to be approximately 0. We’re forecasting taxes to be approximately $4 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 256 million shares. And so let me summarize. During Q3, we generated record revenue at the top end of our guidance and maintained margins.
Heading into the fourth quarter, we see growth coming from the ramp of new designs at large OEM customers. And finally, I thought I'd like you know that as we are completing our annual operating plan during the coming quarter, I'll intend to provide an update to our long-term business model during our 2011 fiscal year end conference call, which will be scheduled for early December. 
And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, if you will, please open up the call for questions at this time.",1005,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Not to mention the quarter is not over by any means. The second half is far from over. But it's hard to tell. And particularly as I try to mention in some of my remarks, you have multiple handset OEMs, handset OEMs out there now, and you see some really gaining, and you see some not so gaining and for someone like us, a player like us where, as I mentioned, our business model is about not going for market share but really more going for sockets, designed sockets, in platforms that a customer really appreciate a price -- not a price, but a performance differentiation. We pick and choose. And we pick and choose on those design sockets. And because we pick and choose, we don't see the entire market when you consolidate everything together. And we pick some winners, and we pick a lot of winners. We come out looking very good. And that's pretty much what we think we're seeing this Q4 that we're in. It could well happen the other way.

We're not just tracking one region, we're tracking across-the-board. And if we do that, I would say on weighted average, they grew about 8%, 9% sequentially. The industrial end customers. And we grow 7%. Maybe even slightly below 7%. As I said, for some regions, we were making sure we keep our inventory in our distributors, most of this as part of the distributors under tight control. This quarter, Q4, the same data we looked at what likely grow 3% to 4% sequentially for that, and we are saying we're probably going to be flat.

It's end market to end market, there's differences in gross margin in each of our end markets, and I try to describe in my prepared remarks. Industrial was strong and it offset a little bit of growth in wireless last quarter. And when I look at our guidance for the current quarter, we have growth in wireless, which has gross margin a little below the corporate average, and that is why gross margin is down, call it 20 basis points in the coming quarter. But what drives it quarter-to-quarter and year-on-year is product mix.

I'll take the call. Yes, we're not forecasting beyond one quarter at this point. But you have puts and takes in each of the end markets.

Hock mentioned a lot about the ASIC division, as well as some of our proprietary optics. The gross margin profile of the proprietary products in that end market are quite good.

But that aside, what the Japanese tsunami and followed by, I guess, the nuclear reactor issue, was my view and you've heard that too from other semi guys and other companies out there when they announce their results. It probably, in fact, I mean more than probably, it did create kind of a bubble of demand, a bubble of orders in the June quarter this year, and which receded and more than receded -- and which probably went the other direction and still going the other direction in this September quarter that we're in, calendar quarter. It's, I guess, pretty normal. What we think is happening is us over ordering in the June quarter because people worried about shortages, component shortages especially, and either backlash this September quarter. So I guess, this kind of behavior, it's more than likely that you will go back up the other direction, maybe to a more muted version of it in the December quarter. I think we're seeing a big part of that happening. Now one may presume that, that could also be due to weak economic performance as well. And that could well be also true. It's hard to break down one from the other. But you have to remember in the September quarter, there's summer seasonality, downward in terms of activity, but also I think the bigger chunk of it is supply chain adjusting, first one way then the other way, and possibly in December another way one more time. And the question for us is to try to see through this all and manage through this all with our distributors. Because the key bottom line is what is end -- just not end resale as much us end demand of our OEM customers that we really focus on.",315,-2.0,7.0,0.3888888888888889,0.7

It depends on whether they use discretes or front-end modules and how many bands they go under each phone carries. Some have much more bands than others. And so that's a big variation. It could range from anywhere from $3 per content, as much as $5, $6. But that aside, main thing is we don't really focus on market share. Our business model is really to get into the sockets where we are either first there, first to market in that particular socket or first into that socket, or that we have a performance differentiation that enables us to win that socket versus anybody else. And I'd be the first to admit, in many cases, we don't have that differentiation and we don't -- we generally don't try to take the business because we are not able to make a price differentiation too, which is not our business financial model. So we don't really track market share.

Interesting. Well, inverters, especially a lot of inverters that go into renewable energy that we all talked about before. Have kind of taken a breather here. Because there's been a slowdown on renewable energy, some of it to do with government subsidies, some of it to do with some technical challenges. So it seems inverters has kind of taken us a bit of a slowdown. On the other side on servo drives, models, we still see fairly strong demand out there, especially on the major, large OEMs, industrial OEMs, servo drives, and guys who sell into models -- who sell motor systems as well, still having a very, very strong -- still in a very strong period. And these are people like Japanese guys and German guys. And then I'm trying to say that because I usually don't try to mention customer names. Then the other side, and finally the last area of factory automation. Factory automation is -- yes, it goes in lumps. There's a lot of that going on especially in the last couple of quarters when there's quite a few factories being built, car factories especially, being built in different locations whether it be China or even Germany, and Eastern Europe. And we've seen very good demand for that. That's probably still better than inverters, but not as strong as servo drives.",228,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Sorry about that, but I really am not at liberty to talk much about it. But having said that, I'll point out that, yes, we're aware of a Japanese player providing samples or initial samples of what you call BAW acoustic wave, which is kind of similar technologies as our FBAR filters. But we see that every now and then. I mean, there are other players who have done that before. And you have to keep in mind, we are on probably the ninth or 10th generation of FBAR today. And these people, great engineering skills to do that, and are probably much earlier in the product life cycle development in terms of power generation. And we have probably shipped billions of those units. And that's pretty tough to be able to produce this effectively, efficiently and do that.

And I know it's pursuing one of your most lucrative areas, which has been II BAW you dominated. What's included in your guidance for wireless, the non-FEM stuff in terms of pricing?

Handset business, we always assume for the same product a certain degree of steady degree of ASP erosion for the product line's life cycle. No surprise as I'm sure for you guys. And we continue to do that. And we typically do that for -- we probably typically see at least anywhere from 3% to 4%, 5%, a quarter of ASP erosion, which we offset with cost reduction on our side, but we expect to see that for the same product going through its product life cycle. So this is no different. And in terms of -- and that's always built in assumptions, but in terms of what does it imply going forward for mix of products, and that's really not -- overall I think we will continue to compete whether is FEMs, front-end modules, or discrete elements, and we'll continue to compete on both sides. And so, I mean, we address it in a fairly long-term manner rather than try to be rather technical and not dropping prices just to keep our market -- keep our competitors in any particular -- or win sockets in any particular socket. So all that stuff, it's not really within the purview or even within the context really our long-term business model. As I said, our long-term business model is to provide products that have price differentiation. So in some -- if our competitor comes with a product that's very similar, we'll try to find a way to make one that is better, performs better. And basically, try to maintain our price premium. And we will continue to do that. That's the call of this company's business model, be it FBAR, fiber optics, optocouplers, any of the products we sell. And SerDes, the same way. That's very, very typical of what we do. It's not about competing on price. Taking that path on the case of industrial, on your question, in Q3, I did remark that we see some softness in Europe and U.S., North America, largely because of inventory adjustment. With distribution, and your question was, is it end demand that's weak versus distribution adjustment? You could be right, it could be a combination of both. But in Q3, which ends July, some part of it falls into the June quarter, as I mentioned earlier, they were typically across-the-board globally in many markets, a small bubble of demand because of the events in Japan. And so you think you go higher. What we have done is we have been very tight in ensuring that we do not -- our distributors do not -- get over shipments of parts from us in that quarter. And that may account for some of the softness we see in North America and Europe. Basically, we do not try to ship to what they specifically want based on what I consider somewhat of an excessive demand because they are concern of shortages. For the same reason in the September quarter, because our inventory is now pretty lean out there, we hope -- we try to ensure that the shipments we make into distributors will reflect the resale that they see with their end customers in all our end markets as well.",544,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start today by reviewing some of the recent business highlights, and then Doug will provide summary of the fourth quarter and full fiscal year financial results.
Now as you may have seen from our earnings announcement, we had a solid fourth quarter with record revenues and income from operations. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 is up 9% year-on-year from the fourth quarter a year ago. We saw a strong sequential growth in our Wireless Communications business in [indiscernible] and we expected at the beginning of the quarter. This was offset partially by weaker than expected performance from our industrial and consumer end markets.
We believe worldwide volatility in the financial markets and slow growth in China's economy is causing a number of OEMs and most distributors to take risks out of their business models and to substantially reduce their inventory levels. Because of this, we see the impact of lower component demand in our industrial markets. In contrast, however, we also experience certain phenomena that leads our revenues in this period of demand uncertainty. 
In particular, certain wireless OEM winners in the marketplace have been able to grow force. Additionally, in wired networking, investments in core routing and data centers remain strong, very much to our benefit in SerDes and fiber. The recent and ongoing flooding in Thailand is having an impact on varied semiconductor and optical supply chains. While the impact on our own business was small in Q4, we expect revenue could be negatively impacting the range of $10 million to $20 million in Q1.
Certain multimarket wireless and industrial products were being tested, assembled with a contract manufacturer based in the flood zone. Most facilities there have been shut down as a result. We are in the process of moving equipment and qualifying new contract manufacturers to bring the manufacturing of these products back online, and we expect this work to be substantially completed during the course of Q1.
With that, let me turn to results from each of our target markets. Within wireless, we manufacture our bond, as you may know, duplexers, power amplifiers, light and proximity sensors and optical single navigations for smartphones and feature-reach phones. We also manufacture RF components for wireless base stations and wireless infrastructure markets. Sales from our wireless communications target market represented 42% of our fourth quarter revenue, and our revenue from this target market grew 16% compared to Q3 and 18% compared to a year ago. This performance was stronger than our expectations for the quarter. Growth in Q4 was driven largely by strength in our power amplifier business driven by the launch of new smartphones.
Our cutting-edge Multi-mode Multi-band Power Amplifiers continue to ramp very successfully. Looking ahead to first quarter fiscal '12, the quarter we are in right now, we expect overall wireless revenues to decline on a percentage basis in the low double digits compared to Q4. In line with normal seasonality, we expect the RF portion of this business to be down by high single digits, exacerbated by weakness in our OFN Optical Finger Navigation business.
Next, within wired infrastructure, as you may know, too, we design high-speed SerDes ASICs and manufacture optical or fiber optic transceivers for enterprise networking data center switching and high-speed computing applications. Revenue from the wired infrastructure market represented 28% of our total Q4 sales. In Q4, our sales from this wired infrastructure market grew 4% over Q3 and grew 24% over Q4 2010. 
In fact, this business has been our steady-eddie. Revenues from the wired infrastructure market grew slightly better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. We benefited from strong double-digit growth from our SerDes ASIC business during the quarter due to the ramp of new customer programs in Nexus switches and the MX edge routers as well as new design wins in ASICs. 
Looking forward to Q1, we expect overall revenues from wired target -- wired infrastructure target market to decline high single digits quarter-on-quarter. After a strong quarter in Q4, we believe we expect a chase spending on core routing programs, which tend to be lumpy, appear to be slowing this quarter especially for proprietary 5 gigabit per second fiber optics.
Turning to industrial and automotive electronics target market, we manufacture and sell optocouplers, motion encoders and industrial fiber. Net revenue from this market accounted for 26% of our Q4 2011 net revenue. Net revenue -- net sales from this end market declined 10% compared to the prior quarter and declined 6% from the same quarter a year ago.
Worse than expected weakness during the quarter came mainly from slower sales of our optocouplers and motion encoders. We believe this was driven by slow economic growth in China and a slowdown in -- particularly a slowdown in the renewable energy sector, which triggered OEMs and distributors to contract their supply chain. We experienced this particularly in Europe and Asia-Pacific within the servo drives and inverter segments. We expect a continued supply chain contraction exacerbated in Q1 by the ongoing flooding in Thailand will lead to revenue from the industrial market to be down low to mid single-digit this quarter.
Finally, in consumer and computing peripherals, we manufacture, as you know, tagged navigation sensors for optical mice and motion sensors for printers. Revenue from this target market represented only 4% of our fourth quarter 2011 sales, and revenues from this market decreased 18% from last quarter and have shrunk 31% on a year-on-year basis. We continue to see muted demand here.
In summary, Q4 revenue growth from smartphones and wired infrastructure more than offset weakness in industrial and consumer, allowing us to show slight overall revenue growth for the quarter. In Q1, we see all our end markets declining and believe revenue would decrease between 10% and 14% as compared to Q4. Now you realize here our OEM revenue really has not been the problem. It will only decline single digit as is the case normally seasonally. But supply chain contractions, particularly industrial, are magnified by distributors as we substantially lower our revenue into the distribution channel this quarter.
Just stepping back, as we aim 2011 fiscal year, Avago, we believe, we see that Avago has achieved a number of milestones we set for ourselves. December 2010, we completed buyback of remaining senior subordinated notes, leaving the company essentially debt-free through the year. In the same month, we initiated a dividend for shareholders starting at $0.07 a share. We have increased this dividend each quarter in the fiscal year and paid $0.11 per share by the quarter ending September 30, 2011.
Power optics are an exciting growth area for Avago. It is also a proprietary area, a product area for us. And in November 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirm the strength of our intellectual property around this technology. The decision include our proprietary embedded technologies as well as our industry standard field pluggable phone factors, and we remain very committed to protecting and enforcing our patent and intellectual property rights here.
Also, over the course of the fiscal year, our private equity ownership of Avago declined from approximately 60% to approximately 10% through 5 public offerings of our shares. And finally, by growing revenues 12% year-on-year, we achieved the top end of our revenue model. And additionally, we grew non-GAAP gross margin by 260 basis points year-on-year.
Later in this call, Doug will provide an update to our financial model. Our goal is to grow revenue 10% to 12% annually to expand growth of product margins and to leverage our infrastructure to expand our operating margin on an annual basis. To support the anticipated growth of our proprietary products, especially in Multi-mode Power Amplifiers, we expect to expand our manufacturing processes in Fort Collins, Colorado. A side benefit of making of this front end manufacturing investment is an expected improvement in gross margins for our wireless business in the years ahead. We do expect capital expenditures to increase, however, in fiscal 2012 to approximately $200 million from $112 million in fiscal 2011.
With that quick summary, let me now turn the call over to Doug for a more detailed review of fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 financial results.",1376,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2011",2011-12-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3670.0,198418.0,11869804.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Okay. Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today, as always, will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and is also available on our website at avagotech.com.
Record revenue of $623 million in Q4 represents an increase of 3% from last quarter and an increase of 9% versus the same quarter a year ago. And as Hock reviewed, the sequential increase was in line with our guidance. However, revenue from our wireless and wired target market came in better than we expected, and revenue from our industrial and consumer target markets came in worse than we expected.
Resales from our distribution partners declined in Q4 relative to Q3, while our distribution inventory rose somewhat. This put us at the end of the quarter at the higher end of our desired distribution inventory model. And as Hock alluded to, we expect this inventory level will be down in Q1. I would point out, somewhat fortuitously, the uptick in inventory is mitigating the impact from the Thai supply disruption. And just a final comment on disti; we have not seen resales begin to grow again, the decline that we saw during Q4 seems to have stabilized at this lower level.
Q4 gross margin was 51.2%. This was down from last quarter and slightly below the midpoint of our guidance. The biggest driver of the sequential decline in gross margin was lower revenue from our high-margin industrial end market and higher revenue from our lower margin wireless end market. During the quarter, R&D expenses decreased $2 million sequentially to $79 million. SG&A also decreased this by $5 million to $49 million. 
The decreases in R&D and SG&A were driven by lower variable compensation as well as tight control of discretionary spending. As a percentage of sales, R&D remained at 13%, while SG&A declined to 8% of net revenue. Income from operations increased by $14 million sequentially to $191 million, which was a new record for Avago and represented 31% of net revenue. Q4 income from operations compares with income from operations of $177 million in Q3 and with $171 million in Q4 of last year.
Taxes for Q4 were slightly higher than guidance at $5 million due to the jurisdictional mix of income. These results translate into net income of $186 million, which is up 6% from last quarter. Q4 earnings per diluted share of $0.73 compares with $0.68 in Q3. Net income in Q4 of 2010 was $190 million or $0.76 per diluted share. And I should just remind you, from a year ago, Q4 2010 net income benefited from a $29 million discrete tax benefit, which was roughly $0.11 per diluted share, which resulted from the redemption of our senior subordinated notes.
Total share-based compensation in Q4 was $11 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q4 excludes $1 million in cost of goods sold, $4 million in R&D and $6 million in SG&A. In Q1, I anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $12 million. And just a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
Let me now move to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding was 48 days. This was up 5 days from the prior quarter, primarily due to the linearity of revenue in Q4. Inventory came in at $194 million, which was down 3% from last quarter. This translated to days on hand of 58 days, which was down 5 days from Q3 and is below our inventory model. I do think it's possible that inventory could grow slightly next quarter. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash balance was $829 million. The primary change in cash came from $195 million of cash that was provided by operations. And I wanted to just foreshadow Q1 for you a little bit here. Q1 is generally our weakest quarter for cash generation due to the seasonally lower revenues as well as the payment of annual employee bonuses that relate to the prior fiscal year.
CapEx in Q4 was $37 million, which was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We expect CapEx in Q1 to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million. As Hock referred or as Hock referenced, approximately $200 million for the full year is our CapEx expectation. The sequential increase will primarily be driven by capacity additions in our wireless factory, as well as additional spending, to bring alternative contract manufacturers online in response to the flooding in Thailand.
At September 30 of 2011, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share. This consumed $27 million of cash. This dividend was raised $0.02 from the prior quarter. And finally, during Q4, we repurchased and canceled approximately 750,000 shares, which consumed $25 million of cash. And as it was yearend, let me briefly recap our fiscal 2011 full year results. Revenue increased by 12% to approximately $2.3 billion. Gross margin improved by 260 basis points to 51.7% as compared to 49.1% for fiscal 2010. Net income for fiscal 2011 increased to $692 million or $2.70 per diluted share as compared to $547 million or $2.19 per diluted share in fiscal 2010.
Let me now review the balance of our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. 
Revenue is expected to decline 10% to 14% sequentially. This is driven by wireless seasonality, the general industry slowdown as well as supply challenges from the flooding in Thailand. Gross margin is expected to be 50.5% plus or minus 100 basis points. This decline is due to anticipated product mix shifts, particularly within the wireless end market. 
Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $125 million and forecasting interest and other to be approximately negative $1 million due to currency impacts from yen-based foreign exchange liabilities. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $4 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 254,000,000 shares.
Finally, let me review the medium-term business model for Avago, which I said I would update you on during the Q3 earnings call.
While this is not intended to represent annual guidance, this is the non-GAAP model that we manage the business to. Our goal is to grow revenue at an annual pace of approximately 10% to 12%. Our desire is to have gross margin in the range of 50% to 53%. We are targeting R&D to be approximately 14% of net revenue. We targeting SG&A to be approximately 8% of net revenue. And consequently, if you do the math, our goal is to have operating margins in the range of 28% to 31% of net revenue. And finally, I expect taxes to remain in the range of 3% to 4% of operating income.

As you can gather, most of our industrial business go through distributors. And as you also know, we recognize revenue on a shipping basis into the distributors. And the interesting thing we see in this whole process is that a resale, which is the end demander of distributors, see, as Doug pointed out in his remarks, kind of flatted out in this quarter. Q1 has gone -- is pretty much flattened out. However, on a shipping basis to our distributors, we continue to bring down revenues particularly. And part of the reason for that is one -- is the fact that, one, related to the Thai flooding where a lot of industrial products are affected. We had brought in products to mitigate that flooding impact in Q4 but 2, is also our ability to ship has been reduced in this quarter. So we'll be shipping less of the -- bottom line is we are shipping in the distributors less of our products than likely we are reselling in Q1.",171,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Okay, let me try to clarify that. No, what I did say, a couple of points I did try to indicate is it's interesting to know that over the past 12 months in fiscal '11, our OEM demand has been very consistently sequentially up from the beginning of Q1 all the way up to this past recent Q4. Our OEM demand, OEM revenue, has been sequentially up all the way through. And even in Q1 where we're guiding a normal seasonal downturn, we see only a very relative, a normal seasonal downturn with respect to our OEM business. In contrast of that in our distributor side, revenue has been rather all over the map. But more than not is, especially since the middle of fiscal '11, we've seen the revenues into our distributors. And resale from our distributors obviously declined and a rollover, in fact, and start to decline. And the decline accelerated particularly in our fiscal Q4 on resale and our revenue, too. And our resale from distributors will be almost flattish from Q4 and Q1. But in terms of adjusting our inventory in our distributors, we will continue in this guidance in our forecast to continue to ship less into our distributors and that's why our distributor revenue in Q1 will be down significantly from Q4.",228,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

It's where our power optics are rather proprietary, very high bandwidth, affordable power -- high-bandwidth optics play in. It's a fairly substantial part of our business now. And it gets lumpy quarter-on-quarter. And it's because of the investments made usually by service providers. And they make very -- and they buy, they buy in a big chunk. And last quarter was very strong, Q4. We don't expect it to, in Q1, to be as strong. And that's the reason why it dropped. Just as in Q2, they might resume some lumpy buying in some programs, whether it's America or China. And then we'll bounce back up again.

On consumer, it's obviously -- as we -- as you have seen over the last 12 months or even longer than that, our business here has actually shrunk, continues to shrink, and that's because we're really down to optical miles and encoders for basically printers, particularly HP printers. Now both markets are not growth markets. And in fact, those 2 markets have some ASP pressures, but the main reason is those markets are not particularly strong. They don't grow much. And so it's been a shrinking market compared to the rest of our business, which are all fairly robust and growing, broadly speaking. So that's probably -- that's pretty much why our consumer business is down to less than 4% of our overall revenues. We just have 2 product lines, none of which are growing.

Well, I mean, this is -- frankly, this just could -- I know some of our competitors use that term. And I'll be honest as I am not even 100% sure what they mean by that. I mean, what you have now, we call it multiband multimode. In some ways, it's -- a converged PA might be a subset of that. It's -- the whole concept is, as you need more and more interfaces, 3G or UMTS, multiple bands, LTE add-on for the bands, bands being different parts of the frequency, you basically, theoretically, you have a duplexer and a PA for every band. And you never get away from duplexers, one duplexer per band. But in the case of power amplifiers, technology and the ways you think at design and process, you may be able to get away with sharing power amplifiers among bands. And I don't know if that's what people mean. But really, by sharing single power amplifier among a few bands, that's really what they mean -- what we mean by multiband multimode PAs, and maybe that's what somebody else mean by converged PAs. But I'm not really sure what they mean, but from our point of view, we don't use that term.

I'm just trying to get my arms around why you wouldn't be seeing better than seasonal performance in Q1 given how well you've done in North America.",106,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

And what we're guiding obviously is that we -- Q1 every year is a seasonally down quarter compared to Q4. Guess Q4 is just so strong. And our Q1, as you recall, covers not only late -- covers -- not only covers December but also covers the whole of January when things tend to be slowdown regardless of whatever it is, whichever player it is. So it's based on historical precedents that we are guiding there's expected seasonality. And as I mentioned, in handsets, RF, we are guiding the normal seasonality, which is really more close to single digits, but couple with that was the fact that OFN, as I mentioned, which gets classified in wireless is also flattening, declining, in fact, because of inventory adjustments that we see in a major customer. So that together -- those 2 effects combine to show wireless going down below normal seasonality, which is double digits.",159,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

In RF components, we're just -- we're guiding normal seasonality. So across the board, we would say that, yes, there are some winners and there are some not so winner -- losers, so to speak, in handset OEMs. But on a combined basis, given our share position and our exposure to such a breadth of handset -- media handset players today, I don't think we'll be totally immune from the impact of specter showing a seasonal weakness. That's the reason why we're guiding to normal weakness or normal seasonality downwards for our RF business. And that includes both FBAR and power amplifiers, by the way. It's just a normal seasonality we are guiding to. And that's typically in the single digits. Well, as I said, we're overlaying on it the effect of OFN.",139,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

No, there's no one particular one making that particular impact, which is why we are asked to kind of drive our forecast seasonally, far from it. We're using that normal seasonality.

And of course, we sell-through major OEMs in Germany, in Europe, in Japan even in the U.S. Which then re-export to China.

As we see the constitution of smartphone growth move more toward Asia out of the more penetrated U.S. market, how does that affect the wireless business? How does that affect the proportion of FBAR as a portion of your sales? And is that a factor contributing to your bringing more of the gas capacity in-house?",62,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And, yes, here is with our thinking long term of the wireless RF component business source. And as you know, we supply both FBAR duplexers, the filter that is, as well as the power amplifiers now. And where we see is you're right. More and more of the growth, if you look at smartphone growth as opposed to total handset growth, more and more smartphone growth will be coming from emerging countries like China where -- and even parts -- certain parts of Europe, but definitely China emerging countries where smartphones are lower or lesser penetrated, so that will be one sector of it. Having said that, one other interesting thing we find in this wireless handset market or smartphone market is it pushes, constantly pushes, the envelope in next-generation as we see from 3G to 4G LTE or 4G, as we call it, and will be next 4.5, 5G. And as each -- what it implies is more and more bands out there. And more than more and more bands out there, more and more roaming from different countries come in, which basically require every phone, every hand smartphones to have more and more RF content. So what we see is another situation where these developed countries or emerging countries and particularly so in developed countries where the content of the RF content of smartphone increases fairly rapidly. As I mentioned earlier, one band requires in theory one duplexer, discrete duplexer, and one PA. You can integrate the PA, the power amplifiers, so that they share across bands, but duplexers, much, much harder, in fact, impossible. So the duplexer content will definitely grow very linearly with the complexity of smartphones as we move to higher wireless bandwidth over time. Power amplifiers may not grow as linearly but still the content will increase. And so far, as we see this smartphone market as an extremely interesting opportunity that will continue to grow very, very well for us.",330,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7
