Applied's first quarter of fiscal 2013 largely played out as we had expected. Thanks to solid execution and disciplined management of discretionary spending, we delivered $0.06 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which represented the high end of our outlook.
Overall, I am pleased with how we navigated the bottom of this industry investment cycle. And with our semiconductor orders up over 80% in the first quarter, we are more optimistic about the potential of our markets this year.
Implementation of the restructuring plan we outlined in the fall is progressing well. The actions we are taking include permanent shifts in the cost basis of the company, as well as a substantial reduction in our solar investments.
By re-prioritizing our spending, we are able to strengthen customer-facing technical resources and accelerate product development programs. This supports our strategic priorities to expand our share in wafer fab equipment and drive profitable long-term growth in display and solar.
Now let me provide an overview of our markets. Global demand for mobile products remains strong, and we expect year-on-year growth of around 35% for smartphones and 55% for tablets. Growth at this level will support solid investment by the foundries, and we believe these customers will represent around 45% of wafer fab equipment spending in 2013.
Mobile devices are also driving demand for NAND flash memory. However, some of the growth in this market is being suppressed by lower-end smartphone and tablet models that are specifically tailored for emerging markets and equipped with less onboard memory.
Overall, NAND is growing, and we believe that bit growth rates will be in the range of 50% for 2013, which is sufficient to support investment in new capacity by the second half of the year. Our development teams are working closely with customers on 3D NAND technology. And when this inflection occurs, it will drive an additional investment cycle by memory manufacturers.
The PC market looks to be relatively flat this year, as touch-enabled hybrid models blur the lines between traditional laptops and tablets, there's a potential upside to this scenario.
For the time being, we remain cautious about logic investment, expecting to see a modest increase in spending relative to 2012, primarily due to the timing of factory buildouts.
DRAM prices are starting to rise. However, we still anticipate DRAM investment remaining at low levels, with spending limited to technology conversions.
In recent weeks, there have been some positive announcements from our largest customers. As a result, we now believe the 2013 wafer fab equipment will be flat to down 10%, relative to 2012 spending of around $30 billion.
In order to reach the high end of the range, we'll need to see investment from a broader base of logic and foundry customers in the second half of the year, as well as an uptick in NAND investment.
We believe that we can outgrow wafer fab equipment in 2013, with share gains driven by strong demand for our transistor products, combined with application wins and inspection, and a customer spending mix that's favorable to Applied Materials.
In Display, there is sense of a renewed excitement in the TV market, with 60-inch and larger models reaching attractive price points and the introduction of new 4K resolution. Following a 2-year period of capacity digestion, we expect investment in new display factories to resume in the second half of the year.
Customers are still cautious and the timing of their factory builds will largely depend on their confidence in the macro environment. Orders for equipment to manufacture touch panels and high-performance mobile screens remain healthy, and production is moving to larger substrate sizes, particularly Gen 6.
In solar, end markets continue to grow at between 10% and 20% annually, and it looks like overall 2012 installations ended the year at around 31 gigawatts. However, conditions within the supply chain remain extremely challenging, with consolidation and rationalization of manufacturing capacity happening more slowly than we had anticipated.
Our approach in solar is to be prudent. We are taking additional steps to scale back our investment until there are clear indications that the market conditions are improving.
Before I hand the call over to Gary, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish George every success in his new role at Qualcomm and thank him on behalf of every one at Applied for all the contributions he has made to our company during the past 13 years. We are in the process of selecting a successor from a strong pool of internal and external candidates, and we expect to appoint a new CFO in the coming weeks.
Now let me hand the call over to Gary for additional comments about our business and strategic priorities. Gary?",791,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2013",2013-02-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3683.0,415948.0,19623034.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Mike. I would also like to wish George well in his new position at Qualcomm and thank him for everything he has done to help get Applied to the position of financial strength that we enjoy today.
As Mike outlined, the expected levels of capital investment by our semiconductor and display customers provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. Also, major trends within these markets create great opportunities for Applied to extend our leadership in precision materials engineering and grow faster than the markets themselves.
The most important component of our strategy for profitable growth is to increase our share of wafer fab equipment. In Q1, we built momentum for market share gains by winning several new development tool of record positions at the 20-nanometer node and converted a number of existing positions into volume orders.
Demand for better mobile products is driving innovation, and we are seeing major inflections in device technology and the introduction of many new materials, as customers strive to differentiate themselves with extended battery life, low power and higher performance products.
These inflections are enabled by precision materials engineering applications, including precision films, material removal, material modification and interface engineering. This is where Applied has clear technology and market leadership and will be a major factor in driving our growth in wafer fab equipment share.
Over the past 3 months, we've been implementing important organizational changes to strengthen our teams and redeploy funding to accelerate our highest impact growth programs. We have restructured our workforce. We have scaled back our investment in solar. And we have carried out an extensive review of our R&D portfolio, stopping programs where we believe we didn't have valuable, sustainable differentiation and increasing funding for programs where we do.
As a result, we are shifting approximately $200 million to key strategic priorities that drive profitable growth. Our strategy is to focus on allocating the appropriate level of investment to market segments where we believe we can achieve a leadership position. This means ramping investment in some areas, while reducing or eliminating investment in others. On an ongoing basis, we will look at every aspect of our business through the lens of profitable growth and prioritize every dollar toward our best opportunities.
One area where we are investing is in field technical resources to upgrade the interfaces between customers and our R&D teams. By strengthening our field technical teams, we will build stronger customer relationships and ensure we are the company our customers seek out first to solve their highest value device performance and yield challenges.
In addition, we have combined the best product development practices across the company. And to date, we have trained 35 development teams in their application. This is improving our ability to define winning products and increasing the velocity of our development process.
Let me now provide an update for each of our businesses. In Semiconductor, technology inflections that enable lower leakage transistors, low-resistance interconnects and advanced patterning are expanding our markets and providing a catalyst to grow our share. Our market leadership in the overall transistor module, combined with the most significant transistor device technology changes in the last 10 years, creates a great opportunity for Applied Materials.
As foundry customers add capacity for the 28-nanometer node and start to ramp 20-nanometer technology, capital intensity is rising in the areas where Applied has the best technology and is a leader. As a result, we expect the strong 2012 performance that we demonstrated in our front-end products, implant and PVD businesses to continue in 2013.
In addition, the adoption of new epitaxy steps and advanced foundry technology nodes will enable us to further grow our Epi business. We achieved important milestones in our first quarter, winning development and production tool of record selections at our top 3 customers.
The past 2 years have been a challenging period for our CMP business and lost market share in 2012 due to an unfavorable customer spending mix. Significant improvements to our latest generation tool delivers a clear architectural advantage for advanced nodes, and we expect to start recapturing share in 2013.
Inspection represents an attractive growth driver for Applied, and I am pleased with the progress our team is making. We had very strong customer pull for our wafer inspection and review products last year, and we believe foundry and logic wins for our Brightfield tools will translate into continued momentum in 2013.
In Etch, we are focusing on key technology inflections in market segments where we believe we have opportunities to deliver technology with sustainable differentiation. With recent new application wins in logic, foundry and NAND flash, we are starting to demonstrate positive momentum.
Turning to Display. Larger TV sizes and 4K ultra-high definition are important trends that create opportunities for us to increase share. These trends drive larger panels and smaller pixels that increase the value of the device performance and yield advantages of our technology.
As 60-inch and larger TVs become a higher percentage of the market, we anticipate more manufacturers will move to Gen 10 substrates. This transition is an important inflection that plays to Applied's advantage and will enable us to leverage our leadership in particles and uniformity to gain market share in PVD and extend our leadership in CVD.
As we have previously announced, we have taken actions in EES to reduce our costs and restructure the organization. We continue to monitor industry conditions closely. And based on our current market view, we decided to further lower our spending beyond the levels discussed in the last earnings call.
By the end of this fiscal year, our goal is to reduce EES operating expenses to a run rate below $25 million per quarter. We continue to invest where we can provide differentiated technology to enable higher cell efficiencies and lower cost per watt and remain confident that this business can deliver long term profitable growth for Applied.
In summary, we are optimistic about our opportunities for the year ahead, and we are confident that the strategy we are executing will drive profitable growth. We are focused on growing our share of wafer fab equipment and have strong momentum.
We are making prudent investments in display and solar, and we continue to strengthen the organization in areas that are critical to our success.
Let me now hand the call over to George for further details on our performance. George?",1066,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2013",2013-02-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3683.0,415948.0,19623035.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. To begin, I would like to thank Mike and Gary for their good wishes and partnership. I would also like to thank Applied's employees, investors and the analyst community for the opportunity to have worked with you. For more than a decade, it has been my privilege to work with some of the best and brightest minds in the industry. And finally, I am very proud of the finance team at Applied Materials.
Now I will cover our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2013. Orders increased 44% from the prior quarter to $2.1 billion, led by strong demand for semiconductor and display equipment. Our backlog increased 31% to $2.1 billion, and our book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.3.
Net sales of $1.6 billion were at the high end of our outlook due to stronger-than-expected performance in SSG. Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.8%, up 1.4 points sequentially despite lower revenue, driven by a higher mix of SSG revenue and lower inventory reserves.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million. Excluding certain favorable items, our non-GAAP operating expense would have been approximately $535 million, in line with our guidance.
In Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating expense to increase to $560 billion, plus or minus $10 million, reflecting the absence of holiday shutdown savings of $15 million, along with increased investment in SSG, partially offset by increased savings from our various cost reduction programs.
For the year, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly $2.2 billion, essentially unchanged from 2012. This includes a sizable increase in growth funding for SSG, enabled by operating cost improvements related to the workforce reductions announced in October, the EES restructuring and the integration of Varian.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.2%, and we now expect a rate of 24% to 26% for the year, an improvement of 1 point from our previous estimate, primarily from the benefit of the R&D tax credit.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.06 were at the high end of the target range, led by strong SSG performance and lower operating expenses. The cost to date of the workforce reduction program announced in October is $110 million. We now expect the total cost to be in the range of $120 million to $160 million, below the original estimate of $180 million to $230 million. The primary reasons for the change in estimate are lower relative participation levels in the voluntary retirement program and a reduced estimate of the final cost of benefits.
We expect annual savings and headcount reductions to be within the ranges originally provided. Cash from operations was approximately $16 million, reflecting lower revenue levels, severance payments related to workforce reductions and the timing of annual variable compensation payments. We expect cash from operations to trend back in line with historical performance over the remainder of the year.
Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.8 billion, a sequential decline of $177 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be: Investing in attractive opportunities in our core businesses; increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business; and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash.
Next I will comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 84% to $1.4 billion, driven by foundry and well above our outlook of up more than 25%. 74% of the orders were from 3 customers, reflecting the concentration of investments in Q1 and our increasing momentum at the largest customers.
Net sales increased 11% to $969 million, just above the high end of our outlook, with an increase in foundry, partially offset by lower NAND revenue. Again, we saw a very high concentration, with 75% of revenue from our top 3 customers. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin grew to 18.6%.
In AGS, orders were down 6% to $544 million. Net sales were down 24% to $471 million, near the low end of our outlook. Excluding the thin-film solar line recognized in the fourth quarter, net sales would have been down 12%.
The revenue decline reflected tight customer spending controls, as wafer starts and overall utilization rates trended lower for the second consecutive quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin declined to 19.3%.
In Display, orders increased 66% to $138 million, reflecting ongoing mobility investments and the beginning of a resurgence in TV equipment orders. We continue to be optimistic for further TV and mobile equipment order strength in the second half.
Net sales in the quarter were $87 million, in line with our outlook, with the vast majority of revenue from mobile display systems. Non-GAAP operating margin grew to 5.7%, demonstrating the group's focus on remaining profitable in a low revenue environment.
In EES, orders were $68 million, primarily due to strength in our web equipment business, while solar equipment orders remained depressed, due to ongoing overcapacity issues for our customers. Net sales were $46 million, in line with our outlook. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $44 million. We are on track to reduce the quarterly run rate for non-GAAP operating expense to below $30 million by the end of Q2, a 20% reduction from Q1 levels.

As we look forward to our second quarter, net sales from our Semiconductor business should be up 20% to 35%. We expect orders to remain strong, approximately at Q1 levels.
Net sales in AGS are expected to be flat to up 10%, reflecting a gradual recovery in wafer starts and utilization levels as the year progresses.
We expect net sales in Display to be flat to up 25%. Orders are expected to increase by more than 20% with the start of TV capacity additions and continued strength in mobility.
Net sales in EES are expected to be approximately flat, remaining at low levels. Overall, we expect net sales for the company to be up 15% to 25%, and our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.15.

Thanks for your question. Very good question. If you look inside our numbers, close to 3/4 of the orders in Q1 are from foundry. As we think about the progression through the year, we do have to have broader foundry participation, but we also need to see logic investment pick up fairly dramatically in the second half, along with NAND flash spending for capacity and then for 3D NAND technology. So that's kind of the progression. We should start to see that by the end of our Q2 or the beginning of our Q3, that transition as foundry comes down as a percentage overall and the other areas in WFE starting to rise.",115,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then the second question, the follow-up question is around a comment that I believe Gary made around some of the advances in transistor technology, in finFET, creating a really good opportunity to gain some share and gain some tool of record positions.

And in the area around the foundry customers that are ramping gate-last technology or finFET technologies, the market share is probably even higher. So this certainly provides a great opportunity for us to grow share. When I think about our overall share position, in 2012, in 300-millimeter, we gained share, a small amount of market share. We look at 2013 as an opportunity to even accelerate that. And '14, when the 20-nanometer gate last is adopted by a number of foundry customers, we've said that, that creates an opportunity for our CapEx to go up 30% at those customers.

We really think DRAM spending is still going to be flat at a low level year-over-year. We think foundry will be down slightly, but perhaps not down as much as we had previously anticipated. And then NAND, about 15% of the total, with spending profile that's stronger in the second half. And then logic, we're thinking will be modestly up as well year-over-year. So in total, that makes -- that nets out to have us move up from -- last time we said 5% to 15% down, now we're saying, flat to down 10%. So that's how far we've moved in the last few months. I'd like to frankly move into the positive territory in the next 3 months. We'll see how the orders play out here.",169,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

I'm a paranoid person. And I'm comfortable once the tool is in the customer's fab and paid for. So I think that we always have to be aggressive in looking at these types of situations. But certainly, I think our order momentum, customers are also buying for multiple technology nodes as you know. So even when they're making 28-nanometer decisions, they're looking to 2016 and future technology nodes and what your position will be there. So I think the strong increase in orders in Q1 for us is a very good sign. Certainly, the discussions we've had with customers have been very positive. And we're overall very optimistic. But again, it's not done until the tools are in the fab and paid for. And so we'll remain focused until that happens.",138,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

And I would still use the term modestly. A couple of things. We're, of course, seeing strength in pricing for NAND utilization and factories are improving. We went back and looked at our analysis of how much bit growth you need to see capacity increases and really have readjusted that. So we need to see about 45% bit growth before we see capacity additions. And then, of course, detailed discussions with customers. And also, we think that 3D NAND is progressing and at least initial pilot line orders will come in for 3D NAND before the end of the year.

And I would say that, Ali's been here for 2 months and the response internally and also, externally, has been extremely positive, very bright, very focused on technology leadership, driving profitable growth. Ali's really hit the ground running and is doing a great job in EES and Display. Another major change we've made is in the SSG organization. We formed a new transistor group within the last month, pulling together all of the different technologies that we have under Steve Ghanayem. And as we've talked about many times, that's really a fantastic opportunity for Applied Materials. And so we're organizing around that strategy. And if that will help us in terms of execution on that opportunity. We've brought in a lot of really good people to mix with already the tremendous talent we have within Applied Materials, both on the technology and marketing side.

We've certainly driven the cost down pretty dramatically. I think in Q4 of '12, we were $50 million -- $45 million, $50 million. As we said, exiting Q4 of '13 in the solar business, we'll down to be about $20 million. So we've cut back in terms of the OpEx spending.

We do expect gross margin to improve in the quarter, as you would expect with volume. And if you look at the EPS guidance, basically, what you're seeing is all of the benefit from volume and margin improvements in the quarter. So the midpoint of the guidance is up $0.06. And we do include in that, obviously, a significant increase in OpEx. But again, on OpEx, you have to look at Q1 as an anomaly. We had $535 million if you take out the favorable items in there. But we also had the shutdowns, which meant that our real run rate was much closer to $550 million. So the rate that we're going up to at $560 million really just reflects incremental funding moving into, again, primarily into SSG. And I think that rate. If you look at the second half of the year, will look relatively flat with that rate.",160,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Let me go through inspection first. Obviously, this is an area I have a lot of experience. We have a really great team, incredibly strong customer pull. In 2012, in wafer inspection and review, we gained a few points of share. We're winning. We had some good wins in Brightfield inspection with customers here recently that also create market share momentum for us in 2013 in wafer inspection and review. So again, overall, I would say, optimistic on wafer inspection. That's a very good business for us in contributing profit to the company. In the Etch business, also we have a very good team. Some customer pull, some recent wins, both in foundry and NAND flash that make us more optimistic. And again, as I've said before, both of these markets are multiple segments, and our focus is not to boil the ocean. We want to focus in the areas where we can have differentiation and we can establish a strong market share position. And we have a very clear strategy in both of these different businesses.

As we look at kind of foundry capacity and what we think will be added. As we said at the outset, it will be primarily driven by strong demand in mobile phones, smartphones and tablets. So in the 28-nanometer area, we think between 75,000 and 100,000 wafer starts per month will be added. And in 20-nanometer, it's a little harder to tell our -- because it also depends on how well those technologies move up the yield curve. But right now, we're estimating about 25,000 wafers in 20-nanometer this year. And that would be really in the second half, late in the second half of the year.",109,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And again, as I talked about earlier, customers will buy for multiple technology nodes. So they'll focus on certainly 28-nanometer. if that's what's they're running in production today. But again, they want technologies that can work for 28, 20, 16, all of these different technology nodes.

So I think on 3D NAND, I mean, there's a pretty significant increase in bit density. So I think as soon as the customers have those devices yielding, they're going to try to ramp them as fast as they can. The biggest issue has been being able to get the yield where they want it to be. As I said before, again, this is a really great opportunity for us. If you look at the number of deposition steps in a 3D NAND process. I mean, Epi is a pretty low throughput application. And you start approaching those types of throughputs on wafers per hour per chamber with some of the 3D NAND applications.

First, 3D is a huge trend here, not just in NAND, but in transistors and packaging. It's one of the biggest inflections we're going to see over the next few years. But this is a huge change to move away from litho defined shrinking and really be able to move the process defined where precision materials engineering, interface engineering really, really matters, and it's why we're so excited about this area. And we think at 32 vertical bits or something like this, this is economical at the kind of 45, 50-nanometer node, where companies are aiming the first generation here. But you have to believe, once they solve the device and reliability issues, it will be very easy for them to move very fast, both down the litho curve and increase the number of bits in the stack.",151,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Maybe I can start and Gary can finish. On the -- as we start -- this current generation of TV fabs will be Gen 8.5. But what we're seeing is, and primarily in China, we're starting to see the orders come in for those factories. So that's really quite beneficial for us. We think that 60-inch TVs are starting to get to the price points that -- to a real volume price point or now starting to approach $1,000 very soon, under $1,000. These -- that kind of price point will drive the industry to Gen 10 just because of how many -- how many TVs you can get on one sheet of glass and to make that economical. But it's pretty clear to us now that while we haven't had a glass size change in, I guess, 5 years, that there's one that's really going to come.

In our second fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered earnings that exceeded the high end of our outlook. We fulfilled request for accelerated delivery of orders from a number of our semiconductor and display customers, while carefully managing our spending.
At this point in the year, 2013 is shaping up largely as we have expected. Demand for semiconductor equipment is healthy, utilization at our customers' factories is steadily increasing and investment in display is strengthening.
Across the company, we are building momentum for profitable growth. Over the past 2 quarters, we have implemented measures to reduce our overhead cost and have redeployed spending to product development and our customer-facing technical teams. These changes are enabling us to strengthen customer collaborations and increase our product development velocity.
We are focusing our R&D investments on key programs that support our strategic priority to increase our share in wafer fab equipment, while making targeted investments in display and other opportunities that expand our total available market. We see further opportunities to reduce our operating expenses and organizational complexity to improve operating margins at current revenue levels and provide significant earnings leverage as volumes increase. Bob will discuss these opportunities later in the call.
Major industry trends are expanding our served available market and play to our strengths in precision materials engineering. We expect to grow our share of wafer fab equipment this year, while winning key development tool of record positions that provide a foundation for additional share gains in 2014 and beyond.
We're also building momentum in Display. Customers are adding capacity, and we are seeing stronger order growth. We are significantly increasing our share of the display PVD market, complementing our strong position in CVD.
In Semiconductor, the mobility trend remains the biggest factor influencing industry growth. The global appetite for always-on, always-connected mobile devices continues to strengthen. And now, the value of silicon being consumed by smartphones and tablets has surpassed that being used by PCs, around 200 million smartphones and 35 million tablets shipped in the first calendar quarter of 2013. That's in line with the expected annual growth rates of 35% for phones and 55% for tablets. Demand for the advanced application and baseband processors used in smartphones and tablets is fueling investment by foundries, as they add capacity at 28-nanometers begin 20-nanometer pilot production and accelerate the development of 3D transistors. Transistor performance is the key battleground for our foundry customers.
In his latest earnings call, Morris Chang described how TSMC has differentiated offering in High-k/Metal Gate delivers better performance for their customers' products. Applied's clear leadership in the transistor module enables us to help our customers solve their high-value device performance challenges, and we are earning share gains at the leading foundries.
The mobility trend also represents a tremendous demand driver for NAND flash memory. With bit growth in the 40% to 50% range and supply and demand relatively well balanced today, we believe NAND manufacturers will increase their investment levels in the second half.
As sales figures for the first quarter clearly indicate, the PC market is navigating some challenging times and as a result, customers are reducing capital spending plans for logic.
Consumption of mobile DRAM has surpassed PC DRAM for the first time. Manufacturers have been migrating capacity to mobile. And with tightening supply, prices have been rising. To meet near-term demand, we are seeing some incremental investment, primarily focused on technology conversions. We believe DRAM trends bode well for increased investment levels in the medium term. While there have been some shifts in customers' investment plans towards mobility, we maintain our view that 2013 wafer fab equipment will be in the range of $27 billion to $30 billion. Reaching the high end of the range will require accelerated build-out of the 20-nanometer foundry node and a further uptick in memory investment.
Turning to Display. We see increasing demand from emerging markets, as well as 50-inch and larger models becoming a more significant portion of global TV sales. This is driving healthy area growth, which we anticipate to be in excess of 10% for the year.
The potential for undersupply in the second half is stimulating capacity investments. We are receiving orders for new display factories in China and expect this equipment to be installed in the fall. Demand for mobile devices and touchscreens remains robust, and investment continues with focus on advanced technologies, including OLED. With strengthening market conditions and our share gains, we are beginning to demonstrate the potential of our Display business.
In Solar, equipment industry conditions remain challenging. We are significantly reducing our exposure to the current weakness in the market by substantially scaling back our investment. We expect our quarterly operating expenses for EES to be below $25 million, exiting the fiscal year.
Overall, as we look to the second half of 2013, we see spending spread across a broader base of semiconductor customers. Memory investments look incrementally more positive, and demand is -- in Display is strengthening.
More importantly, at Applied, we are building momentum towards profitable growth. We are focused on strategy execution and winning those critical tool selections that support share gains, while in parallel, making changes to the organization that will allow us to deliver stronger operating margins and increase our investment in attractive growth opportunities.
Before I hand the call over to Gary, I would like to officially welcome Bob Halliday to his first earnings call as Applied Materials' CFO. Bob brings a strong track record of results and a wealth of industry experience to this role. He is already proving to be in an outstanding leader for our global finance team.

As Mike outlined, global adoption of mobile devices drives growth in the electronics industry and is also increasing the speed of innovation within the value chain.
Our semiconductor and display customers are striving to provide consumers with more capable mobile products, and this is accelerating changes in device technology that are enabled by the Applied Materials' core strength in precision materials engineering. All of this creates a great environment for us to execute our strategy and drive profitable growth.
Today, we are building momentum by strengthening our team and focusing our investments to deliver growth in revenue and operating profit. We are building momentum by increasing share and entering into earlier and deeper collaborations with our largest customers.
We are leveraging our strengths to help customers make major transistor and memory transitions that will happen in 2014 and 2015. And we are building profitable growth in additional segments that will provide significant improvement in our overall operating margins.
In order to accelerate the execution of our strategic plans, we are strengthening our organization and business processes. We are aggressively managing our costs to drive improvement in operating margins and taking further steps to reduce overhead expenses. We are actively managing our product portfolio by focusing on our best opportunities and increasing funding for those programs that really move the needle for our customers and for Applied.
In addition, we continue to upgrade our product development engine to improve our ability to define winning products and increase the velocity of our development process.
Our customers are faced with increasingly complex device performance and yield challenges, as they transition to new device technology and new materials. This is driving significant pull from our largest foundry, logic and memory customers for earlier and deeper collaborations on our next-generation products, as they focus on accelerating technology development and technology transfer into high-volume manufacturing.
These broader and deeper collaborations span our current areas of precision materials engineering, market leadership and additional market segments, where we have a significant potential to grow share, as future device technology is adopted.
Applied's position as the leader in enabling precision materials engineering technology is giving us insight into future device performance and yield problems that are critical for our customers. In our early engagements, we see an increase in atomic-level customization of our precision films combined with enabling technologies, including precision materials modification, materials removal and interface engineering on Applied Materials' platforms. This gives Applied a unique opportunity to solve some of our customers' challenges with new solutions that leverage our strong materials engineering technology portfolio. Some emerging materials engineering examples include: improving film stability in very high aspect ratio structures; film densification; material selectivity for deposition and etch; and atomic-level interface engineering to improve device performance and yield by preventing corrosion and native oxide growth.
To support broader and deeper customer relationships, we are strengthening our technical teams in the field by moving key people into higher impact positions and bringing new talents into the company.
In Semiconductor, key market inflections are growing our available market, while creating opportunities for Applied to demonstrate leadership and win share. As the foundries start their transition to 20-nanometer technology, we see Applied's served market opportunity growing approximately 25% relative to the 28-nanometer baseline.
Our strongest positions are at the foundries. And as they focus on new transistor technology, this plays to our strength and provides a great platform for us to grow share with our leadership products.
The architectural advantages offered by our Epi, thermal, metal deposition, CMP and implant products, combined with our ability to integrate these processes, are enabling customers to solve major device performance and yield challenges associated with the move from oxynitride transistor schemes to a High-k/Metal Gate-last devices.
In addition, we see increased urgency in the development of finFET technology, where the interplay between deposition, annealing and implant steps is even more important. When the finFET inflection occurs, we expect our served market to incrementally grow by 5% to 10% on top of the 25% increase during the 20-nanometer transition.
Beyond our increasing opportunity in foundry and logic, we expect our served market to grow by about 25% on a wafer start basis, as memory customers transition from planar NAND to first-generation 3D device technology. We anticipate shipping production equipment for 3D NAND in the fourth quarter of 2013 for the initial ramp of these new devices.
Another market that has potential for profitable growth is CMP. We are seeing an increase in the number of CMP steps for leading-edge device technology. We recently began shipments of new CMP technology that we anticipate will able -- enable us to increase share starting this year. And we've already secured new positions with large foundry customers.
We are also building profitable growth in additional segments. Inspection represents a great opportunity for profitable growth, and we are focusing on segments of the market where we are strong and have differentiated technology. We are demonstrating solid momentum in wafer inspection. And with recent wins at leading foundry and logic customers, we are very well positioned for share gains in 2013 and 2014.
In Etch, our strategy is to increase share and applications in foundry and memory where we have valuable and sustainable differentiation. In the past quarter, we received production orders from memory customers and won new development tool of record positions that gives us momentum to deliver a significant improvement in Etch's financial performance.
In Display, we have great momentum. We are increasing our market share and during the second quarter, we secured 100% of the CVD and PVD business for a new factory in China. As the market rebounds, we see the potential to book more than $800 million of orders this calendar year. The structural changes we have made to our Display organization during the downturn provide us with strong operating leverage, as volumes increase. As the industry moves to new transistor technologies and OLED for mobile applications and TV, it's becoming more processed and material technology-intensive. This plays to Applied's strengths in precision materials engineering for large area applications.
In TV, 4K resolution and increasing average screen sizes create a number of engineering and manufacturing challenges. Larger areas and smaller pixels make film uniformity and particle performance increasingly important. Our CVD and PVD systems have clear architectural advantages in device performance and yield that enable us to deliver increased value to our customers.
Applied has been the clear leader in CVD for many years. And now, we are demonstrating excellent traction with our PiVot PVD tools and expect to significantly grow our share in PVD in 2013 and beyond.
In summary, our semiconductor and display customers are in a race to deliver differentiated products to gain share and mobility. This is driving a big push by customers to accelerate time-to-market of new devices and new materials. These inflections create a great opportunity for Applied to leverage our leadership in precision materials engineering in earlier and deeper engagements with customers to solve their major device performance and yield challenges and drive profitable growth.
We are building momentum by strengthening the Applied team and focusing our investment to deliver growth in revenue and operating profit. We are very excited about the momentum we are building for profitable growth, and we'll discuss our plans and opportunities in more detail at the Analyst Meeting on July 8.
Let me now hand the call over to Bob for further details on our performance. Bob?",1249,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, May 16, 2013",2013-05-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3848.0,468328.0,21789659.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,4,"Thanks, Gary. I look forward to working with everyone on the call again in my role as the CFO of Applied Materials. I've been a part of the Applied team for over a year now, and I'm extremely impressed by the depth of technology and talent we have across the company.
I was immediately impressed with Applied's ability to design and build great products. As a product company, there are 3 legs on the profitable growth stool. The first leg is the ability to design and build great products. Applied definitely has that ability. What also struck me was the economic power of these products. Applied's integrated solutions combine superior hardware, chemistry and process support. The economic value to customers could be great, and the economic value of these strong products leveraged off of a common platform is also great for Applied Materials.
The second leg of our strategy for profitable growth is the ability to solve customers' high-value problems. I have been increasingly impressed over the last year in our improved internal capability to learn and solve these problems. The increasing ability to understand customers' high-value problems, combined with our ability to design incredible products, results in more products that hit the market requirements. As I said before, products that hit the market requirements result in very good businesses for Applied Materials.
The third leg of our profitable growth strategy is our ability to fund growth and increase investor returns. We've already taken a number of actions in recent quarters to redirect spending to fund new product development and strengthen our technical marketing capabilities. These actions include: steep reductions in solar spending; our gate integration synergies; the global workforce actions we announced in October; and the re-prioritization of our R&D projects. We are reinvesting net savings in product development to drive our growth.
Looking at our financials. R&D spending, as a percentage of R&D plus G&A, has increased from 53.3% in Q2 of last year to 57% in Q1 of 2013 and 58.5% in Q2 of 2013.
The next question is, can we fund growth and increase our profitability at all levels of sales? In my first couple of months as CFO, I've had the opportunity to examine each of our businesses in greater detail, and I see opportunities to lower our costs and improve our efficiency. I plan to review our detailed operating model and timeline with you at our Analyst Meeting in July.
At this time, I'll share some initial perspectives on 7 areas of our business. First, in EES, we have very aggressively reduced our losses. Our non-GAAP losses in Q2 decreased to $34 million, and are down 40% from the same period last year, despite half the revenue. We will continue to reduce our spending and losses.
Second, in Display, Q2 non-GAAP operating margins more than doubled from the prior year to 16.5% on slightly lower net sales. Our Display business has a very attractive business model and managed to stay profitable throughout the worst downturn in its history. We see significant leverage returning to this business in the up cycle.
Third, in SSG, Q2 non-GAAP operating margins were in line with the prior year, when normalized for revenue, despite an overall increase in SSG R&D spending. In SSG products where we have significant share, the operating margins are very good. With increasing customer pull and a higher hit rate on product development, we believe that some of our lower share products are on the verge of significant increases in operating leverage.
Fourth, in AGS, non-GAAP operating margins increased to 23.2%, up 3 percentage points relative to the same quarter last year. There is an opportunity to grow AGS revenue and profitability.
Fifth, the efficiency of resource allocation can be improved between our businesses through a comprehensive product portfolio process. We should have no sticky assets in the company, and we are embarking on that process.
Sixth, in operations, the vast majority of our product cost is materials. We plan to work aggressively across the company to design for lower cost and also save money on existing products. This will take some work, but it is another significant opportunity.
Seventh, and finally, all of the functional organizations, including operations, supply chain, finance, legal, human resources, IT and facilities, need to be efficient and scaled appropriately for all of our business levels.
Now I'll cover our second quarter results and comment on changes from the prior quarter. Orders grew 7%, led by strong demand for our semiconductor and display equipment. We generated net sales of approximately $2 billion, which was just above the high end of our guidance, led by strength at Silicon Systems. All segments, other than EES, were at the high end or exceeded our revenue expectations.
Non-GAAP gross margins was 43.2%, up 3.4 points, driven primarily by the increase in revenue and lower inventory charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $567 million, in line with our guidance, with G&A expenses down slightly relative to Q1.
We plan to reduce the G&A and manufacturing overhead components of our spending over time, both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of non-GAAP operating expenses. We will continue to update you on our progress.
In Q3, we expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million, plus or minus $10 million, which includes a shutdown in the first week of July.
Our effective tax rate was 24.9% on a non-GAAP basis. We still expect the full year rate to be between 24% and 26%.
Cash from operations was $224 million or 11% of revenue, reflecting severance payments related to our previously announced workforce reductions and higher working capital requirements associated with the increase in revenue levels.
We used $100 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares and returned $108 million in dividends. The first payout at our recently increased dividend level will occur in the third quarter.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities in our core businesses, increase the dividend, in line with the growth of the business, and utilize share repurchases to manage dilution and return excess cash to shareholders. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.85 billion, up slightly from Q1.
Next, I will comment on our Q2 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 14% to $1.55 billion, primarily driven by increases in NAND and DRAM. Foundry, again, represented the majority of our orders and remained highly concentrated. SSG net sales increased 33% to $1.3 billion at the high end of our outlook of up to 20% to 35%, driven by foundry and stronger DRAM spending. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 25.5%, driven by the higher revenue.
In AGS, orders were down 12% to $481 million due to the seasonal effect of service contract renewals and a slightly lower-than-anticipated improvement in customer utilization rates and wafer starts [ph] . AGS net sales were up 10% to $517 million at the high end of our outlook. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 23.2% due to higher revenue and our cost management initiatives.
Our Display orders increased 41% to $195 million, reflecting the investment in new TV fabs in China, along with share gains in multiple product lines. We expect orders to continue to increase in Q3. Display net sales increased 46% to $127 million, above our outlook of flat to up 25%. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 16.5%.
EES orders were $39 million, and net sales were $38 million. EES posted a non-GAAP operating loss of $34 million, and we rolled off the remaining goodwill for the Solar business in the quarter. We are lowering our spending in EES. And the non-GAAP OpEx run rate is below $30 million per quarter, exiting Q2. As Mike mentioned, we expect to reduce EES quarterly spending to below $25 million, exiting the fiscal year.
Now I will provide our third quarter business outlook. Overall, we expect the company's net sales to be up slightly from the second quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share should be in the range of $0.16 to $0.20.
Here's my conclusion. We have very good product development people and IP. If we can get a high hit rate on understanding customers' high-value problems and move fast internally, we can significantly increase profitability. Mike, Gary and I see a clear path to profitable growth, and we look forward to sharing more of it with you in July.

If you think about that relative to last year, we said this year that WFE will be flat to down, 10%.

I think we can get efficiency and cost savings on both the expense line and the cost of goods sold line. And I think the opportunity is kind of half and half, to be honest with you. I think R&D efficiency is also going to drive the faster product development and to a certain extent, will be self-funding but through efficiency. I think on the gross margin line above that, people sometimes ask me about the question, can you increase your peak operating profit versus say '10 -- 2011, where you did the $1.30? So if you look at gross margin then and you look at gross margin today, we have few things going in our favor. One, we have good mix between the segments where future growth will be more in semi versus solar, for instance, in 2011. Secondly, we will, I think, we'll drive this cost reduction, which I spoke of just a minute ago. And thirdly, as we start to get some traction in some of these high-value businesses, I think those have favorable pricing components. So I'd say the gross margins look okay. It's a combination of mix between segments, some potential mix between price [ph], cost of goods sold reductions and pricing, commercial and negotiate, all that stuff.",231,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

I don't think we really formulated a detailed view on '14, but maybe just a couple of thoughts. Assuming that, let's say, we can have another 30%-plus year growth in smartphones and a 50% growth here in tablets. I think the foundry spending is flat to up, maybe up a little bit more than that because of complexity. Increases in the 20 and 16-nanometer and the push to advanced transistors. And then I think we're going to see an investment cycle in NAND flash, not quite -- we don't precisely have that pegged yet on exactly how the cycle will go.

Thanks, Satya. So first of all, I think one of the big trends is in and around the foundry. The spending has been quite concentrated, as Bob alluded to. And we think, in the second half, foundry spending will be roughly flat, but spread out among a wider array of our customers. We think that's an important factor as you just start to think about, so what's going to happen here in the second half of the year. We think logic spending comes up from reasonably low levels in the first half of the year. And then we'll see growth in both DRAM and NAND spending, but we don't think they exceed the 25% of the overall wafer fab equipment spend, that's putting them together. And I think some customers have fungible spending there. So we see positive trends in NAND and mobile DRAM.

But can you please explain to me in a simple way, other than ASP, what is it that you're doing to enable you to gain market share in an oligopolistic environment? You only have one competitor in each segment. So what is it other than ASP that enables you to go and actually gain market share without giving up much margin?",85,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

If you look at Display, for instance, this concept applies to all of our different businesses. We're focused on the key device performance and yield challenges of our customers. So as they go to larger panel sizes and smaller pixels, the particle requirements are increasing from 10 to 100x to get equivalent yield. So our focus there is on how do we have an architectural advantage that delivers better particles than our competitors. The same thing is true as you go to larger panel sizes. Customers, if they -- if we have a certain uniformity on our product, they can sell the panels into their own brand. If they have a worse uniformity, they go to OEM brand at a much lower margin. So the leverage in yield and the leverage in device performance for our customer is significant, and that is the strategy that we're pursuing that is growing share in the Display business today. The same thing is true in the semiconductor business. As our customers move to new transistor technologies, as they move to new 3D memory technologies, these transitions, as you go to finFET or other devices, are extremely difficult. They have big challenges in trying to drive time-to-market toward these products. And it is the key battleground for our customers in mobility. Our products that enable those transitions in the architectures, that's where we're focused, that's why we're increasing our R&D spending, that's why we're increasing the technical support of our customers in the field. And that's the formula, at least for me, and 30 years in this industry, that's the same formula I've seen work in every one of these different businesses.",295,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Customers have talked about accelerating that from 20 -- from 28 through 20, and possibly even skipping some of the 20 and going straight to 14-nanometer finFET. I guess how do you rationalize, I guess, what the customers are looking for there? And from what process segments do you see the, I guess, an expansion at the 14-nanometer node? Is this the same one as 20? Or do you see areas like CVD also growing faster than the marketplace?",98,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And then customers will move to finFET technologies, that's 16 and to 14-nanometer finFET nanometers, where there's still more incremental opportunities for us. The big -- the really big areas of focus for us are around the transistor, as I talked about earlier with Epi, Anneal, implant, PVD. And there are more CMP steps as the customers move to finFET technology. So those are the ones that with these transistor technology changes, that are the real big opportunities for us. I would say also, I talked a little bit about combining the precision films with precision materials removal, material modification and interface engineering. And we're certainly seeing more of those types of issues, where combining these precision materials engineering technology could provide our customers with a real device performance and yield advantage and also be very positive for Applied Materials as we combine these technologies on our platforms.",171,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We're pleased to report solid financial results for our third fiscal quarter. We delivered earnings at the mid-point of our range, with global appetite for mobile devices and larger TVs driving healthy demand for our semiconductor and display equipment. 
As we outlined at our recent analyst event, across the company, we are building momentum for profitable growth. Industry trends in semiconductor and display favor Applied Materials' leadership areas and at the same time, we are seeing results from changes to the organization and our spending profile designed to strengthen customer collaborations and speed up product development. 
We are increasing investment in 300-millimeter R&D and field technical resources to support our strategic priority of growing share in wafer fab equipment by winning at market inflections. 
While we are stepping up our R&D spending to ensure we have the strong product pipeline we need to drive growth, we are equally focused on reducing operating expenses and organizational complexity to improve profitability. We will provide an update on our progress later on today's call. 
As the mobility build-out gathers pace, device makers are engaged in a battle for leadership. Consumers are making buying decisions based on battery life, features, form factor and visual experience, which means that our customers' ability to deliver winning products requires new device technology at the right yield and cost. 
Performance improvements in mobile chips and displays are becoming increasingly dependent on materials innovation. Applied is uniquely positioned to enable next generation transistors and interconnects, 3D memory and high-resolution, low-power displays. 
In addition to robust demand for mobile devices, we are seeing strength in the TV market and as a result, our display business booked its highest orders in over 2 years. TV unit sales are growing and average TV sizes are increasing significantly faster than historical trends. We anticipate an average increase of 2 inches in 2013 versus a typical annual increase of about 0.5 inch. 
To put this in perspective, for every inch of growth, one new Gen 8.5 factory is needed to fulfill the incremental area demand. 
Now let me turn to our outlook. For the third year in a row, seasonal buying patterns are evident, as consumers wait for new smartphone and tablet models to be released in the fall. As a result, we are seeing a near-term slowdown in investment by our foundry customers as they focus on ramping new capacity installed over the past 2 quarters. This will deliver product for the holiday season and readying their next generation of technology. We expect investment levels to recover in the fourth calendar quarter.
Unit growth for -- of mobile devices is also driving healthy demand for NAND flash memory, and bit growth for 2013 is expected to be in the 40% to 50% range. The transition of 3D NAND technology into production is underway, and we expect investment to accelerate in 2014 and 2015, as more manufacturers adopt this technology. 
In the DRAM market, conditions are improving, with average selling prices recovering to levels last seen in 2010. As a result of increasing bit demand for mobile applications, combined with structural changes in the market in several years of under-investment, customers are taking actions to increase bit supply. Today, these investments are primarily focused on technology conversions from the 3X to 2X node. We expect some new capacity will be added if these favorable market conditions continue into 2014.
While mobility-related demand remains strong, PC sales are still challenged. And consequently, we are seeing some minor reductions in logic investment for the year. 
Looking at industry investment as a whole, while there has been spending mix shifts towards memory in the second half of the year, we are maintaining our 2013 wafer fab equipment forecast of $27 billion to $30 billion. We believe that wafer fab equipment investment will be higher in 2014, up 10% to 20% relative to this year. This will be driven primarily by the foundries building out their 20-nanometer node, investment in 3D NAND capacity and some increase in DRAM spending. This is a spending mix that is favorable for Applied Materials.
In summary, the market environment in both semiconductor and display, provides a firm foundation for profitable growth. At the same time, major industry trends are playing to Applied Materials' strength in precision materials engineering, presenting us with an unprecedented number of opportunities. 
Most importantly, I'm confident that we have the right strategy, the right talent and the right new CEO to take Applied to new levels of performance. 
Let me now hand the call over to Gary, who will provide more details about our strategy and the progress we are making against our goals. Gary?",786,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2013",2013-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4184.0,505526.0,23339577.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,5,"Thanks, Mike. Today, I will focus on 3 areas where we are building momentum for profitable growth. First, we are shaping a more competitive company that can execute better, faster and at lower costs. Second, the major industry trends translate into positive momentum for our leadership business segments that are enabling the key technology inflections in the mobility war. 
And finally, we have positive momentum in growth businesses that can drive significant incremental contribution to our financial performance. 
As Mike discussed, mobility is the major driver in electronics, and all our customers want to be the first to introduce new technology that will help them win. Applied's capabilities in precision materials engineering are strategically important for our customers. And this has resulted them pulling us into much earlier and deeper engagements. 
Today, our customer relationships have never been better. And this, combined with our strong pipeline of new products, is providing us with significant opportunities to grow market share as new transistor, interconnect, memory and display technologies are adopted.
To realize these great opportunities, we are making changes to execute better, faster and at lower cost. We have added very strong talent in management, product development and the field. We've been implementing changes in our structure and business processes to improve the speed and quality of our execution. We've been increasing R&D for products that can drive future profitable growth. R&D spending, as a percentage of combined R&D plus SG&A, has increased from 55% a year ago to 62% today. 
In line with our strategic priorities, we have increased focus on our semiconductor business. By shifting overhead dollars, managing our product portfolio and improving productivity, we increased our annualized funding for 300-millimeter R&D and field support by almost $170 million since the start of the fiscal year. All these actions are enabling us to create a pipeline of new, highly differentiated products that have significant pull from the industry technology leaders and will drive future profitable growth in our leadership areas and in other markets, where we have a lot of room to grow our share and profit. 
Our customers' war for mobility leadership is intensifying, and materials innovation is their most significant lever to drive performance gains in transistor, interconnect, memory and display.
In foundry, the major battle is to introduce new transistor technology to enable enhanced performance and longer battery life for mobile devices. This really plays to the sweet spot of our leadership in Epi, implants, thermal, CVD, PVD and CMP. 
Selective epitaxy, combined with our implants and anneal technologies, improves transistor speed by more than 30% while our integrated PVD metal gate delivers a 100X improvement in device leakage and lower power consumption. 
As a result, we expect to gain 5 to 10 points of PVD market share this year. In CMP, we expect to grow share about 3 points in 2013 and see future market growth, as foundries and 3D NAND customers integrate additional steps. 
Looking ahead, 2 inflections that will have a positive impact on our business in 2014 are foundries transitioning to the 20-nanometer node and first-generation 3D NAND. These new devices are very positive for Applied because the performance gains are enabled by our leadership and precision materials engineering, they grow our available market, and we are in a strong position to gain share when these new devices ramp into volume manufacturing. 
As foundries move to 20-nanometer technology, Applied's served market opportunity grows approximately 25% relative to the 28-nanometer baseline.
When finFET transistors are introduced at the 1X node, we expect our served market to incrementally grow by an additional 5% to 10%. In memory, the 3D NAND inflection also leverages our leadership in precision materials engineering. With the transition from planar to 3D NAND, the performance gains are driven by Deposition and Etch. And as a result, we expect our available market to grow by about 25% for first-generation 3D NAND devices. 
Another positive trend in 3D NAND is the adoption of Epi and thermal products, 2 areas where we have clear and sustainable differentiation. Overall, we have a strong position in 3D NAND and anticipate our served market and share will grow as these factories ramp into volume production. 
We are also building momentum in additional segments, including Etch, inspection and display. We are focusing on areas where we have strong pull from customers, can help enable inflections and have sustainable differentiation. The talent and investment we've added in these areas are resulting in positive market share momentum. 
In Etch, our strategy has been to target areas of the market where we believe we have valuable and sustainable differentiation. And this has started to yield results. In the quarter, we secured important process tool of record positions in memory that provide a platform to drive significant gains in market share this year. 
In Inspection, we've been investing in R&D and field technical support, enabling us to increase our layer qualification at logic and foundry customers, both at 28- and 20-nanometer technologies. We expect to translate these qualifications into share gains for our brightfield products this year. 
Another area where we see positive momentum is display. Displays have a huge influence on the desirability of mobile devices, affecting user experience, power consumption and form factor. Advanced low-temperature polysilicon and metal oxide transistors are being used to deliver high-resolution LCD and organic LED displays that consume less power and have new form factors. These high-resolution mobile displays increase the opportunity for our CVD and PVD equipment in this market by more than 30%. 
In TV, the introduction of 4K ultra-high definition and OLED is driving more complex and capital-intensive manufacturing processes. Our differentiated large-area, precision deposition equipment provides device performance and yield advantages. We won 100% of the CVD and PVD business for the last 2 new TV factories, and we anticipate our overall share in display PVD will increase by about 25% this year. We see a pathway to grow display revenues to $1 billion or more with high operating leverage. 
In summary, 2013 is shaping up to be a year where we are building momentum for profitable growth for 2014 and beyond. We are making great progress building a more competitive company that executes better, faster and at lower cost. We are bringing new talents and investment to key areas, while implementing structural and process changes that improve the speed and quality of our execution. 
We have positive momentum from the major trends in semiconductor and display markets that plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses, and we have positive momentum in Etch, inspection and display that we anticipate will drive incremental contributions to profitable growth.
We are very excited about our technology pipeline and laser-focused on execution to make sure we take advantage of the great opportunities we have to drive profitable growth. Now let me hand the call over to Bob.",1144,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Before I cover our results for the quarter, I want to reinforce 2 very important points that Mike and Gary made. 
One, our leadership in precision materials engineering creates a unique opportunity for us with our customers, and two, we are driving the necessary changes in the organization to capture this opportunity while improving the overall profitability of the company. 
To fund these changes and improve our profitability, we are significantly reducing the cost to doing business. We are rapidly eliminating organizational complexity and reducing the investment in areas with lower returns and reallocating these dollars into our product pipeline for the highest value opportunities. We are already seeing the shift in our financials. 
On a GAAP basis, G&A, as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A, has decreased from 24.3% a year ago to 21.4% in Q2 to 17.9% in Q3. At the same time, R&D, as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A, has increased from 54.8% a year ago to 58.5% in Q2 to 61.6% in Q3. The net result is a 4% year-over-year decline in the spending, while increasing R&D by 8%. 
We will see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but the trend is reflective of the systematic reallocation of our spending that is taking place. This reallocation is driving incremental momentum with customers. One simple leading indicator of this momentum is the number of our semiconductor evaluation tools is expected to increase more than 20% in the next 2 quarters. 
In addition, a leading indicator of future spending is headcount. And our total headcount is down 6% or approximately 900 employees from a year ago, with most of that reduction coming out of EES in the corporate function. 
The Applied functional organizations are doing a great job of driving these rapid changes. The teams are doing extensive benchmarking, quickly adopting best known methods and working to improve the velocity of the company. I have been really pleased and grateful for everyone's efforts. 
The dollars getting reallocated in the additional R&D investment are going into semiconductor and display. These are businesses that have high share or they are growing share with strong product pipelines. 
In SSG, we are extremely well-leveraged to the transistor technology inflections occurring over the next few years. It is possible that the great majority of our business units will gain or hold share to share. The plan is pretty straightforward: get more efficient in the cost of doing business and invest in markets and products that we know very well. 
The early results are very encouraging. Overhead cost and solar spending are down substantially. Investment in core SSG and display products is up. We are gaining share in most of those markets, and other leading indicators, like evaluation tools in our product pipeline are up. These cost savings and harvested R&D investments will drive sustainable growth and profitability for Applied Materials. 
The money we are reinvesting is going to our highest value opportunities, markets we know and businesses with very good incremental margins and high and/or growing share. Now I'll cover our third quarter results and comment on changes from the prior quarter.
Orders were approximately $2 billion, down 12% sequentially on lower semiconductor equipment demand, partially offset by strength in display and AGS. We generated net sales of approximately $2 billion, which about -- which was about as we expected. 
Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.18, which was at the mid-point of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.9%, down slightly, due to a less favorable product mix within SSG, partially offset by less inventory charges and lower variable compensation. 
Over the next 2 quarters, we expect gross margins to decline slightly, as products, which traditionally have had lower share and, therefore, less scale, become a larger percentage of SSG revenue. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $535 million, below the low end of our guidance, primarily due to reduced corporate spending. Our effective tax rate was 23.9% on a non-GAAP basis. We now expect the non-GAAP full year rate to be between 24% and 25%. 
Cash from operations was $364 million, or 18% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We returned $170 million to our stockholders in Q3. We used $50 million to repurchase 3.3 million shares and paid out $120 million in dividends, reflecting the 11% quarterly dividend increase we announced in March. 
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of just over $3 billion. Next, I will comment on our Q3 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. 
SSG orders were down 22% to $1.2 billion, due to lower, but comparatively strong, foundry spending. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in NAND, DRAM and logic orders. SSG net sales declined 1% to $1.3 billion, with increases in NAND and logic offsetting most of the seasonal decline in foundry. 
SSG's non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 22.2%, reflecting a less favorable product mix relative to Q2 and slightly higher operating expenses. 
In AGS, orders were up 7% to $517 million, due to improvements in customer utilization rates and wafer starts. AGS net sales were down 4% to $497 million, due to a slightly less favorable wafer start by device type than expected. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was essentially flat at 23.3%, despite slightly lower revenue. Our display orders increased 31% to $256 million, with record orders in array PVD. The increase was driven by TV fab investments in China and reflects our share gains with those customers. 
Display net sales increased 27% to $160 million -- $161 million, consistent with the order ramp we experienced over the past few quarters. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased 4.6 percentage points to 21.1%, which is our highest operating margin at this level of revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2008. 
EES orders were $19 million and net sales were $45 million, up $7 million from Q2. The non-GAAP operating loss declined to $15 million, due to lower inventory charges and our cost reduction efforts. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below $30 million in Q3, and we remain on track to lower OpEx to below $25 million exiting the fiscal year. Now I will provide our fourth quarter business outlook.
Overall, we expect the company's net sales to be flat relative to third quarter with a little more risk than opportunity. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $525 million, plus or minus $10 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.20. 
Within this outlook, we expect net sales from our semiconductor business to be flat to down slightly; AGS net sales are expected to be flat to up slightly; Display net sales should be down slightly; with EES net sales up slightly.

It seems like what we were hearing at SEMICON West doesn't quite match what's happening in the very near term.

I think the foundry spending profile was quite predictable and pretty much in third calendar quarter as following what's happened very similarly over the last 3 quarters. I think there's a fair difference as we look into our Q1 or into the fourth calendar quarter. We think foundry spending will pick up as they start driving towards their 20-nanometer nodes and -- or it might be teen nodes for some suppliers. And we'll have a little broader investment by a broader number of customers. I think if there's any modest surprise, it's around a little higher memory investment in the second half of the year, Jim.

So theoretically, memory spending is picking up over the next several quarters.

If it was just the mobility market, we can see the compounded annual growth rate of bits per box that's been pretty aggressive. And -- but it's tempered by what's been happening in PCs. So if I knew what was happening in PCs, I'd be more confident that we'd say that you could think of a 4 -- especially in DRAM, a 4-quarter run, but I'd be quite hesitant to say that today.

And then maybe a question for Bob. Bob, if I look at SSG gross margins, they're down about 300 basis points on flat revenue. Also, it sounds like SSG margins are going to hold back overall margins a bit, even as revenue grows here into January. If you look back maybe 5, 6, 7 years ago, you guys are having definitely a lot more success now gaining share in these 2 big markets that you're focused on in SSG. But back years and years ago, there were some effort to sort of see the market by, I don't want to say giving away tools, but pricing tools very low.

In terms of -- I think the single biggest thing that's having impact to the next couple quarters is mix. We're actually gaining share in some, in 1 or 2 segments, one in particular is -- we haven't gain share a long time. I think we will gain share, but without the scale, the margins are lower. I think in our strong businesses, the margins are holding up pretty well. So I think it's mostly a mix issue. You've got a little bit of issues, too, out there with mixed of customer type. And I can't point to any explicit impact of the weak end but it's probably in the background in terms of how aggressively customers negotiate. So overall, I'd say we're probably going to be still in the ballpark, but a bunch of mix issues right now we're sorting through.",150,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

In Inspection, that's actually one of our highest margin businesses. We -- as I talked about early, we definitely have momentum there, very strong pull from customers in all markets for current and future technology. Again, one of the major cases I'd ever seen in my career of customer pull for products. We've got a lot of momentum in foundry and logic. We're increasing layer penetration at 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and also, at finFET with the technology leader on that particular device. We have really strong pull from customers on the unique imaging and defect-capture capabilities, especially for patterning applications. We're ramping investment R&D in the field. And as I said, a lot of momentum there. The other thing I would say about the Inspection business is we have the best EVM technology in the world. Very strong in terms of EVM review. And we can leverage this technology for growth in new markets. But overall, Inspection is one of our highest margins, one of our most profitable businesses. In Etch, the good news is we are making tremendous progress in share this year. We're penetrating new applications and foundry, planer NAND, and we are extremely well-positioned in the first customer that's ramping 3D NAND. So we're making very significant penetration, strong growth in the business. The margins there aren't as good. They're not really different from where they were. So there's no change in terms of the pricing behavior there. It's just as we're ramping, especially with new customers, where we haven't been for a long time, those initial margins are not great. The other thing I would say in Etch is that we are working with technology-leading companies, all of the technology-leading companies, on very differentiated products that have potential for significant share growth for us in the future. So certainly, we're penetrating today, as I said, in foundries, in planer in 3D NAND. But we also have very, very strong technology around some of the key future inflections in the Etch business.",344,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

We also, in other areas like CVD, we're bringing to market new technology targeted at inflections, and we also have very, very strong pull from technology leading customers for these products. And so we believe in CVD, we'll build momentum for share gains in 2014 and 2015 with some of these new products and new applications. So that's another area.

I'm wondering if you can help me understand how you guys think about spurring to the silicon growth and/or the profitability of your customers over time relative to that number. And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is we've seen this pretty significant mixed shift down in the consumer market, from the high-end to the mid-range to the low-end, which probably doesn't reverse itself. I'm kind of curious as how that dynamic impacts your longer-term forecast on capital spending?",142,2.0,8.0,0.6111111111111112,0.8

That was a long question, but -- and a little further out question. I think how we try to describe it at Analyst Day was we're really looking at process complexity increasing over these next few nodes to create the -- we talked about a number of increased steps in 3D NAND and those that would favor us. We also talked about the increased steps for vertical transistors, finFETs, everybody is racing in that direction, and how much more difficult it is to be -- going to be to create these 10-nanometer or 7-nanometer patterns that our customers are going to be driving towards at that time. That's by far the biggest effect. And then the second part of it is really, a continued build-out of the smartphone and mobility, mobile tablets, over that period of time. We expect that growth rate is going to continue that way until essentially all phones are smartphones. And I think we explained that, that, in the event that there's just a significant amount more silicon that's being employed in one of those smartphones and that -- those are by far the biggest effects that kind of get us up to a $37 billion wafer fab equipment spending range from where we are today. Also, I think you know there's been pretty significant under-investment in DRAM over the last few years. We certainly don't think DRAM is going away as a category and as the mobile build-out happens, it's going to return a little bit larger bit growth than we've seen in the last few years.",264,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

That's actually one of our highest gross margin businesses in the whole company; very good gross margins, very profitable, and if I look out over the next few quarters, that business is extremely profitable. In terms of the Etch business, we have confidence in share based on what's happening with customers. We have strong pull in foundries for new applications and extremely strong pull in NAND technologies, both for planar and especially, as I said earlier, for 3D NAND. So that is very strong. We know what the pricing is there. Again, it is -- that one is at the lower end in terms of our gross margins today. But there's a lot of leverage as we grow that business.

Okay, great. And then a question for you, Bob. If I look at your OpEx guidance for the coming quarter, contrast that against what your longer-term targets, right. It seems like your OpEx guidance is already in the long-term OpEx target of $2.1 billion, right? I guess, to my question, one is, is there any kind of onetime saving you're realizing this quarter or are we done with OpEx? And I guess the other point [ph] I want to figure out is how much more do you think you can spend in R&D as a percentage of total OpEx?",101,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

There's 2 -- there's 3 buckets, I guess, of OpEx. There's the cost of doing business that pushes all the support functions, and there's the R&D investments, which is what you choose to invest in. And we have a lot of good investment opportunities right now that Gary talked about. The third, which is the field; a lot of that is, are pushing some of our growth with the technical marketing guys and fields. So I think that the R&D and the technical marketing guys is investments. And the rest is the cost of doing business. The cost of doing business, I can sort of see the next 3 years sustainably keep improving our performance, and I could sort of see the roadmap to be honest with you. I think on the R&D investments, those are choices we select. And I think, if you think of that, those type of investments, it's like a pipe. What you're seeing in the short term right now is we're really optimizing the investments that we're halfway down that pipeline of products. What we've done now is we've increased the diameter of the pipeline funding, but we've also increased the velocity going through the pipe. So in terms of spending, I think the cost of doing business will keep improving that over the next 2 years. I think the velocity of stuff on a pipeline in terms of R&D, I'm pretty, pretty excited about. Once those things started to hit, and right now, we're optimizing things, we're halfway down the pipe, whether it’s Inspection or Etch. But we have some very aggressive plans right now for stuff coming out the pipe. So when those come out of the pipe, which will be over the next year or 2, what you'll see is the revenue line will start to grow, the OpEx spending, as a percentage of that grows. So right now, we're spending on R&D a little bit higher than our revenue line. We're funding with the G&A stuff. But as we get that pipe really flowing, the R&D will probably stay more constant. The G&A will get optimize and revenue will grow and the margin will go up.",374,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think the key thing for us -- the really key thing that moves the needle for us is our layer qualification. That's one of the things that we watch very, very closely. And what we talked about was a significant increase in the layers when you look at the 28, 20. And also, we're working very closely with leaders in finFET technology.

So if you look at that business, we sell a lot of spare parts around tools. So I think we could probably hold better share in that business. And that's a function of sourcing, correct optimizing programs with customers and internal alignment on all that. You do that when you first design the tools and then also, as the tools are released. I look at that as a really good opportunity because the drop from profit in that business is pretty good. It's also really good cash flow business, frankly, because the operating expenses once you set up the infrastructure are pretty low incremental cost. I like that business a lot. I think we'll implement some of these things, which we're working on right now. We're getting good coordination internally, we just keep -- we have to keep chopping away at it, hacking away at it, or building on it, maybe that's the right word.

Because remember when you put an eval tool into a fab, the customer makes just as big economic commitment as we do. So it is a really positive indicator that they're going to buy your tools in some volumes. So we kind of like high leverage eval tools.

At the end of September, we announced that Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron are combining to create a new global innovator for the semiconductor and display industries. This merger will enable us to accelerate the strategic visions of our 2 companies and to accelerate our momentum for profitable growth. We will bring together complementary leading technologies and products to create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning to solve our customers' high-value problems better, faster and at lower cost. 
Since the announcement, we have started integration planning, and we are pleased with the constructive engagement. We've also been meeting with our customers to discuss the specific ways the merger will create value for them, and their responses have been positive and supportive.
We expect to file our S-4 Securities registration statement in January, which will provide you with additional information, and we remain confident that we will receive approval for the merger in the mid to second half of 2014.
The rest of today's call will focus on Applied Materials' quarterly and year-end results, as well as our outlook. In the fourth quarter, Applied delivered earnings toward the high end of our range, and we enter our new fiscal year with momentum in bookings and new product penetrations. 
I would like to thank all our employees for their contributions over the past year. This is a team with tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors. I would also like to thank Mike Splinter, whose leadership, guidance and support enabled a seamless CEO transition. Mike and I will continue to work closely as we plan and implement the integration with Tokyo Electron.
2013 was a transformative year for Applied Materials, a year of building momentum for profitable growth. First, we focused our growth strategy and investment on leveraging our precision materials engineering leadership to enable major technology transitions for our customers. As part of this focused strategy, we increased annual run rate investment in 300-millimeter product development by more than $200 million. 
Second, we took steps to shape a more competitive company. We reduced overhead spending by $130 million through efficiency improvement and corporate functions and made significant additional reductions in solar operating expenses. We strengthened the organization in many critical areas, attracting top technical talent in etch, inspection and other groups, while adding new leadership in solar and display, finance, operations, marketing and strategy. We introduced a new operating rhythm and strengthened our business processes to improve execution and enable Applied to effectively scale as we drive profitable growth. 
Third, we built positive momentum in our growth businesses, including etch, inspection and display. 
Fourth and most significantly, major industry trends are fueling positive momentum for our leadership businesses. Our precision materials engineering technology is enabling key inflections in the mobility war by providing our customers with solutions that improve device performance and yield.
With smartphone sales expected to exceed 1 billion units this year, the mobility trend remains the main growth driver for the electronics industry. Smartphones and tablets now generate more semiconductor and display revenue than all other categories of consumer electronics combined. We estimate that our customers will need to add manufacturing capacity for more than 500 million incremental smartphone and tablet units in the next 2 years. 
Demand for advanced mobile chips is fueling strong foundry investment in leading-edge processes, as they build out 20-nanometer and race to be first with finFET technology. 
Mobility is also a driver for NAND flash. And when combined with the stronger adoption of solid-state drives, bit growth remains in the 40% to 50% range. We expect investment to grow by more than 30% in 2014, with incremental spending at advanced planar NAND and strong spending for 3D NAND. 
DRAM content in smartphones is approximately doubling with each generation, boosting consumption of mobile DRAM. Prices have risen more than 120% over the past year. And due to supply constraints that we expect to extend until mid-2014, there's a good foundation for new capacity investments. 
Based on these factors, we are maintaining our view that wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2013 will be in the range of $27 billion to $30 billion. As we are at the beginning of major technology transitions, driven by finFET and 3D NAND, we believe wafer fab equipment investment will be higher in 2014, up 10% to 20%. We expect to see a year-over-year increase in foundry, NAND and DRAM investment, with logic and other spending flat to down.
In display, TV unit growth is being impacted by the elimination of subsidies in China. However, this is being offset by global demand for larger TVs. Shipments of 50-inch and bigger screens are up nearly 70% year-on-year, and this is driving area growth of around 10%, which is enough to sustain healthy investment levels. 
In mobile, new display technology is being adopted. The use of low-temperature polysilicon backplanes enables higher resolution and lower power consumption and is migrating from smartphones to tablets. In addition, smartphones with curved OLED flexible displays are starting to appear. These trends are very positive for Applied, as LTPS, OLED and flexible display technologies increase the total available market for our large area precision materials engineering equipment by more than 30%.
As we outlined at our July analyst meeting, customers are locked in a battle for mobility leadership, and this is driving major technology inflections in transistor, interconnect, memory, patterning and display. Materials innovation and cost-effective scaling are driving performance gains for our customers and are increasingly enabled by Applied's strengths in precision materials engineering.
In foundry, transistor performance remains a critical focus, and we have very strong pull for collaboration in this area. As customers build out high-k/metal gate capacity, we are increasing our share of their spending through a combination of expanded market opportunity and new positional wins. As a result, we anticipate that we will grow our PVD share more than 5 points in 2013, as well as making significant gains in CMP.
The next battleground for foundries is finFET, and customers are pushing hard to begin pilot production in 2014. Our strong position in the critical transistor technologies, including Epi, implant, anneals and CMP, provides us with a platform for further share gains at this inflection. 
In memory, technology trends also played to our strengths. And with the transition from planar to 3D NAND, we see our opportunity per wafer start increasing by more than 30%. In addition to market expansion, we are also winning share in 3D NAND, as leading customers select our differentiated solutions for high aspect ratio etch and critical deposition process steps. 
In recent weeks, we secured a major win in staircase deposition applications at one of our largest memory customers. In the past year, we have started to demonstrate excellent progress beyond our traditional leadership areas. 
Our Process Diagnostics and Control group grew 20% relative to 2012, and our UVision brightfield inspection product line delivered record net sales for the year. Overall, we believe we will gain over 4 points of inspection share in 2013, and we are in a strong position with the leading companies as they ramp next-generation finFET devices.
In etch, our focused strategy is yielding results, and we are gaining share based on the new conductor etch positions we have secured. 
In display, equipment demand rebounded in 2013, and more importantly, we were able to significantly outgrow the market. We expect to gain more than 20 points of PVD share this year, while holding position in CVD, where we are already very strong.
In summary, fiscal 2013 was a year when we built momentum for profitable growth and made Applied Materials more competitive. Today, we have positive momentum in our markets as major trends play to our strengths, and we have a very strong pipeline of differentiated products to grow our wafer fab equipment share and enter new markets. We have positive momentum with customers and strong pull for earlier, broader and deeper collaborations to enable their future devices with our materials engineering solutions. We also have positive momentum with employees. Our engagement scores are at an all-time high, and we are adding very strong talent in critical areas to improve execution and enable us to successfully integrate with Tokyo Electron. 
As we look to 2014, we are very excited. We have great opportunities to accelerate our momentum for profitable growth, and we remain highly focused on execution to ensure we take full advantage of these opportunities.
Now, Bob will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.",1428,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2013",2013-11-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3585.0,551763.0,25225420.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. In the fourth quarter, our orders grew sequentially, and revenue was in line with our expectation. We maintained our spending discipline in the quarter, which helped us to achieve EPS in the upper end of the guidance range. We enter fiscal 2014 with momentum, especially in both orders and revenue for SSG. 
Since this is our Q4 report, I'll make some observations about fiscal 2013. We have been transforming the financial profile of the company by, one, aggressively reallocating our spending priorities; two, increasing the funding and velocity of new and disruptive products; and, three, strengthening our gross margin performance even as we introduce new products. 
Beginning with spending. We have reallocated dollars from solar to semi and from overhead to products. For example, we reduced solar spending by about $120 million in 2013, and we shifted that spending, plus another $40 million in overhead savings, to R&D programs within SSG.
For the year, we grew R&D, as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A, by 6 points, for about 54% in 2012 to nearly 60% in 2013. To help fund the increase, we reduced our overall G&A spending by $130 million or 22% over the same period. These are major changes to our organization. 
Now let me give you some insight into how we're deploying these additional dollars to strengthen our technology and product pipeline, especially in disruptive products, which are a key driver of future profitable growth. 
In 2013, we moved over 2/3 of the incremental R&D investment into disruptive products. These are new products, such as selective material removal, that give our customers new ways of solving high-value problems. Disruptive products expand our addressable market and give us the chance to change the market share landscape. A good indicator of our progress is evaluation tools shipments, which are projected to increase significantly in Q1 of 2014. 
For our customers, clean room space and engineering expertise are precious resources, and their strong pull from more of our evaluation tools speaks to the value of our latest products. 
Another example of our progress is our manufacturing pilot line in Santa Clara. With this new capability, along with other changes, we will reduce our deployment cycle time by approximately 4 months and significantly improve our initial product quality. 
Another key indicator of progress is that we are beginning to see these disruptive products in our backlog in both SSG and display. We expect this investment and faster development of new and disruptive products to increase our market share and operating leverage. In 2013, we gained market share with many of our existing products by improving our customer responsiveness and application footprint. We are gaining more traction with our customers, particularly with those that are pushing the leading-edge in logic, foundry and 3D NAND. Our orders for the leading foundry customer were the highest in Applied's history this year, and we expect our strong SSG order momentum to continue into 2014 in foundry and overall. 
Now I'd like to give you some background on our gross margin performance. In 2013, while our overall revenue was down 14%, we increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 120 basis points. The mix between our segments was beneficial in 2013, as solar declined and semi, display and AGS all increased as a percentage of our revenue. We see this segment mix benefit continuing in 2014, which should be a strong year for us in semi. 
Now, let me give you some color on our non-GAAP gross margins within each of our segments for 2013. In SSG, we maintained our gross margins during a year in which we penetrated new markets. In display, we gained share and improved our gross margins. In AGS, gross margins were flat, excluding the impact of a PV solar line sale in 2012. In EES, gross margin improved despite a weak year for solar demand. 
Although it is still early to make precise forecasts, we currently project our non-GAAP gross margin to be up sequentially in Q1 of 2014, down slightly in Q2 and up again in Q3 and Q4. 
Overall, we expect our product and customer mix to become more favorable as we proceed through the year. We also have initiatives underway to lower our material costs, and higher volume for the year will help the absorption of our fixed costs. Our goal for 2014 is to once again deliver over a point of non-GAAP gross margin improvement for the year, even as we ramp new products. 
Next, I'll summarize our fourth quarter results and comment on changes in the prior quarter. Orders were approximately $2 billion, up 5% sequentially on higher orders in SSG, AGS and EES, offset by a decline in display. Net sales were approximately $2 billion, in line with our expectations. 
Our non-GAAP EPS is $0.19, in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42%, down about a point, due in part to items in AGS and display that I'll touch on in a moment. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $512 million, which was a bit below our guidance. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.8% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year. We expect the rate to be approximately 23% for the first quarter.
Cash from operations was $19 million, driven by increased working capital requirements. Our shipments were weighted to the latter half of the quarter, resulting in higher accounts receivable. And inventories grew to support Q1 projected customer demand. 
We returned $167 million to stockholders in Q4, paying $120 million in dividends and using $47 million to repurchase 3 million shares. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.9 billion. 
Next, I'll comment on our Q4 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 16% to $1.4 billion, with growth in foundry, NAND and logic and a decline in DRAM. SSG net sales declined slightly to $1.2 billion, in line with guidance, with increases in logic and DRAM, offsetting a seasonal decline in foundry. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 20.8%, reflecting higher investments and new product development. 
In AGS, orders were up 6% to $548 million and included several large contract renewals, which tend to be higher in our Q4. AGS net sales were up 8% to $538 million, which is a bit better than our expectation due to higher-than-expected equipment sales. AGS non-GAAP operating margin declined to 21.6%. We recorded a $20 million charge for a customs duty assessment that we hope to recover in the future. 
Our display orders decreased 55% to $114 million. We expect orders to be higher in Q1, and we expect the overall TV and mobility investment cycle to continue in 2014. Display net sales were flat at $163 million. The non-GAAP operating margin declined by about 9 points to 12.3%, reflecting a $10 million inventory charge. 
EES orders increased to $40 million, and net sales were approximately flat at $44 million. EES non-GAAP operating loss was $22 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to lower EES spending and losses. 
Now I will provide our Q1 business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 3% to 10%. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be up by 15% to 20%. AGS net sales should be down 5% to 10%. AGS revenues tend to be seasonally lower in Q1. We expect display net sales to be down 15% to 30%, and EES net sales should be approximately flat. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $540 million, plus or minus $10 million. Many of our groups will observe a 2-week holiday shutdown, which will save us approximately $10 million in the quarter. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24. 
In summary, 2013 was a transformative year for Applied Materials, and we anticipate that 2014 will be a strong year for the company and the industry. We enter our new year with increasing customer and product momentum. We are excited about our planned combination with Tokyo Electron, which will accelerate our strategy, increase our profitability and provide strong cash returns to our owners.

Intentionally, John -- I intentionally gave everybody some guidance by quarter because there's so many moving pieces here that I want to try and help. Last quarter, if you remember, I voiced some conservatism about the Q1 gross margin. I looked ahead a quarter. And in fact, if you look at what we're saying today, it's probably a little bit more optimistic than the Street interpreted last quarter and, frankly, than I thought. It's got a little bit better. So a lot of mix things going on here. So if you look, Q1, probably a little bit better than people thought last quarter and even I thought, got a little bit from this -- or up a little bit, actually, from this quarter, but not quite as conservative as I thought last quarter. As you look to Q2, I project the mix to be a little bit negative. I project, as you go through the year, Q3 and Q4, the product and customer mix to be more positive. And I project some of the material costs and absorption to be more positive later in the year. Additionally, the question you asked about new product penetrations, we're pretty optimistic about the new product penetrations, including the disruptive ones and the evals and the customer engagement.

Yes. So as I've talked about before, we see very, very strong -- continue to see very strong pull from customers in the inspection market, a lot of momentum, especially in foundry and logic, layer penetration increasing at 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer. And we also see a very strong position as the customers move to finFET technology. In the leading finFET companies, the layer penetration for us is increasing. So the -- really, the strength is in the foundry and logic business. There are some areas where the technology is superior to the competitors, especially in some of the patterning types of applications. We have imaging capabilities that really leverage our strengths. So that's one area that is growing for us. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks that our UVision brightfield sales were a record in this last year. We also have a strong position in e-beam technology. The e-beam review business is a few hundred million dollars, and we're strengthening our position there. There -- and then as customers are moving to the 3D NAND, there is more demand for e-beam types of applications in the defect review. We're actually seeing traction both in foundry and logic, with some unique e-beam imaging capability and metrology. So we're seeing some more pull there. And e-beam inspection, especially in 3D NAND, is increasing. That's a small number for us today, but we see that longer-term as an increasing opportunity.",239,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

If you add up our orders numbers we have reported throughout the year, you'll see that we have a pretty damn big backlog in display, and the lead times in those tools tend to be pretty long, months and months in terms of the lead times to buy the parts and assemble the tools. So you have pretty good visibility into the shipment pattern. Now the risk you have on that tends to be a little bit -- do they slip it out a little bit. But in terms of the visibility into the shipment plan over the next 6 months, it's pretty good. The inventory charge we noted on this, that was related to a specific type of tool. We're still hopeful that we are going to end up in good territory in those tools, but right now, we took a position that it was -- we're going to take a reserve against them.",156,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We found display, as we talked about earlier, a few things driving the business. One is the increase in TV sizes. That's a very positive driver for us. And really, the new technology in display technology and mobile is also positive with LTPS, OLED, flexible displays. This is really a big part of the battleground for the consumers.

Yes, I agree with you. I think right now, we've talked a lot about we've been reducing costs in overhead areas, particularly ones that aren't in SSG, and investing in product development, which is heavily focused in SSG. Those new products are starting to come out, whether it be eval tools or D2R positions. As we start to get revenue ramps on those tools, you'll see our margins drop through much more effectively. So we see it going up next year with some volume. We see it improving over time as we start to get penetrations. And our goal is to be much more similar to what the numbers you've referenced. We've just turned somewhat of an investment mode in R&D in SSG right now, and we're funding that by cutting back all of other places where it's solar or overhead. So I think our overall approach is somewhat balanced right now, but in SSG, we're in investment mode right now.",172,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

What I would say is that those technology transitions are very big transitions, many new materials, very difficult for the customers. And so the first thing, really, in working with them is to hit the device performance targets, and those are the things that we're working on. And then after that, really, it's trying to optimize the overall capability of the systems. And we are certainly working with customers on that, too.
