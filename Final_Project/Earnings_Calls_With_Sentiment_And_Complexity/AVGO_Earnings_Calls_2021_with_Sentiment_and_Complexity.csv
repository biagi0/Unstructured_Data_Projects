Well, we delivered net revenue of $6.7 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.9 billion, increasing 17% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.7 billion, up 5% year-on-year.  
Let me turn first to semiconductor solutions. But before I get into the numbers, perhaps it would be very constructive for me to give you my perspective on the situation today and in fact, what has actually evolved over the past 9 months.  
You may recall in our earnings call Q2 fiscal '20 around middle of last year that we highlighted supply chain challenges. Since then, we have started extending lead times across our product portfolio. We stretched these lead times further over the past 9 months, as we saw demand within end markets continue to increase. So fast forward to today, we see customers accelerating their bookings for early deliveries and attempting to build buffers and creating the demand-supply imbalance you don't hear out there.  
In anticipation of this phenomenon, we put in place, in mid-2020, a very rigorous, disciplined process of carefully reviewing our backlog, identifying real end-user demand and aligning our supply chain to more closely match end user consumption.  
Of course, not all end markets are behaving the same way. But we believe we have done a very good job of balancing demand and supply in our end markets. And what I'm reporting today does recently reflect what's been consumed by our end users. With that, let me get into the numbers.  
In semiconductors, we grew 17% year-on-year organically. Starting with wireless, we hit a seasonal peak in Q1, where wireless was up 52% year-on-year and reached 40% of semiconductor revenue mix. This sharp increase was in large part due to a higher content -- FBAR content was up, and we shipped in high volumes WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E, the next generation of WiFi 6.  
As expected, Q2 wireless revenue will now show a typical seasonal decline sequentially, even as anticipated revenues will be up 30% to 40% year-on-year.  
And as we look into the second half of the year, we are planning for typical revenue ramp in this space and structuring our in-house FBAR fab capacity appropriately. This should result in sustaining the year-on-year growth trend we now see in Q2 through the second half of the year.  
Moving on, networking represented approximately 29% of our semiconductor solution revenue in the quarter and grew 15% year-on-year. Demand is strong, driven largely by data center spend in the cloud and global telcos who continue to upgrade their infrastructure and networks.  
Sustainability of this strength is evidenced by bookings as they jump 80% year-on-year and 62% sequentially. Demand for switch and routing platforms, both of the current and as well as next-generation, is robust. But as anticipated, our AI TPU business was seasonally down this quarter. Moving on to Q2, we expect networking to be up sequentially and continue the trend of being up year-on-year, driven by continued strength we see in cloud and telcos, offset partially by continued weakness in enterprise.  
Turning to broadband, which represented approximately 15% of semiconductor solutions. Revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by the work from home environment. Multiple telcos in Europe and the U.S. continue to roll out PON and cable DOCSIS. Embedded in this wireline gateways are our next-generation WiFi 6 access points.  
Softness in enterprise was more than offset by the strong demand from retail home routers even as telcos continue to spend. Looking at Q2, we are enabling the launch of new WiFi 6-enabled platforms with higher value content for North American and European telcos. As a result, we do see demand accelerating consumption -- and consumption increasing, and we expect to generate double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in broadband.  
Server storage connectivity represented approximately 12% of Q1 semiconductor revenue. This segment is largely driven by enterprise demand, as we know. And not surprisingly, service storage revenue was down 22% year-on-year, reflecting continued softness in end-user demand as well as OEMs, original equipment manufacturers, depleting their inventory in this space. While bookings have improved, these are largely for demand in the second half. And accordingly, we expect revenue in Q2 to continue to be down year-over-year by double-digit percentage. However, we do expect some recovery based on our bookings received in the second half.  
And finally, industrial represented approximately 4% of Q1 semiconductor solution revenue. Resales grew 13% year-over-year in Q1, driven by a recovery of multiple economic factors in China. Turning to Q2, we expect resales to grow at roughly the same level as we see recovering now occurring as well in Japan and Europe. Inventory in the channel for us continues to deplete, and we may have to increase shipments and revenues to replenish channel inventory this quarter.  
So in summary, semiconductor solution revenue -- segment revenue was up 17% year-on-year in Q1. Q2, we expect this year-over-year percentage revenue to continue at a similar -- around a similar amount in spite of a seasonal decline in wireless. The way it looks now, this relatively strong trend appears to be sustaining through most of 2021. However, in our view, this very high and unusual secular growth rate merely highlights and accelerated adoption of our connectivity platforms during this pandemic.  
Turning to our other segment, software. Q1 2021 was our first quarter that on a year-on-year basis provides an organic comparison following the Symantec acquisition. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue growth was 5% year-on-year. In dollar terms, bookings averaged 122% over expiring contracts, while core accounts averaged 137%. Now over 90% of these bookings represented recurring subscription and maintenance. 
Our strategy of focusing on core accounts continues to perform well as we cross-sell our portfolio of software tools. In other words, our software portfolio continues to perform as we had planned and continues to be on track with our long-term financial model for organic software revenue growth of around mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. And that's something we expect to continue to see in Q2.  
So in summary, our Q1 consolidated net revenue grew 14% year-on-year. We expect a similar growth trajectory in Q2, which could bring revenue to $6.5 billion or a 13% year-on-year growth.  
So with that, I will now turn the call over to Kirsten.",1050,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Net revenue was a record $6.7 billion for the quarter, up 14% from a year ago. Gross margins were 73% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 30 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 8% year-on-year, reflective of the full benefit of the completed Symantec integration.  
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $3.8 billion and is up 23% from a year ago. Operating margin was 57% of revenue, up 420 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 billion or 59% of revenue. This figure excludes $138 million of depreciation.  
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for semiconductor solutions was $4.9 billion and represented 74% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 17% year-on-year.  
Gross margins for semiconductor solutions were approximately 67% in the quarter, up 220 basis points year-on-year, notwithstanding the higher mix of lower-margin wireless revenue. Operating expenses were $750 million in Q1, down 3% year-on-year as we invested in R&D and streamlined SG&A. Because of this, operating margins increased to 52% in Q1, up 350 basis points year-on-year. So while semiconductor revenue was up 17%, operating profit grew 25%, all organic.  
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.7 billion and represented 26% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 190 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $346 million in the quarter, down 18% year-on-year as we've completed the integration of Symantec. Operating profit was up 17% year-on-year on top line growth of 5%. Operating margin was 70% in Q1, up 740 basis points year-over-year.  
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the first quarter was approximately $3 billion, representing 45% of revenue. This is up 35% year-over-year as we carefully manage working capital. Days sales outstanding were 35 days in the first quarter compared to 57 days a year ago. We ended the quarter with inventory of $952 million, a decrease of $51 million or 5% from the end of the prior quarter. We should also note in Q1, we spent $114 million on capital expenditures.  
On the financing front, we extended our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 9 years from 6 by issuing new notes that we use to refinance and redeem existing debt. Our weighted average coupon increased about 23 basis points to 3.8%. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and $41.9 billion of debt, of which $843 million is short term.  
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.5 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $225 million of withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 521,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 408 million outstanding common shares and 450 million diluted shares. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 450 million in Q2.  
Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '21 is for consolidated net revenues of $6.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 59% of projected revenue.

I wanted to dive a little bit into that. 
Last quarter, you talked about a backlog. I think the number was $14 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of your backlog today, how it is on an absolute level and the sustainability of it as investors are wondering if this demand is just too good to be sustainable and what does it mean to excess bookings, double ordering, that sort of inventory digestion that will inevitably follow thereafter?",102,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And as I say, we have had -- as I indicated, we started this process almost 9 months ago because we've seen demand that are quite strong. And we started the process of thinking how we best ensure very, very good use of our supply chain capacity. And basically, as I said, we went through this process rigorously scrubbing our backlog. And by the way, our entire backlog -- virtually, our entire backlog follow a set of terms, a key set of terms we mentioned before, which is noncancelable for any of the customers who book those. And they still apply, more so than ever. 
So double bookings from our point of view, is not -- it's never been an issue. And as we stretch out lead times, we are seeing customers obviously booked for delivery dates for customer requests they set further out. So that makes sense, too. And that's why it makes the process of create or being able to match customer consumption close -- as close as we could do it against what we supply to be something that makes sense. And we've done that. 
And I think we are fairly -- we could always do better, but we feel pretty good that we have a reasonable process in place that ensures that our customers get their products and maybe just in time, but they do get their products when they need it. 
And we believe we have managed this process of supply, demand and imbalance fairly very, very well, as I indicated. And in fact, as I made -- to repeat the point I highlighted, our revenue year-on-year in Q1 was up 17%. But as I also indicated, our bookings was up 63%. That by itself proves there is a lot of demand, and people are booking out very far. We are virtually 90% booked for 2021 and -- if you laid out what they need. And we believe this is real because they can't cancel it. 
And obviously, in order to do reach that point, to one of your points, as our backlog as we begin Q2 increase from when we began Q1, yes, it has. We have and quite significantly as we start to see lead times even stretched out more. 
And the strength, we believe, of our products, not only products that are incumbent and used today, but what is coming down the pipe as next-generation products, which have already released but await launching is proven by the fact that we have customers, many of them, and reflecting a backlog while willing to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.",457,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But I do understand your question. And you have seen in my prepared remarks just earlier of where we see ourselves planning and the trend to go.

And it cuts to the core of the work we've been doing. We've never been working harder simply because, number one, is don't forget, we supply -- we do supply -- I mean we supply a range of products, and we do supply to a bunch of customers. But keep in mind, if I could remind you over the -- of the business model, we have built up the structure we build up. 
We provide technology leadership product in multiple verticals, mostly connectivity into the IT space. And where we are, we're the leader. Where we play, we tend to be leader.

I mean -- and you've seen the metrics we indicated, they increased.
And on noncore, you've also -- while we don't say -- what I said previously is we do see a level of attrition, manageable, but it will. And as they trade -- but is offset by improvement in core. We expect to be able to reach a stabilization, as I say, around mid-single digits on a very consistent basis. And we have seen that 2 years now that we have gone through, over 2 years now. And we've seen that happen. We have seen 8 quarters, 9 quarters to be exact, of that level of performance and is a great line of sight. 
The other thing I might add that it's also interesting, and I know stating the obvious to some extent, is most of all our customers, if not all of them, are enterprises, even in this environment. You heard when I tell by enterprise in semiconductors and how -- and the approach -- the different approach, the different characteristics and behavior enterprises have in terms of demand requirements in this environment of a pandemic, work from home to -- compared to telcos, broadband and public cloud. We don't see that in software, in the infrastructure software we have, simply because these are mission-critical products, tools embedded in the business process of these largest enterprises in the world who, if anything else, during this environment, consume more of those products rather than less.",318,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So bookings was already declining. And when I indicated Q1 bookings year-on-year improvement of 80% and what I'm also saying is that is netting out a decline in bookings of our wireless in a fairly substantial manner as it would have -- you would expect seasonality. 
So the answer is, yes. What we are seeing -- what I'm reflecting out to you, guys, when I showed those bookings, the revenue is -- the bookings that we're showing in Q1, which is fairly strong, reflects declining bookings in wireless as we all fully expect seasonally in -- at that -- during that time frame.",169,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

I was wondering when one of you guys will get to that and sure enough. You're right, we are accumulating cash. And you heard Kirsten mention it. We are generating cash. In Q1, we generated $3 billion of cash. And that was -- Q1 also is the time we pay out bonuses to all our employees. So if I, in fact, normalize that, that's about -- we're generating a $3.5 billion a quarter is our free cash flow. So it's building -- and half of that goes to dividends or almost half of it, as you correctly say. So that's predetermined. 
And the other half for now, we are putting into an increasing cash portfolio. And you're right. Well, look -- and our business model and strategy, as you know, long term, is to acquire and add on to our portfolio, add on to our earnings stream for our shareholders. And we take that very seriously, and we continue to look at it very seriously. If -- and so -- and that -- this takes time, and we continue to look at it. And we want to take an approach -- my point that we would be somewhat flexible to that as we accumulate cash. 
And by end of this calendar -- fiscal year, we haven't done an acquisition, we'll obviously take a hard look at our 2 other choices. One is pay down debt. And that may even happen before then, pay down debt. But interest rates are very low, and money is very available, and we're still very investment grade. And the other alternative is buy back shares.

Don't forget there is some timing adjustment by quarter 2, Blayne, in the sense that what used to be a big quarter in our wireless seasonality of fiscal Q4, in this recent generation, the peak quarter, as I indicated, begin Q1 of '21. So obviously, things roll down, perhaps somewhat slower. And because we're also assuming, as it rolls down slower in the course of fiscal '21, that we can -- we have to assume, for lack of knowing no better, that we might be back to a normal seasonal cadence of a wireless seasonality -- of wireless launch of new phones and assume that you will be back to that normal cadence. 
So '21 might look kind of compressed when you think in terms of revenue, in terms of availability of a market for us to address. And then couple that with a content increase between '20 and '21, you, therefore, could understand why we -- I indicated that for the rest of '21 begin to look like a fairly significant 30% to 40% increase on a year-on-year basis as we run through each -- the remaining quarters of '21.",208,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Hock, I had a question for you. I'm trying to wrap my head around some stunning numbers you threw out for networking, 80% increase in bookings, some 62%-odd sequential increase. I appreciate the process of identifying real demand. 
So with that, is there something going on in bookings that is specific to your end markets or your product set that is driving it? Could you just highlight what is going on there?",75,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And I've been dancing around and saying it in nice words. Let me call it directly. People need our products, each of our products. And in particular, whether it's broadband or networking, our customers, our end-user customers truly need the products. 
I mean they're in the business. They're in the business of launching more broadband, improving their networks. And all the cloud guys have to scale out data centers because there's more demand -- hosting a demand from public cloud in this work from home environment of social media and also online retail and everything else. So we need to buy those products of ours, whether it's the current generation, which we have, that work of soon to be the next generation. 
So if we stretch our lead time to an extended basis, the thinking in their mind is these are noncancelable orders. Do I still need it 6 months, 9 months from now? They need it, they place an order. Otherwise, they have a gap in being able to scale out capacity or scale out launches. They'll do that. It's a real test of how strong our product franchises and how mission-critical it is to our end users. 
And so -- so as we stretch out our lead time, where it goes from 3 months to 6 months to 8 months, they just book what they need 8 months out or first 3 months out first and 6 months out, then 8 months out. And you only do that if you truly believe you need that products to enable your business. 
And what I'm trying to say is, it is nothing more fundamental than why we are seeing as we stretch out lead time because we match it against our ability to get those products out, is a great way to indicate whether our products are needed. And they don't need it now as much as the -- as people might seem to indicate. They may need it 3, 6 months from now, but they are willing to lock in and say they need it so that we can manage our supply chain to get them those products, which is why I'm also saying the management of our supply chain to match demand. It's not that extreme and simple as may be made out there that you hear around. It's all about being able to tell your customers and get your customers to behave in a rational manner and, for us, to manage it in a rational manner. 
I mean, if I ship my -- have my entire backlog today, assuming I can even do that, of course, they will take it because they are all in the pending mode. But if on the other side, they know they can get it when they need it 6 months from now, they're happy to wait until then. Meanwhile, they book it ahead of time because that's one I need to reserve my capacity. 
And that's the perspective I only give to you guys. It is what it is. This is not a panic mode. This is a very structured and reasonable process, which we believe at the end of it all, still shows real underlying demand and the way we want to report it.",547,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

In Q2, semiconductor solutions revenue grew a strong 20% year-on-year to $4.8 billion, with infrastructure software revenue growing an expected 4% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Consolidated net revenue was of $6.6 billion, up 15% year-on-year.
Now on the last earnings call we had, we talked about how strong broadband and networking bookings were from hyper cloud and service providers, even as wireless was declining seasonally. In Q2 just passed, not only do we see broadband and networking sustaining, we now see a recovery of bookings from enterprise. And on the supply side, hourly times have now stabilized, but the volume of bookings we are experiencing today continues to grow. Now we intend to meet such demand, and in doing so, we maintain our disciplined process of carefully reviewing our backlog, identifying real end user demand and delivering products accordingly.
With that as context, let me provide you more color. Starting with broadband, which interestingly now is going through somewhat of a renaissance. Revenue grew 28% year-on-year and represented 18% of our semiconductor revenue. As discussed during our Broadband Teach-In, the work, learn and play from home environment is driving global service providers to expand connectivity to the home.
In our broadband carrier access business, PON fiber or otherwise known as PON grew over 40% year-on-year, mostly with existing generation 2.5G. But with next-generation 10G PON representing only 30% today, there is significant room for content growth as 10G PON deploys over the next few years. Not to be outdone by fiber, cable operators in the U.S. are driving deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems, we saw an 80% year-on-year growth, and planning to accelerate the upgrade to next-generation DOCSIS 4.0. Our broadband technologies, in fact, are enabling service providers to complement the 5G they deliver -- to deliver best experience for consumers.
Now overlaying all this last-mile broadband upgrades, we see a demand surge for the latest WiFi 6 and 6E technology to enable the last 100 feet of connectivity in homes. Broadcom has emerged as the clear market and technology leader in WiFi for access gateways to the home and to enterprises, with over 50 million ports shipped in Q2 alone or a year-on-year revenue growth of some 30%.
On the other hand, as we might expect, with the push into higher-performance fiber, copper DSL, digital subscriber line deployments for wireline broadband, declined 30% year-on-year. And with a lack of live events during the pandemic, video declined 20%. But with the onset of 5G, service providers are competing for subscribers, leading to technology upgrades globally in fiber, cable and WiFi connectivity. We're seeing this investment cycle in broadband extending into 2022. And so for Q3, we expect to sustain double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in this segment.
Moving on to networking. Networking grew 10% year-on-year and represented 32% of our semiconductor revenue. We experienced tailwinds from hyper cloud and telcos, partially offset by headwinds from enterprise. Revenue for switching was up 30% year-on-year, primarily driven by the strong ramp of our Trident and Tomahawk 3 for over 400G platforms and hyper cloud data centers.
In the network, service providers have been investing in 5G infrastructure worldwide, where the demand for Jericho2 at the metro core and Qumran at the edge have been robust with revenue up 35% year-on-year. On the other hand, enterprise demand in networking has not yet recovered, still down double digits from a year ago. But as we go into the back half of the year, we expect to see hyper cloud upgrading to our next-generation Trident, Tomahawk 4 or over 800G switching platforms and sustained strength by service providers in network routing. And accordingly, in Q3, we expect networking revenue to maintain the trend of low double-digit growth year-on-year. We found the complete recovery of enterprise demand.
Speaking of enterprise, let's talk about server storage connectivity, which represented approximately 12% of semiconductor revenue. This end market is largely driven by enterprise. And in line with our guidance, revenue was down 16% year-on-year. You may recall, however, in Q1, this was down 22%. And as the economy starts to recover, we are seeing an improving demand trajectory. And so in Q3, we expect server storage connectivity revenue to be down high single-digit percentage year-on-year.
With the launch of Intel's Ice Lake, AMD's Milan as well as future ARM-based servers, this space is turning quite exciting and innovative for us, both in hardware and software. And we will provide, obviously, more color during our next teach-in in July on our server storage business.
Moving on to wireless. Q2 revenue was down 16% sequentially, reflecting seasonality, with wireless representing 34% of semiconductor revenue mix. Nonetheless, on a year-over-year basis, wireless revenue was up 48%, reflecting a very favorable compare year-on-year as well as content increases in FBAR and WiFi. In Q2, we were able to ship more than we had originally planned. And accordingly, in Q3, we expect the growth trend in wireless revenue to sustain but at over 30% year-on-year.
Finally, industrial and other represented approximately 4% of Q2 semiconductor solutions revenue. Resales grew 34% year-over-year in Q2, driven by recovery in automotive and China. Inventory in the channel continues to deplete as what we shipped in the distributors grew only 23%. Turning to Q3, we expect resales to continue to grow double-digit percentage on a year-on-year basis. 
Summary, Q2 semiconductor solutions segment was up 20% year-on-year. And in Q3, we expect revenue growth year-over-year to be of a similar amount.
Turning to software. In Q2, infrastructure software produced another quarter of steady and predictable results as revenue grew 4% year-on-year and represented 27% of total revenue. Now if we exclude professional services, our enterprise software revenue grew 7% actually year-over-year. And a further indicator of the quality and sustainability of our products, over 90% of our software bookings represented recurring subscription and maintenance with an average contract life span from core customers pretty much close to 3 years. We continue to believe our infrastructure software business is on track to grow at or better than mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, which is again what we expect to see in Q3.
Summarizing this, demand continues to be robust, and so our Q2 consolidated net revenue grew 15% year-over-year. We expect the momentum to sustain in Q3 and total revenue to be at $6.75 billion or up 16% year-on-year.

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $6.6 billion for the quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Gross margins were a record 75% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 180 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower SG&A, offset in part by increased investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $3.8 billion and was up 25% from a year ago. Operating margin was 58% of revenue, up approximately 470 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4 billion or 60% of revenue. This figure excludes $133 million of depreciation.
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $4.8 billion and represented 73% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 20% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 69%, up 290 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by higher product margins. This margin improvement comes from content growth as we deploy more next-generation products in broadband and networking end markets. Operating expenses were $795 million in Q2, up approximately 2% year-on-year as we invested in R&D and streamlined SG&A. R&D was $702 million in Q2, up approximately 6% year-on-year. Q2 operating margins increased to 53%, up 580 basis points year-on-year. So while semiconductor revenue was up 20%, operating profit grew 35%.
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 27% of revenue. This was up 4% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 100 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $355 million in the quarter, down 8% year-on-year as we've completed the integration of Symantec. R&D spending at $228 million is up 1% year-over-year. Operating profit was up 10% year-on-year on top line growth of 4%. Operating margin was 70% in Q2, up 360 basis points year-over-year.
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $3.4 billion, representing 52% of revenue. Days sales outstanding were 33 days in the second quarter compared to 51 days a year ago. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $1 billion, an increase of $52 million or 5% from the end of the prior quarter. We should also note in Q2, we spent $126 million on capital expenditures.
On the financing front, we extended our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 10 years from 9 by exchanging notes. Our weighted average coupon decreased about 5 basis points to 3.7%. During the quarter, we made $1.5 billion in payments on debt obligations, ending the quarter with $9.5 billion of cash and $40.4 billion of total debt, of which $278 million is short term.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.6 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $461 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 1 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 410 million outstanding common shares and 450 million diluted shares. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 449 million in Q3.
The Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $3.60 per share in Q3. Based on current trends and conditions, our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 is for consolidated revenues to be $6.75 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 60% of projected revenue.

First, within your wireless business, you've been able to sign long-term contracts with your key customer, and I'd argue that's benefited both you and them. It's given you the confidence to invest in the business properly and then the confidence that you'll have supply for them when they need it. I'm just kind of curious, given how tight things are elsewhere in the semi business, have you been able to parlay this into any longer-term customer contracts? And what implications might that have as we all start to worry about the ""end of cycle""? 
And then secondly, just on your comments about enterprise recovery, can you elaborate on that? Was that specifically a storage comment? Or is that also a networking comment?",128,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Let me take the question one at a time. On arrangements with long-term agreements, John, this is something we have been thoughtfully, carefully putting in place with our core strategic customers. We just don't go do it as if it's commoditized. We're very thoughtful about doing it, and we do it in very specific areas where we know for sure that the technology is fairly, fairly difficult, complex to manage and which requires a substantial amount of R&D spending. And we've been doing it for a while now with strategic customers in core businesses. So we just don't do it across the board.
And what you pointed out is very, very correct. It's a mutual -- then it's a structure, it's an agreement with mutual benefit. We have the confidence to invest in R&D to make CapEx capacity investment. And in return, we offer the best leading-edge technology in specific areas in a timely manner to our critical customers.

It is -- I won't say across the board necessarily and trying to define enterprise very appropriately. As you noticed in my comments, we've classified service providers, telcos as a separate animal, different from traditional enterprise. And so -- and as I pointed out, based on broadband, telcos have been investing big time. Service providers, telcos have been investing in a huge manner over the past 12 months.
But traditional enterprise, the companies, whether it's the banks, the manufacturing sector, various retail customers, airlines, examples, no, these guys are in a recovery mode. And not surprising, we are seeing pandemic easing like, say, in North America. And as it eases, we see a step-up in spending. But we do not see spending spiking up.
Now obviously, if you look at some businesses that -- like warehouses that require WiFi networks, campus networking environment, you do see that improving. But to say across the board, all enterprises are just spending money, not -- we are still seeing -- and as I showed that in server storage connectivity, we still see year-on-year, things are not up to what it was a year ago.

Hock, I think as you mentioned, we're still in the early phases of the 400-gig networking upgrade cycle with your hyperscale and telco customers. I know 2 of your big cloud typing customers have already started the upgrade. It looks like there's another 2 more that are going to start the upgrade cycle here in the second half of this year and quite a bit more next year. 
And then as you mentioned, you still have Tomahawk 4 ahead of you. So given the extended visibility that the team has with the strong backlog, do you see the cloud and telco upgrade cycle and inevitable recovery in enterprise driving continued year-over-year growth in networking into next year?",130,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But on a broader trajectory, it does appear fairly much the trend, as we said, which is the hyper cloud guidance will push out in the second half, as I indicated, on the data center side on Tomahawk 4, the 800G platform. In fact, we have substantial backlog for delivering in the back half of the year for Tomahawk 4. 
So we see that going on, and we -- you're right, we see the recovery step-by-step of the enterprise, though I do not see that really taking off in terms of reaching the level it was a year ago, probably until 2022. But what we do not know for sure is would that give pause to hyper cloud in their spending. And that part, I'm just putting everything on the table. We're not sure whether hyper cloud spending will necessarily continue into 2022. We sensed it would. We see some of the backlog. 
But as enterprise steps up, one really never knows if the economy starts to rebalance in that side. But what we do see in broadband is service providers, the telcos in particular are, for sure, upgrading. And here, this is the longer cycle of upgrade and we see them upgrade.

Hock, I want to dive a little bit into the lead time commentary that you had with that stabilizing. Two quarters ago, you talked about the size of the book, the backlog you had. Last quarter, you talked about the year-over-year and even, in some instances, the sequential growth being so large in bookings. And now we're hearing that the lead times are stabilizing. People could interpret that a bunch of different ways as far as the implication on the demand side of the equation or that supply is catching up to it, or frankly, people are just ordering so far out that they're not willing to extend that any further. 
So I was hoping to double-click on that lead time commentary and get your feelings as to why it's stabilizing. And do you take that as a positive or a negative?",147,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And so what it is, is customers -- our customers are comfortable seeing our lead time now. 
But one we have found rather remarkable over the last quarter is that even if our lead times remain stable, consistent, the volume of bookings we receive every week continues to grow.

In between, I'm not sure. But on the first, it's -- we will not put ourselves in a situation nor should anyone do it because there's also a certain amount. You do not -- we do not want our customers, and I don't think any of our peers want to do that either, to buy, to hoard, to create buffers, to buy ahead of what they need.
 So we try to mesh, identify, as I said, and go through a process of rigorously understanding true end demand. In other words, we look for drop date quantities as the term is used in the industry. And we ship to those drop date quantities and maybe a little more. And what you see today is the true growth rate we are representing. We are not hiding what could have been. There's no what could have been. We're shipping to what we believe the customers consider as the true real demand. 
Now having said that, we may be delivering -- doing JIT, just-in-time. But nonetheless, we do try to fulfill what customer truly want just in a timely basis. And that still continues today, regardless of the size of the backlog we have, but this is really in that regard. And from our perspective, the challenges we have in the supply chain is a constant side challenge. It's to ensure that we get components, whether it's wafers, substrates, getting our products assembled, tested and any other small components on a timely basis to make sure that we can keep this thing running. 
And if you look at the size of our inventory versus the size of our cost of goods sold or revenue quarterly, you can see that we run pretty close to just-in-time through our entire supply chain. And we've been able to do it and sustain that. And so what we're reporting to you like 20% year-on-year growth on semiconductor components is, in our view, a pretty decent reflection what is truly end demand needs out there.

And I'll tell you this. Right now, we're in the midst of a very strong demand, and that's also created perhaps, as we all know about, a severe imbalance between demand and supply, demand and supply works to catch up. But if you look at it long enough, I think the dynamics underlying -- the fundamental dynamics underlying the semiconductor industry hasn't yet changed. At least I haven't seen it change. 
So Tim, that's my -- that's the best answer I can give you, which is I haven't changed my thinking, if we look over the next 10 years, how this industry will behave because it is a relatively mature industry. It's evolutionary. Technology is still evolving, which is great for us. And it keeps getting better and better. But it's evolving.

And it's a combination of all this. 
So the natural growth of -- expansion of gross margin for our business, especially in the semi side -- particularly in the semi side, which I assume your question is related to, Blayne is, as I've always said, we have a gross margin expansion range of 50 to 150 basis points year-by-year. And it's an average across our 24, 25 different -- well, I should take out software, just hardware, about 20 or so different product lines, each with a different product life cycle and each going to its new generation product each time. Because as you know, each time we come to a new generation product, we get a lift in margins, in product margins, which translates to gross margin. 
So it's not unusual to see us go to the high end of the range. And in this particular case, year-on-year, it's a bit more than the higher end of the range. And that's probably related to perhaps a separate mix of products in this environment because there's still puts and takes across our product range. Not everything is on fire. And based on that, we end up with higher than the normal 50 to 150 basis point range. But I don't think this is something that will go on forever. But you should expect that year after year, you will see that 50 to 150 basis point improvement in gross margin on the semiconductor side.",319,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

And part of the demand may actually come a bit from Q3. Not sure 100% yet because this is -- demand comes in short cycles. And it may, and perhaps that's why we are a bit careful about telling you Q3 year-on-year improvement is still 30-plus percent year-on-year growth. I'm not saying 40%-plus. But we don't know for sure, except we know that we do pull in some from Q3 to Q2, not much, and that allows Q2 to perform that 48% year-on-year growth, which is great. But Q3 will still be pretty good year-on-year, as we fully expect. 
And related to content and all that, I prefer, at this point in this sensitive arena with a highly sensitive situation, to not answer that question at all. No offense, please, but I can't answer that question. 
But I'll be happy to take the third question, which is, yes, we have cost inflation in this environment where, as we all know, the semiconductor supply chain is on a severe constraint on its ability to provide. Now we are very large. We are a very, very large customer and a very loyal customer to many of our suppliers, all of our key components. And so we believe we are treated very well. 
Having said that, where prices are concerned, of course not. We see cost inflation. And in this environment, we are very, very open to talking to our customers who are, in turn, very open to being able to address cost -- inflationary cost pressure in a higher purchase price on your side. So we're good, which is why our margin has been stable.",350,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

My frank opinion, I don't know. There shouldn't be. Same question that was asked is, do I think the semiconductor industry over the next 10, 20 years will grow any faster or slower? And my view is no, I don't think -- I don't see any fundamental things that have changed. See, while we're in the thick of this storm, so to speak, of course, all hell breaks loose, as the expression goes. 
But these are cycles we all have seen many times in the semiconductor industry. And maybe this is a bit extreme with -- in the context of the pandemic over the course of 2020, now extending partly into 2021, but the supply will step up at some point. And demand is always there because people need technology, people need the performance, need the technology that we all offer in the products we provide. And we'll be competing the same way we have been competing. And it's not necessarily related to creating long-term agreement or any such thing. It's about being able to provide the best technology, the best product in a timely manner for your customers. 
And it doesn't matter that you do any agreements if at the end of the day, you lack the technology or you lack the products that customers need to make themselves successful to be able to deploy very well in a good manner. And that has always been the semiconductor industry. And that is -- there will -- I do not see anything that changes that. Now putting long-term agreements might make life easier. But I think it's just a myth. We still have to establish ourselves that we can outperform, out-engineer the competition.",284,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

In Q3, semiconductor solutions revenue grew 19% year-on-year to $5 billion, with infrastructure software revenue growing 10% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Consolidated net revenue was $6.8 billion, or up 16% year-on-year. 
In Q3, demand continued to be strong from hyper cloud and service provider customers. Wireless continued to have a strong year-on-year compare. And while enterprise has been on a trajectory of recovery, we believe Q3 is still early in that cycle, and that enterprise was down year-on-year. On the supply side, we continue to keep our lead times stable. 
With that as context, let me provide more color by end markets. Starting with networking. Networking revenue of $1.8 billion grew stronger than we had forecasted, up 19% year-on-year versus low double-digit growth and represented 36% of our semiconductor revenue. The better-than-expected growth was driven by routing from service providers in the expansion of 5G networks for backhaul, metro and call as well as major share gains in ethernet network interface controllers within data centers. While we experienced strong orders from OEMs, consistent with a recovering environment for enterprise spending, we believe actual deployment of networking in enterprise are still lagging from a year ago. Our shipments and revenue appropriately reflects this. 
In Q4, however, we expect a different set of demand dynamics. We see cloud customers upgrading to our next-generation 800-gigabit base Tomahawk 4 and Trident switches. We're the first and only provider of 25.6 terabit switches, and we are shipping 2 versions: one with 512 lanes at 50G SerDes; and we have 256 lanes at 100G SerDes. I would like to highlight that we are the only company today shipping 100G SerDes. 
In data center switching, as in service provider routing, we continue to lead in next-generation product transitions as our engineers continue to out-execute what's out there. And in Q4, against a very strong year-on-year compare, we expect networking revenue growth to be low double digits year-on-year. 
Next, our server storage connectivity business was $673 million in Q3, down 9% year-on-year, in line with our guidance and represented approximately 13% of semiconductor revenue. As you know, our products here supply mission-critical applications largely to enterprise, which, as I said earlier, was in a state of recovery. That being said, we have seen a very strong booking trajectory from traditional enterprise customers within this segment. We expect such enterprise recovery in server storage. And the same is happening in networking to be one of the [ engines ] of growth in Q4 and into 2022. 
In this particular segment, customer transition to our next-generation SaaS and nVME connectivity at the server, exemplifying this growth. The aggressive migration in cloud to 18-terabyte hard disk drives will also provide a strong tailwind to demand for external storage connectivity products in this segment. In sharp contrast to the 9% decline in Q3, we forecast in Q4, server storage connectivity revenue to be up low double-digit percentage year-on-year. 
Moving on to broadband. Revenue of $910 million in Q3 grew 23% year-on-year and represented 18% of semiconductor revenue. This was primarily driven by the 2x growth in deployments of WiFi 6 access gateways as well as double-digit growth in next-generation fiber and DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem deployments.
For Q4, we continue to expect double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in broadband, we've been seeing for the last few quarters. So looking ahead, we see service providers like AT&T, British Telecom and even Deutsche Telekom, deploying in increasing volumes next-generation last mile fiber connectivity to homes in the U.S. and globally. This multiyear and multibillion dollar investments by these operators and attach to every one of these fiber nodes, you need WiFi connectivity for the last 100 feet within the homes, and we lead the global transition to WiFi 6 today. We expect our strong design win momentum for WiFi 6E at U.S. and European operators will sustain our market position into the next generation. 
Now moving to wireless. Q3 revenue of $1.4 billion was up 35% year-on-year, in line with expectations and represented 29% of semiconductor revenue mix. In Q4, we expect wireless revenue to ramp approximately 33% sequentially in support of the launch of next-generation smartphones and to be up 25% year-on-year. 
Finally, industrial. Revenue of $205 million in Q3 represented approximately 4% of Q3 semiconductor solutions revenue. Resales here grew what we consider an unsustainable 55% year-over-year, driven by aggressive buying from OEMs in automotive, robotics and renewable energy. As a result, inventory in our channels declined significantly to below 2 months. And turning to Q4, we expect resales to come down to a more rational 20% year-upon-year growth.
And so in summary, Q3 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 19% year-on-year. And in Q4, we expect the momentum to continue and revenue growth to be up double-digit percentage year-on-year. 
Turning to software. In Q3, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 10% year-on-year and represented 26% of total revenue. Within this, Brocade grew 27% year-on-year, driven by the launch of new generation Gen 7 Fibre Channel SAN products. Excluding Brocade, Broadcom software revenue grew 6% year-on-year. In dollar terms, bookings averaged 116% over expiring contracts, while in our core accounts we averaged 129%. Over 9% of these bookings represented recurring subscription and maintenance revenues. Reflecting these renewals, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to be on track to grow around mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, which is, again, what we expect to see in Q4. 
So in summary, combining a strongly growing semiconductor segment with a more stable software segment, total Q3 net revenue grew 16% year-on-year, and we expect this double-digit growth to sustain in Q4 and total revenue to be $7.35 billion or up 14% year-on-year. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",965,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Revenue was $6.8 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 85 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, flat year-on-year, driven by lower SG&A and continued investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $3.9 billion and was up 24% from a year ago. Operating margin was 58% of revenue, up approximately 360 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.1 billion or 61% of revenue. This figure excludes $134 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $5 billion and represented 74% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 19% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, up 110 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by favorable product mix and content growth as we deploy more next-generation products in broadband and networking. 
Operating expenses were $783 million in Q3, flat year-on-year. R&D was $693 million in Q3, up 1% year-on-year. Q3 operating margins increased to 54%, up 410 basis points year-on-year. So while semiconductor revenue was up 19%, operating profit grew 29%. 
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 26% of revenue. This was up 10% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 125 basis points year-over-year. 
Operating expenses were $359 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year. R&D spending at $226 million is up 9% year-over-year, and SG&A of $133 million is down 11% year-over-year. Operating margin was 70% in Q3, up 305 basis points year-over-year; and operating profit grew 15%. 
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $3.4 billion, representing 51% of revenue. We spent $115 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the third quarter compared to 42 days a year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.2 billion, an increase of $156 million or 16% from the end of the prior quarter in preparation to meet customer demand in Q4. We ended the third quarter with $11.1 billion of cash and $40.5 billion of total debt, of which $279 million is short term. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.6 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $347 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 739,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 412 million outstanding common shares and 449 million diluted shares. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 448 million in Q4. Our Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $3.60 per share in Q4. 
Based on current business trends and conditions, and to reiterate what Hock has said, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 is for consolidated revenues of $7.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 61% of projected revenue.

You mentioned it a couple of different times when you were talking about both networking and your server storage connectivity segments. So I guess a two-part question. 
One, how much of your semiconductor business do you believe is enterprise exposed? And two, when do you believe that will return to year-over-year growth? And is that a specific thing to Broadcom with your product cycles? Or is it just the end markets returning to year-over-year growth at that time?",87,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Well, enterprise -- traditional enterprise, as we define it, and I think I made a point of purposely demarcating the fact that in semiconductors, which -- focusing on semiconductor segment by itself, you can literally look at our data -- revenue selling into 3 distinct elements, right? One is cloud and service providers, which we clump together as one, and then there's consumer, which is very much our wireless business. And then the rest of companies out there, enterprises, we call traditional enterprise. So we do put telcos, service providers to make it clear, as part of cloud in that category. So we break it into 3 categories. And under that measure, enterprise represents about half -- just around half of the total semiconductor revenues. 
And to basically answer your question, which I did indicate in my remarks on server storage end markets for our semiconductor business, we have seen an improvement year-on-year of revenues in this -- in server storage, which is 80%, at least 90%, driven by traditional enterprise. So they are a very good indicator of what traditional enterprise is showing. 
We have seen it show of improving year-on-year compares, and ending with -- and the latest Q3 still high -- mid- to high single-digit decline from a year ago. But we did also guide that because of strong bookings that we have been seeing now for the last 3 months, at least from enterprise, which is going through largely on the large OEMs, who particularly -- who integrate the products and sell it to end users, we are going to likely expect enterprise to grow double digits year-on-year in Q4.

Last quarter, you were predicting -- or you thought the excellent growth you've seen in cloud server providers and telcos might lighten up next year as they digest that as enterprise started to grow, and there'll be kind of a mix shift there. But it sounds like that isn't lightening up and enterprise is coming back a bit sooner. 
Do you think any differently now about telcos and service provider in the cloud? Will that last longer? Do you still expect to maybe lighten up in 2022? And how long do you expect -- enterprise has been down for quite a while now, the enterprise upward trend to last?

What we are seeing now -- or what we expect to see in 2022 in terms of broad direction is, we see -- in telcos, service providers are running well, quite hot, and it looks like they are sustaining as opposed to perhaps rolling over. They seem to be sustaining where we are right now. And regarding enterprise, it's pretty much what we had indicated before and continue to see, which is a continuing trajectory of improving demand -- spending and demand. And we see that continuing to improve and grow next -- this coming quarter, Q4 and beyond. 
In fact, I would say that the engine for growth for our semiconductor business in 2022 will likely be enterprise spending, whether it's coming from networking, one sector for us, and/or from server storage, which is largely enterprise, we see both this showing strong growth as we go into 2022.

Strong free cash flow generation in Q3. You gave us the EBITDA profile for Q4. And if I use normalized assumptions on cash interest payments, cash taxes and CapEx, it looks like the team is going to generate about $13.7 billion-ish, roughly, in free cash flow this fiscal year which roughly translates into a dividend increase to at least $16.70, maybe a bit more, if the team continues to return 50% of the free cash flow. 
I guess my question is, on Q4, are there any onetime cash events timing-related dynamics, CapEx increases or tax-related events, which we should be considering? Or is my free cash flow and dividend math roughly correct? 
And then just a quick follow-up. The team has a fairly large footprint of logistics, warehousing and key suppliers for assembly and test in Malaysia.

On the clarification, I think, Hock, you mentioned you're shipping to demand. Does it mean you're not seeing any supply shortages? Then that would be very different than what we're hearing from every other semiconductor company. So I just wanted to make sure I had the right interpretation. 
And then my question is, just kind of the long-term growth rate for Broadcom. In the past, you have mentioned kind of this mid-single-digit kind of growth rate. I understand that this year, right, compares to make it easier to grow faster than that. But as you look at Broadcom over the next handful of years, do you think you are in a situation to grow better than mid-single-digit growth rate? Like what is missing to make you upgrade, right, that mid-single-digit growth rate, the conceptual forecast that you have provided in the past?",154,3.0,5.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5

Let me take the first question first -- the first part of the question first because I think it's very important and very interesting. It ties into the first question by John Pitzer is, ""Hey, why are you guys not shipping like crazy? Are you supply constrained?"" That's always overhanging our care about making every wafer count in this environment, and we do that very carefully. And we do that, I believe, very well given -- looking at how well our margins are performing in this environment. But we also are always, as I said before a few times, the way we manage our supply chain, we pretty much like to carefully scrutinize end demand as defined by ourselves, which is what -- the end-user who need those products. 
What we also see, and I mentioned that in our Industrial segment in 2000 -- in Q3, where resale from a distributor -- as you know, industrial generally goes through -- pretty much go through distributors. The OEM -- the end users just go to our distributors and wipe out our inventory, most our inventory there. So we show a resale growth of 55%, and we all know that's not real demand. People are building up buffer. There's a certain level of panic buying. Take that across all segments of semiconductor markets today. You see that kind of behavior, unless you -- as core key suppliers, we put in careful discipline to manage supply to where demand is really needed as opposed to where OEMs or even end users are just building up buffers -- bucket of buffers everywhere. And that's pretty much what we spend a lot of our time doing. 
I cannot necessarily say the same of many other semiconductor companies out there, which is probably why John Pitzer is saying, ""Well, why are people showing bigger numbers?"" We can show bigger numbers, but that means we will build up inventory in the wrong places. And we need every one of those wafers in this environment, not just this quarter, but next quarter and the quarter after that to ensure that our strategic customers are able to get what they need to launch, to deploy programs.

I get the most -- well, we like -- I like to believe, like some of you do, that with this recent event and with these things happening, especially COVID-19 creating a change of work habits in this -- in our ecosystem, there is a reset upwards towards a higher consumption of technology, and by expansion, semiconductor chips in the long term. 
I agree, there has been an accelerated adoption of certain technologies under these lockdown conditions in our lifestyle, economy, over the last 12 -- in the last 18 months. That this accelerated adoption of technology has created a strong grow -- demand for semiconductor products over these 12 months. I agree, and we report those results which we believe are true end demand, as I indicated in my brief -- earlier part of my answer to your question. That it's now up to high -- mid- to high double-digit teens, so to speak, year-on-year. That's good. That's very strong. That's a far cry from my model that says semiconductor growth long-term mid-single digits. 
But this accelerated consumption does not necessarily create a fundamental shift in our people's ability to consume technology. And when things revert back towards a more normal lifestyle, maybe not this year, maybe next year or the year after, I would expect this accelerated consumption would reset itself. And then you ask yourself fundamentally over the next 10 years -- 5, 10 years, is semiconductor consumption usage going to increase any higher? I find it hard to imagine why it shouldn't if fundamentally we have an industry that's relatively matured, still evolving, still changing, which make it exciting for us, but pretty much been around -- fairly much a long time. And it's -- I may be wrong. I still think it will revert over the next 5, 10 years back to a norm. 
And the question -- your view is, will that norm be high single digits, perhaps, rather than mid-single digits? And you may be right. I don't know the answer to that. But right now, you're right. We are seeing 15% to 20% year-on-year demand usage of our semiconductor chips. And by the way, we are pretty broad across multiple end markets in applications of semiconductors. So we kind of represent a large part of the overall semiconductor growth. And now there may be particular -- that could grow faster than that mid-single digits, and I do accept that. But given how broadly broad-based we are, I tend to think we'll revert to what will be the norm. And I cannot disagree with you that the norm might be higher than the mid-single digits I've said before.",454,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

No, broadband is hot, to cut to the chase. It's hot. It's hot, driven by 2 things, and I articulated that in my remark: WiFi, WiFi 6. And WiFi is a big area now that operate -- service providers basically operate -- the telcos and cable operators are using, as part of connectivity, to households globally. And that's -- and we have literally won again a huge part of that market successfully. And we're seeing that trend continuing into next-generation WiFi 6E. 
But what's also driving WiFi -- broadband, I should say, Blayne, and I mentioned that, is fiber. Fiber is multi -- several large telcos, Europe, U.S., are investing very big in putting fiber out there to households. It's particularly driven, I guess, to some extent, by political considerations. They want to connect households very well. You hear about British Telecoms are openly saying they want to -- they have a program over the next 5, 6 years to connect over 20 million British households. Deutsche Telekom is doing exactly the same thing, and so is AT&T here in the U.S., where they have very large program. 
And these are, as I indicated, multiyear programs, where each of this operator will spend multiple billions of dollars of investment to put that fiber out to the home. And at the end of each node -- fiber node, you have that wireless connectivity, WiFi, within for the last 100 feet in the home. So what I'm implying here is saying, this is not a one-shot thing. And the thinking in the past that fiber is a kind of boring, single-digit slow growth business, big changes from our perspective because we are seeing the program from those operators coming. And a big part of it is both U.S. and Europe putting in large broadband in the form of fiber because it's the most effective way, in some ways, economic way, to expand to households and hand-in-hand with 5G network wireless networks out there. 
It's also very interesting for us, market share-wise, because you used to talk about China doing broadband fiber. Today, it's beyond that. It's Europe, U.S. And the number of players fighting in this market on technology is much less now given the interesting political events between China and the rest of the world.",385,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

So in the environment we have today, enterprise demand rebounded sharply over 30% year-on-year. Hyper cloud and service provider demand continued to be strong, and strong wireless growth in Q4 was driven by the seasonal launch of next-generation smartphones by our North American OEM. Our core -- meanwhile, our core software business continues to be steady with a focus on strategic customers. 
On the supply side, our lead times remain extended and stable. Inventory in our channels and at our customers remains very lean. 
Accordingly, in Q4, semiconductor solutions revenue grew 17% year-on-year to $5.6 billion and with infrastructure software revenue growing 8% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Consolidated net revenue was a record $7.4 billion, up 15% year-on-year. 
Let me now provide more color by end markets. Let's start with networking. 
Networking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 13% year-on-year, in line with our forecast for low double-digit growth, and represented 34% of our semiconductor revenue. Double-digit year-on-year growth was primarily driven by strong demand from campus switching, both from our merchant silicon as well as ASIC solutions through OEMs like Cisco and HP. 
We also experienced similar double-digit growth with the deployment of Jericho routers within large-scale AI networks in the cloud as well as Qumran in 5G infrastructure and DCI. 
Our unique capability here to deliver ultra-low latency Ethernet networks enables large-scale deployment of AI compute for the cloud. Meanwhile, in the core of these large data centers, we have begun to ramp Trident 4 and Tomahawk 4, the world's first 25.6 terabit per second switch to several hyperscale cloud customers as they address their ever-growing need for bandwidth demand in scaling out their massive data centers. 
Now within hyperscale cloud, we continue to lead in delivering ASIC silicon for multiple compute offload accelerators, which has manifested into being 20% of our networking revenue, expect continued growth in the next fiscal year here to over $2 billion. The key to our success here aligns with our robust design methodology, which integrates a broad and substantial silicon IP and rapidly delivers world-class customized silicon SoCs to enable AI, virtualization, orchestration, video transcoding and security. We have now extended our footprint here beyond TPUs and multiple cloud customers. 
In Q1, networking is firing on all cylinders, and we expect networking revenue growth to accelerate to close to 30% year-on-year. 
Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $815 million, up 21% year-on-year in sharp contrast to the first half of 2021 and represented 15% of semiconductor revenue. The better-than-expected results were driven by robust demand for storage controllers and hotspot adapters from renewed spend by enterprises upgrading their compute and storage infrastructure. 
Additionally, hyper cloud storage, we saw accelerated migration to 8 terabytes and the start of 20-terabyte hard disk drives, which drove our nearline storage revenue. To put things in perspective, today, our nearline storage business is close to $1 billion on an annualized basis. 
We continue to gain share in server storage connectivity as we expand our leadership in next-generation SaaS 4, PCI express Gen 5 and nVME. Spending for enterprise continues to recover, and we expect this will accelerate growth in our server storage connectivity revenue in Q1 to approximately 30% year-on-year growth. 
Moving on to broadband. Revenue was $872 million grew 29% year-on-year and represented 16% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven by the continued strong growth in deployment by service providers globally of next-generation PON, wave WiFi 6 and 6E access gateways. We continue to lead the industry with a portfolio of end-to-end integrated solutions across multiple access protocols on PON, cable modem, and DSL, all SoC controllers, each with integrated WiFi managed through our software stacks to reliably deliver more bandwidth, faster data speeds from the call service provider networks to the homes. And a critical element in our broadband platform on my end is leading-edge WiFi 6 and 6E today and WiFi 7 tomorrow. 
Having leading-edge wireless is important for our service provider customers to reach digital homes from the networks. By the same token, in-campus switching in enterprises, it's also critical that our OEMs can connect enterprise data centers through campus switches to the access points with leading-edge WiFi. In both markets, our platforms, which encompass wired and wireless, silicon and software, uniquely differentiate Broadcom and sustain our market leadership. 
So in Q1, we expect this double-digit percent year-on-year growth rate in broadband to continue as we have seen for the last few [indiscernible]. 
Moving on to wireless. Consistent with the launch of our customers' next-generation phone during the quarter, Q4 revenue of $1.8 billion represented 32% of semiconductor revenue and was up 21% against a softer Q4 quarter a year ago. Nevertheless, we expect continuing strong demand into Q1 and -- which will drive wireless revenue to be up sequentially single-digit and be flat to up low single-digit percentage year-on-year from the peak of a year ago. Finally, industrial revenue of $197 million represented approximately 3% of our Q4 semiconductor solutions revenue. Having said this, resales of industrial of $232 million grew 36% year-over-year in Q4, driven by strong demand from OEMs for electric vehicles, robotics, factory automation and health care. As a result, our inventory in the channel declined further to below 1 month. And turning to Q1, we expect resales to continue to be strong, at the levels we saw in Q4. 
In summary, Q4 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 17% year-on-year. And in Q1, we expect the momentum to continue and revenue growth to be up double digits again year-on-year. This implies that Q1 semiconductor revenue will be up low single digits sequentially. 
Turning to software. Q4. Infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 8% year-on-year, represented 24% of total revenue. Within this, Brocade showed strong growth of 19% year-on-year, consistent with strong enterprise recovery during the quarter and deployment of our next-generation Generation 7 Fibre Channel SAN products. 
Now excluding Brocade, our core software revenue grew 6% year-on-year. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts, while within our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 127%, consistent with prior quarters. Over 90% of the value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. 
Stepping back and following the Software Investor Day last month, let me provide an update on the entire fiscal '21 for our core software. Total backlog at the end of the year totaled $14.9 billion, up 15% from a year ago, with average duration of contracts extending from 2.6 to 2.9 years. This backlog translates into an ARR, or annual recurring revenue, of $5.2 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. 74% of this ARR comes from our approximate -- approximately 600 strategic accounts, which in fiscal '21, we renewed at 129% or $2.4 billion of annualized booking value. $1.9 billion of this represented renewals on expiring contracts and roughly $500 million represented cross-selling, including PLAs of our portfolio of products to these strategic customers. For the year, we booked over 300 contracts generating greater than $1 million of revenue annually with over 30 contracts generating over $10 million annually. With such stability in Q1, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to continue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-over-year. 
So let me summarize. With the continued strength in our semiconductor segment and steady growth in our SAN software segment, total Q4 net revenue grew 15% year-on-year. 
Turning to Q1. Semiconductor revenue, excluding wireless is expected to be up 28% year-on-year. Wireless is expected to grow flat to low single-digit percentage compared to the peak of a year ago. So semiconductor revenue in total is expected to grow 17% year-on-year again, and consolidated revenue is expected to grow 14% year-on-year. Sequentially, this will drive revenue to grow from $7.4 billion in Q4 to $7.6 billion in Q1. 
We are very well positioned in every one of our franchise markets in fiscal '22 and beyond. We continue to significantly out-invest anyone else across our platforms, in switching and routing, offload compute, silicon photonics and wireless connectivity to accelerate our next-generation road maps as we continue to gain market share. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",1365,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Revenue was $7.4 billion for the quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 105 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $4.4 billion and was up 20% from a year ago. Operating margin was 59% of revenue, up approximately 286 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion or 61% of [indiscernible]. This figure excludes $134 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $5.6 billion and represented 76% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 17% year-on-year. 
Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, up 170 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Note that we have been able to continue to expand our semiconductor gross margin despite higher wireless revenue mix. 
Operating expenses were $790 million in Q4, up 3% year-on-year. R&D was $701 million in the quarter, up 6% year-on-year. As a side note, for fiscal '22, we are planning to increase R&D spend in semiconductors by mid- to high single-digit percent year-on-year. As Hock indicated in his remarks, we are committed to investing heavily in our next-generation products to maintain and even increase our leadership across all our franchises. 
Q4 operating margins increased to 56%, up 350 basis points year-on-year. So while semiconductor revenue was up 17%, operating profit grew 24%. 
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 24% of revenue. This was up 8% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 19 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $353 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year. R&D spending at $220 million is up 9% year-over-year, and SG&A of $133 million is down 10% year-over-year. 
Operating margin was 70% in Q4, up 166 basis points year-over-year, and operating profit grew 11%. 
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.5 billion, representing 47% of revenue. We spent $88 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 25 days in the fourth quarter compared to 32 days a year ago. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.3 billion, an increase of $137 million or 12% from the end of the prior quarter in preparation to meet customer demand in Q1. We ended the fourth quarter with $12.2 billion of cash and $39.7 billion of total debt, of which $290 million is short term. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.4 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $266 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of 525,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 413 million outstanding common shares and 448 million diluted shares. 
Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $7.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 61.5% of projected revenue. 
Let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2021. Our revenue hit a new record of $27.5 billion, growing 15% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $20.4 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $7.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 75%, up 100 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $4.5 billion, down 2% year-on-year as we completed the integration of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was $15.9 billion, up 23% year-over-year and represented 58% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was up $16.6 million, up 21% year-over-year and represented 60% of net revenue. This figure excludes $539 million of depreciation. 
We spent $443 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 49% of revenue or $13.3 billion. Free cash flow grew 15% year-over-year. 
For the year, we returned $7.5 billion to our stockholders, consisting of $6.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $1.3 billion for the elimination of 2.8 million AVGO shares. 
We have extended our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 10.6 years, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.6%. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. Consistent with that, we are increasing our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal '22 to $4.10 per share, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout this year, subject to quarterly Board approval. 
Today, as part of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we announced that the company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of $10 billion of our common stock under Broadcom's new share repurchase program. The authorization is effective until December 31, 2022. This new share repurchase program reflects our confidence in the company's ability to generate strong and sustainable cash flow. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 448 million in Q1. This excludes the potential impact of any share repurchase.

Obviously, bookings have been strong, continue to be strong across most of your buckets or end markets within semis. But if you can talk about bookings trends in the quarter, what you're seeing there, that would be super helpful. 
And then as you sort of answer the fiscal '22 question, if you can touch on supply and to what extent supply could be a gating factor over the next 12 months, that would be helpful.",114,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So let me try to address it in its various component parts. What we continue to see with the recovery, and I made a point of saying that -- and there's now -- we're now in the midst of a very strong spending recovery in enterprise, particularly, so we're continuing to see strong demand bookings in the semiconductor side. But a big part of that demand and increasing part of that demand is now coming from enterprise spending, which translates to end markets, tends to drive a lot of our broadband, continuing to drive the broadband, which has been strong in most of '21, continuing to drive the enterprise part of our networking business. And of course, server storage and industrial is just very, very strong. 
Having said that, under hyper cloud spending side, a lot of it resides in, obviously, in our networking business. Things are still fairly very elevated. Demand continues to be strong. And so when you combine all this together, we continue to see booking rates being at a fairly and continue to be a very elevated level week after week so far. 
And as of right now, we're pretty much booked all the way through '22 and even beyond '22 into '23. If you think about a 50-week lead time, no surprise, it goes to late '22. But we've gone, even in many cases now, gone beyond '22 and '23. And that's partly because: one, timing of our customers planning very far ahead; and two, as I said, our continuing disciplined approach to ensuring that we deliver products at the right time to the right place, and we see that going on. And I hate to disappoint you, still, we're still not ready or prepared to give you guidance on our whole fiscal year.",312,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

You said, obviously, on the industrial space, your channel is lean. It sounds like your bookings overall is very strong. At the same time, we know you've been taking efforts to limit like worries around stockpiling and overshipping, whether it's parsing orders, expedites. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you are doing in that space. How are you feeling right now in terms of your shipments versus where end demand is?

Well, we've been doing this 50 weeks now for -- just since the beginning of '21. So -- and we have been delivering very much, as much as we can to those lead times. So in some ways, I'd like to believe it's giving some method to this booking madness, I guess, is what I would call it, in terms of our ability and in terms of where -- how we are shipping the products. 
But by keeping lead times very stable and predictable as we are doing now, we're also clearly communicating to our end users the way they should be planning their business. And I like to think this -- all this is working out in terms of allowing us to -- making sure we don't overship and build up buffer inventory through our ecosystem out there, that means distributors, channels and customers. And all that is being done purposefully. And the truth be told, that the day will come when things have to land, and we like to make sure it lands very gently and softly. 
I would like to think that is working very well. And -- but -- so what we are reporting in some sectors now, what we're guiding in some sectors and reporting where you see growth of some 20%, 30%. I know even from our perspective, it seems very hot, excessively hot. And in those areas, in particular, we take strong particular attempt, to make those attempts to ensure these products we ship are for programs that get deployed rather than sit on the shelves for a future need. 
And so I'd like to believe that the areas -- that growth in networking, broadband, server storage lately of some 20% to 30% year-on-year are real, true end demand.",297,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And you may see then from quarter-to-quarter, when you talk about sequential quarter, you may sometimes see them. And what I'm trying to say -- and we may also chose to deploy supply to one market versus another as you go quarter-by-quarter. 
So looking at it sequentially in specific verticals might sometimes, for our case, from our point of view, be rather misleading, unintentionally, I may add, simply because we may choose to deploy or ship more to, for instance, sometimes to server storage because there is a hot need there versus to networking. And you may see then, because of that networking, see some sequential weakness in one particular quarter, which is why we report as much as we can on a year-on-year basis, where then you take out the effects of this short-term lumpiness and short-term discontinuities.",160,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

And only way I can answer that is, if this is a way of trying for me -- to guide -- to ask me to guide you on networking for the year, ain't working. I'm not doing that. 
But you're right, though, there are a lot of levers, and I articulate quite a few of them. And maybe I oversay it in some cases. And they all seem to be, as I use the expression, as we sit here today and going into '22, firing on all cylinders. And by that, I mean more than just forecasting. 
We've actually seen the backlog. We have the backlog and they keep building up. And you're right, hyper cloud guys, like you would ask me 6 months ago, I would not believe the level of spending they're embarking on right now in '22, but they appear to be. So we have the rate of enterprise has been strong, and you've seen the rate of growth of enterprise year-on-year of 30% across broadly. And cloud has the current elevated levels we are seeing in networking has not softened, has not weakened. It's still sustaining. 
Now it's not recovering, obviously, year-on-year basis as fast as enterprise is showing simply because enterprise starting from a lower point, but cloud is still growing. We are seeing hyper cloud growing and it's growing from not just switching and routing. That's our traditional strength. It's growing now for us on -- for want of a better expression, collectively called offload computing applications, from virtualization, orchestration to -- and more and more AI beyond just a single lead customer we have in TPUs today. So we're seeing multiple as I said, multiple levels, all moving in the right direction for fiscal '22.

So Hock, I find 2 things interesting. One is you didn't use the word metaverse in your commentary, but that's not my question. The question is on the buyback announcement. What changed your view? 
Because for some time, you were not as favorable towards buybacks. So the $10 billion announcement, is that more a statement about business trends, is it lack of M&A targets? Are you going to be more consistent in buybacks? So that's part A of the question. 
And part B is that, if I take that $6 billion or $7 billion in dividends that you will pay next year and add the $10 billion in buybacks and apply the free cash flow range that you have, it suggests sales of somewhere in the low to mid-30s billion, right, using that math.

I mean, this is consumer, right? So it's very hard. I can't even begin to forecast, much less -- I think my customer will be better at it. And even then, I suspect they are very challenged. 
But what we do see, interestingly enough, is demand for our components for the January quarter is good. And hence, you see the fact that even as we measure year-on-year to an all-time peak a year ago, we're still flattish to slightly up and sequentially from Q4, which in this current round, you are correct in this regard. Q4 is supposed to be back to normality in seasonality as being the peak quarter. Our Q1 will exceed our Q4 shipments as we forecast today. 
So yes, it sounds like even that part is doing quite well. It's just that year-on-year compare in percentage terms, may not be as exciting as the rest of the semiconductor verticals that we're in, but it's still holding up very nicely.",169,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So first, Hock, I want to revisit kind of the quality of demand and maybe ask it a different way. You've talked about undershipping what the actual demand or what your bookings are because you believe you can ship to actual demand. So that delta between what you're shipping and what is being booked, is that changing? Is it shrinking, growing? Basically trying to get at any change in customer behavior. 
And then the second question would be separate and 1 for Kirsten. You mentioned about the OpEx in the semiconductor side rising going forward. Any more color about the linearity of OpEx as we go throughout the year? And any color on kind of the areas that would be focuses of that investment?",146,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Has anything changed between what we're booking versus what we are shipping? I'm trying to answer now because -- I'm not trying to answer it. It's because the demand by verticals have rotated somewhat, and you can probably understand that. And so what I'm saying is one clear example is what I'm saying now. 
Enterprise is actually waking up big time, and they are asking for our products. They're asking for products in a very, very urgent manner. And so we're seeing more -- a lot more shipments to OEMs who support those enterprises. 
And by verticals, we are seeing strength in -- basically in server storage, in particular, and also the enterprise portion of networking, hence the strength in, as I mentioned, campus switching and WiFi in many ways because enterprise campus switching now for enterprise switching needs a wireless strategy component. And so we're seeing our WiFi business for access gateways in enterprise really take off now. 
Having said that, our classification of cloud includes telco service providers. They've been steady. It's interesting, cloud and telcos have been steady and -- but they've been steady in different manners. The cloud guys are now pushing more and more into compute offload. I mean, the programs they're working on starting to happen and starting to manifest as deployment. So we're seeing that. And that is really driving some more growth than just normal switching and routing that we have seen super strong in 2021. 
We've seen areas like in some of the very massive scale-out of machine learning or AI networks, here you need a different kind of performance of those networks. So we're seeing a different kind of products going into that area. And I highlighted in my remarks about Jericho being -- going into many of those AI networks in hyper cloud. And of course, 5G continues to be -- goes through cycles and happen to be a 5G deployment and backhaul is strong, and we ship a lot of Qumrans. 
So it varies. But if you take it from a macro point of view, not -- hasn't changed from 6 months ago, Ross, which is the undershipment from the level of bookings we are seeing.",381,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And not having had the time yet to go back and look, is this an unusual spend here?

And so we have -- and -- but in some other areas, and it's not so much about worrying about competition as seeing the underlying part of our business model across our various franchises. It's simply that we always out-invest our engineer, anybody else in the verticals, in those franchise verticals we are in. 
And so from our point of view, hey, now is a great -- because during COVID-19 in '20 and in part of '21, things were not as moving as fast as perhaps we believe a normal cadence of product cycle turnover should be, product life cycle. So we are now jumping in to '22 to basically bring it back up to where it should be in terms of a normal product cycle cadence is. 
And in that sense, you're right. It's not because of the competition, it's because we believe we need to deliver this new-generation of products with better features, better bandwidth, low latency to our customers and -- who are now ready and willing to take it on. And we -- having said that, we invest now. You don't see the impact of that probably until '23, '24. 
So -- but we feel that there's some hiatus of new technology being absorbed in 2021. So now is the time to really accelerate new technology, new generation of products for its absorption as much as we could in '22 and definitely in '23. So it's logical that spending would go up, and we are stepping up for that.",276,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But we intend to follow through, and we intend to do this $10 billion. And the reason we're doing it, as you guys can gather, is we haven't done a deal in -- we did not do a deal in '20, did not do a deal in '21. Got tons of cash, we have holed up a ton of cash, and debt has actually somewhat -- the gross debt has actually declined somewhat, while our cash position is building out. 
And while we may still do a deal in '22, it's just that we will still be generating a lot more cash in '22. So when you add up this whole thing, it's just a very logical conclusion for us to not just sit on the cash, hoard in some ways, you may call it, but just return it to you guys as we continue to accumulate cash.

And by the way, our ASIC business is actually larger than the $2 billion we indicate. It's only that part of the ASIC business sitting in networking that we highlighted. It's actually -- there are a couple of other areas where we do ASIC and it's done on a platform under one -- in a particular franchise business that we run fairly separately as one of the product divisions. 
But you are right, though, the larger part of it sits in networking. And a big -- and half of it roughly, I would say, maybe growing more than half now, is to the hyper cloud is to OEMs too, still remain very much OEM-related business as well. And you're right. But it's -- but your point is well taken. 
This is a steady, stable business -- and growing over time that we've had for many, many years. And it has, as I said, a long time ago, 20, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, been very much on networking, merchant silicon showdown in networking and -- which is switching and routing, and it has not grown as much in networking. But in this place, having said that, other opportunities show up. And most of -- a lot of it is what I call collectively offload computing, which is very much tied to hyper cloud. 
And that's a business that has been slowly but steadily growing, but it's slow, and it's not something that should slump exponentially overnight. Because a lot of the hyper cloud guys, much as they have ambition to do their own designs, I'd like to make that point very clear, it's a very difficult thing for them to do because they can go and hire silicon architects and designers, it doesn't mean you can define a chip, sell SoC, silicon on a chip, that addresses what they're looking for. Whether it's in transcoding, whether it's in security or even in virtualization or even in AI, it's hard when you don't do it on a full-time basis. 
So we have been working with these hyper cloud guys for the last 5 years. There's been fits and starts in many, many situations among these hyper cloud guys. But the message I want to say is we've never given up. We continue to work with them. And more slowly, more and more, after many tries, some of them become successful, more and more successful, hence you see the trend of growth in our ASIC business for offload computing. 
I mean those of you who have followed me consistently for the last 3, 4, 5 years, you have heard me talk about it 3, 4, 5 years ago. Then 2 years ago, I just shut up because it takes a while to get it going and starting to translate into revenues and ramps now, and it will be a nice driver to growth, I believe, for us over the next year, 2 years, I would say.

Beyond that, I really don't know the answer to what you're saying. I do see content increasing over the next several years because we have various products, multiple products, not just one particular product. And we have multiple -- we have various products into every one of those very high-end smartphones, and that gives us opportunity to expand footprint and to strengthen and increase our content. And -- we never really plan for unit increases actually in all our plan. We just plan on some content increase year after year, but never on any unit increase.

Now it doesn't mean they are perfect in their planning. And so occasionally, it happened, they come running in and asked for all the expedite deliveries within lead times. And we see that, and we work through that. 
But by and large, our customers are planning better and better because they have practiced doing that. It doesn't mean it's perfect. And in some cases, where we can do it, they probably will look for, if they can find alternatives. And to the extent there are alternatives, my competition gets some benefit on those spot situations, and that will happen. Because we -- I love to be perfect, but we cannot be.
