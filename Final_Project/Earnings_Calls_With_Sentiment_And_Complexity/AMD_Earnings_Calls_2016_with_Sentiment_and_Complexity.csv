168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3392.0,919697.0,39191519.0,Presenter Speech,Lisa Su,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. While 2015 was a challenging year from a financial perspective, the dedicated commitment of our employees, combined with our long-term technology investments and sharpened focus have created a strong foundation for future growth. 
In the fourth quarter, revenue decreased 10% sequentially to $958 million as seasonally lower semi-custom SoC shipments were partially offset by the second straight quarter of double-digit percentage revenue growth in our Computing and Graphics business. 
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 11% sequentially as we continued to improve the performance of our PC business. We had strong double-digit sequential percentage growth in mobile APU sales driven largely by increased Carrizo shipments and good sell-through of AMD-based PCs on Black Friday. 
In the channel, we delivered our third straight quarter of sequential revenue growth and further reduced downstream product inventories based on improved demand for FX CPUs and A-series APUs. We also made progress diversifying our client Computing revenue as we further expand into the commercial PC market. 
Second-half 2015 commercial APU unit shipments increased more than 15% from the first half of the year. We believe we can continue to grow our commercial shipments based on the high volume wins we are securing both across large enterprises and the public sector. 
Now shifting to Graphics. GPU revenue increased sequentially for the second straight quarter, driven by improved AIB channel sales of our Radeon 300 series across the enthusiast, performance and mainstream segments, and growth in Professional Graphics sales. The PC gaming market strength helped fuel a richer GPU mix and improved demand for our high end Radeon R9 series in the quarter. We expect this momentum to continue throughout 2016 as Oculus and HTC begin shipping consumer-ready VR headsets. The buzz and interest in VR is an exciting trend that is focusing the software industry's attention and some of its brightest minds back on the PC platform. 
While the initial wave of VR will be focused on gaming, an increasing number of developers see VR as the most significant investment in how we interact with technology since the introduction of the mouse and graphical user interface. Most importantly, these breakthrough software experiences will only be enabled with high-performance, energy-efficient CPUs. 
Overall, we made good progress further stabilizing our PC business in the fourth quarter and we believe we are well positioned to navigate the seasonally weaker first half of the year and the ongoing challenges in the China PC market due to macro conditions. 
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue declined 23% sequentially, in line with our expectations as semi-custom sales decreased from their third quarter seasonal peak. We had record annual semi-custom unit shipments in 2015 and have shipped more than 50 million semi-custom APUs as a critical and trusted partner to Sony and Microsoft. 
Demand for game consoles looked strong for 2016 and we remain on track to generate additional revenue from new Semi-Custom business in the second half of 2016. We also began production shipments of our first 64-bit data center class ARM SoC and expect additional system introductions from our partners throughout 2016 as the ARM 64 infrastructure ecosystem further develops. 
Now turning to the year ahead, we remain focused on completing our strategic work around 3 key growth pillars. First in PCs. Even in a declining overall market, we believe we can regain client compute and discrete graphics share for the year, driven by gaming, VR, commercial and our most competitive product roadmap in more than a decade. 
We have clear opportunities to regain GPU share in 2016 based on the performance-per-watt of our new GPUs and software leadership. Earlier this quarter at CES, we announced our new Polaris GPU Architecture, which we expect to begin shipping in the middle of 2016. Polaris combined significant design enhancements as well as 14-nanometer FinFET process technology to deliver double the performance-per-watt of our current GPU offerings. 
Customer response has been excellent, particularly in the notebook space where for the first time ever, there will be a GPU architecture capable of bringing high-end gaming and VR experiences to thin and light notebooks. In client computing, our opportunities to regain share in 2016 will be driven by our design win momentum, continued progress expanding into the commercial market and reentering the high-performance desktop market late in the year with our Zen-based Summit Ridge CPU. 
Our second growth pillar is in the $15 billion plus data center in infrastructure markets, driven by our FirePro GPUs and next-generation server CPUs. Our Zen-based CPU development is on track to achieve greater than 40% IPC uplift from our previous generation and we are on schedule to sample later this year. We have secured several key design wins with global OEMs for our Zen-based server CPU and believe we can rapidly reestablish our presence in the data center when we bring our new products to market in 2017. 
With FirePro, we plan to leverage our upcoming Polaris Architecture and suite of new software tools designed to dramatically simplify GPU Computing to accelerate the adoption of FirePro in the HTC and data center markets. Our third growth pillar is focused on further expanding the TAM for our products and technologies through ramping our previously communicated semi-custom wins, converting additional semi-custom pipeline opportunities and gaining share in targeted embedded markets. 
We also have near-term opportunities to strategically monetize our valuable IP in 2016 through licensing and partnerships that are complementary to our product development efforts. I look forward to sharing the initial results of our IP monetization strategy in the coming quarters. 
While we expect revenue to be lower in the first half of 2016 compared to the second half based on the seasonality of the PC and game console businesses, we remain focused on successfully executing our product and technology roadmap, and plan to return AMD to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of 2016 and generate positive free cash flow from operations for the year. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1026,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3392.0,919697.0,39191520.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2015, notwithstanding a difficult PC market and financial losses, we continued our multiyear efforts to transition our business model by diversifying revenue and establishing a foundation for improved financial performance. We made progress in stabilizing the Computing and Graphics segment and achieve strong double-digit percentage revenue growth in the second half of 2015. 
We also reduced overall channel inventory significantly from the prior year. In our EESC segment, we had record shipments of our semi-custom SoCs powering the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game consoles. In total, against the backdrop of a 28% revenue decline from 2014, we reduced a cost profile with a 14% decrease in OpEx, managed our inventory down and maintain our cash well within our target range of $600 million to $1 billion. 
Now let me provide the specifics of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $958 million, down 10% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonably lower sales of semi-custom SoCs, partially offset by higher Computing and Graphics segment sales. The year-over-year decline was 23%, due primarily to lower client processor and chipset sales and lower game console royalties. 
Gross margin was 30%, a 7 percentage point improvement from the prior quarter with 6 percentage points resulting from the impact of a $65 million inventory write-down in Q3 and the remainder, primarily from improved product mix in the Computing and Graphics segment. 
Operating expenses were $323 million, down $13 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower headcount and ongoing expense control. Operating loss was $39 million and net loss was $79 million with loss per share of $0.10 calculated using 791 million shares. 
Net interest, other expense and taxes were $40 million in the quarter compared to $39 million in the prior quarter. The GAAP results include a $13 million tax settlement in a foreign jurisdiction. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $5 million, improving from negative $55 million in the prior quarter. 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $470 million, up 11% sequentially, primarily due to higher notebook processor sales. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage revenue growth for this segment as we increased sales of both our client compute and graphics rosters in Q4. 
Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $99 million, improving from $181 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher sales and the absence of a third quarter 2015 inventory write-down. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $488 million, down 23% from the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. The operating income of this segment was $59 million, down from $84 million in the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower semi-custom product sales. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $785 million at the end of the quarter, up $30 million from the end of the prior quarter. Inventory was $670 million, down $83 million or 11% from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to reduced levels of semi-custom SoC inventory.
We have concluded our wafer re-profiling discussions related to the 2015 WSA amendment with GLOBALFOUNDRIES and we'll be moving approximately 60 million of wafer purchases from that amendment to later in 2016. To date, total repurchase under the 2015 WSA amendment are approximately $1 billion, including approximately $150 million of wafer purchases, which were not taken until early in our fiscal first quarter 2016. 
We are currently negotiating the 2016 WSA amendment. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.26 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, including total borrowings of $230 million on our secured revolving line of credit, unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was a positive $21 million, an improvement of $105 million from the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2016, which is based on the 13-week quarter. AMD expects revenues to decrease 14% sequentially, plus or minus 3% driven by game console seasonality and a cautious macroenvironment in China. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 32%. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $320 million. Interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $42 million, cash and cash equivalent balances to be down approximately $100 million from the end of the fourth quarter, including $70 million of cash interest payments. This cash balance does not include any cash proceeds related to the ATMP JV with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics. We expect to close that transaction in the first half of 2016, pending regulatory and other approvals and expect cash proceeds of approximately $320 million net of taxes and other expenses upon closure. Inventory is expected to be approximately flat from fourth quarter levels. 
Our fiscal year 2016 is based on 53 weeks and we plan to take the extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses between $320 million and $340 million per quarter as we continue to invest in leadership products and in line with our expected revenue profile. 
Interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $45 million per quarter. Cash and cash equivalent balances to be in the optimal zone of $600 million to $1 billion. Capital expenditures of approximately $70 million, inventory to be down year-over-year, and to return to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of 2016 and generate positive free cash flow from operations for the year. 
In closing, as we begin the new year, we remain focused on financial and operational execution and look forward to building on our second half 2015 product and roadmap momentum throughout 2016 across the 3 areas that Lisa outlined: high-performance PCs, the data center and TAM expansion through semi-custom and embedded opportunities.

So David, thanks for the question. So let me give you a bit of a color on sort of the guidance and how we view 2016. So if you look at overall 2016, we do expect to grow revenue, and if you look at our business, we see -- certainly, the second half of revenue will be stronger than the first half because of both of our businesses. Game consoles, we see units going up 2016 to 2015. We've also said in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment that we will be ramping some new design revenue in the second half of '16. So we see that as a positive growth driver. And then if you look overall at our Computing and Graphics business, we do believe even in a down PC market that we have the opportunity to gain share as a growth vector in our Computing and Graphics.

So as you say, we don't go into that level of detail. I think what we have said is that we did see growth in our discrete Graphics business sequentially in both Q3 and Q4. As we look into 2016 with our discrete Graphics business, we have a strong product portfolio. In particularly, the ramp and the introduction of our new FinFET products, code-named Polaris, will happen in the middle of 2016. So that'll be a '16 growth driver.

I think we have some design wins with it and I would call it a modest revenue contributor in 2016. We still see ARM strategically as an interesting market for the infrastructure markets.

I think the overall commentary, maybe if I just expand a little bit is, look, the data center market is really, really interesting. And I think we all agree with that. I think x86 has a lot of momentum and that's one of the reasons that we've put quite a bit more emphasis on our x86 data center and infrastructure play. That being said, I think ARM does have a lot of specific areas where it can contribute and it has done so.

And as my follow-up, perhaps a longer-term question, which is, what is the strategy to actually get to a meaningful earnings and cash flow growth? I understand on the macroenvironment is a little tough right now. But the way I see it, a lot of the progress you guys are making on your embedded products is being offset by the declines in your legacy businesses and as the mix is shifting to your embedded products, gross margins are sort of holding around that 30% level, but you're not really able to reduce costs. So sales are finding it tough to grow, right? But that offset, gross margins are not moving up that much. And you are now going to hold OpEx steady also. So I'm just trying to understand, what are we missing here that can help AMD be a more sustainably profitable company?",146,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

So let me try and then Devinder can add, if he has some comments. So I think what you have to do is take a step back and look at overall the progress in year 2015 from a foundation standpoint and then what we hope to accomplish in '16 and forward. I think the most important message around sustainable profitability for AMD is around our product and technology roadmap and ensuring that we grow share in our target markets. So that is certainly the goal. I think if you look at some of the progress that we made in the second half of '15, we have seen a -- some stabilization in our Computing and Graphics business and actually, a return to some sequential growth. As we go forward into 2016, we certainly have to continue that momentum in both our client compute as well as our Graphics business in terms of gaining profitable unit market share. And then as we go forward, we have our data center strategy as well as our semi-custom and new markets that will bring additional opportunity. So from a product standpoint, it is about getting our technology out there. And I think we will enter 2016 with the strongest product portfolio we've had in a long time and we need to continue to work with our customers, design opportunities and moving the platforms into production as we go through the year 2016.",240,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

If I can add, Lisa, I think the other thing that I would add is, if you look at the couple of areas that Lisa mentioned, data center in particular, while also the embedded space as we talked about in our financial Analyst Day in May, those are businesses that command higher gross margins. So Vivek, to your point about the gross margins, I think in longer term, with that business kicking in, in 2017, we believe that we can get closer to the longer-term model. 2016, we've guided to operating -- I mean, free cash flow positive from an operation standpoint. And as we continue to manage the costs as you said, especially on the OpEx side of the house, improving the gross margin, in and of itself, obviously benefits the bottom line and that's kind of heading towards the longer-term model we outlined at the Analyst Day that we had in May of 2015.",157,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Why don't I start and again, Devinder can add. So overall, if you look at PCs, I think we'll have to wait until the numbers come out. But we believe we have gained a bit of share in Q4. I think if you look at the driving factors behind that, Stacy, there were a couple of factors. In 2015, I think we did a concerted effort to clean up some of our channel inventory both on the OEM side as well as in the DIY channel. So that factor will be gone in '15 relative to 2016. I think if you look at the product roadmap, I think the product roadmap is stronger. I think if you look at our commercial business, that is also stronger, so it's leading to a stronger product mix. So those are the key factors. Now relative to the Q1 guidance, I'll make a comment about Q1 guidance overall. Our Q1 guidance includes obviously, both the Computing and Graphics and the Enterprise embedded and semi-custom business. The semi-custom business is historically significantly lower in the first quarter of the year. If you look at the past couple of years, it's been the case because you're coming off of a strong holiday season. So I would say that, that has to be factored into that guidance. And then if you look at the Computing and Graphics business, I think what we're seeing is very consistent with what's out there in the market and we believe in that market, that sort of market conditions, we can gain share.",263,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I guess, relative to some lower operating spending that you guys are doing as a company, maybe Lisa you could lay out some priorities for how you're going to roll out these products. I guess particularly, I'm looking at how you balance semi-custom versus discrete GPU. How you balance Enterprise CPUs versus APUs when you roll out Zen. It seems like quite a bit to take on given the lower spending levels of the business at a whole, and I'm just wondering how you're prioritizing that versus the guidance for the year.",125,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So Matt, I think maybe a couple of comments. I will say that I am pleased with the execution on engineering that we have accomplished over the last 12 months. I think we have passed some significant hurdles. The transition to FinFET for us was very, very critical across our businesses. And I feel good about the state of the progress there. As a result, as it reflects on 2016 spending, I think, Devinder commented earlier, but I would say, that's why we're giving ourselves a range in the OpEx from $320 million to $340 million. And we are being prudent in where we spend. However, clearly, there is a significant focus on discrete Graphics and what we can do in that space. I think we're very excited about the momentum around virtual reality and the momentum in gaming. And we think that, that's a very good market for us. I think relative to our CPU competitiveness and regaining competitiveness there, that is a very key priority as well. So Zen across both our clients computing as well as our server market is our priority. Relative -- the good thing about our semi-custom business is it does rely on customer investments to customize the roadmap.

So if you look overall at our business, yes, we are projecting full-year revenue growth 2016 compared to 2015. And so we would have to have some significant growth as we go into the second half of the year. If you -- independent of any new design, the semi-custom business naturally is significantly higher in the second half than in the first half, especially third quarter. It's kind of a peak for the business as we go into the holiday season. And we continue to see that phenomena as our customers are giving us their forecasts. We expect the base semi-custom business or the base game consoles to continue unit growth in 2016 versus 2015. There will be some modest ASP decline with that, and then we expect to layer over it some new semi-custom revenue starting in the second half of the year. So from what we see obviously, a lot of things have to happen, but the semi-custom business is one that we've been able to predict pretty well given the customer long-term forecasts.

So on the IP monetization strategy, we will continue to update that quarterly as we go through the process. I think we have had a good -- really a good discussion around where to go there. I think there are several different avenues that we believe our IP will be valuable. I think on the straight patent side, we've said before, we have 10,000 patents that are over a substantive number of technical areas, including Graphics and microprocessors and other semiconductor patents. Those can certainly be licensed or in some cases there may be sales. However, another area that we think has a lot of potential is the area of technology licensing where we can help partners accomplish their objectives with both patents and know-how.

So let me give you some more color on the compares which might help. So on the base EESC business, if you were to look at product revenues of semi-custom, game console SoCs, they were actually up a bit. So overall units were up double-digit percentage. ASP declined, but less than that and so product revenue was up. What you saw as segment decline was actually legacy revenue from server and embedded. And if you remember, we have some legacy revenue based on some of the older Opteron products that we continue to sell. And that has seen a drop off as well as our DCSS or SeaMicro business was there in 2014 that we exited in 2015. So that was the year-on-year decline that was there. And then I think as you go forward to 2016, I'm not being that specific about the base business. But I will say, I think units will be up and we'll have to see exactly how much up, and as the markets go.

And I guess, piggybacking off that to an earlier question this time for Devinder on the gross margin side. And correct me if I'm wrong here, but what I heard as to the answer to the earlier question as to why you're not guiding for the full year gross margin was partially because the unknown mix dynamic in revenues. To the extent that's true, does that imply that the gross margin delta between the Computing and Graphics group, and the EESC group, even with the new ramps in semi-custom is likely to remain as wide as it has in the last year or so?",108,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

And then, obviously, on the CG side, you've heard us talk about Graphics and Computing new products kicking in. And so -- and from my standpoint, I want to see how it unfolds in terms of the mix of product, mix of the business before getting into the gross margin.

Okay, so Chris, the -- if you look at the semi-custom cycle and again, these cycles are hard to predict. Through this year, through the end of '15, the game console units are far ahead of the previous cycle. So on the order of 20 million units ahead of the previous cycle. When you look at the significant price points, I would say they are sub $300 price points that start accelerating demand, and you saw some of that this holiday season. So that had some impact. When you -- your question overall in terms of acceleration, I think again, the game console guys know how to do this cost reduction and they've done it very well.

Our strategy to improve our business by gaining share in the graphics and PC markets, growing our semi-custom business and expanding into the data center market is progressing as planned. First quarter revenue decreased in line with expectations to $832 million, driven largely by an anticipated reduction in semi-custom shipments.
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment. Against the backdrop of one of the largest sequential Q4 to Q1 declines in the PC industry and ongoing softness in the Chinese PC market, we continue to execute our multi-quarter plan to improve the financial performance of this part of our business. Revenue decreased 2% sequentially as improved notebook processor, desktop CPU and professional graphic sales offset declines for our other PC products.
We reduced our operating loss from the prior quarter, outperformed the PC market and believe we regained processor and GPU share. Importantly, we accomplished this while maintaining our disciplined approach to managing inventory in the quarter as our inventories with MNCs and downstream channel partners were flat to slightly down sequentially.
We had our second straight quarter of double-digit sequential percentage growth in mobile APU sales. We began shipping our seventh generation Bristol Ridge APUs in March and have secured new design wins that continue our expansion into more premium notebook offerings, including HP's new ENVY x360 convertible notebook. Compared to our previous generation 15-watt APU mobile offering, Bristol Ridge delivered a 20% improvement in our already industry-leading graphics performance and up to 20% CPU performance uplift.
In Graphics, we delivered a strong sequential double-digit percentage increase in desktop discrete unit shipments largely driven by increased sales of our Radeon 300 Series GPUs in the channel. Our investments in graphics and our focus on creating industry-leading drivers and software are starting to pay off. We have delivered 7 new graphics drivers releases in the first quarter alone, not only improving the performance and user experience of our GPUs, but also adding support for our new AAA game titles and features like our innovative XConnect external GPU technology. We expect to grow our investment in graphics throughout the year as we further update our graphics software and extend our leadership in DirectX 12 gaming and VR.
We believe VR will be a key long-term demand driver for AMD across both our consumer and professional graphics offerings, especially as content creators require more powerful GPUs to create fully immersive VR experiences. To capitalize on this trend, I am proud to share that we plan to launch the industry's most powerful platform for VR creation and consumption at the end of this month when we introduce the $1,500 Radeon Pro Duo. We remain on track to introduce our new 14-nanometer FinFET-based Polaris GPUs midyear. Polaris delivers double the performance per watt of our current mainstream offerings, which we believe provides us with significant opportunities to gain share.
Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue declined 24% sequentially due to lower semi-custom sales. Based on our current visibility, we expect semi-custom unit shipments and revenue to grow on an annual basis based on strong demand for game consoles and the ramp of our previously announced new business in the second half of the year.
In embedded, we secured new designs across our target markets. Highlights from the quarter include our first significant CPU design win with one of the leading network infrastructure providers. I am also pleased to share that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to reestablish our presence in the data center market as we successfully passed several key milestones related to our next-generation Zen-based server processor. The Zen silicon running in our bring-up labs is meeting our expectations, and priority customer sampling is on track to begin this quarter in advance of data center system availability in 2017. 
Our EESC results in the quarter also benefited from the latest step in our strategic IP monetization efforts. As we've disclosed earlier today, we have licensed high-performance microprocessor technologies to a newly created JV we formed with THATIC. The JV will develop SoCs tailored to the Chinese server market. The $293 million licensing agreement is a great example of how our IP monetization efforts can accelerate the adoption of AMD technologies in key markets while also strengthening our balance sheet and financial results. Today's announcement is a key part of our overall strategy to reenter the data center market, with the JV providing AMD with a differentiated approach to gain share in the fastest-growing regional server market.
In closing, we're making steady progress on the clear strategy we have developed to return AMD to growth and profitability through delivering great products. We are executing well to our product and technology road maps, including the introduction of our 7th Generation APUs, our midyear launch of new Polaris GPUs and our future Zen-based processors. As we enter into the second quarter, we see strong demand for our semi-custom and graphics products, which we believe will lead to stronger-than-seasonal sequential revenue growth.
For the full year, we are confident that our product portfolio and business execution can further strengthen our financial results and enable us to grow annual revenue and return to non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. Longer term, we expect the strong customer interest in AMD's data center offerings will result in new design wins that can deliver profitable revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.

From a financial perspective, the first quarter came in as expected. We continued funding our road map products and also made progress on our IP monetization strategy with the execution of a licensing agreement that is expected to generate $293 million of cash before tax contingent upon achieving certain milestones.
Let me review the results for the first quarter. As a reminder, our first fiscal quarter was a 13-week quarter. Revenue was $832 million, down 13% sequentially driven primarily by lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. The year-over-year decline was 19% due primarily to lower sales of semi-custom SoCs and client notebook processors. Gross margin was 32%, a 2 percentage point improvement from the prior quarter due primarily to a more favorable product mix and a mix of revenue between the business segments.
Operating expenses were $332 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter primarily due to increased R&D expenses related to new products partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. Operating expenses were $12 million higher than guided primarily due to the timing of mass and hardware for our new products and some incremental investments in graphics. Operating loss was $55 million, and net loss was $96 million with loss per share of $0.12 calculated using 793 million shares. We recognized a $7 million licensing gain associated with our IP monetization efforts in the quarter.
Net interest, other expense and taxes were $41 million in the quarter, down from $53 million in the prior quarter primarily due to a $13 million tax settlement in Q4 2015, which was included in the GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $22 million compared to negative $5 million in the prior quarter.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $460 million, down 2% from the prior quarter primarily due to lower desktop processor sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $70 million compared to $99 million the prior quarter primarily due to the decreased operating expenses.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $372 million, down 24% from the prior quarter primarily due to lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. The operating income of this segment was $16 million, down from $59 million the prior quarter driven primarily by lower revenue and higher R&D expenses partially offset by the IP licensing gain.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $716 million at the end of the quarter, down $69 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to lower sales and higher debt interest payments of $69 million in Q1. Additionally, our Q1 results include $52 million net of taxes received from our IP licensing agreement. Inventory was $675 million, down $3 million from the end of the prior quarter.
Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the first quarter were $183 million, including a $155 million related to the 2015 WSA amendment taken in Q1 2016. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter, including total borrowings of $230 million on our secured revolving line of credit, unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the first quarter was negative $68 million compared to a positive $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Before providing our outlook for the second quarter, let me provide an update on our ATMP joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics. Earlier this month, NFME shareholders approved the transaction, and we are currently in the final stages of obtaining regulatory approvals and expect to close the transaction this quarter.
Now turning to our outlook, which is based on a 13-week -- 13-fiscal-week quarter. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, driven by a strong demand for our semi-custom and graphics products; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $335 million; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $25 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $45 million, including approximately $3 million of taxes related to the IP licensing gain; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately $950 million, including approximately $320 million related to our ATMP joint venture; inventory to be up slightly from first quarter levels.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect revenue to grow year-over-year, to be non-GAAP operating profitable in the second half of 2016 and to generate positive free cash flow from operations for 2016. Also, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $330 million and $350 million per quarter, IP monetization licensing gain of approximately $52 million with $7 million already recognized in Q1 2016 and capital expenditures of approximately $80 million. For the rest of the full year 2016 outlook, please refer to the written CFO commentary document posted on amd.com.
In closing, we continue to strengthen AMD's core business while leveraging our IP and technology. As we look to the rest of the year, we are focused on introducing compelling new products, regaining market share and improving our financial performance.

And assessing any kind of risk associated with this IP agreement, do you need to get -- do you check in with -- do you tell Intel that this is going on? Did you get clearance from them?

Mark, this is Lisa. Thank you for your question. And regarding the JV that we just announced, yes, we are very excited about it, partnering with THATIC and really focusing on the Chinese market for server processors. What we are licensing in this agreement is microprocessor technologies and System-on-Chip technologies. All the technologies licensed are AMD technologies. So there are no encumbrances from that standpoint. We have closed on the deal, and we are starting execution of the deal. So we've talked about, from a financial standpoint, there's a $293 million licensing payment over a number of years. What we expect is the first payment we'll receive in the first quarter of $50-ish million. And we expect that over the first 2 years that about half of the licensing payments would be paid upon completion of some development milestones. So overall for us, I've talked about IP monetization in a very broad sense. For us, that includes patents as well as technology licensing. This one is very positive for us not just from the standpoint that it leverages our IP, but it also gives us a very key partner in the Chinese market, which we all believe is going to be very, very important for data center growth going forward.

So I think if you look at the business, in particular, as I said even in my prepared remarks, you have gross margin levers. But one of the things that obviously comes into play is the mix of business between the semi-custom business or the EESC business and then the CG business. So that obviously comes in play. As Lisa said, we have the growth with our guidance for revenue in Q2, and it's weighted towards the semi-custom business in addition to the growth that we are seeing in graphics. And that's primarily what's driving the guidance at 31% as compared to where we came in, in Q1 at the 32% level. And then as far as the levels going on from then, I think it partly is a mix of the business overall from a viewpoint of the semi-custom business and other businesses, but also the continuing investment we are making in the road maps as you see from our OpEx guidance for the rest of the year that we want to go ahead and invest in products in graphics and other areas that will help us improve the gross margin and then getting into, later on when the Zen product is introduced, having even higher gross margin compared to where we are today.",221,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So the semi-custom, if you -- just to recap on what we've said about the semi-custom designs in the past, we have a total of 3 design wins that have a lifetime revenue of about, I'd call it, $1.5 billion or greater, and that will come across over the next 3 to 4 years. In addition, we have our current game console business as well.

So they're technologies, not products. The technologies are applicable to both x86 and ARM, but as you know, most of our investments are in x86. And then in terms of other aspects, there are other aspects that are needed to put together a System-on-Chip. So they include things like fabrics and other IP.",65,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And one more, if I could. Just on your -- sorry, in your current quarter, you launched Bristol Ridge in March. So maybe that led to some of the incremental, like, better-than-market unit growth.

If you look at the overall ASPs, actually mobile ASPs were up. Desktop ASPs were down, and that's why we said overall down, but it was quite modest. So if you look overall, I think the ASP trends are about what we would expect. Going into the second quarter and in general, I mean, it depends on the mix and the mix of the product. We are certainly trying to sell further up the stack, but we'll have to see how the exact mix comes out. But there's not a dramatic change in ASPs, if that's what you're asking.",132,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

Probably down, let's call it, high single digits. Certainly, the first quarter started off a bit weaker than any of us would've liked. I would say though in that environment, we still believe that we can gain share in both the compute -- the client compute and the graphics side really as we are transitioning to a new product portfolio on the graphics side. So I think that's a strong driver for us. And then on the client compute side, between our product refresh and also our partnership with OEMs, I think in general OEMs are getting more comfortable using us higher up in the stack. And our A8s, our A10s are commercial-based processors. So we're continuing to work with OEMs to ensure that we get into the right priority platforms, and so that would be our focus even in a down market.",165,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

It is really also the mix going to higher-end graphics driven by VR and driven by AAA gaming and all the things going on there. As it relates to our share, I will say that we certainly have aspirations to regain shares to our historic levels. It will take us some period of time, so it will happen over multiple number of quarters. We're optimistic about the second half of the year, and we think Polaris is positioned well. We are particularly positioning in some of the mainstream segments that are higher volumes so we drive share growth faster, and we'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year.",137,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I know you don't want to get into division by division. But maybe at a high level, as you look at your year-over-year growth, how do you differentiate between what the market is doing and kind of the market share gains that you need to get to that year-over-year growth?",87,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So let me break it up into the 2 segments. When you look at the EESC segment and especially semi-custom, I mean, that's less about a general market and more about what we see in terms of the customer forecast and what they're seeing the market to be. So I think those are, let's call it, fairly well understood by us, and we're very interlocked with our customers. When you talk about the computing and graphics market, I think that's where you get a little bit more how much uncertainty is there with the PC market trends. There's no question that the PC market is weaker than any of us would like. I think from our standpoint though, if you remember the last few quarters and how many times we've talked about inventory normalization and ensuring that we got ourselves into a healthy position relative to our OEM and channel customers. I think we feel that we've done a good job there, and we're now in a place where the consumption is more in line with the selling. So we believe that even in this market, there's enough opportunity for us to gain share, and obviously we have to prove that out over the next couple of quarters. But just given where our business is, where we see the products and where we see the design wins, that's how we see the market right now.",241,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I'm just kind of curious, the IP licensing gains you expect this year, are there any milestones that you need to hit to get that? And as we think about '17, if you hit the milestones in '17, would we expect licensing to grow year-over-year from the JV? At then lastly on the JV, just given that you guys have the opportunity to go into China today and sell your own product, I'm just kind of curious how we should think about $100 of server product in the JV and what that means to you from an economic standpoint versus you just going into China today and selling $100 worth of server product as AMD?",132,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

So look, on the JV licensing payments, so we will expect about half of the licensing revenue to come over the next 2 years, so over 2016 and 2017. Our current forecast for 2016 was at $50-ish million that Devinder mentioned, and it is contingent on several milestones that we believe are on track. To your broader question about why do a JV versus just selling right into servers, look, we're very cognizant of where our share is in servers. So I believe we have the technology to get there, and we will continue to make progress. But given the importance of China and the fact that having a partner who is very much familiar with both the Chinese market from a customer as well as just a technology standpoint I think can only be additive. And there's more than enough server market to go after given where we are, so I think it's an additive deal to our baseline strategy.",165,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And then on the game console side, so clearly VR is going to be a pretty big deal in Q4 with the Sony PS4 VR, and there's been some chatter about obviously maybe a faster refresh for some of the game consoles.

Relative to our current game consoles, those deals were well negotiated at the beginning, and I don't think we will be renegotiating. I think the ASPs and all that stuff are also well understood. Relative to what VR brings and again, not being specific to any particular customer because there's just a lot of speculation out there in the industry, I will say that VR is very exciting not just for game consoles, but for PC gaming, for the headset guys, for the ecosystems. So yes, we believe that graphics becomes much more valuable in this framework, and we will be looking for how to leverage and monetize that across both our semi-custom business as well as our discrete graphics and APU businesses.",131,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Our ongoing focus on diversifying our business model and delivering great products is creating solid market and financial momentum. 
Looking at the second quarter specifically, strong semi-custom demand and better-than-seasonal graphic sales drove a 23% sequential revenue increase and our return to non-GAAP operating profitability. We also recorded our first full quarter licensing gain from our China server JV with THATIC, and improved our balance sheet with cash proceeds from the formation of our ATMP joint venture with NFME. 
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue decreased 5% sequentially, as stronger than seasonal GPU sales were offset by a decline in desktop processor sales. First half 2016 GPU sales increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago as the investments we have been making to develop leadership graphics hardware, software and drivers, combined with new marketing campaigns, are paying off. 
Our strong second quarter graphics performance was capped by the launch of our new Polaris-based RX 480 GPUs at the end of June, which helped contribute to our highest desktop channel GPU shipments since the fourth quarter of 2014. The Radeon RX family resets expectations around the experiences and features gamers now want in a mainstream GPU. We are pleased with the Polaris launch, initial channel sales and OEM design wins. We expect this strong demand to continue and help drive revenue growth in the third quarter with the launch of the RX 470 and RX 460 desktop GPUs and Polaris-based notebooks from our OEM customers. 
We also delivered our third straight quarter of sequential professional graphics revenue growth and believe we gained share driven by increased adoption of FirePro graphics by OEMs as well as several cloud data center GPU compute wins. 
In Client, mobile APU sales increased for the third straight quarter, partially offsetting decreased desktop processor sales led by channel softness in China. Shipments of our recently launched 7th Generation APUs are ramping well and outpacing sales of our 6th Generation APUs at this point in their life cycle. More than 25 new 7th Generation APU systems, including several premium designs, are expected to be widely available in the coming months from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo, providing us with confidence in this part of our business as we enter the seasonally stronger second half of the year. 
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Our 59% sequential revenue increase is the largest since our first full quarter of semi-custom product shipments in 2013. As in the previous 2 years, we expect semi-custom shipments to peak for the year in the third quarter as both Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holidays. Based on strong demand, we believe semi-custom unit shipments and revenue will grow on an annual basis. 
Last quarter at E3, Microsoft announced 2 new members of the Xbox One family powered by AMD. The Xbox One S is the slimmest Xbox console ever and the first to support HDR. The system is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks. Microsoft also announced their next-generation game console codenamed Project Scorpio for the 2017 holidays. Project Scorpio is designed to be fully compatible with existing Xbox One software, while leveraging AMD's leadership gaming technologies to create more immersive 4K and VR gaming experiences. Project Scorpio is one of the semi-custom design wins we communicated previously. 
Our next-generation Zen processor products passed several key milestones in the quarter as well. I'm excited to report that in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next-generation Zen-based processor at COMPUTEX in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs. We are pleased with the performance we are seeing with Zen hardware, which is helping to expand our customer engagements and accelerating design-win momentum across multiple OEM and ODMs. We remain on track for volume shipments of our Zen server CPU in the first half of 2017. 
In closing, over the last 18 months, we have been diligently executing our strategic plan to improve our financial performance by delivering great products, strengthening our customer relationships and simplifying our business. In the past 6 months alone, we released our game-changing Polaris architecture, completed our ATMP JV transaction, announced a JV and IP licensing transaction with THATIC and returned to non-GAAP operating profitability. While we recognize we have more work to do, we believe that based on the ongoing ramps of our semi-custom SoCs, Polaris GPUs and 7th Generation APUs, we can deliver full year revenue growth in 2016 and non-GAAP operating profitability in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on delivering our road map of high-performance products and technologies, including Zen and our next-generation Vega GPU architecture that can drive long-term growth. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance.",833,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The second quarter was a strong quarter punctuated by better-than-expected financial performance, driven by demand for our semi-custom SoCs and the closure of our ATMP joint venture transaction with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, which bolstered our cash position. 
Second quarter revenue was $1.027 billion, up 23% sequentially, driven by higher sales of semi-custom SoCs. The year-over-year revenue increase was 9%, with higher sales in both reportable segments. Gross margin was 31%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of semi-custom SoC sales. 
Operating expenses were $342 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased marketing investments. We also recognized a $26 million licensing gain associated with our JV with THATIC and restructuring credits of $7 million, primarily related to facilities. We are pleased to report operating income of $3 million this quarter. 
Net loss was $40 million, with loss per share of $0.05 calculated using 794 million basic shares in the quarter. We recorded a pretax gain of $150 million related to the ATMP JV transaction, an equity loss of $3 million based on our 15% ownership stake and taxes of $27 million related to the JV transaction. Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $36 million compared to negative $22 million in the prior quarter. 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $435 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. Revenue was up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by higher client load per processor and graphics sales. 
Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $81 million compared to $70 million the prior quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. 
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $592 million, up 59% from the prior quarter and 5% higher than the prior year, driven by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from $16 million in the prior quarter, driven by higher revenue and a $26 million IP licensing gain compared to a licensing gain of $7 million in the first quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $957 million at the end of the quarter, up $241 million from the end of the prior quarter, primarily due to net cash proceeds from the ATMP JV transaction offset by working capital needs in the quarter. 
Inventory was $743 million, up $68 million or 10% from the prior quarter and higher than guided in support of expected higher semi-custom sales in the third quarter. 
In the second quarter, we recorded a $62 million investment on our balance sheet related to our 15% ownership stake in the ATMP JV. 
Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the second quarter was $75 million, and year-to-date, we have purchased $259 million. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.24 billion, flat from the end of the prior quarter and includes total borrowings of $226 million on our secured revolving line of credit. 
Free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $106 million compared to a negative $68 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the inventory build in support of strong second half revenue. 
Now turning to the outlook, which is based on a 13-week fiscal quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue to increase 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by our graphics and semi-custom products, including the ramp of new Semi-Custom business; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million, due to an increase in R&D investments; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $22 million; to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes or other -- and other to be approximately $45 million; cash and cash equivalents to be approximately flat; and inventory to be approximately $700 million; and lastly, for the full year 2016, we expect low single-digit revenue growth year-over-year. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we made this quarter. We launched exciting, new products in the second quarter with more expected to come to help drive strong revenue growth and improved financial performance in the third quarter. We recognize there is a lot more work to be done to return AMD to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation and look forward to continuing our progress over the coming quarters.

This is Lisa. Let me start with that. So our Semi-Custom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season. We expect the seasonality of semi-custom to be similar to prior years, where we'll see a peak in the third quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter. And we will see the new business layer in starting in the third quarter, but I don't expect that to change the seasonality pattern.

You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you're going after there, where you see the opportunities? It seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that's x86 captive for you guys to go after. So I'd just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from.",114,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color of how we see it. First of all, look, that is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it's actually coming up very well. We've demoed both desktop systems and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers' labs. I would say, as the progress of Zen is -- goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased, and so we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline as we go into the third quarter in more widespread availability. Our view is Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud, I think that's certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly -- fit well for sort of the performance areas that we're targeting. I think Enterprise is also, again, very much a target area for Zen. What we're looking for, again, is ensuring that we have a very high-quality launch, and so we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvements that we expect. But as I said, overall, it's going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.",256,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I guess another question on Zen, more in the PC market because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server, but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches?

So we have been very focused on the server launch for the first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that. In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of '17. We may shift some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness. But again, if I look overall at what we're trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well, and so that's where we would focus on desktop. You should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well.

Maybe I'll start and then see if Devinder would like to add up -- add to it. So, look, our -- when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter. So we've been pleased with how it played out. Certainly, our second quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance. Overall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EESC to both grow for the year. I think the Semi-Custom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect. So the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris and as we launch broader availability across the product line as well as the 7th Generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday.

So if you look at it overall, the -- our OEM customers have adopted our technologies. So we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook. We are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past 5 or 6 quarters, so that's been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don't believe it's a sell-in phenomenon. Actually, it's consumption share that we see increasing.

I'd kind of like to get your view on the news earlier this week around SoftBank and ARM. You're sort of in a unique position because you're both kind of a partner with ARM as an ARM licensee, but if you look at your custom silicon business, especially on the x86 architecture, you could make the argument that you're a little bit of a competitor as well.

Well, I think it's a very interesting deal, the ARM SoftBank deal. I think we have a lot of respect for ARM. They are a close partner. I'm not sure we would call them a competitor. Overall, they are a partner. As it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high-performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphics side, is very unique. And in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you're talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing, and it's so it's an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products. And that's, in general, the way we think about IP monetization is we have a set of products that is very important to our business model but our IP can go further than our product -- than our products themselves.

We have seen some positive signals and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week. And then we saw a little bit of pickup in consumption in June from our OEM customers. But again, that was compared to, I'd call it a soft April, May. Our view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that's our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products -- of the graphics products we've talked about as they ramp in the second half of that year.

So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3, which is where we were in Q2.

We will look for opportunities to ensure that we are strategically placing the big bets in R&D, both on the CPU and the GPU side. For example, this year, we have ramped up our investments on the graphics side with the formation of the Radeon Technologies Group and what we're doing in both hardware and software, very significant investments, and similarly, on the CPU side as well.

Our strong third quarter results highlight the progress we have made across AMD this past year as we improve our financial performance by delivering great products. Third quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 27% sequentially and 23% from the year-ago period, driven by upside demand for our graphics products and record semi-custom sales. 
In addition to the significant revenue growth, we also achieved several financial and operational milestones in the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet and improved our P&L through a series of capital markets transactions that reprofiled and reduced our debt. We also signed a strategic amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES that provides sourcing flexibility and financial predictability. Most importantly, we delivered non-GAAP net income in the quarter based on strong execution of our product road map and growing momentum across our business.
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we had solid growth in the quarter. Revenue increased 9% sequentially and 11% from the year-ago period, driven by improved sales of mobile APUs and discrete GPUs. Mobile processor revenue and unit shipments increased for the fourth straight quarter as seventh-generation APU shipments continued ramping, highlighted by the launch of our   new Pro series APUs earlier this month with HP. 
Customer and partner excitement for our Zen-based desktop product, Summit Ridge, is growing as we successfully passed several key engineering and design win milestones in the quarter. We provided our first competitive performance preview of Summit Ridge in the quarter and believe we will have a very competitive offering for the $4 billion high-performance desktop processor market. We are working closely with our infrastructure partners and customers in preparation for the launch in early 2017. 
In graphics, we had a very strong quarter with discrete GPU revenue and unit shipments growing by double-digit percentages sequentially and year-over-year. The launch of our expanded family of Polaris desktop GPUs and our first full quarter of RX 480 sales drove our highest quarterly channel GPU revenue and ASPs since early 2014. Radeon RX GPUs now account for more than 50% of our channel GPU revenue. Polaris GPUs continued to gain traction based on their leadership performance in VR and on the rapidly expanding number of software titles that feature the latest generation of APIs like DirectX 12 and Vulkan. 
Our progress in the quarter was punctuated by Oculus, announcing a limited-edition Oculus-ready PC powered by an AMD FX processor and Radeon RX 470 GPU. That brings the cost of entry for VR-ready system down to $500 for the first time. This is a meaningful milestone for consumers, and I'm excited that AMD is enabling the ecosystem and driving broader adoption of VR by making premium experiences available at such an attractive price point.
We also delivered our fourth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth for our professional graphics products. In addition to solid workstation sales growth, we expanded our presence in the server GPU market as HP announced availability of multiple Radeon options across their traditional and Blade server offering.
And just last week, we announced a collaboration with Alibaba Cloud, China's largest cloud provider, to deploy Radeon Pro server GPUs across their data centers to expand the scale and services of their global cloud offering. We now have material server GPU engagements with multiple cloud data center providers, demonstrating that our strategy to grow our presence in this profitable market by delivering superior performance with Radeon Pro hardware in conjunction with industry standard programming tools and APIs is beginning to pay off.
Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 41% sequentially and 31% from the year-ago period, driven by record semi-custom sales, which included the ramp of 3 new FinFET-based products powering the Xbox One S, updated PlayStation 4 and our new design win in the Sony PlayStation 4 Pro. We are on track to grow semi-custom unit shipments and revenue for the third straight year, demonstrating our leadership in high-performance gaming technologies for the very successful game console market. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be down seasonally as we transition from our annual semi-custom sales peak in the third quarter. 
Our embedded product sales grew sequentially as our newer design wins reach production. In server, our Zen-based high performance processor remains on track for introduction in the first half of 2017. We successfully passed several silicon and platform technical milestones in the quarter and have secured multiple new design wins across OEMs, enterprise and cloud providers.
In closing, as I complete my second year as CEO of AMD, I am pleased with the solid progress we have made across the company on multiple operational, product and financial fronts. We are executing our long-term strategy and the set of near-term priorities that I believe provide AMD with significant opportunities over the next 18 to 24 months to drive top line revenue growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation. We have strengthened the core of the company by clearly defining the markets where we have technology and expertise to win; bringing a laser focus to our product execution around our graphics and microprocessor road map; creating deeper, more lasting relationships with strategic customers; monetizing our assets and valuable IT with 2 joint ventures in China; and reengineering our balance sheet to increase our cash balance and reduce debt. I want to thank the thousands of AMDers whose determination this past year has allowed us to put in place the financial and operational foundation to drive growth and profitability.
In 2017, with Zen and Vega, we are focused on delivering our strongest product portfolio in over a decade capable of unlocking multiple growth pillars for our business across the data center, gaming and high performance graphics and PC markets. I am proud of what we have accomplished, and I believe that the best is yet to come.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance.",1008,8.0,5.0,0.9444444444444444,0.5
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2016",2016-10-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2582.0,1059450.0,44394140.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and a very good afternoon to everyone. In the third quarter, we achieved another milestone in our progress as we return to non-GAAP net income profitability. The third quarter financial performance was driven by strong demand for our semi-custom SoCs, higher graphics revenue and positive free cash flow. We executed a series of capital markets transactions that have significantly improved our balance sheet and termed that profile and will reduce interest expense beginning in Q4. We also finalized a long-term Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 27% sequentially, driven by higher sales of our record semi-custom SoCs and higher graphics processor sales. The year-over-year revenue increased 23%, driven by higher sales of our semi-custom SoCs, client mobile processors and graphics processors. Non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, flat from the prior quarter, driven by a richer mix of PC and graphics products offsetting lower margin semi-custom products. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $353 million, up $11 million from the prior quarter due to increased R&D investment. 
We recognized $24 million of net licensing gains associated with our server JV with THATIC. Non-GAAP operating income was $70 million this quarter, up $67 million from the prior quarter. Third quarter other net expense was $63 million, mostly consisting of a $61 million loss related to debt retirement. The equity loss in the ATMP JV was $5 million based on a 15% JV ownership stake. 
Non-GAAP net income was $27 million with earnings per share of $0.03. Non-GAAP EPS was calculated using 865 million diluted shares of common stock, which includes 12 million shares associated with the equity offering that closed late in the third quarter. Included in our GAAP operating loss and GAAP net loss is a $340 million charge associated with our sixth amendment to the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million compared to $36 million in the prior quarter. 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $472 million, up 9% from the prior quarter and up 11% year-over-year primarily due to increased sales of GPUs and client mobile APUs. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $66 million compared to $81 million the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $835 million, up 41% from the prior quarter and 31% higher year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $136 million, up from $84 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $301 million from the end of the prior quarter, including $274 million remaining from the proceeds of our capital markets transactions. Excluding this amount, the cash was $984 million as compared to $957 million last quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $20 million in the third quarter.
Inventory was $772 million, up $29 million or 4% from the end of the prior quarter in support of holiday season GPU and semi-custom product sales expectations in the first part of the fourth quarter. Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the third quarter were $168 million, and we continue to expect overall wafer purchases of approximately $650 million in 2016, including $155 million purchased in early 2016 as part of the sixth amendment to the WSA.
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter due to our significant debt reduction efforts. During the third quarter, we raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock, which includes the exercise of an underwriters' option to purchase 15% or $90 million of additional common stock and the issuance of $700 million in 2 1/8% convertible notes due in 2026. We used the majority of these funds to redeem outstanding term debt to cash tender offers, and we paid off the outstanding ABL balance of $226 million.
In addition, early in the fourth quarter, another $105 million of convertible notes were issued as part of the exercise of an underwriters' option, bringing the total principal amount of the 2026 convertible notes to $805 million. We also redeemed the remaining principal debt balance of $208 million of the 2020 premium note, which was our most expensive debt. This debt has now been fully paid off.
The debt reductions and issuance of the new convertible notes due 2026 that occurred in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter will result in approximately $55 million of annualized cash interest savings beginning in the fourth quarter. Please refer to today's CFO written commentary for further details of the capital markets transactions and debt on the balance sheet.
Free cash flow in the third quarter was a positive $20 million compared to a negative $106 million in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased revenue, improvement in working capital and a reduction in capital expenditures.
Now turning to our fourth quarter 2016 outlook, a 14 fiscal week quarter as it has an extra week. We expect revenue to decrease 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by a seasonal decline in our semi-custom business and an improvement in our CG business. Revenue at the midpoint of guidance would be up 12% year-over-year; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 32%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million; IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $25 million; to maintain non-GAAP operating profitability; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $32 million; cash and cash equivalents to be up, in line with our guidance of ending 2016 with positive free cash flow, excluding cash from capital market transactions and the net proceeds from the ATMP JV; inventory to be down to approximately $660 million; basic share count to be approximately 930 million, including 115 million shares related to the third quarter equity issuance; and we now expect full year revenue growth to be up approximately 6% from 2015 based on the midpoint of fourth quarter revenue guidance.
In closing, we are very pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter. With focused execution, we continue to build a solid financial foundation for the company. In just the last 3 months alone, we achieved non-GAAP net income profitability, amended the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES across multiple years and deleveraged and derisked the balance sheet with our capital markets transactions such that, over the next 5 years, there is less than $200 million of term debt due. We look forward to continued execution and further improving our financial performance.

I figured I would ask a couple things about Zen since that's been one of the things that's most topical in my conversations with investors. Lisa, you talked about, in your prepared remarks there, multiple OEM engagements and design wins for desktop and also the same on server. Maybe you could do a little bit to expand upon those, I guess, the timing of launch of each and in particular, in the server market, the focus whether that be enterprise or whether that be cloud-based.",94,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Matt, thanks for your question, and as you said, it's been a very busy quarter for us. As it relates to Zen, we are on track to launch in the first half of the year for both our desktops and our servers. The desktop launch will go first, and it is on track for the first quarter. And then the server launch will go in the second quarter. We've had a wide amount of sampling that's gone on in the third quarter. We have multiple customers on both the PC side as well as the server side, who have working hardware now in their labs. They're bringing up their platforms and software, and we're very pleased with how smoothly it's coming up actually. So you asked specifically about the server side. Our focus on servers is really across the OEM business, including enterprise as well as the cloud data centers. And I think the key for us is we're getting a lot of interest from our partners, and we continue to work with them to bring up their systems. But I think we are optimistic about where we are in the Zen bring-up and the Zen launch cycle.",200,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And then, I guess, as a follow-up there in the server market, I think, obviously, your GPU primary competitor has had some very stellar traction with server acceleration around GPUs. And you highlighted in the prepared remarks some wins and engagements that you've had on Polaris and I assume, on Vega for server acceleration. Maybe you could expand upon -- on that commentary a bit, what you're investing there, how the GPUOpen or the openCL environment is developing relative to the CUDA environment in server acceleration. And just what proportion of your GPU business could be driven by that server opportunity in the long term? Any commentary there will be great.",114,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So let's talk on overall about our graphics business. So when you look at our graphics business, certainly, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made on the consumer side with Polaris, but we've also mentioned that we've made good progress on the professional graphics side, including both workstations as well as server GPUs. I think the market is certainly very receptive to growth in the server GPU area. I was just at the Alibaba Cloud Computing Conference last week where we announced our collaboration with them. They're actually using parts that are pre-Polaris and pre-Vega, so we were demoing a GPU-based cloud server based on some of our FirePro technology using hardware-based virtualization. And I think the main feedback that we've gotten from them as well as multiple other cloud engagements is the hardware looks very good. We're working with them on sort of the overall infrastructure and software bring that up, and we believe that the products are very competitive in this market. And the market is nice because it's certainly margin accretive to the consumer side of the business. So we do expect, as we bring out Vega in the first half of 2017, that, that will certainly strengthen the product portfolio. But there is a lot of interest in the cloud space around what we're doing with Radeon Pro and on the server GPU side.",231,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So again, I think on the Alibaba deployment, it is the beginning of what we expect to be a long-term collaboration. So the work today is being done on a pre-Polaris base, but we do expect that, that will upgrade as we go forward. I think the key is there are many, many applications, but what we're starting from is a GPU-based cloud server application. So in virtualized environments, you can imagine cloud gaming or remote workstation-type environments, which need a lot of graphics horsepower as well as virtual desktop environments. And I think, as we go forward, certainly, we view the opportunity to expand that into a broader set of workloads as well as obviously on the CPU side as well. So I think, overall, we think the cloud is a very important market for us to focus on, on both the GPU and the CPU side, and we're ramping up our efforts there.",157,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Last night, Tesla announced that it was using NVIDIA for their self-driving car, but on the conference call, Elon Musk, I think the expression he is -- was that it was a tight decision between NVIDIA and AMD, which suggests that you're farther along in solutions for deep learning and neural networking and -- than most, including myself, thought. And so I was wondering if -- can you talk about your efforts in deep learning and artificial intelligence? How big is that business now? Do you have anything in that business now? And how do you grow that going forward?",107,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So look, there is a lot of interest in the deep learning space overall, and certainly, our GPUs are very applicable to that space. So when we look at competitiveness and all that stuff, we think we can be very competitive there. We will be talking more about our strategy in the coming quarters, so maybe let me refer to that, Mark. But I think, suffice it to say, I think we look at GPUs as overall secular growth, whether you're talking about consumer, professional workstations, server GPUs or any of this machine learning area.

You're kind of characterizing it as seasonal. I kind of know the trappings of talking about normal seasonal because there's so much variance around it. But it does seem like in prior quarters where you had a 14th week, that extra week actually did help revenue a little bit. So I'm just kind of curious within the context of the December quarter guidance, how you're thinking about that extra week both on the revenue line and on expenses.",89,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

I think, if you look at the 14 week quarter, I think, John, you're right. It depends upon many factors. Our 14 week quarter is in the Q4 time frame, which is this quarter we are in. On the revenue side, I would say, looking at it overall, there's not much of an impact as the extra week falls during the holiday season when a large portion of our operations and our customers are in shut-down mode. There is an impact on the expense side, but that's already contemplated within the guidance of OpEx that I gave at the $350 million due to the extra week.",107,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

And then, Lisa, a little bit longer term. I mean, over the last kind of several quarters, you've been somewhat forced to try to manage profitability level to that break-even line given the lack of revenue growth. But now that you're sort of on this path of more sustainable revenue growth, I'm just kind of curious, as you think about R&D specifically, how should we think about kind of your desire to want to invest at higher rates as revenue begins to grow from these levels? Because, clearly, as Mark talked about on the last question, you've got a lot of potential new areas and opportunities to go after. Can you give us a sense as to what -- sort of to what degree you think you've been underinvesting in R&D and how we should think about R&D investments over the next several quarters as revenue growth kind of resumes?",153,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I think it's fair to say that we've been very prudent in how we've invested overall. If you look at our operating expenses, '16 to '15, although we've been relatively flat overall, we've actually increased R&D relative to other elements of the P&L. But as we see revenue growth and as we've seen progress over the last couple of quarters, I think you've also seen us increase our R&D spend. I think there are several areas that we see as very large opportunities, and we talked about some of the graphics area in the previous question with Mark. I also think in the data center, I mean, there's a large opportunity for us on the CPU side as Zen fully comes to market. So I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&D as our revenue grows, but we're still going to be very prudent with how we do that. And I think the key metric there in terms of being net income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we're going to continue to manage every diligently.",204,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Look, we're very happy with how Polaris ramped in Q3. The customer demand across all geographies was very strong. Q3 was primarily a channel-based quarter, so with our add-in board partners and -- as some of you noted, in the early part of Q3, we actually had some supply constraints given the customer demand. We did catch up towards the end of the quarter, so very pleased with how that's ramped. I think it's a very competitive market. We've leaned into VR, and we've leaned into sort of our work with DX12. And I think you can see in some of the benchmarks that we're doing very well there. As we go into Q4, in addition to the channel partners continuing to ramp, you should expect some OEMs launching in Q4 more broadly.

So let me start with that. I think, relative to our second sourcing or our supply sourcing flexibility, I think we make it, on a product-by-product basis, based on where we are in the business. So we will have multiple products in 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer that will be sourced across foundries. And similarly, when we talked about the Wafer Supply Agreement, we mentioned 7-nanometer as being a key target node for that.

And how should we think about the size of the benefit that you're going to get from initial channel stocking there?",99,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So Chris, I think the game console shouldn't be really looked at on a quarterly level when you're looking at sell-in and sell-out because it's so different from the other markets. I would say, on an annual basis, everything trues up. And the thought process is, in Q2 and Q3, there is a bit of build ahead as the customers are really building for the holiday season. And the customers do so much of their business in the last 6 weeks of the year. That's when all the inventory is green. So my view is that, if you look on the annual basis, the game console business is doing quite well, and so we expect units to be up. We expect revenue for the business to be up for us. And the quarterly transitions are less important. It's more that we want to ensure that we're meeting our customers' build cycles so that they get to build everything that they want and get it into their channels. But from my standpoint, I think it's a very well-managed system.",179,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6
