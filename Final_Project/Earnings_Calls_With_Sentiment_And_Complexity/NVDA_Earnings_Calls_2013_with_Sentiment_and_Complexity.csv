With that, let's begin. We are pleased to report a record year for the company. Despite significant headwinds, we achieved record annual revenues and gross margins for fiscal year 2013. Excluding chipset revenue, which we exited, we grew our GPU business 8% last year and for the third consecutive year. 
We increased overall GPU market share from 53% to 65%, and our notebook share by almost 20 percentage points from 47% to 66%. 
Tegra, Tesla and notebook GPUs all achieved record revenue. We invested in new growth products that are now sampling including Tegra 4, i500 4G/LTE modem, Project Shield and GRID, while controlling OpEx at target for the year. 
This year, we transitioned Kepler across our GPU businesses. Gaming was a key area to benefit. Massively multiplayer games or MMOs continue to drive a robust PC gaming market. Worldwide MMO revenues grew 21% last year to $13 billion according to market research firm, Newzoo, and GeForce is the gamers' choice of GPU by a margin of almost 2:1 according to gamers on Steam. Our notebook share is near a record high. Kepler is also starting to shift into Quadro, with revenues up 10% this quarter. 
With Tesla, we are leveraging GPUs beyond graphics into massively parallel processing and supercomputers. 
Just 3 years after we entered the market, 50 of the world's top 500 fastest computers are now powered by NVIDIA GPUs, including the fastest and the most energy-efficient. 
We introduced NVIDIA GRID visual computing appliances. GRID is a first of its kind graphic system that serves graphics-intensive applications to many concurrent users at once. One of the major applications is cloud gaming. More than a dozen cloud gaming trials are up and running around the world, and others will be announced by more telcos as the year progresses. 
At CES, we announced Tegra 4, the world's fastest mobile processor. It is the first 4-PLUS-1 quad-core A15 processor with an extra energy-saving core and 72 graphics cores compared with Tegra 3's 12 cores. It delivers the world's fastest web browsing performance and new, always-on, high-dynamic range computational photography. At this point in time, we already have more design wins with Tegra 4 than we had in total with Tegra 3. 
We see significant new growth opportunities in the LTE connected device market, which is projected to be 150 million units in 2013, and growing at 50% a year. We are now sampling our i500 4G/LTE multiband, multimode voice and data modem. 
More efficient and 40% the size of conventional modems, i500 delivers 4x the processing capability of its predecessor. 
This is the first result of our Icera acquisition. Icera is the first company to successfully create and commercialize a software defined radio modem and has been building modems since 2006. 
And we announced Project Shield, an NVIDIA-branded open platform and gaming device. A pure Android device connected to the Google Play store and TegraZone, Project Shield is able to play any Android application and game, and can also stream PC games from a nearby GeForce GTX PC. 
Powered by a Tegra 4 processor, Project Shield integrates a 5-inch retinal display, a console grate game controller and a first mobile-tuned port base reflex speakers. We believe Shield will be attractive to modern gamers who want to play on open platforms and have great gaming experiences, while unfettered to their TVs or PCs. 
Shield will enhance the strategic position of Tegra. Besides highlighting the capabilities of Tegra, Shield will attract great games to TegraZone, which can then be enjoyed on every Tegra-powered device. 
TegraZone has already been downloaded 6 million times. 
Looking forward, our company is shifting gears to accelerate. Our GPU business remains strong, while we extend our visual computing technology leadership. Tegra 4 is ramping into production for mobile devices this year, while growing into embedded devices such as cars and gaming devices. We will engage the LTE-connected devices market aggressively this year. And we will add new system products incorporating our processors and software, the NVIDIA GRID graphics appliance and Shield Android gaming device. 
We are excited by the investments we're making into these very large markets, where our expertise in visual computing can make unique contributions. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen.",1029,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2013",2013-02-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3888.0,415974.0,19623807.0,Presenter Speech,Karen Burns,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. NVIDIA had record revenue for the year of $4.3 billion, up 7% from fiscal 2012. At the start of the year, we set out a number of financial objectives. It's satisfying to note that we achieved many of them. Among these goals were the following: gain share and our GPU business. 
Driven by the introduction of our new Kepler architecture, we gained share in both desktop and notebook, and delivered record revenue for our notebook products. 
Grow Tegra revenue at least 50%. Revenue for Tegra products sold into smartphones and tablets increased by $181 million to a record $541 million, up 50% year-on-year. Grow Quadro and Tesla revenue. Revenue for Tesla products increased 37% year-on-year as we shift our first Kepler products, Tesla K10 in Q3, and Tesla K20 in Q4. 
Quadro revenue was down roughly 6% year-on-year. In October, we shipped Quadro K5000, our first Kepler-based Quadro product in limited volume. 
This year, we will launch Kepler for Quadro in volume, top to bottom, into the professional market. We expect Kepler for both Quadro and Tesla to do very well. 
Exit the year with gross margin of approximately 52%. We exceeded our target, exiting Q4 with a gross margin of 52.9% and non-GAAP at 53.2%. 
We had record gross margin for the full year with GAAP gross margin at 52%, up 60 basis points from the previous year and non-GAAP gross margin of 52.3%, up 40 basis points. 
Manage our OpEx investment at approximately $1.56 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.4 billion for non-GAAP. 
GAAP OpEx was $1.58 billion, up $20 million from our original expectations. This was due to a $20 million expense for corporate donation made in the second quarter. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excluded this $20 million charge, as well as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs, we successfully managed to our target of $1.4 billion. 
Before moving on, I'd like to provide more background on OpEx as we continue to invest in our key growth strategies. Our OpEx is comprised primarily of employee-related costs. This includes compensation and benefits, as well as other related expenses and supporting cost, largely infrastructure for facilities and IT equipment. 
GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx were both at 12% from fiscal 2012. Of the year-on-year OpEx increase for GAAP, 86% related to these employee-related costs, 12% to a contribution expense for corporate donation and 2% related to all other costs. 
With non-GAAP OpEx excluding the contribution expense, as well as stock-based comp and acquisition-related costs, which were flat year-over-year, 98% of the increase came from employee and supporting infrastructure costs. The remaining 2% related to all other operating expenses. 
We are investing in the new products and major growth opportunities Rob talked about. Icera i500, Project Grey and Shield and NVIDIA GRID. 
We added about 840 new staff in fiscal 2013, giving us a total of nearly 8,000 employees at the end of the year. Of our new staff, 88% joined our engineering teams, 12% joined our operations and SG&A organizations. 
We also invested in an annual pay increase for existing employees and began a 401(k) match in Q4. 
We believe our focused investment and our growth strategies and our core businesses are critical to our future growth. 
Now onto revenue by business segment for the full fiscal year. 
Beginning this quarter, we changed our financial reporting segments to reflect the way we are now managing our business. We now have 2 primary reporting segments: GPU and Tegra processor. 
This new segmentation recognizes that we have 2 fundamental technologies: GPUs and SoCs, which we leverage across several markets under different brands. 
Revenue for the GPU business, which includes GeForce, Quadro and Tesla-based GPUs, was at 2% year-on-year. 
This increase was achieved despite a $173 million decline in chipset products, which we discontinued. 
Excluding chipset product revenue, our GPU business grew 8%, representing our third consecutive year of GPU growth. 
Revenue for the Tegra processor business was up almost 30% from the previous year, driven by the 50% increase in revenue for Tegra sales shipped into smartphones and tablets, including Win RT devices referenced earlier. 
Full details of our new reporting segments, as well as historical revenue segmentation, can be found in my CFO commentary posted on our website. 
Now I'd like to talk briefly about the fourth quarter. Apart from our tax rate, Q4 results were in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Revenue was $1.11 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 16% year-on-year. 
Growth margins remained at record levels. GAAP gross margin was 52.9%, non-GAAP was 53.2%. Operating expenses were $402 million for GAAP and $360 million for non-GAAP. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both below expectations at roughly 7% in Q4 as we benefited from the extension of the U.S. research tax credit. 
Extension of this credit was enacted during our fourth quarter, bringing our effective tax rates down for the year to roughly 15% for GAAP and non-GAAP, in line with outlook with the inclusion of this credit. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our position remains strong in the quarter and throughout the year. Cash increased each quarter, reaching a record $3.73 billion at Q4, up 9% sequentially and at 19% on fiscal 2012. 
In Q4, we initiated quarterly cash dividend and extended our share repurchase program. We returned $147 million of cash to shareholders in the quarter, with $100 million of stock repurchased and $47 million in dividends paid. 
Accounts receivable at Q4 was up $9 million over the prior quarter on slightly less shipment linearity. Conversely, inventory was down $9 million from the prior quarter at $420 million. 
Regarding the first quarter outlook for fiscal 2014, our expectations for GAAP are as follows: Revenue is expected to be $940 million, plus or minus 2%. We expect revenue for the first quarter to be less than Q4, reflecting lower GPU sales in line with expectations for the PC industry and lower Tegra sales as customer devices based on Tegra 3 ramped down ahead of Tegra 4 production. We expect gross margin of approximately 52.9%, flat from Q4; OpEx of approximately $430 million and a tax rate of approximately 16%, plus or minus 1%. We expect the same for the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014. 
For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: Growth margin of approximately 53.2%, flat from Q4, and OpEx of approximately $395 million. This excludes stock-based compensation and certain charges related to acquisitions in aggregate of approximately $35 million. 
The increase in OpEx for Q1 over the fourth quarter is primarily due to the employee-related costs, including planned hiring for our key growth businesses with the addition of a large FICA tax reset that occurs each first quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $59 million to $61 million, and capital expenditures of $55 million to $65 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately $619 million. 
Lastly, we will pay our next quarterly cash dividend at $0.75 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. 
On an annual basis, this is equivalent to $0.30 per share and approximates an annual yield of about 2.4% based on yesterday's closing price of $12.43. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.",1217,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

And so my follow-up question had to with OpEx. So that's a pretty big jump up in the GAAP OpEx, $430 million from your $402 million, and then your $384 million in the prior quarter.

I think the -- we haven't decided yet whether to guide the full year or not. At the moment, we've decided to guide a quarter out. And to tell you the truth, I'm not sure how helpful it was to all of you that we guided the whole year. And so I think that at the moment, we're still thinking through it. But some of the comments that you heard related to, in Rob's comments, were that -- specific to Tegra, at this point, we have more design wins than we had at this point with Tegra 3. You also heard that we're now sampling our 4G/LTE modem, and this is a pretty large market. It's still early in the overall modem market. It's about 150 million units large projected this year, growing about 50% per year. The overall connected device market is probably about 1 billion, north of 1 billion units, and so there's still a lot of LTE 4G modems that need to be shipped. And this is really the first year where we have the ability to engage that market. So we're really super excited about it, we're going to engage it very, very hard and we're sampling modems around the world now. And so those are good growth indicators of -- for Tegra 4. The first quarter, always, we ramped down Tegra 3 as we ramped up Tegra 4. And hopefully, in the future, as we get more and more into lower end devices where the life cycle is a little longer, this transitional effect will be a lot -- would be less pronounced. But this is something we expected and this is something that we'll transition into Tegra 4 as fast as we can.",296,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

But when you provided it a year ago for fiscal '13, it was extremely helpful. So we appreciate that. Just as a follow-up question here, we've heard about one of your primary competitors in the ARM processor area talk about cleaning clocks of Tegra. Can you give us a sense as to, given some of the slippages that the trade press has reported with Tegra 4, that -- to give us confidence that indeed, you will be able to maintain performance leadership when we see Tegra 4 come out.",110,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

No one outside the company knows the performance of Tegra 4. So that's number one. I'll refrain from going any further. I'd like to. But with respect to Tegra 4, I guess you're just going to have to wait just a little longer, not much longer, and you'll see performance evaluations of Tegra 4. And I think you'll be quite pleased with them. Tegra 4 is many times higher performance than Tegra 3 in many areas. And it's designed to be very high performance, there's a lot of confidence in why we can deliver that performance leadership. We said that about Tegra 3 and I think we delivered on that. We -- this is an area that we're quite good. So whether it's CPU performance or GPU performance or camera performance, these are 3 areas that we've made big breakthroughs on. But the 2 areas that are super important to our customers have to do with the battery life that we can sustain despite the fact that our performance is really high. And it has to do with 2 very unique features. One is our 4-PLUS-1 energy-saving core. We invented this technology and we're still the only company in the world shipping this technology. And no -- none of our competitors have this technology as of yet, although some of them are talking about it in the future. Second is a technology that's related to modulating the backlight on a per pixel per frame level. That is something that's very unique to Tegra and it saves hundreds of milliwatts. Because as you can imagine how much a display backlight consumes, it's getting higher and higher because the resolutions are getting higher and the displays are getting brighter and people expect more from their display. This is a technology that is quite unique to us and this is with Tegra 4, we have our second-generation to that. And so we've introduced not only performance capabilities, but as well as battery saving capabilities and new functionalities, like our camera. And so I'm looking forward to the reviewers, which ultimately, ultimately, the reviewers will tell us how their processor compares to ours. But based on everything we know about crate, I think our position of Tegra 4 is going to be pretty extraordinary.",403,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We're gaining share in that business because our position in graphics is getting stronger than ever. Our technology leadership position is pulling ahead. Whereas graphics is important, and it continues to be, we've introduced new ways of rendering graphics, ray tracing and other computational graphics capabilities. We've added a simulation technology related to -- made possible by GPU computing so that you could simulate and visualize at the same time. So the capabilities that we provide is increasing. We're just transitioning Kepler into our entire enterprise product line. And Kepler, as you know, is just a wonderful GPU. It's the best GPU we've ever built. It's the best GPU the industry has ever built. And we're in the process of transitioning that into Quadro. That's been offset. There's been some offsetting dynamics related to the weakness of the enterprise market in some areas around the world. There were some delays related to the next-generation workstation motherboard from Intel, but I think their people are working through all these issues and I think the dynamics will play out.",201,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The PC graphics, the consumer product line, that's really 2 components. The larger component -- well, there's 2 components. So there's the OEM graphics, where the OEMs use our GPUs to differentiate their notebooks or differentiate their PCs. They add our GPUs, and because it's clearly additive and the performance is so much better, they could provide the same basic platform with a premium SKU. That dynamic hasn't really changed and my guess is that an OEM's desire to create premium products will continue to be there. The larger dynamic, the larger market for PC graphics is related to PC gaming. We've always said that PC gaming is vibrant. We've said that PC gaming is, in fact, growing. And the reason for that is because the PC platform is open. And it allows for a lot of innovations not only for technology, but also for business models. One of the most important new growth dynamic has to do with free-to-play. free-to-play is really a wonderful business model. And it's a business model that doesn't serve as well, a proprietary and a closed platform model where royalties are -- where it's royalty-bearing. And so these free-to-play platforms are fabulous for PCs. And it attracts new gamers, it costs nothing to try it and unless you really enjoy the game, that's when you really get in and buy up virtual goods, where you can differentiate your outfit, your costume, differentiate your weapons, play new levels. And so it's -- the more you enjoy the game, the more you're welcome to spend in the game. And I think that, that kind of a business model really tailors nicely to PCs. It's also much more associated with MMOs, massively multiplayer online games. And so these dynamics continue to help drive our PC graphics business, the gaming graphics business. For the year, I think that these dynamics will make true that the MMO and the free-to-play business models are going to continue to drive and help grow the PC graphics business.",386,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Looking forward, if I run the numbers, it looks like we're going to see about 15% OpEx growth year-on-year even if you hold Q1's level pretty stable for the balance of the year. How should we think about that going forward? Are you going to be -- should we think about revenue leverage here or is there a gross margin leverage potential to hold on to your earnings power?",105,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

I think first of all, we have to recognize that we're investing into a once-in-a-lifetime and very large market opportunities. We weren't the first modem company in the world, but we need a modem, a 4G/LTE modem to address the very large LTE-connected devices market. And if we're able to deliver that, we're in a pretty special place. And the reason for that is because we have a great application processor, we have a great application processor roadmap, because we have the technology and capability to sustain it. One of the most important areas, one of the most important capabilities in the mobile market is the ability to have software. There's so many different operating systems, and Microsoft does a great deal in the PC industry that's not afforded to in the rest of the embedded markets. And this is a market where in the connected marketplace, connected device marketplace, where there's Android and Chrome and Win RT and Linux and QNX, and all these different operating systems require a world-class system software team. And so if we have those 2 things and we combine it with LTE, which we're now sampling, the combination of these 3 things can put us in a very special place. And so we want to go after that large and fast-growing LTE marketplace and investment is necessary. So the answer to your question is revenue leverage. We're looking forward to revenue leverage. Now our GPU business, of course, is still growing as well. And there's opportunities to grow there. The last year, we grew 8%, if you excluded the chipset business that we exited. And this year, we added a new type of GPU product. We incorporated our GPUs into a first of its kind graphics appliance. It's a graphics computing system. It's dedicated to doing graphics, and we've described a few applications for the NVIDIA GRID. And I think that this type of a computing appliance, this graphics appliance, is for GPUs very similar to a router it is -- a router is for networking chips or a network-attached storage as for standard chips. At some point, when you want to share these resources with a larger workgroup over a lot of different people, these graphics appliance, these computing appliances are really a perfect fit. And we see a lot of people wanting to go to SaaS, but they can't do it with graphics-intensive applications. And now with the NVIDIA GRID, they can finally do that. And so I'm excited about the GPU growth opportunities still, but one of the areas where we're investing very heavily, and that's the reason why you saw the investments from last couple of years, is really to put us in a place where we can engage the LTE market. And this year, we will aggressively do that.",476,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Clearly, it sounds to me like you want with the LTE modem, you want to grow on the handset side of the market to take advantage of that. When you look at all the other investments that you're making as you just ran through a pretty healthy list there of new products that you've introduced recently, what's #2 and #3 on the list as far as revenue contribution?",91,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I listed LTE, and that's -- LTE, when I say LTE, I mean Tegra LTE. You have to invest in Tegra and you have to invest in LTE in order to engage that LTE-connected device market. There is no standalone modem business anymore and many of these new 4G-connected device marketplace, and integrated approach is necessary. And that's the reason why we bought us, Icera, and that's the reason why we're investing in LTE. So that's really one investment. You have to do it altogether or you don't do it at all. And so that's one of the reasons why all of the standalone modem companies really have gotten out, and that's the reason why most of the standalone application companies have gotten out. Because unless you have the combination of these 3 things, the Tegra, something like a Tegra application processor, a 4G modem and a software stack, you really can't play. You can't play the big games. And I think we're rather uniquely positioned to be a great challenger here. And then #2 is GRID. That particular investment is really about taking our GPU and taking it out of the box. If you take the GPU out of the box, then you can grow independent of the box. And GRID is going to make it possible for us to put our GPUs, if you will, on a network and whether it's a Mac network or a PC network or an Android network or whatever devices you've got networks onto it. So those are 2 investments that I've described. And both are -- have exciting growth opportunities ahead.",276,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

I'm going to take a swing at that. I think you asked, what is likely to be a larger growth driver for us, is it tablets or phones, and number two, is it Android or Win RT? And so that's a good question and let me see if can try to dissect that. First of all, on a yearly basis, although the quarters have been a little choppy, on an annual basis, all of our -- most of our growth, not all of our growth, but the vast majority of our growth has come from tablets. And whereas people were rather skeptical about Android tablets, we really stuck with it. And we stuck with it because we believe not in whether a tablet, an Android tablet, is going to be useful or not or successful or not, we believed in the Google cloud. We believe that people will buy books and music and games and movies and store their photographs up in the cloud. And when you put all these, all your personal content in the cloud, you want to enjoy it on your phone, you want to enjoy it when you're home in a larger format. And in which case, an Android tablet. We also believe that you would want to enjoy playing the games with a device that's designed -- dedicated to play games. And that's the reason why we built Shield. And so I think the tablet market is -- has turned out to exceed most people's expectation. And we grew a lot in Android tablets this last year, and my expectation is that there will be more Android tablets built this next year. And so the first thing is, yes, I believe in tablets. I believe in tablets wholeheartedly and it's an area, it's a segment of the marketplace that we're going to continue to invest in and be quite successful in. Win RT, I believe it is essential, strategically essential for Microsoft to be on all of the major processors in the world, surely, the highest volume processor in the world as a software company, that and an operating system company. It's a market they can't afford to ignore. And so Win RT is surely going to be an important area for them. Now whether people see Win RT as a consumer tablet or as a PC has yet to be determined, but at the very minimum, if you extrapolate it forward by a few years, it's hard to imagine how Win RT can't possibly, won't possibly be a wonderful PC. We know exactly what it feels like on top of a Tegra 4 and it rocks, it's fantastic. And so Win RT, I think, will be successful as well. Microsoft will have no choice but to continue to invest in it, and it's a great company, they'll do something great with it. With respect to tab -- so that's Android and Win RT. I already commented on tablets. Smartphones, super phones, this is an area that we will likely need to have an LTE modem in order to be successful. And that's the reason why we worked so hard to accelerate our LTE modem to market. We're working around the clock, and this is with an LTE modem, the Tegra processor and our software capability, we will be able to address a much larger phone opportunity going forward. And so we'll have some phone success this year, but we're not expecting to have a whole lot of phone design wins until we have -- until we engage the market with LTE, okay?",599,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I think GRID comes in 3 flavors. GRID, the architecture, comes in 3 flavors. One, and the one that we developed first is GRID for enterprise VDI. We've been working with Citrix, VMware and Microsoft for quite a long time, and that particular application, by installing our graphics cards, the GRID, VGX graphics cards into a industry-standard OEM server, you could deploy it in enterprises and accelerate the VDI installations that you have. And so if you had a Citrix desktop, it would just be much snappier. We can also address markets where the current VDI solutions aren't sufficiently good enough, because the graphics performance isn't good enough, it doesn't accelerate -- it doesn't run certain applications like workstations, and so we could expand the market for VDI. Our 3 partnerships are going fabulously, everybody's very excited about that and that is likely the first area of growth this year for GRID. The second component of growth has to do with cloud gaming. We have about 6 partners, and we're evaluating new ones who are middleware partners who service telcos and MSOs around the world to provide cloud gaming to these telcos and MSOs. They would like to provide gaming as one of the channels of cable television. And so it's another way for them to monetize a subscriber base they already have. It's another way for telcos to provide content that could be enjoyed over the LTE networks. And so you could imagine that this is creating new content, adding content inventory to their subscriber base. That's something that, of course, every telco and every MSO would more than love to do. And so there -- we have 6 partners partnered with us around the world. The clouds are growing on 12 of the telcos, at 12 telcos around the world, and there are more coming online as we speak. And so that evaluation will take longer because the quality of service has to be proven and there's a -- these large networks have to be tested. And so that's the second that we started. I'm not expecting large revenue contribution this year, but it's really, really important that we do proof of concepts and trials at every telco this year. And so that's our primary focus. And the third has to do with SaaS. There's as you know, most of the software companies would like to move to a SaaS model. It is -- from whether it's monetization or just being able to access new customers more quickly, not having to install a heavyweight application in somebody's network is one of the fastest ways to capture new subscribers or new customers, new licensees. And so being able to just literally put a heavyweight application like an Adobe or Autodesk or a SolidWorks workstation application as a little icon that you double-click and boom, you're in that application, because that application is being served on a network, it's a real benefit to them. and so this is a new market as well for us. Obviously, GRID is a first of its kind device. It's a graphics -- it's a GPU. It's a massive collection of GPUs in a computing device. And so we're very good at GPUs, of course, and all the software is in-house. But we're cultivating that marketplace now and we'll see how it goes. And so I wish I had crisp answers on these, on GRID. But this is a first of its kind device and we have enthusiastic partners because it provides a benefit to all in the ecosystem, and soon as we can, we'll report on the actual business component of it.",613,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And so this is -- we own the entire stack and so it's easy for us to do it.

But we watch it very, very closely. The channel's very important to us and all of our partners, and the flow of goods is important to us.

The ability to stream your -- remotely your PC game and to be able to enjoy it on your Shield is quite a magical new experience. And the enthusiasm from our GeForce customers around the world is really quite spectacular. We've had more, more press written about Shield than just about anything in the history of our company.

The first addition is LTE modems. LTE modems by itself is not a new business but LTE modem will allow Tegra to enter into new markets where LTE is necessary. We already have many LTE design wins on i500. Our expectation is this is going to be quite a good trend for us. So that's one additive, additional part of our business. The second additional part of our business is using our own Tegra processor and utilizing our own proprietary technologies in software and such, to build an Android device, we call that Shield. The third additional to our business -- addition to our business is GRID, which is a GPU. It's a network-attached GPU. It's not a new business, it's a GPU business. It's packed with GPUs and it has served -- it serves our existing marketplace, partnered with our existing partners, sold into the same ecosystems. And so we have 3 things this year.

First off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your design traction on your modem business. You talked about i500, that Icera acquisition is definitely a key part of that. Just curious if you can help us maybe understand maybe the shape of the growth this year and perhaps the sizing. Is it something that grows to 100 million this year? Is it something that's a lot bigger than that? I mean 150 million units for the year, it's a big TAM. So I just wanted to think about that the right way.",101,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

The first thing is it's important to note that the previous generation of our LTE modem, the i410, is the first and currently still the only Win RT LTE modem certified by AT&T. It is currently shipping in the ASUS Vivo tablet, and if you get a chance to try it, it's really wonderful. It stands to reason that there are many other Win RT Tegra 4 tablets in development and we would transition them to the i500 modem. We don't sell the modem separately. It's sold as a kit. It's sold with Tegra 4. And so it's hard to break it out per se. But more and more of our business will include LTE because we had no LTE penetration in the past, and this year, we're going to be shipping LTE modem. So I don't know exactly how much, we're trying to make it as much as possible. But at this point, we're not guiding the whole year.",163,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then just for my follow-up, I was curious, when we take a look at the full year, you've got a lot of great stuff happening on Tegra outside of, I guess, handsets. So you've got tablet traction, you've got Shield, you've got automotive that did well last quarter. When we look at full year here, I mean you guys did a great job hitting 50% growth last year. Could you care to maybe give us some help in terms of ballpark, how much growth we should be thinking about this year and fiscal '14 given the transition and the fact that we're kind of starting off a little bit light as we enter the April quarter?",119,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And I'm hoping that over time, as we -- as our -- although we've had this transition now for all 3 generations, each one of the transition, the piece have become much higher and the revenues of the whole business has become much larger. And so our position in the marketplace is growing, our footprint is growing and our position is more strategic to the marketplace than ever. But we haven't decided to guide the whole year. We're going to go through this transition one more time and we'll start shipping in Q2, but we haven't decided to guide for the full year. What you recognize are the same things we observe as well. Whereas before, we really only had Android tablets. Now, we have a much larger Android tablet market. We have Win RT PCs, we have Shield and we have automotive. And so Tegra is not just a smartphone and, of course, we have Tegra LTE, which should be great for connected tablets, as well as smartphones. And so we have more than just Android application processors now. We have much more than that. But it's hard to say exactly how much for the year and we're just going to go do as best we can.",223,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

With that, let's begin. 
Our results this quarter came in at the upper end of our guidance, driven by strong sales of higher-end GPU products for PC gaming. We made good progress on our key strategies as the Kepler GPU architecture, which delivers outstanding performance and energy efficiency, drove strong GeForce demand with PC gamers and began to flow-through our Quadro and Tesla businesses in new products. 
The PC gaming software market, which is forecasted to grow from $17 billion in 2012 to over $20 billion by 2015, continues to be fueled by new great content. Q1 saw the continued growth of free-to-play games and the release of the 3 hot titles: Crysis 3, Tomb Raider and BioShock Ultimate. To enable our customers to experience these games at their visual best, we launched GeForce GTX TITAN. Our best indicator of future success is customer demand, and since its launch in February, TITAN continues to sell out as fast as it's delivered. It packs into a quiet elegant form factor, 7 billion transistors, using the same Kepler architecture that powers the world's fastest supercomputer, the Titan at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Strong press reviews have reinforced the value of TITAN. A nontech described it this way, ""It's simply in a league of its own right now. TITAN delivers the kind of awe-inspiring performance we have come to expect from NVIDIA's most powerful video cards."" And Eurogamer said, ""TITAN is a unique remarkable product, a serious statement of intent from NVIDIA on the future of rendering technology."" 
This quarter, we also brought Kepler fully into the enterprise workstation market, launching 4 new Quadro K-series professional graphics products. They deliver up to 50% faster visualization performance and twice the compute horsepower of previous generation Quadro products. The Quadro K-series is now available from key OEM workstation suppliers, including Dell, HP, Lenovo and Fujitsu and is supported in key professional software applications. As they roll out this year to customers worldwide, we expect Quadro to drive unprecedented performance and power efficiency for the design, manufacturing and media and entertainment industries.
As you know, one of our key strategies is to extend the GPU beyond the PC. At our recent GPU Technology Conference, we introduced GRID for the enterprise market, taking Kepler beyond the PC into the data center. In the short time since we began taking GRID to market this quarter, we've engaged over 100 GRID VGX and GRID VCA trial customers and signed many of the top Adobe, Autodesk and SolidWorks resellers to take GRID VCA to market. The world's first visual computing appliance, NVIDIA GRID VCA, is a powerful GPU-based system. It runs complex applications, such as those from Adobe, Autodesk and Dassault systems and sends their graphics output over the network to be displayed on a client computer. This remote GPU acceleration gives users the same rich graphics experience they would get from a powerful dedicated workstation under their desk. 
We believe GRID VCA represents a potential $3 billion market opportunity. With an estimated base of 10 million users of Adobe, Autodesk and SolidWorks software, design firms and other creative businesses can now give their teams access to graphics-intensive applications with uncompromised performance, flexibility, and for the first time ever, mobility. 
This quarter, we also continued our work to bring world-class visual computing to new mobile computing devices. In a key announcement, we introduced our first integrated Tegra LTE processor, Tegra 4i, which delivers 3x higher performance than the competing Qualcomm S400 solutions. Computer graphics in mobile matters more than ever, as evidenced by the growing importance of visual fidelity in the many new phones and tablets launched over the past year. To that end, Tegra 4i has 5x the number of GPU cores as Tegra 3, enabling high quality console quality gaming experiences and full 1080p HD displays. In addition, it integrates an optimized version of the NVIDIA i500 software-defined radio, 4G, CAT 3 and 4 multi-mode LTE modem. At our Investor Day, you saw Tegra 4i making phone calls on the AT&T network, streaming high definition movies across LTE at a maximum 100 megabits per second and running the latest high-end Android games.
We've made significant headway in certifying our lineup of LTE modem-based solutions, the i500 discrete LTE modem and the single-chip Tegra 4i integrated LTE applications processor. We expect -- or we continue to expect LTE data certification by early Q3 and Tegra 4i certification in Q4. In addition, this quarter we're working closely with our customers in preparing new Tegra 4 devices for launch in the second half of the year, and several will be announced over the coming weeks.
Looking to the second quarter of the fiscal year, we anticipate continued strength in consumer gaming, particularly in the higher end of our GeForce product line. Quadro and Tesla will benefit as Kepler-based products continue to drive in the professional graphics and high-performance computing segments. And our GRID enterprise products will engage the market, where our focus remains on growing our GRID VGX trial customers and ramping channel sales for our GRID VCA product. We anticipate customer announcements of new Tegra 4 devices starting in the second quarter, and we look forward to bringing our Project SHIELD open-platform gaming device to market with great anticipation. 
As we discussed during the recent Investor Day, while the company continues to be very focused on prudent investments leading to profitable growth, it is also committed to regular return of capital to shareholders. Karen will provide an update on this topic in her section. 
To summarize, our investments in Kepler are opening up new markets. We're driving share among gamers, strengthening our workstation and supercomputing segments and extending our GPUs into servers and data centers. As mainstream PCs continue to be disrupted by tablets, we're using Tegra to leverage our world-class GPU assets to lead that disruption. And with Tegra 4 devices and Tegra 4i certification on the way, we're gearing up to return to growth in the second half of the year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Karen.",1334,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, May 09, 2013",2013-05-09,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3530.0,460909.0,21544593.0,Presenter Speech,Karen Burns,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Rob. Hello, everyone. You have my full summary in the CFO commentary. I want to highlight for you some key areas before we take your questions. 
Revenue. First quarter revenue was $955 million, at the high-end of our outlook. GPU revenue was down 5.6% from Q1 and up 8.1% from a year earlier. By comparison, the consumer PC market declined roughly 15% over the same time period. We believe our outperformance stems from the success of our growth in targeted investment strategies. 
Rob talked about one of our key target markets for growth, gaming. Revenue from our gaming GPUs was up 24% year-over-year. GTX TITAN, our highest performance single GPU, which retails for $1,000, was launched 3 months ago and continues to sell out as fast as it becomes available.
Our investments are directed not only at advancing the GPU but also at extending its reach. Our focus on CUDA and general-purpose computing are continuing to gain traction in the marketplace. As evidenced by our Tesla revenue growth of 55% year-over-year. 
In the Tegra processor segment, revenue was down 50.5% from the previous quarter and down 22.2% year-over-year. As mentioned on our Q4 earnings call and reiterated at last month's Analyst Day, we made a strategic decision to push out the schedule for Tegra 4 by about a quarter, enabling us to pull in the introduction of Tegra 4i, our first mobile processor with an integrated modem. This allowed us to engage the LTE phone market 6 months earlier with an integrated processor that is significantly differentiated. The revenue decline over both periods reflects this impact. Sales volume of Tegra 3 processors declined as customers began to ramp down production of Tegra 3 based smartphones and tablets. We expect this to continue into the next quarter as customers start to announce Tegra 4 design with further new designs and volume ramp starting in the second half of the year. Our Q2 revenue guidance reflects this, with revenue expected to be up about 2% quarter-over-quarter. We expect the GPU segment to do better than this and the Tegra processor segment to be lower due to the volume for Tegra 4 starting in Q3. 
Gross margins. We achieved record gross margins this quarter, now in the 54% range, up 1.4 percentage points sequentially and up 4.2 percentage points year-over-year. There are always puts and takes but this improvement reflects our rich mix of higher margin products, as well as the underlying value of our GPUs in the marketplace and our focus on costs. For Q2, we expect margins to remain within the same 54 percentage range as Q1 with a high mix of our higher margin products. 
OpEx. OpEx this quarter was in line with our outlook. Our investments support our growth strategies, which are: To lead in visual computing; extend the GPU beyond PC; and with Tegra, leverage our visual computing assets into the fast-growing market for new computing devices. 
For Q2, we expect GAAP OpEx to be approximately $448 million and non-GAAP OpEx to be approximately $408 million. Non-GAAP OpEx excludes stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisition, an aggregate of approximately $40 million. The increase in our expectations for Q2 OpEx is primarily related to hiring for our strategic initiatives and due to the tape-out and related engineering costs for new products we are bringing up this quarter. We are very focused on managing OpEx. To balance the strategic objectives of increasing TAM, growing revenue and doing so profitably. 
For the fiscal year, we expect GAAP OpEx to be approximately $1.76 billion with non-GAAP OpEx of $396 million in Q1 and $408 million in Q2. This results in $804 million for the first half of the year, in line with our expectations of approximately $1.6 billion for the year.
EPS. GAAP EPS of $0.13 per share and non-GAAP of $0.18 per share was an increase of 30% and 12.5%, respectively, over the prior year and above Street consensus estimates for GAAP of $0.10 per share. Revenue was certainly a component, increasing 3.2% year-over-year with growth largely attributable to our gross margin improvement, demonstrating the underlying lift that is possible in our business. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash position remains very strong. Cash at the end of the quarter was $3.71 billion. We've generated $175.7 million in cash from operations and $110 million in free cash flow. As announced at our recent Analyst Day, we plan to return in excess of $1 billion this fiscal year in the form of share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments. During the first quarter, we returned $146.3 million to shareholders by repurchasing 100 million of shares, retiring 8 million of shares and paying 46 -- or 3 million of dividends at $0.75 per share. This represents a total return of 188% on GAAP net income and 133% return on free cash flow. As part of this capital return program, NVIDIA plans to continue its quarterly dividend at $0.075 per share -- excuse me, for that error earlier. And expects to enter into a $750 million structured share repurchase this fiscal year.
The broadening of our capital return program underscores our confidence and the traction of our strategies in the market and our long-term cash flow outlook. Returning cash in the form of repurchasing shares also underscores our belief that buying our shares at current prices is an attractive use of capital. 
As we look beyond the current fiscal year, we expect quarterly dividends to remain a key component of our strategy, which the board plans to review annually for potential increases. In addition, we expect to continue the use of share repurchases as a means of capital returned to our shareholders with the amount a function of certain factors, such as market condition, our share price, level and availability of domestic cash and ability to access all share cash in a tax efficient manner, among other things.

And so my sense is that the market is quite large and it gives us a lot of opportunities. I think at the high end or the midrange or the low end, Android is really quite disruptive and it's going to continue to become more popular over time. People who enjoy Android phones are going to want to enjoy Android tablets and Android this and that's, and the reason for that is, of course, once you get your content in the cloud and once you have all of your applications on -- in the Google Play store, you're going to want to enjoy more of those applications in all the devices that you own.

If I were to make the assumption that PCs decline over the next few years, is it fair to think that the discrete graphics market has peaked and that will also decline from the next year onwards? Because if I look at the last 5 years, the discrete market has stayed flattish in the $3 billion or so range, with sort of periodic share shifts between yourselves and ATI. But now as PCs start declining, then would the discrete graphics market also start declining substantially?",92,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

The discrete GPU market has been growing for us 12% CAGR over the last 4, 5 years. We see no reason why it's going to stop. And the reason for that is because we're making the GPU more useful over time. Four years ago, no one spoke of using GPUs for general-purpose computing. Four years ago, no one spoke of using GPUs to accelerate digital content creation applications. Four years ago, no one spoke about putting GPUs in servers. Now, Cisco, IBM, Dell, HP, all are shipping servers with GPUs inside. They're shipping it for accelerated VDI, they're shipping it for cloud computing, [Audio Gap] probably from a GTC conference, Shazam and many others are starting to develop their software on GPUs, so that they could deal with the big data problems that are happening as a result of more and more mobile devices and the use of cloud computing. Four years ago, none of that stuff happened. And I think our investment in making the GPU more flexible and our investment in CUDA has made the GPU a really terrific parallel processing device. And so we've expanded the reach of GPUs into non-PC devices. Meanwhile, PC is really one of the most important gaming platforms today. It's one of the most gaming -- most important gaming platforms because it's open. And if you were developing free-to-play games, where the economics were in [indiscernible] the PC is really a terrific platform for that. There are many markets outside of the United States where the game console is just not as popular. For example, China, Korea, many of the regions outside of the United States, particularly in Asia, which happens to be the fastest-growing markets for us. The PC is really the preferred gaming platform and we're seeing a lot of growth there. And so there's a lot of reasons to be enthusiastic about the continued growth of GPUs. And so I would say, the assumptions are -- needs to be corrected, number one. Number two, as tablets disrupt the PC, it disrupts the PC for casual PC use. You can't really use a tablet to design a car yet. And it is really doesn't make sense to use a phone to create a movie. So for a lot of people [indiscernible] line activity and the keyboard is important, and large storage is important and a mouse is important, a large display is important, and so a lot -- for a lot of us, the PC continues to be very important and those are not being disrupted by the tablet really. And where the segments of market that's being disrupted by the tablet today, we're not really players, as you know, right? The bottom half of the PC market is a non-market for NVIDIA. For a long time, it's probably going to 5, 6, 7 years, where we've not been in that segment of the marketplace and that's the reason why we invested in Tegra, so we could participate in these new computing devices, disrupting the entry-level PC. A great tablet is surely better than the cheap PC.",526,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

As my follow-up, Jen-Hsun, just wanted to get your perspective on the competitive landscape in both the 4G/LTE and high-end processors. I think previously, you made the comparison with Qualcomm's S400, I believe. How do you think your products compare with the S600, S800 and, especially, as I look forward, a number of ARMs partners are coming out with the Cortex A15 products using big little architectures, et cetera.

Let me talk about the phone market first. The high-end phone market is dominated really by 2 players, Apple and Samsung, and both of them have their own application processors. We don't really think that we could add a whole lot of value there. And so our target is the next segment down. We believe that we can add value to the phone market by building an application processor that has the features and the capability of a super phone but the price of a mainstream phone, and that's the reason why we targeted the segment that is currently Snapdragon 400. From that perspective, you could see that Tegra 4i is incredibly well-positioned. It's -- it brings a level of capabilities and features and performance that, that segment's just never seen. And we launched it early in the year, couple of months ago. We see a lot of excitement. We have customer projects going now and, hopefully, we can get to market as soon as possible. We pulled in the Tegra 4i by about 6 months, that was a decision that we made. We felt that it was good for us to engage the LTE market as soon as possible. This is a market that's still doubling every year, the sooner we engage it, the better off we're going to be. And so that's the phone market. Outside of the phone market, we think it's fair to say, and that you would recognize this as well, that there's a lot of licensees of ARM, something like 80 licensees of ARMs, I don't even know who isn't a licensee of ARM, maybe that's a good way of saying it. But yet, there aren't that many people that are contenders for the performance segments. Tegra 2 was the highest -- was the world's first dual core, Tegra 3 was the world's first quad core with a 4-plus-1 architecture and Tegra 4 is the highest performance application processor in the marketplace today. And so my sense is that performance is a combination of architecture, obviously, the ARM processor makes a big difference, your GPU, your system architecture and also, of course, of software. And that's an area that we can add a lot of value to. Outside of phones, where these new computing devices are becoming increasingly like your entry-level personal computer, performance matters. And this is an area we can add a lot of value.",421,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If you look at last year, Tegra 3 had really a couple of high-profile devices and those have a lifetime in the marketplace of about a year. And because we decided to pull in the Tegra 4i by 6 months, as a result, we slipped out Tegra 4 by about 3 months. We're going to have a trough in Q2 this year. But Tegra 4 is a great device. It's a great processor. And this time around, although we have fewer phones, fewer high-profile phones, there are more Android devices being built around the world than you could imagine and there's all kinds of new types of devices coming to market. We have tablets, obviously, in development. And we have other types of computing devices that we will also announce, probably starting in late Q2 and ramping strongly in Q3 and Q4. But one of the areas that is becoming more prominent is our automotive business. It doubles every year. It's going to double this year again.

On Intel platforms, out of that 80%, if we were to have the vast majority of that, say 80% of that, that results in a market share of some 64% overall. And so that tells you something about our market share. We're -- on the Intel platforms, we're quite successful. On the AMD platforms, there are not really opportunities for us. Now if you -- if AMD were to gain share by 5%, we'll tick up a little bit. If AMD loses share -- or Intel loses share, we would lose overall share. And so at this point, I think that our market share on notebooks is relatively stable and could be, from season to season, depending the model-to-model to OEM-to-OEM, we may win or lose a little bit. But I think, overall, that's just not a factor in our overall business that much anymore. Were going to keep working hard to win share there. But if you look at our growth prospects. Gaming PC is very important. The workstation marketplace as the industries around the world continue to develop and as more economies become a design economy instead of just a manufacturing economy, our workstation business continues to grow. More and more people are using and creating more digital content. And when they create more digital content it helps our workstation business. And then all of our GRID initiatives to take GRID into accelerated VDI, accelerating Citrix applications, if you will, accelerating VMware VDI applications, to GRID in the cloud, to GRID being used for cloud computing, dealing with big data.

This year, we're going to have our trough in Q2. The overall market is quite -- doing quite well. So if we had a trough, we must have lost share. And we lose share momentarily in our trough and when we grow back, we're going to gain share. We're still a relatively small player in the overall mobile space. Our position is becoming more and more clear to people. The partners that we work with are enthusiastic about the products that we're building. But we have the trough because we decided to pull in Tegra 4i and we pulled in Tegra 4i by about 6 months. And as a result, we were -- we weren't able to hold on to our schedule in Tegra 4 and so Tegra 4, instead of ramping in Q2, like Tegra 3 ramped in Q2 last year, Tegra 4 is going to ramp in Q3.",162,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

As we go into the second half for Tegra, excluding GRID and excluding SHIELD but just looking at the Tegra business exclusively, because now you're lumping everything in Tegra now. What about -- how many design wins, I guess, do you have on Tegra 4i that would kind of give you some confidence that you're starting to penetrate and I would assume, that will be on the handset side. And along those lines, I mean, I guess the competitive landscape isn't -- is more intense than it was, say, 2 years ago, particularly in China, with Mediatek and Spreadtrum. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe talk about where you could grow in the handset, I mean, you talked about kind of where Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 plays into, but if you can elaborate on that, that will be great.",143,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And I'm going to just tease it apart real quick. Number one, GRID is not lumped into Tegra. GRID is part of GPUs. And so let me -- that's just the first clarification. Tegra includes -- Tegra is our new computing devices business. It includes phones. It includes tablets. It includes everything Android. It includes automotive. It includes SHIELD. Because Tegra is a chip, it's not a business. We lump it all together for the simplicity of understanding. And because we highly leverage everything. These mobile devices are becoming -- these computing, new computing devices are becoming more and more similar. They all have ARM CPUs. They all have Android. They all have WiFi and 4G and USB and HDMI and all these things that are kind of becoming universal computing platforms, whether it's a car or a television or a tablet, it's becoming very similar. And that's one of the reasons why Android is becoming so successful. It really embodies all of the spirit of Linux, it's open and it's -- and if you want to be an Android device, devices like Tegra are going to be quite useful. So we lump all of that together for simplicity. In the case of phones -- in the case of Tegra, there are 2 devices that we're selling now. There's Tegra 4 and then there's Tegra 4i. Tegra 4 is the high-end processor and Tegra 4i has a integrated modem. Tegra 4i is much more targeted at phones. Tegra 4 is much more targeted at tablets, set-top boxes, cars, clamshell devices, et cetera. And so we have a lot more Tegra 4 design wins than we have Tegra 4is, because we just announced Tegra 4i. We pulled it in by 6 months, surprised the customers, we surprised the market, which is all good. And I was talking about the positioning of Tegra 4i earlier that it was really targeted at the mainstream with superphone features. And we have customer projects ongoing now and our expectation is that the design cycle would take about 9 months to about a year, which is relatively typical for phones. And so we announced it in Q1. My expectation is that we would have phones completed in late Q2 -- excuse me, late Q4. And then be in production, hopefully, be in shelves by Q1 of next year. Tegra 4, tablets and clamshells and TVs and set-top boxes and that kind of stuff, cars and that kind of stuff, we hope to announce -- we hope our customers announce devices in late Q2 and we would like to be ramping quite hard by Q3.

So whenever gaming -- whenever our gaming business improves, it helps gross margins. Whenever GTX improves, it helps gross margins. When Tesla grows, it helps gross margins. When Quadro grows, it helps gross margins. Relative to the corporate average, I'm talking about relative to corporate average. When GRID grows, it helps relative to gross margins. When notebook, obviously, drags the gross margins, because they tend to be more competitive business. Low-end desktop PC business tends to drag gross margins, but that's not a very large business anyhow, okay?

With that said, let's begin.
Our focus on visual computing enabled us to ride out a rough PC market this quarter and is setting us up for growth in new markets. Revenue came in at the middle of our outlook, driven by strength in GPU, offset by Tegra. PC gaming performed particularly well, enriching our product mix, growing our share of GPU revenue and driving margins to another record high.
The PC market is evolving as entry-level laptops face pressure from tablets. Yet sales of specialty PCs, like gaming systems and workstations, continue to grow. The disparity reflects how consumers use these different classes of PCs. Many consumers look to a PC as a general-purpose device that they can use for browsing, email, social media and video, but much of this can be better served by a tablet. In contrast, gamers are preparing their systems for a strong roster of games coming this fall, including blockbuster franchises, such as Call of Duty: Ghosts, Grand Theft Auto V and Assassin's Creed 4. In a similar vein, for digital artists and designers, the workstation is the tool of their trade. They depend on increasing processing power to deliver results for their clients, and the use of specialty PCs could become even more widespread with the growth of new applications, like 3D printing.
Open platforms, such as PC and Android, are outgrowing the walled gardens of the traditional console market. They benefit from more innovation. Nearly half the developers surveyed at GTC recently were working on PC games compared to only 11% on next-gen consoles. PC game revenues are expected to reach around $20 billion annually by 2015. Whereas the total for both PlayStations will be less than $10 billion and Xbox is only around half that.
In mobile, games generate 80% of the revenues on Google's marketplace and 2/3 of the time spent on a tablet is spent playing games. It's this innovation and energy that we're leveraging with SHIELD. It started shipping July 31 and the critical reception has been excellent. VentureBeat described it as ""A game geek's dream device."" A writer at Forbes said it got him excited about gaming again.  And CNET called it, ""A high-quality device with stellar performance."" Because SHIELD is an open platform, it can access anything available to an Android tablet. That means there were literally hundreds of thousands of games available for SHIELD the day it launched. It's a web browser and a way to update Facebook. It excels as a Netflix movie player and as an Internet radio or Pandora music player, thanks to the effort we put into the loudspeaker and acoustic design.
SHIELD is the best way to play games, Android games, and a key element of our strategy to generate a virtuous circle in open gaming. It links to GeForce on PCs, so gamers can play PC games from their couch. One day, it will be an excellent client for GRID gaming. We paired it with TegraZone, a curated collection of games, all tested on Tegra and many of them optimized for Tegra. TegraZone has been installed over 7.5 million times already, and that number increases around 10% a quarter. The model we're building for games is familiar from music and movies. You can buy a song from Amazon and download it to your device or stream it directly from a service like Spotify, or even buy it and host it in the cloud at Google. Similarly, a gamer can download games to SHIELD to play, play a game online and soon stream it from GRID.
Our content group helps develop and differentiate their games on our platforms, and this creates synergy across devices. Games optimized for SHIELD will also look great on Tegra 4 devices, like the HP SlateBook x2 or the Toshiba Excite Pro, both of which shipped this quarter. Games optimized for GeForce will be excellent candidates for GRID gaming. In this way, SHIELD, GeForce and GRID each benefit the other and gamers benefit from a dynamic ecosystem.
Q2 is a trough quarter for Tegra, and you'll see more Tegra 4 devices -- but you'll see more Tegra 4 devices launched through the balance of this year. Meanwhile, the qualification of our modems, both the standalone baseband i500 and the integrated application processor Tegra 4i, is proceeding as expected, and we're making steady progress towards certification at a number of carriers.
We previewed our next-generation mobile processor, Project Logan, last month. Logan includes our first mobile Kepler GPU, delivering what the technical press described as, ""Unambiguous mobile GPU leadership."" Licensing our GPU cores, as we announced this quarter, allows us to generate revenue from markets previously inaccessible, such as vertically-integrated smartphone OEMs. The mobile Kepler inside Logan has around 3x the performance per watt of the iPad 4 GPU, yet performs like a new desktop part. We showed it running Epic Games' next-generation game engine Unreal Engine 4 and running Ira, the face demo that was recently at the Investor Day in April, was restricted to high-end gaming PCs.
Forbes suggested that, ""NVIDIA's Logan could be a mobile graphics disruptor."" Gizmodo said that, ""If you get a new phone in 2014 with crazy battery life and an amazing on-screen performance, the Kepler GPU will be the reason."" Other press were similarly enthusiastic.
Last year, we made the decision to pull in Tegra 4i and Logan. This made us late to market with Tegra 4. However, with Project Logan, we are early and well positioned to capture key design wins.
Moving on to our GPU server business, Tesla had an excellent quarter, very nearly its best ever. Notably, this quarter's revenue was driven by application-based deals. That is, customers using off-the-shelf applications are turning to Tesla GPUs to accelerate them. This validates our continued investment in software. For example, last week's acquisition of PGI, the leading developer of compilers for high-performance computing. Also, since this revenue passes through OEMs, it requires much less sales and support resources from us and offers a more efficient route to scale for that business.
In professional visualization, Quadro displayed a strong sequential and year-over-year growth. We launched the Quadro K6000 to complete the lineup of Kepler top to bottom. Prospects look good for future growth, 80% of Quadro's sales are driven by manufacturing and recent PMI and auto manufacturing data has been very encouraging.
GRID is showing increased traction in the ecosystem. We announced this quarter that GRID is now supported natively within XenDesktop 7, so enterprises considering Citrix's virtualized infrastructures can easily also evaluate GPU acceleration. We have over 150 proof-of-concept trials underway, and a dozen Citrix live partners working on active GRID opportunities.
Our focus on gaming, visualization and compute generated growth in a turbulent market. Leveraging our IP into new markets and applying GPUs to the cloud will accelerate that growth in the future.
With that, I'd like to hand it over to Karen.",1473,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2013",2013-08-08,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3531.0,503583.0,23260972.0,Presenter Speech,Karen Burns,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Chris. Hello, everyone. I want to highlight some key points before we open up for Q&A. Overall results for the second quarter exceeded our original expectations, driven by strong demand in the high-end segments of our GPU business across desktop, workstation and server. Gross margins are now in the 56% range, with Q2 being our fourth consecutive record quarter.
The performance of our GPU business and intense focus on costs delivered EPS of $0.16 on a GAAP basis and $0.23 on a non-GAAP basis. These were $0.04 above Street consensus estimates of $0.12 for GAAP and $0.19 for non-GAAP. Revenue for the quarter of $977 million was at the midpoint of our outlook. The GPU business was very strong, with a 9% increase quarter-over-quarter and up 8% over the prior year. Growth was fueled by the release of new Kepler-based GPUs for high-end in desktop, and with Kepler-based GPUs now available top to bottom for workstation and server.
Revenue for the Tegra processor business was down 49% sequentially and 71% year-over-year. We had expected a drop, as discussed last quarter, with the ramp down of Tegra 3 products and ahead of Tegra 4 shipments. Nonetheless, we are disappointed with the size of the decline. Due to current dynamics in the mobile space, we believe it will be challenging for Tegra revenue to remain flat year-over-year, as originally expected. That said, we anticipate Tegra revenue to be up significantly in Q3 from Q2, as we start to ship Tegra 4-based design wins and SHIELD, our NVIDIA branded gaming and entertainment portable. And we expect further growth in Q4 as more Tegra 4 OEM products come to market.
Our revenue guidance for Q3 reflects these new expectations. We expect revenue to be up approximately 7% from the prior quarter, with stable growth in the GPU business and significant growth in Tegra processor. We again achieved record gross margins this quarter. The large increases you are seeing quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year reflect our strong market position in high-margin segments of our GPU business, particularly in desktop and workstations.
For Q3, we expect gross margins to maintain at current levels. OpEx this quarter of $401 million was below our outlook, at $7 million below the midpoint. Some of this investment shifted to Q3. For Q3, we expect OpEx of approximately $460 million for GAAP and $418 million for non-GAAP. Our OpEx investments remain tightly aligned to our key growth strategies. For visual computing, we are extending the technical leadership of our GPUs, growing GPU for accelerated computing and engaging the market with our GRID GPU servers for enterprise VDI. GRID servers are in production by Cisco, Dell, HP and IBM.
For Tegra SoC, we are leveraging our core GPU investments to bring our visual computing leadership to industries that are being revolutionized by Android and ARM. We can make a contribution to many applications where a great GPU is desired. To date, we have established a proven market position for Tegra that we will build on. Largely with Tegra 2, we generated $360 million in revenue in fiscal 2012 from smartphones and tablets alone. Largely with Tegra 3, we grew revenue 50% to $540 million from these devices in fiscal 2013. With Tegra 4, we are expanding our reach to other large markets where visual computing matters, such as auto navigation systems, TV set-top boxes and new desktop form factors like all-in-ones and smart monitors.
With GAAP -- with non-GAAP OpEx of $797 million in the first half of the year and $418 million expected in Q3, we are tracking at the high end of our full year expectations of approximately $1.6 billion. We aim to reduce this amount, as we remain intensely focused on operating costs.
Turning to the balance sheet, our overall position remains very strong. In the first half of the fiscal year, we generated $275 million in cash from operations and $122 million in free cash flow. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, a reduction of $778 million from Q1. This relates to our capital return allocation to shareholders of $793 million, consisting of $43 million in dividend payments and $750 million for share repurchases.
In Q2, we executed an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $750 million of shares. To date, we have received 40 million shares under this agreement, reducing our outstanding common stock, and we expect to receive additional shares when the contract ends in Q3.
In addition, year-to-date, we have returned $190 million to shareholders, including $100 million in share repurchases and $90 million in quarterly dividend payments. With this capital allocation strategy, along with our quarterly dividend payments in the second half, we are on track to return capital to shareholders in excess of $1 billion. Thank you.

Because we pulled in 2 very important projects: Tegra 4i, with our integrated 4G modem; and Logan, which incorporated our mobile Kepler GPU. As a result of that, Tegra 4 was a little later than our typical cycle. And so we had a gap out, and we expected Q2 to be the trough. We expect next quarter to be up substantially, and as Karen mentioned earlier. However, there were some disappointments this year, some projects that we worked on, that we had spent a lot of effort on, didn't pan out as we expected. And it's relatively well-known now. But nonetheless, it didn't meet our expectations. But overall, I would say that Tegra 4 is going to ramp up very nicely this coming quarter. There's tablets from ASUS, Toshiba and HP. There's SHIELD, that's ramping up, and there are new devices that are going into production that are quite exciting. I think relative to your other question of auto, we had said earlier that auto is about $100 million for the year or so, roughly. And last year was $50 million, and we're expecting next year to be another 100% growth year. Auto, as you know, design cycles are quite long. And so the product life is also quite long, but it takes some time to ramp up. And just one last thing, you had mentioned something about the game console royalties. We're not accounting for much game console royalties.",262,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Well, we are a specialist in visual computing. This is our core business. And over the years, we've enhanced and extended our business model from just chips to now, chips and systems, such as GRID, to system components, such as GTX cards and Quadro cards and Tesla cards to now, including GPU IP. And so we're an end-to-end provider of GPU technologies to all of the applications that relate to visual computing. And the way that we go to market has everything to do with how the customers would enjoy incorporating our technology into their products. In some customers, they would like to buy our chip and put it on their own motherboard. In some -- with some customers, they would like to buy our system components with our software, and we integrate it into their servers or workstations. Some customers would like to buy in retail, adding cards of GeForce. And some customers prefer to build their own chips, their own systems and take it to market themselves. And so in those vertically-integrated opportunities, we've historically not had an opportunity to serve them with our technology. And now, with our mobile Kepler GPU that we revealed at SIGGRAPH, it took us some 3 years to mobilize the world's most advanced GPU. Now the world's most advanced GPU is in a mobile format. It's the world's first CUDA GPGPU in the -- available for mobile, and it takes a huge advance in energy efficiency. And now with this Kepler GPU, we could license our technology in a GPU core format to customers who would like to incorporate it into their own products and address their own vertically-integrated market with it.

But today, just like in movies and music, you game on every computing platform. And the fastest growing platforms in the world today are open platforms. PC is the fastest growing, and it's now become the largest, some $20 billion worth of global software sales. Obviously, China is very, very large. But the United States is large as well, Russia and Korea, you name it. PC gaming has become very large. The business models are vibrant, whether it's multiplayer online games, AAA titles or now free-to-play games. You could see that PC games are just really vibrant. The fastest-growing -- so that's the largest -- the fastest growing and now the second largest is mobile. One of the reasons why we really feel that we can make a contribution in mobile is because video games is such a large part of the mobile experience. And in fact, it’s the largest download of the world's largest digital store, Google Play. It is -- video games is what people spend the most time actually doing on a tablet. And video games and great computer graphics go hand-in-hand. This is an area where we can add a lot of value. And so these 2 platforms are the largest and now the fastest-growing. And I don't think there's anything that game consoles would do at this point that would disrupt that. People just have too many PCs, and there are too many people with tablets and mobile devices, and people like to game wherever they happen to be, not just while they're sitting in front of their TV, sitting in front of the family room.",284,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The decline comes from -- coming into the year, we had pretty high expectations on one particular platform, and there's no sense naming it. But it's a very important platform that also derived from it a lot of design wins. And because this particular platform just didn't do as well as we or, frankly, anybody in the industry had hoped, we don't expect as much returns on that investment as we originally hoped. Our guess is that it's going to be down a couple of hundred million dollars or so, maybe somewhere between $200 million to $300 million overall. And we don't expect it, in the short term, to come back. But not all of the other platforms that we're talking about, obviously, are not affected by this one, one particular design win, and all of it's associated design wins.",145,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

And so it's slightly down. The overall notebook PC marketplace, of course, is not as vibrant as people have hoped. But you know that we're not really in the mainstream PC market. We're really in the specialty PC market, whether it's gaming PC or workstation PCs or high-performance computing PCs or premium consumer PCs or PCs that are used for video editing and digital content creation. That's primarily our target. The notebook part of it, of course, the consumer part of it is not vibrant, and we're not expecting it to -- in our guidance, we're not expecting big growth from it.

GRID is our data center GPU server initiative. And GRID has several attributes. One, of course, could be used for high performance computing, one could be used for big data analysis, whether it's image recognition or image processing or audio processing or video processing. You know that more and more people are uploading just an enormous amount of multimedia data onto the web. And the third initiative is virtualization, enterprise virtualization. And one of the most challenging parts of enterprise virtualization is called VDI. And so these are the major applications of GRID. All of our OEMs have now completed all of their server and data center certifications and are now in production: Cisco, Dell, HP and IBM. And there are trials going around all over the world, where we see -- we have visibility into some of them, and we track about 150 all over the world in Japan, in Europe, in United States, in China.

We're investing in 3 very, very important initiatives. One is GRID. GRID puts our GPUs in data centers, which powers cloud computing. I can't imagine a more important initiative. The second is Tegra, which is going after the Android and ARM computing revolution. Computing devices are cropping up everywhere. Of course, it's already -- we know that it's disrupted smartphones. It's in the process of disrupting computing with tablets. But it will -- its disruption will propagate out to consumer electronics, to gaming, to TVs, to automobiles, to just about anything with a computing device. And wherever there's a computer, there's an opportunity that some of them would require GPUs. And what Tegra is about, that initiative is about, is addressing those opportunities. And wherever we can address those opportunities, what Tegra's -- the effort of Tegra, the focus of Tegra spins off because of that intense focus on energy efficiency and targeting mobile devices and small computing devices. It spins off GPUs cores that we can now use as core IP. And so our investment is really around these 3 areas: GRID, Tegra and our core IP initiatives. And I think these are 3 very large and very important growth initiatives that are very important to invest in. And so we're not expecting to reduce OpEx. What Karen is saying is we're constantly focused on making sure that there are no waste in the company. And we're the largest visual computing company in the world, and our investments are leveraged from visual computing and leveraged from our GPUs.

I think last year we had done something along the lines of $750 million in Tegra, in overall Tegra from smartphones to tablets to automobile to embedded entertainment, whether it's Windows on ARM -- excuse me, Win RT or Android, okay? So that's -- all of that was under Tegra, and last year was about $750 million. This year, we're expecting it to be somewhere between $200 million to $300 million less than that.

One is Quadro, our professional visualization product. It Is quite rich in gross margins because it's mostly a software product. Our value proposition in Quadro is very heavily related to all of the middleware and tools and all of the algorithm technologies that we incorporate into software packages all over the world that are processed by Quadro. Tesla is rich in gross margins because, again, it’s very much a computing platform product. It's not a chip product. And it's about the programming model. It's about the programming language. It's about compilers and tools and libraries and all about all of the computational mathematicians that work with our supercomputing centers and research centers around the world to solve the world's most complex science problems. What also helps our gross margin -- drives our gross margins is GRID. GRID, again, is a heavily software product. The GPU Hypervisor, all of the compatibility that's integrated into all of the Hypervisors and to enterprise infrastructures around the world, the value proposition that it delivers, it’s just very much a software product. And of course, in the future, if we were successful with our core GPU core IP strategy, that would be a big, big lift on gross margins. And so we have products that are very software intensive, very IP intensive and therefore, very margin-rich. But we also have OEM products where we have to compete against other chip providers and our margins are much more compressed there. And so it just depends on where, which one of these parts of our businesses grow faster. I'm not exactly sure whether I'd be happier if the gross margins were to be richer and richer or whether our revenues were to outpace our gross margin growth. But we have the vehicles now, from IP to chips to very value-rich, software-rich system components and systems, to be able to drive our growth. And yet, we can be singularly focused on visual computing. We can be singularly focused on being the world's best GPU provider and serve these markets that are growing quickly.",353,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And as we look at the guidance, and we look at the GPU business and Tegra and the licensing, is it fair to say that the GPU business is going to kind of be in line with the midpoint of your guidance? And then you are going to have a significant growth in Tegra, but that's going to be offset because of some of the declines in the video game consoles, is that how we should be looking at the quarter?",86,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Our GPU, our GPU product line basically is midpoint of margins. And so if you see Quadro grow faster than top line, if you see Tesla grow faster than top line, if you see GRID grow faster than top line, then I would expect our gross margins to increase. If you see Tegra grow faster than top line, then you would see our gross margins come under some pressure.

And that's, I know you guys don't give forward guidance, just the quarter, but as we look at the January quarter, what's typical seasonality in the January quarter? I know things have changed a lot in the dynamics of the PC market, but how do you think we should be looking at seasonality for the January quarter?",73,5.0,4.0,0.7777777777777778,0.4

But I think that there are product cycle factors that are greater than the seasonality factor. And although -- don't take this is as a guidance for the January quarter, but we're just in the process of ramping Tegra 4 into all the devices that have been announced and devices that have not yet been announced. We're ramping SHIELD. And the holiday season, of course, is a factor there and SHIELD is a brand-new product for us. And we're ramping Logan. And so we were late to market with Tegra 4, and it was a bit of a scramble. But I think the decisions were really, really good. We wanted to bring forward our modem technology so that we can start to engage the market and start the long process of certification. We also wanted to pull forward very importantly our mobile Kepler GPU. It was a 3-year endeavor to take the world's most advanced GPU and mobilizing it. And the results are just really quite spectacular. It's kind of amazing to see the graphics that you see in a high-end PC, or even a supercomputer for that matter, running in a little mobile processor. And the architecture and the efficiency is so exquisite that the energy efficiency is really -- really it's a big discontinuity. I mean, we're going -- we've already demonstrated some 3x better energy efficiency. And as you know, energy efficiency, if in a constrained energy environment, like a mobile device, the energy -- the most energy efficient processor is also the most high-performance processor. And so I'm super excited about Logan and now we can get into the marketplace well ahead of the competition. And so those factors, along with the work that we're doing in GPUs, are likely to play a role. And so we'll see how it turns out.",312,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

First of all, our modem qualification comes in 2 different parts, and they're related, but not the same. First is the data service, which is important for all of our modem -- excuse me, all of our tablet products. And so data modem cert is well ahead of the voice and so we're in the process of doing that as we speak. And then there's the -- then there's the voice that goes with Tegra 4i. That happens -- the certification completes near the end of the year. And so we're not expecting -- the reason why we do AT&T is because it's the most rigorous. And if we get through AT&T, you're pretty much set on just about vastly the Western world's open markets. And so that's the reason why we focus on AT&T first.",139,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Chris mentioned that Tesla had almost a record quarter. And most of that was from not one singular supercomputing center installation. It was all from open markets and smaller installations and clusters being purchased to run off-the-shelf applications. And so there's now just a current of business that appears to have developed around the world, and that's really healthy for gross margins.

I think that SHIELD is just hard to say. We didn't set -- we have high expectations from a personal level, but we didn't set high expectations from a financial level. We think it's just a really special and quite a distinguished product. And the more people that are playing with it and touching it and holding it and enjoying it, the more they become really passionate around it. It's a little bit like a gaming PC is to a PC. This is a gaming Android device to an Android device. And it's a specialized Android device, just as our GeForce PCs are really a specialized gaming -- specialized PC for gaming. And so I think the logic is relatively similar. We can a deploy the company's DNA, expertise in graphics and gaming into SHIELD. And so people understand it when NVIDIA brings a gaming product to market. They've known and grown up with GeForce for many of our -- I even meet many engineers at NVIDIA who grew up on NVIDIA's GPUs. And they know our gaming brands very well, and they know what we can go in this field. And so I think it could be a really interesting outcome.

One factor is, it's hard to say exactly where SHIELD is going to be, and we're just expecting it -- we're just trying to be modest at the moment. Two, the separation between Tegra 4 and Tegra 3, or Tegra 3 and Tegra 4 is well over a year. The separation between Tegra 4 and Tegra next is, as you know, relatively short because Logan is already sampling. The sacrifice that we made on Tegra 4 to bring in Logan was really a good decision. Because we wanted to introduce the mobile world to the most advanced GPU in the world, and what NVIDIA's core DNA is all about. And it's at a time when the market is really craving a great GPU. The next-generation Tegra or Logan has a lot more than a great GPU in it, and there are many other surprises that we have in store that I'm just super excited about. But at the very minimum, it contains the most advanced GPU in the world, binary compatible, architecturally compatible, but at a power envelope that's 100x lower. And it's the most efficient GPU that's ever been built for mobile and any energy or performance comparison is -- against anything that's available or around the horizon is just off the charts. And so we're going to take Logan to market as fast as we can. And so those 2 factors, SHIELD and Logan, kind of makes that -- your question a little hard to answer.

With that, let's begin. NVIDIA's focus on advancing the GPU and targeting specialty segments of the PC and mobile markets where visual computing matters resulted in revenue growth in line with our outlook and near-record gross margins. A strong PC gaming market, together with record Quadro and Tesla results and renewed Tegra revenues from Tegra 4 in new Android devices offset declines in mainstream PC units. While the PC market overall declined 9% year-on-year, according to Gartner, NVIDIA's year-to-date overall GPU business is up 4% versus the same time period.
PC gaming continues to grow, led by PC MMO growth at 14%, according to market research firm Nuzu. PC gaming represents almost 40% of the worldwide gaming market, larger than console, phone, tablet or any other gaming markets. PC gaming is also becoming a huge spectator sport, as more than 8.3 million people watched last year's League of Legends Championship Final online, more than the number of people who watched the 2013 Stanley Cup Hockey Final.
This quarter, we launched exciting new products to feed the demand of the PC gamers and spectators alike. We recently unveiled our fastest gaming GPU ever, the GeForce GTX 780 Ti, which, this morning, received the following assessment from Maximum PC, and I quote, ""the GTX 780 Ti is just in a league all by itself.""
We launched NVIDIA G-SYNC Technology, which for the first time, enables near-perfect synchronization between the GPU and the display, solving the decades old problem of on-screen tearing, stuttering and lags. And we introduced GeForce ShadowPlay, a software platform that lets gamers record, stream and share their best gaming moments. Think of it as a DVR and video chat for gaming highlights built in to your GeForce GPU.
The growth of PC gaming has bolstered our GPU gaming revenues despite changes in the PC market. NVIDIA's GPU gaming revenues are up 6% year-to-date compared to the same period last year, while notebook GPU gaming revenues have doubled the last 2 years.
While we saw declines in our mainstream PC OEM business consistent with the overall market, the decline in mainstream units came out of our lowest gross margin products, while the stronger gross margin notebooks' GTX lines grew. The result was favorable revenue and gross margin mix with financial performance better than the overall PC market.
Quadro posted record revenues and record gross margins, driven by strong sales of our new K6000 product. Tesla revenue also hit a new high, driven by steadily ramping demand for Tesla products in high-performance compute applications, particularly for big data analysis.
Evidence of increasing industry compute momentum this quarter included an announcement by IBM that they're working on accelerating Java with CUDA. A recent HPC site survey from the Intersect360 Research Group showed that accelerators are now at 44% of high-performance computing sites, up from 24% 2 years ago. 85% of the HPC sites using accelerators are using NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.
Our GRID platform, which virtualizes graphics by deploying GPUs in the data center to accelerate enterprise power applications, continues to gain momentum, with 212 GRID customer trials now in progress, up from 150 last quarter. All major server OEMs, including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hitachi, HP, IBM and Lenovo, are now promoting GRID for enterprise PC virtualization.
This quarter, VMware announced that VMware Horizon View now supports GRID, enabling graphics acceleration for users of their virtual desktop environment. GRID this quarter won the Best of Show Judges' Choice award at VMware's VMworld Conference. And this week, Amazon Web Services announced that they are deploying GRID servers, delivering GPU acceleration to users running graphics-intensive applications and games in the cloud.
Tegra revenue more than doubled this quarter. Tegra 4 shipped in over 15 different mobile devices, including Xiaomi, HP, Microsoft, ASUS, Toshiba, Acer and others. Android devices with Tegra this quarter included ASUS' new 2500x1600 Transformer convertible tablet, 3 new HP tablets, a new Acer all-in-one PC, ViewSonic's new Android intelligent display and a number of Android micro game consoles. Tegra in automotive continues to ramp, delivering another record revenue quarter.
SHIELD is the ultimate portable game console and continues to garner critical acclaim and reviews. Last week we launched GameStream Technology, which allows streaming of GeForce PC games to SHIELD and Gamepad Mapper, which allows hundreds of Android games to take advantage of the SHIELD's physical controller. More than 10 worldwide partners have announced Tegra Note products to ship this year.
And finally, Xiaomi, the hot smartphone maker from China, which recently surpassed Apple's share in that region, launched what the Chinese press has referred to as the fastest superphone in the world, the Mi3 superphone powered by Tegra 4. The first 100,000 units sold out in 86 seconds. Subsequent production builds of 200,000 also sold out within minutes.
In summary, visual computing in gaming, professional graphics, compute and the data center drove solid financial results this quarter despite a changing PC market, while positioning us to capitalize on growth opportunities in the coming year.

It's a pleasure to be here. Hello, everyone. I want to highlight some key points before we open up for Q&A.
Overall results for the third quarter were in line with our overall expectations for the quarter as continued demand for high-end desktop GPUs, Tegra, Quadro and Tesla platforms drove our results.
Revenue for the quarter was $1,054,000,000, slightly below -- slightly above our outlook and up 8% sequentially. 
We delivered EPS of $0.20 and on a GAAP basis and $0.26 on a non-GAAP basis. These results compared to Street consensus estimates of $0.19 per GAAP and $0.26 for non-GAAP.
Revenue for the quarter reflected solid results in our GPU business. The GPU business grew $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter and was down 2% year-over-year. Desktop, GeForce GPU revenue grew slightly compared to last quarter due to a stronger mix of the mainstream segment, in addition to price repositioning of our high-end GeForce products.
The year ago quarter for desktop GPU revenue was particularly strong as the increased available supply of Kepler high-end GPUs drove results. Our notebook GPU revenue declined as volumes in our low-end notebooks decreased. However, high-end gaming notebooks had strong growth, as mentioned earlier. In our gaming segment includes above [ph] our GeForce gaming GPUs and high-end notebook GPUs, our revenue has grown 6% year-to-date, driven by healthy gaming market.
Quadro enterprise revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter and 24% year-over-year, setting another record quarter, fueled by a strong demand for Kepler-based Quadro products. Our Tesla revenue increased 6% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-to-date, also setting another record quarter as accelerated computing gains momentum.
Revenue for the Tegra business more than doubled sequentially as our Tegra 4 shipments in mobile surged, our growth in Tegra, including strong revenue from new smartphone releases by Xiaomi and growth in our tablet products across several platforms. Additionally, our Tegra sales benefited from Microsoft Surface 2 shipments and our new NVIDIA-branded SHIELD gaming and entertainment portable. As we move to Q4, we expect our Tegra revenue will further grow compared to Q3 and we continue to ramp these devices into markets and our customers introduce new designs.
GAAP gross margins in Q3 was 55.4% and our non-GAAP gross margins were 55.7%, influenced by our success in our Tegra processor business revenue for the quarter and by the most recent price changes in our high-end GeForce desktop products.
GAAP operating expenses this quarter were $443 million, which was $17 million below our outlook, as we worked on optimizing our resources and spending. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $405 million.
Moving to Q4 outlook. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1,050,000,000, about flat with Q3 with continued success in our GPU business, offset by decline in mainstream GPUs. We expect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         strong sequential growth in Tegra. We anticipate GPU business gross margins to remain stable and to experience continued strong growth in Tegra sales. Thus, we expect our GAAP gross margins to be approximately 54.2% and non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 54.5% in the fourth quarter.
On a GAAP basis, operating expenses should be about $450 million in the fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 should be about $410 million. The slight increase from Q3, reflecting growth in headcount-related expenses. The full year should come in slightly over $1.6 billion non-GAAP. 
Moving to our capital return strategies. Our $750 million accelerated stock repurchase was complete on October 22, with a return of an additional 14.6 million shares. In total, we have repurchased 59.5 million shares year-to-date. For the quarter, our dividend was $43 million. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $983 million through capital return allocation to shareholders, consisting of $133 million in quarterly dividend payments and $850 million through share repurchases. Reflecting continued confidence in the company's outlook and the focus on providing a strong consistent return to shareholders, we are pleased to announce a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.075 per share to $0.085 per share. This dividend increase will be effective in the current Q4 of fiscal year 2014.
Our board has also authorized an additional $1 billion of common stock repurchases for a total authorization of $1.286 billion available through the end of fiscal year 2016. We plan to continue our capital return to shareholders and with the increase in regular dividends and stock repurchase authorization, we are pleased to announce that we intend to return up to $1 billion of capital to shareholders within fiscal year '15.
Turning to other balance sheet items. Our overall financial position remains very strong. For the quarter, we generated $162 million in cash from operations and $124 million in cash from free cash flows. Year-to-date, we have generated $434 million in cash from operations and $246 million in free cash flow. Cash inclusive of marketable securities at the end of the quarter was $3 billion.

We licensed our technology to Sony for the PlayStation. We licensed our technology to Intel for their integrated graphics products. In the time that we've done these agreements, we have increased our activities around technology licensing. In July, as you probably remembered, we announced that we would license our GPU core, which is at the heart of the Logan -- Project Logan, which is our next-generation Tegra processor, and its architecture is based on the world's best GPU called Kepler. Our intentions are to continue to invest in technology licensing and make this an important part of our business going forward. So whether it's Intel or others, this is an opportunity that's very important to us. As one of the most important innovators around the GPU, and as you know, the GPU is more important than ever, the GPU, when we started the industry, was available only on PCs and workstations. And now it's available on mobile devices and tablets and cars and cloud and servers. And so this is an area that we're going to continue to invest in and this is an area that we're going to try to monetize in a lot of different ways because business models change and business models are different in all these different segments. Sometimes it makes sense for us to sell chips. Sometimes it makes sense for us to offer systems. And sometimes it makes sense for us to license cores in our technology. And so I think that the way you should think about our technology licensing is that Intel is one of the opportunities for us. But this is a much larger opportunity for us than ever before and this is an area that we have a lot of activity around.",306,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But the way to think about automotive is the automotive -- the modern car is a connected car. And so visual computing matters more than ever. And instead of using traditional mechanical instrumentation, digital clusters provide them the opportunity to modernize the driving experience. The GPU -- because of the GPU -- the programmable GPU inside our processors make possible all kinds of new driver assistance capability because of computer vision, because of driver assistance, artificial intelligence type of capabilities. We make cars safer and we make main cars funner to drive. And so from digital clusters to infotainment systems to, in the future, driver assistance, the car is going to be an opportunity for more than just one GPU. And as we see the success of the Tesla electric car, I think you're going to see more and more car companies follow suit and be much more aggressive in adding mobile computing into the car. Now this is an area that we've invested quite a lot of effort over the years, and our expectation is to see continuous success here. Now design wins...",197,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And if the processor is designed with enough headroom, we'll be able to support higher bit rates and -- in an ever-changing landscape of protocols. And so if you'd see -- if you look at our progress, our progress with respect to getting Tegra 4i certified, and the i500 has also, by the way, been certified for voice and data, our speed of getting our Icera modem certified certainly is an indication of the flexibility of SDR. Now one of the historical challenges of SDR is thought to be power consumption, but those are not fundamental problems. Those are architectural and technology challenges. And with the right technology, the right architecture and a lot of great care, we've been able to make Tegra 4i and the i500 modems fit within very aggressive and competitive power envelopes.

Let's see. The Quadro growth drivers are fundamentally related to the fact that more and more companies are using digital design approaches for every aspect of their product design. There's so many companies who still use mechanical prototyping, actual prototyping and -- but today, unless -- if you really want to be able to -- state-of-the-art, create devices that are as exquisite as what we see in the marketplace today, or it is that you like to do more 3D virtual prototyping, all of that's going to require you to invest in designing in 3D. And so we're just seeing greater and greater adoption of 3D design in all aspects of product design. Now the second growth factor has to do with the fact that we're able to now, because of our rendering techniques, able to be -- we're able to add value to a larger part of the workflow, whereas before, where we're used for design, we're now used largely -- we're also used largely for styling because our visualization, our rendering is photorealistic now. We can capture real materials. So as a result, you can actually render using computers the ability to prototype devices that are photorealistic. We're also increasingly being used in product lifetime management, and so PLM. And now that's an -- that's just an increase in the number of people inside companies that would need to use 3D assets, whether it's in training or documentation or managing their supply chain, managing their subcontractors, inventory management, parts repairs. So more and more of the entire product lifetime includes 3D where Quadro could be useful. And then lastly, more and more countries are continuing to adopt manufacturing, not just for -- not just at the supply chain level, but at the design level. And so Quadro continues to surprise us with the size of the overall market. And I think when we innovate, we discover that the market is larger than people ever expected.",329,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

The thing that I do know is this: our market share in Quadro is very high. I really don't know of any car company or movie studio or digital broadcast station or oil or gas company that doesn't use Quadro in a large part of their entire workflow. And so I think the real opportunity for us is, of course, continue to expand globally and work with OEMs around the world to see their workstations be adopted by the various industries. That's a deliberate effort on our part. And we have OEM partnerships in every geography to expand their reach and their understanding of workstations in the local industries. And then secondarily, to continue to create new ways for workstations to be useful to more people, to more professionals inside a company, expanding our reach of their workflow. In those 2 dimensions that we continue to innovate and we continue to drive hard, I think we're going to -- we have every opportunity to outgrow the GDP.

Almost -- vastly everything else is Android. We have some for Win RT or Surface, but our focus is that going forward, the vast majority of Windows on ARM will be Surface. And so we're not -- we're -- the most of -- the vast majority of everything else in Tegra is Android. Now with respect to Android, you're absolutely right that Android is not just about phones. Android is the most disruptive operating system that we've seen in a few decades, in a couple of decades. And this time, because of the open source nature of Android, it could be adapted to all kinds of devices. You see that all of a sudden, not only is Android in smartphones, it was in tablets, it's now in all-in-one PCs. I think 3 all-in-one PCs based on Tegra was announced this last quarter. You're going to see more of them. And it's quite delightful to be able to buy a monitor, bring it home and plug it in and it's already a computer. And if you like, you could still connect it to HDMI, to a PC and use it as PC. You're going to see Android in all kinds of other computing devices, including set-top box and others. And so Android is probably the most versatile operating system that we've ever known and has the benefit of also being connected to cloud. And so the data, you turn it on, it's incredibly useful with all kinds of applications already on it. And so that's Android. Chrome, we have no exposure to Chrome today, but it's proven to be quite an important operating system. We've known all along that technologically, it's incredibly robust, resilient and high quality. And now we're seeing quite strong adoptions all over the world. And so this is an area that warrants focus on our part.

Thank you. Let's see. We announced GRID -- I mean, that is -- it is pretty -- it is probably one of the most successful product launches for enterprise that we've ever had. And you could argue that this is really NVIDIA's first enterprise product because workstations is in the sweet spot of enterprise computing. It's a specialized part of enterprise computing. And Tesla is for high-performance computing, which is not in the sweet spot of enterprise computing. This is the first time that we've been in the sweet spot of enterprise computing and had the benefit of the sales force of every major OEM in the world supporting this launch, from Cisco to Dell to HP to IBM, Fujitsu, Hitachi. I don't know of any global enterprise IT company who isn't supporting GRID and taking it to market. The type of applications that -- and we have the support of Citrix and VMware. Citrix, we announced in Q2, I think it was, and VMware was announced this last week -- this last quarter. And so we have sales force -- we have the largest extended sales force of any product that we've ever had. The type of applications that people are using it for are really essentially taking their PC and virtualizing and putting it in a data center. And the power of doing that is you can now access your PC from anywhere on any device. With a Citrix receiver client, with a VMware receiver client, you can now have your PC literally anywhere. Now there's several powerful benefits to that. For the people who are designing and working on large data sets, the benefit is that you've moved your computer closer to the data. So instead of moving the data to the computer, you're moving the computer to the data. And so for big data problems, large data sets, data or projects where you're collaborating with a whole lot of other people, you now have -- you now don't have a whole lot of different copies of data. You also have the benefit of mobility. People are using more and more mobile devices and people are working from customer sites and working from home or out giving demos. The benefit of having mobility is really incredible. And so there's a lot of different benefits associated with it. And then now, with the cost of storage continuing to reduce and the cost of networking continuing to reduce, you can now make these virtualized PC environments much more cost effectively. So I think our timing is good. Your question about adoption, about trial to ramp, these are enterprise trials. And my sense is that somewhere between 6 months to 9 months is what we're experiencing. And so we'll see how it turns out. But the trials that we have going around the world are large, important customers who have significant deployment to do. And the early response has been really fantastic.",494,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think that this time, the strategy that I've laid out for you guys before, basically, it's several things. One, we believe that Tegra 4 -- we delayed Tegra 4 so that we could pull in our Logan Project and also our modems. I am delighted with that decision. It put a trough in this year. However, we've bounced back from that. I think that what you will see is several things. One, there will be more devices ramped with Tegra 4. Tegra 4 should continue to contribute to our momentum recovery in Tegra. You should see that Tegra is adopted in more than just phones, that there will be phones and tablets and other devices, automotive and other devices. And then third, and you should see our modems come to market with important devices that I think people would love using. And then lastly, the gap between Tegra 4 and our next-generation processor, Project Logan, should be a lot shorter than 1 year. And so I think all of that is on track and we'll keep an eye on that.

I appreciate the question. Tegra Note is a reference platform. Tegra Note is a reference platform, albeit very complete. It has the additional qualities that the software is very polished and that it includes features like stylus, the world's first type high-performance passive stylus that is unique. It has the world's first always-on HDR that is unique. So it has capabilities that no other tablets have, no other devices have. And it has the benefit of having software that's completely polished and refined. But otherwise, it's a reference platform. And we direct our partners, particularly local brand holders around the world, who don't have the ability to invest in building such a great device at the ODMs that we partner with to have these devices built. But in the end, our business model there is to sell a chip, and we partner with local brand holders around the world to take these devices to market. With respect to SHIELD, it is our initiative to cultivate the gaming marketplace for Android. We believe that Android is going to be a very important platform for gaming into future. And to do so, we have to create devices that enable great gaming to happen on Android. Our investment there is modest, our expectations are modest and we're -- our distribution is modest. We built these devices. They're all -- they're in the hands of every developer in the world now. And the reviews have been fantastic, and we're going to let the market tell us how they like it and then we'll take it from there. And so for Tegra Note, the business model ultimately is to sell chips, partner with partners like we do with GeForce.

I appreciate the question, Rajvin. First of all, Tegra is not just about phones, although we have found success with Xiaomi and we've found success with others and we've participated in building some of the most exciting superphones in the marketplace, and we'll continue to do that. Tegra is not just about phones. Unlike the companies that you've named, NVIDIA's application processors can be successful and very successful without modems. However, there are many, many segments of our market going forward, where there -- where a data modem is important to have. And Icera gives us a platform to build the data modem, which we are very successful at already. I think the risk of our data modem success is not at all the concern. And in fact, we're incredibly proud of the performance of our data modem. It's a piece of technology and a companion part of our technology offering that's really important for us to have. If you look at Tegra, therefore, whether it's in phones or tablets or cars, set-top boxes, gaming devices, all-in-one PCs, Chrome PCs, they all require the same application processor. And so Tegra is more than just phones. And in many of those segments, a data modem is very important to have. And in one segment, a voice modem is very important to have. And so the way to think about our position, you have to think about the whole Android, the whole mobile technology market. You can't just think about phones, which is very unlike the 2 companies that you mentioned earlier. They tend to be very phone-centric. We're just simply not.
