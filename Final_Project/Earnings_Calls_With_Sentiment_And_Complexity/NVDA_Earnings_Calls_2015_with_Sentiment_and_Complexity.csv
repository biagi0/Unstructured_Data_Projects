First quarter revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $1.15 billion. Growth was driven by the strength in gaming, high-performance computing and cloud and automotive. Viewed from a segment perspective, GPU revenue was $940 million, up 5% year-over-year. Tegra processor revenue was $145 million, up 4% year-over-year. NVIDIA's business performed within expectations within the quarter. Our strategy of creating specialized platforms for gaming, enterprise, high-performance computing and cloud and automotive continues to gain traction, and we continue to reshape our organization to focus on them.
In Q1, these 4 growth platforms contributed to more than 80% of revenue, up from 68% a year ago. Gaming revenue was $587 million, up 25% year-over-year, powered by the strength of our Maxwell GPU architecture. Helping our performance was the launch of Titan X, the world's fastest GPU. Titan X, introduced at the Game Developers Conference, sets a new standard with the outstanding capabilities to drive 4K games and virtual reality titles. It delivers twice the performance and double the power efficiency of its predecessor. We also announced SHIELD, the world's first 4K smart TV device. SHIELD delivers video, music apps and high-quality games and uses Google voice search. It's powered by our Tegra X1 processor. The gaming market continues to expand. In the second half, we look forward to multiple drivers, including 4K, which quadruples the number of pixels to process; virtual reality; and the launch of Windows 10. Enterprise revenue was $190 million, down 4% year-over-year due to the weakness in European currencies. We continue to maintain strong market leadership with our Quadro products. During the quarter, we shared our vision for physically based rendering, which allows for the accurate simulation of real-life materials and their interaction with light. In the enterprise data center, NVIDIA's GRID graphics virtualization platform continues to hit key milestones. We now have over 250 enterprise customers with production deployment, up from just over 30 customers a year ago. In March, VMware, the virtualization market leader, shipped the latest versions of Horizon and vSphere with full support for NVIDIA GRID vGPU technology. More than 400 customers have signed on to the GRID early access program. HPC and cloud revenue was $79 million, up 57% year-on-year, with continued strength in the HPC market and among cloud service providers. Tesla products continue to benefit from widespread Internet interest in deep learning. One indication of our traction was the success in March of the GPU Technology Conference, or GTC, where we drew a record 4,000 attendees. Two of the world's most renowned deep learning experts, Google's Jeff Dean and Baidu's Andrew Ng, delivered keynotes at the event. A growing number of companies are now using Tesla GPUs for deep learning, including the world's leading cloud service providers like Baidu, Facebook, Flickr, Microsoft and Twitter, as well as a broad range of startups. Another indication of our traction is the success of our library for developers who implement deep neural networks. Since its March release, it has been downloaded by more than 5,000 deep learning developers.
During the quarter, we also hit a milestone for CUDA, our parallel computing platform. It's now been downloaded 3 million times since its 2006 launch, with 1 million downloads in the past 18 months alone. Automotive revenue had a record quarter at $77 million, growing 121% year-over-year. Our design wins in digital clusters and infotainment continue to ramp over multiple automotive OEMs. At GTC, 25 global automakers and Tier 1 suppliers were represented, including developers and researchers from such companies as Audi, BMW, Delphi and Elektrobit. Their enthusiasm reflects the interest, increasing importance of visual computing for automotive and our position as a key technology provider for this market. We also announced the availability of our DRIVE PX deep learning development platform. It will provide researchers with the computing platform and software tools to develop algorithms for self-driving cars. We have started shipping DRIVE PX to developers around the world. The OEM and IT platform had revenue of $218 million, down 38% year-over-year. This reflected a combination of end-of-life for Tegra OEM design as well as continued weakness in PC OEM sales. The weakness in PC OEMs has been broadly reported and attributed to foreign exchange rates and delays in purchasing leading up to the launch of Windows 10.
Regarding IP. Our case is progressing against Samsung and Qualcomm. Last month, NVIDIA received a favorable pretrial claim construction ruling in the case. The case is set to be heard at the U.S. International Trade Commission beginning next month.
Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margins was a record 56.7%, above our outlook for the quarter and up 80 basis points from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins was 56.9%, also above our outlook and up 70 basis points sequentially. Our strong margins resulted from a richer product mix. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $477 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $425 million, in line with our outlook and inclusive of $16 million of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. GAAP net income was $134 million, down 2% from a year ago. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.24 was similar to a year ago.
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q1, our cash and marketable securities balance grew to $4.79 billion. During the first quarter, we paid $46 million in cash dividends, and we repurchased 2.4 million shares. As a result, we returned an aggregate of $99 million to shareholders. Today, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.0975 per share. We have also announced our intent to increase our capital return to shareholders to $800 million in fiscal year 2016 from $600 million through cash dividends and share repurchases. Further, our Board of Directors has extended the previously authorized repurchase program through to December 2018 and authorized an additional $1.62 billion for an aggregate of $2 billion available for repurchase. We are committed to capital returns as an essential component in delivering shareholder value.
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2016 to be $1.01 billion, plus or minus $2 billion -- I mean, 2%.
In addition to seasonality, 2 factors informed our Q2 guidance. European currency weakness is affecting overall demand. Also, as widely reported by OEMs, a combination of seasonality and a lull ahead of Windows 10 launch are impacting the PC market. The overall dynamics of our business are great. Gaming is expanding and 4K, virtual reality and Windows 10 will lift it further. GPU-accelerated data centers are expanding, and deep learning is a new, exciting application. And the market for car computers is expanding. We have an excellent position in each of these growth markets. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.7% and 56%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This outlook is slightly below Q1 margins, reflecting our product mix. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $474 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $425 million, flat with last quarter. We announced earlier this week that we will begin to wind down our Icera modem operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We are open to the sale of the technology or operations. We estimate restructuring target -- charges to our GAAP results in the range of $100 million to $125 million, primarily during fiscal 2016. These charges will consist of severance and other employee termination benefits, tax expense items and other costs associated with the wind-down if we are unable to sell the modem operations. The Icera wind-down or sale is expected to benefit non-GAAP operating expenses in the second half of the year, and we will carefully invest in our growth initiatives of deep learning, self-driving cars and gaming. We expect our fiscal year '16 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat with fiscal year '15, excluding litigation costs. Fiscal year '16 litigation costs are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million as we defend our intellectual property. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal year '16 are expected to be 23% million and 21%, plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook amounts exclude restructuring charges associated with the wind-down if the company is unable to sell the modem operations.

Again, we still see this as a business that we're going to still try our hardest for the overall growth. But what we see going into Q2 is a very soft market with the PC OEMs, and we do see probably a seasonal decline as we go into Q2. From a gross margin perspective, on the outlook and what we see, that is really driven from a mix perspective of decline in revenue from Q1 to Q2, and we still expect gaming to be great during that time and add value to our gross margins. But just because of the overall mix of what else is in the portfolio, we do expect it to come down to about 56%.",145,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

What we want to discuss is our markets are extremely healthy. Yes, gaming, automotive, high-performance computing, great leadership position, very healthy TAMs. How they'll grow specifically quarter-to-quarter, we'll see at the end of the quarter. But we've talked about we have a strong list of design wins for automotive. With that strong list of design wins, we can expect our revenue to grow in that area. If it grows specifically between Q1 and Q2, we'll have to see based on when the manufacturers want to pull the inventory for their lines. And so that's not necessarily fully in our control. But long term, this is a growth opportunity for us as we outlined our growth platforms.

If we assume that there is some growth in Tegra sequentially in the June quarter and the royalty stays the same, as it always does, for time being, it would basically imply that the GPU business, including workstation, is going to be down something like 16% sequentially.

How fast it will grow, we will have to see at the end of Q2. But keep in mind, there is generally a sequential seasonal decline as we move into our Q2 that we're going to see. So we don't have a specific number at this time in terms of our overall GPU business.

When you look at the timing of when we initiated our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm, it was relatively at the latter or the end of fiscal year '15. So there's not a material amount in fiscal year '15 associated with the legal expenses. So the way you can look at it is we have called out a potential range of what we see for fiscal year '16 to help you going forward, and so you should just use the baseline of fiscal year '15 as a total for rest of the OpEx to be flat.",98,2.0,5.0,0.6111111111111112,0.5

Certainly, every production is a little bit different because every company is a different size.

And the reason for that is because over time, not only will we get new customers into production, but existing customers will deploy more broadly. And so my expectation is that we should get growth on both sides of it. And once an IT department gets this, it's a network-based virtualization technology. And so, of course, it's just enormously helpful that VMware has now integrated vGPU, GRID into both Horizon as well as vSphere. And so from end-to-end, we now have GRID certified in large corporations. The VMware is certified, Citrix is certified. Both of their sales force, the sales force at the OEMs, are all aligned with us and working on engaging customers all over the world. And so the first thing that they do, of course, is to test all of their applications, and large companies have a lot of different applications in the works. It could be SolidWorks, it could be Autodesk, AutoCAD, it could be Adobe Photoshop or Premiere or After Effects or -- I mean, it could be all kinds of applications that requires 3D graphics acceleration. And so once they certified that in fact -- qualified that in fact the applications all are perfectly compatible, which we largely expect them to be, then they start deploying them over the network. And some networks need to be shored up because this is about virtualizing the whole PC, and so it's being streamed over the corporate network, so some of the networks need to be shored up and then, of course, making sure that all of the end users are satisfied with the experiences that they have, which largely they've been more than delighted because, as you could imagine, having an accelerated -- GPU-accelerated virtualization platform has got to be pretty exciting. And so far, we've seen that the trials have gone over nicely. And then, as more people use it, the more people will want to enjoy it. And we hope that not only will we increase the number of customers but the number of seats within each customer over time.",354,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So my question is, what tangible data points can you point us to that says that the number of gamers is actually increasing and that this is really a growth market for NVIDIA?",87,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

I think you're getting a lot of anecdotal evidence from multiple directions that suggests that PC gaming is growing. First of all, eSports. You know that eSports is largely PC gaming. And eSports has become so large now that it's even highlighted on ESPN2 -- ESPN. You know that the number of stadiums they have sold out as a result of eSport tournaments is growing over time. So there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that video games is growing. I think it's also pretty clear that almost every new human is a gamer, where -- when the previous generation before me, very few are gamers. My generation, I would say, probably is 25% gamers; my kids' generation is probably 75% gamers; and the generation after that has got to be 100% gamers. And so games is no longer a niche. Game is really a pop culture now. And we expect gaming to continue to expand. And then the last thing is, last reason why I'd say we'll get multiple uplifts in gaming has to do with the new mediums that are coming out. 4K displays are becoming quite commoditized and quite affordable, and that has 4x as many pixels to process. And so although the imagery is much richer, you need a much more powerful GPU to drive it. We're looking forward to VR. VR Is launching later this year, and VR is going to be launching on multiple platforms. And in order to enjoy great VR, you need 90 frames per second in stereo with 2 eyes. And so unless you have something along the lines of a GTX 980 or TITAN, at the moment, it's kind of hard to enjoy great VR. And anybody who has tried VR is generally blown away by it, and that explains the enthusiasm in the industry. So whether it's eSports or the fact that just more people are playing games that are growing up and familiar with the format and the new mediums that are coming out, 4K and VR, and of course, Windows 10 is going to really help. Windows 10 is a great operating system and has DX12, and DX12 is a fantastic new API. It's been a while since we've had a new 3D API, so we're excited about DX12. So there's a lot of things going in gaming. That explains the reason why it just continues to grow.",408,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And as my follow-up, I think we sort of understand the slowdown near term. How should we think about the back half conceptually? Like how much of the slowdown right now is because of temporary factors? And how much can we expect to recover in the back half? Should it be normal seasonality in the back half? I know it's a little early to give guidance, but just conceptually, how are you thinking about the back half of the year?",84,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

I appreciate that. We give guidance once a quarter, 1 quarter ahead. But if you look at the overall market, we expect seasonality. But more importantly, our position in the growth markets are really great. First of all, gaming is growing, as we previously discussed. The second half of this year, you are going to see multiple growth drivers: 4K monitor pricing is really coming down; VR is launching in the second half; and Windows 10 with DirectX 12 is launching in the second half, not to mention all the great games coming out. So I think that's the growth driver. We continue to see that our GPU business for accelerated data centers continues to grow. It grew more than 50% year-over-year. We are going to -- we expect it to continue to grow with the enthusiasm around this new application called deep learning. We're seeing artificial intelligence work in every single country by every single computer company and every single large application developer. The ability to predict the future for better applications and smarter applications is pretty abundant. And lastly, we had a record quarter with our automotive business. We're growing now faster than doubling. And computing in cars, as you can imagine, is going to continue to expand. So these growth drivers, I think, are pretty fundamental to the market, and we have great positions in all 3 of them.",233,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So the question for you is, just help -- just remind us, where does GPGPU fit into that? And how should we think about the market? Intel's DCG revenues are $14-odd billion, and the Tesla trajectory, from what you had -- when you initially started the product out a few years ago, it was slow to start, but it's picked up. So 5 years out, how should we be thinking about the addressable market and just help us -- just remind us, where does GPGPU fit in? And how should we think about coprocessors from FPGA? And where are the specific needs, workloads-wise or whatever. However you can help us, enlighten us would be great.",152,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

First of all, CUDA, the GPGPU technology that we invented, is growing more than 50% per year. The applications for CUDA ranges from deep learning to image processing to natural language processing to weather simulations, fluid dynamic simulations, molecular dynamic simulations, quantum chemistry simulations, astrophysics simulations, gosh, ray tracing. The number of applications that I -- we can spew off is pretty endless, and that's one of the reasons why nearly every single OEM in the world today has GPU-accelerated servers. There has got to be some 200 different SKUs of GPU-accelerated servers being offered by OEMs around the world. I don't think one of them offer an FPGA server yet. And so that's one indication. The number of applications, the number of OEMs, the number of industries that we now serve with GPGPU, with Tesla, if you will, is really quite large and explains why this segment, this market, this business for us is growing over 50% per year. And it's now off of a relatively large base. So that, I think, is the way to think about, if you will, the evidence of success. Now the reason for that, of course, is that CUDA is a processor architecture. It's an instruction-set architecture. It's completely software-programmable. It has the support of tools and profilers and all kinds of middlewares from around the industries. So it's a general-purpose parallel computing architecture, and it's completely reprogrammable. Whereas an FPGA is like a reconfigurable ASIC, which means the person who designs it, the person who reprograms it, if you will, reconfigures it, has to know how to design a chip. And there aren't that many people in the world who knows how to design chips. There's got to be a 1000x more software programmers than there are the number of chip designers. And so one is reprogrammable, general-purpose programmable; the other one is reconfigurable, if you will, which explains the general-purpose nature of Tesla. It explains the vast number of applications of it. It's taken a long term. I mean, it takes a long time to create a new computing architecture. And in fact, aside from Tesla, aside from CUDA, I actually don't know of another new type of instruction set that has come to the world. It's been a long time. I mean, the world's had DSPs now for a long time. It's had CPUs for a long time. Aside from GPGPU, I don't think another general-purpose programmable architecture has emerged into the world in a very long time. And the niche that we discovered was parallel processing, that we believe there's a lot of problems in the world, a lot of applications in the world, where you could process it massively in parallel. And that explains the reason why you could create a supercomputer like the one at Oak Ridge that has 36 -- 38 million CUDA processor cores all processing in parallel, 38 million cores, all processing in parallel. And now the DOE has tasked us and IBM to partner together to build supercomputers that are going to 100x that. And so the parallel computing capability and the scalability of CUDA that we invented is really quite phenomenal. And this explains the reason for its success. I appreciate the question.",542,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I appreciate that question. We wouldn't invest $70 million to $90 million to defend our patents unless we expect a substantial return on that investment. This -- we don't go into litigation lightly. And in fact, quite frankly, I don't recall the last time we served against somebody. And so I think this is something we took with a great deal of consideration. And at the highest level, the way to think about it is this: we've invented more in modern computer graphics and modern visual computing than just about any company and, in fact, all the companies combined. We invented a GPU that everybody -- just about everybody in mobile today, large or small in volume, are utilizing in some way. We invented a programmable shader, and we invented -- and the question that was just asked of me that I appreciated was we invented GPGPUs. And these technologies are really fundamental to modern computer companies. And whether it's mobile, car computers, supercomputers, you name it, our technology is pretty vital to it. And so it's necessary for us and for all of our shareholders that we defend this, from all of our employees that come here to do their life's work so that they invent all this stuff to the shareholders that have entrusted us to make these investments, we have to go and make sure that we get the appropriate return on investment. You also know that today's technology industry, the supply chain, is much more complicated, if you will, than it used to be. And at the core, NVIDIA is an IP company. We don't make steel, we don't make concrete, and we don't really even make wafers. We are an IP company at our core. And so we're comfortable making our innovations and our work products available, whether it's in a service or GPU or add-in card or even in IP form. And so our expectation is that, one, we have to defend it; two, the return on that investment should be very, very high, because the exposure of the inventions that we've made in the industries that I mentioned just a moment ago are quite large and so...",365,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And the power of cloud computing is pretty extraordinary. It's like everybody gets a supercomputer. And more and more of our GPUs are now going into the cloud data centers, and so my expectation is that long term, we likely will see more and more of these type of thin, delightfully small and long battery life computers. And so I think that, that trend is inevitable. However, x86 is really still quite important in so many industries, whether it's in high-performance computing, the energy efficiency of Intel CPUs in a data center is pretty hard to overcome. I mean, they've done an incredibly good job. The workstation industry, CATIA, Autodesk's applications, Adobe applications, so many of these applications that large companies rely on, that legacy is 35 years old. And it explains also the reason why our Quadro business is so sticky and our position there so strong that the legacy is quite strong, and people rely on that platform for their -- to run their business. And so my expectation is that x86 and Intel architecture has its place in the world and that ARM is also going to be -- of course, has the opportunity to bring computing to a large number of people, especially smaller devices that are connected to cloud. So my -- you're talking to somebody who believes in computing, and you're talking to somebody who believes that the future of computing has really just started.

And it's here to stay because there are some genres of games that are just better with the keyboard and mouse. And you can play your game in your bedroom and not have to share it with anybody in the living room. On the other hand, there is $1 billion people who have not had the benefit of enjoying the type of AAA games that are largely, largely in game consoles, which is a little bit like a cable box, if you will, a dedicated thing that people buy to now be able to enjoy it broadly in living rooms all over the world. So I think there's still ways to expand the reach of gaming, and that's why we are building SHIELD, and that's why we're building GRID. We believe that long term, video games, like video, like movies, will become democratized. And it would be, if you will, virtualized and put into the cloud like Netflix and for us to be able to enjoy it all over the world. And  so I believe that. And we've got to go lay the foundation necessary to go bring that to the world. I'm pretty excited about some of the work that we're going to reveal this year, and I think we just have to push on all of those vectors. I think all of those vectors are real. PC gaming is going to keep growing. Cloud gaming will come. And Android gaming on TVs will disrupt the market, I believe in all those -- all 3 things simultaneously.",268,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I appreciate that question. I think if you back off and look at the larger dynamic of gaming, the larger dynamic of PC gaming, the primary driver of PC gaming comes from 2 areas: one is amazing new games, that's number one; number two is brand-new technologies, whether it's a brand new GPU, amazing new display technology, and 4K is -- I would characterize as amazing new display technology. And then -- and new technologies like VR. So new technologies are the reasons why people come to upgrade. And so new games that are just amazing, and they need new GPUs, or just amazing new GPUs that cause the installed base to upgrade. And so those are the 2 primary reasons. However, this year and starting in Q1 and surely we're experiencing some of it in Q2 as well is the currency disruption that we -- that's been broadly described. That, I think, has a pretty significant impact because what it does is just makes all the GPUs more unaffordable. And so everything just got more expensive in Europe. And so -- but that's something that hopefully will pass, and I'm looking forward to what happens in the second half. VR is coming, okay, and you know how excited everybody is about VR. There is good reason for that from John Carmack and Tim Sweeney and the leaders of the gaming industry. I mean, we all now recognize that VR is going to be the future of gaming. And although we're going to continue to use monitors for many types of games and many genres of games and we'll play it on TV and such, but there will be a very large genre of games based around VR, and there's no question about that now. And so I'm excited about the rollout of VR across the industry in the second half. And of course, you just can't -- you can't not get excited about VX12 and Windows 10. I mean, it's just -- I think it's going to be a pretty big deal. So I think second half should be exciting, and we're looking forward to it.",359,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And it's just that our strategy is very different now. We used to be  much more of a components supplier competing directly with other components suppliers, but increasingly, we're really a differentiated platform supplier. And so you find that the software that we -- the software investments that we've made over the years really, really increasingly define our product. I mean, if you think about Tesla, the amount of software that's stacked on top of Tesla from all the tools that we've created, the middleware, the libraries, the programming models, the robustness of all of it, the integration with all of the industries' software products and everybody else's software that's built on top of Tesla is pretty daunting. And so it's hardly just a GPU anymore. GRID is all about software. I mean, otherwise, it's just another one of our GPUs. And so GRID is largely about software, virtualization software, concurrency software, the ability to deal with very, very low-latency streaming, the integration with all the tools in the world and all the other platforms in the world. And so I think when we think about our products and our platforms, it's really about the differentiated value that we built on top of our GPUs, number one; and number two, the deep integration with the large ecosystems around the world to the point where other companies' capabilities are really going down to this platform, making this platform more valuable to customers. And so that's really what's changed about our company's strategy and why increasingly, we look very different than other component suppliers.",280,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And Q1 was relatively fine for us. What we said was that we're going to let the broad -- what's broadly impacting the rest of the industry inform us about Q2. And we think that when it comes down to enterprise, that's one of the factors, enterprise does effect us when enterprise slows down because of FX issues or delays in purchase because of Windows 10. Workstations is part of enterprise, servers that they buy is part of enterprise, and so it affects us there. We still have a piece of our business that, even though it's a rather small percentage of our business at this point, it's still nonzero. Our PC OEM business is affected by what's happening around the world. And so it's -- I would say that yes, our Q2 was informed by all of those factors. But I would say that also our core business is really doing well. Gaming is robust, and I expect gaming to continue to grow. The work that we're doing in accelerated data centers, it grew 50% year-over-year, and my expectation is that's going to be a strong business for us going forward. And the success that we're seeing in automotives and the expansion of car computers has allowed us to double our business there. So our core businesses are growing very nicely and largely independent of what is being experienced in PC OEMs globally.",252,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We go to a new process when we're ready to go to a new process. And as you know, we could wring out new architectural efficiencies in exactly the same process technology for several generations with 28-nanometer. The difference between Kepler and Maxwell is pretty amazing. To be able to deliver twice the energy efficiency in 1 generation using exactly the same process is pretty exciting. And so I think there is -- there are many ways to skin the cat, and we surely expect and we surely expect to go and look forward to going to next-generation of nodes. But the GPU is a piece of the puzzle. The algorithms we put into GPUs is a very important piece of the puzzle. The software on top of it is a piece of the puzzle, and the system design is a piece of the puzzle. There are just so many ways for us to deliver energy efficiency and performance.

Second quarter revenue was $1.15 billion, up 5% from a year earlier and well above our forecast of $1.01 billion. Growth was driven by our GTX gaming platform's continued momentum, the gaming market's underlying strength and increased automotive sales. Viewed from a segment perspective, GPU revenue was $959 million, up 9% year-over-year. Tegra processor revenue was $128 million, down 19% from a year earlier.
In the face of challenges on both the macro and semiconductor fronts, NVIDIA is executing well, helped by our sharp focus and strong market positions. Our strategy for creating platforms for gaming, enterprise graphics and virtualization, HPC and cloud and automotive continues to serve us well as visual computing becomes increasingly more important in these industries. In Q2, these 4 platforms contributed 85% of our revenue, up from 68% a year earlier.
First, let's start with gaming, a market that's global and growing. Sales of PC gaming systems this year are estimated at $28 billion with continued expansion expected. eSports professional online gaming competitions is now a major entertainment category with a growing audience of 130 million. This week's championship tournament of DOTA 2 offers a purse of $18 million compared with $10 million for the PGA Open Golf event, and there are now over 80 million people enjoying multiplayer online battle arena games, twice that of 3 years ago. Our gaming revenue rose 59% year-on-year to $661 million. This exceptional performance reflects the buoyant gaming market as well as the continued strength of our Maxwell-based GeForce GPUs for the enthusiast and performance categories.
The newly launched flagship GTX 980 Ti has received outstanding reviews. AnandTech, for example, called it the card that all other high-end video cards are measured against. Across all regions, gamers are flocking to advanced GPUs to play enormously popular games with high production values like Grand Theft Auto V and Witcher 3. Demand is also being driven by excitement around new gaming technologies, including 4K, VR and DirectX 12.
During the quarter, we rolled out SHIELD Android TV, a revolutionary device that connects your TV to an infinite world of entertainment. The world's first 4K smart TV, SHIELD was created for a new age of television, where movie, music, games and apps are delightfully simple to enjoy on one platform. SHIELD is the first of the next-generation smart TV devices. The first were streamers like Chromecast and Roku. The next will feature 4K, powerful processors and rich app stores. We are excited to take SHIELD globally as supply comes online and exciting applications become available.
Moving to enterprise. Our enterprise graphics and virtualization revenue declined 14% year-on-year to $187 million. Our Quadro business was hampered by the weak refresh cycle and workstation market. We look forward to launching the year's second half of workstations based on Windows 10, Intel's Skylake and new Quadro GPUs. We continue to make good headway with our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphic-rich applications, like design tools from Adobe and Autodesk, to employees on any device anywhere. The number of GRID customers has more than tripled in the past year to over 300 from a broad range of industries. Among the more than 40 customers added this quarter are the University of Southern California; Textron, the maker of Bell Helicopters; and Gensler, the global architecture firm. Nearly 1/4 of the Fortune 100 are now in trials or in deploying GRID.
In HPC and cloud, revenue declined 15% year-on-year to $62 million, reflecting lumpiness from major deep learning projects. We strengthened our offerings in the rapid-growing field of deep learning, building on momentum from our March GPU Technology Conference. We launched DIGITS 2, CUDA N3, GPU-accelerated software that doubles deep learning performance for data scientists and researchers. Deep learning adoption continues to grow with multiple developers for voice-recognition platforms serving vast numbers of consumers. We are now engaged with more than 3,300 developers and companies interested in this area. Moreover, nearly 30,000 professionals on LinkedIn identified themselves as having proficiency in CUDA, our language for programming GPUs. In addition, GPU computing in the cloud continues to gather momentum, with multiple leading cloud services providers offering GPU computing resources. We are also excited by the opportunities presented by President Obama's call last week for the U.S. to build an exascale supercomputer, one 30x faster than today's most powerful systems. Just as GPU technologies are being used to build the pre-exascale computers coming online in the years ahead, we believe they will be important for exascale.
Finally, automotive revenue rose 76% year-over-year to $71 million. Momentum here continues with new designs at new and existing customers. Hitting the road this quarter in North America, for example, is Audi's TT sports car, which features a full digital dashboard power by Tegra. In addition to our infotainment cockpit business, we are working with more than 50 companies interested in using NVIDIA DRIVE PX in their autonomous driving efforts.
Last quarter, we announced our intention to sell or wind down our Icera modem operations. In the absence of a viable buyer, we are winding it down. Accordingly, we have incurred this quarter $103 million in restructuring charges net of tax. GAAP gross margin was 55.0% and incorporates our warranty provision for SHIELD tablet. Non-GAAP gross margins was 56.6%, in line with our outlook. Margins were slightly lower than the previous quarter, as the strength of GeForce GTX revenue was offset by a lower mix of enterprise and accelerated computing GPUs. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $558 million, inclusive of $89 million of restructuring and other expenses associated with the wind-down of Icera modem operations. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $421 million, including litigation charges, slightly below our outlook. GAAP net income was $26 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.05, including $0.19 charge for Icera and $0.02 charge for the recall. Non-GAAP net income was $190 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.34. Earnings grew 13% year-over-year.
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q2, our cash and marketable securities balance was $4.51 billion. During the second quarter, we paid $52 million in cash dividends and $400 million associated with an accelerated repurchase agreement. As a result, we returned an aggregate of $452 million to shareholders following $99 million in the first quarter.
Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2016 to be $1.18 billion, plus or minus 2%. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming continues to accelerate, and 4K, VR, Windows 10 and a pipeline of exciting games will lift it further. GPU-accelerated data centers are expanding, deep learning is a new exciting application and the market for car computers is expanding. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.2% and 56.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This outlook is slightly below Q2 margins, reflecting our product mix. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $484 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $435 million. We expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat with fiscal year 2015, excluding litigation costs, which are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million as we defend our intellectual property. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 22% and 20%, respectively, plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook amounts exclude restructuring charges, which are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million in the second half of fiscal 2016.

And then on top of that, GTX 980 Ti seems to be doing very well in the market. Why wouldn't we expect more seasonal growth in the business here for October? I guess, the question is, maybe offsetting that, are you guys still seeing headwinds in the enterprise and cloud or PC OEM segments in Q3?",98,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

The first one is the blockbuster titles that you mentioned. The installed base of game platforms is growing so greatly that developers can now invest an enormous amount in the production value of great games. In the second half, you're going to see some pretty amazing games. I mean, you didn't mention Star Wars. Myself along with everybody else are practically out of our minds waiting for it, and I think this is going to be a huge game, Call of Duty, of course; Assassin's Creed, of course; Metal Gear Solid is going to be huge. The second half of the year, we're going to see some really huge games. The second dynamic is just eSports. eSports is probably the most social gaming platform that we have, and the reason for that is because you want to play with your friends. And it's also a form of gaming where milliseconds could make the difference between winning or losing. So performance of your platform matters a great deal. And it's a solely PC phenomenon, and it's a global phenomenon. In just a few years' time, eSports has doubled to almost 100 million gamers around the world. And this is, as I mentioned, is social, and so therefore, the network effect is quite important. And that's why you can imagine it doubling in just a few short years. And the larger the numbers, it just seems like the larger the numbers become. And the third driver for gaming this holiday season is the combination of several platforms coming together, finally. 4k is here, the pricing is fantastic now. Windows 10 is great, and the Skylake platform from Intel is going into production now. And then the fourth driver is a driver that we all have heard a great deal about, and surely the experience is as wonderful as the promise, is VR. VR will go into production in the second half of the year. Each one of these drivers are pretty large scale, and so I would agree with you that my expectation would be that gaming is going to continue to grow and high-end gaming, particularly, is going to grow nicely. The guidance that we provided is the guidance that we think makes sense at this time, and then we will report on how it turns out at the end of the quarter.",408,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And then, the team has got this great pipeline of auto design wins, and with the new model changeover that's happening now that you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks, how is this expanding the number of new models that are rolling out here in the second half of the year that are using the Tegra platform and that you would also be recognizing revenue on, on a go-forward basis?

We have 8 million cars on the road now. We have 30 million more cars coming with our Tegra platform in it. And our recent initiative of utilizing deep learning in our CUDA processors, the Tegra processors for autonomous driving, is really gaining a lot of traction. We're now engaged with about 50 companies around the world developing autonomous vehicles. The advantage that we have is the ability to capture camera inputs from all around the car, in addition to other sensors from LiDAR to radar to sonar. And sensor fusion is just such an important part of autonomous driving that this Tegra platform, we call it the DRIVE PX platform, is really incredibly valuable to the car companies. And so we're developing autonomous driving vehicles with many, many of them at the moment. So I expect the car business to continue to grow, and hard to exactly to say how it's going to do the second half. It depends on how many cars get sold. But there's no question at all that, year-over-year, the growth is going to be steady, and it's going to keep going for several years.",201,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

In terms of VR, as you mentioned, some of the new products will go into production this year. As far as a bigger demand inflection for that technology goes, approximately when would you think that would be really taking off in terms of unit volumes, and also helping to uplift your GPU business further? And related to that, just given that you have a lot of development on the software side as well as on the hardware products in terms of your SHIELD products, does it make sense for NVIDIA to go more vertically integrated for VR products?",107,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And if we just take a couple, 200,000, 300,000, they tend to require higher-end GPUs because you're driving stereo, you need to have extremely low latency, and you need to have 90 frames a second so that you don't see flicker. And so those factors combined requires you to have a relatively high-end GPU. Several hundred thousand new high-end GPUs at several hundred dollars apiece adds up a bit. And that would be for the first year. It's hard to say exactly how big the VR market becomes ultimately. But if you had a chance to try it, it's really a whole new experience. Being immersive, it just doesn't begin to explain how wonderful it is. And so, I think, the buzz around VR from all the people that have experienced it and the content developers that have spoken so highly of it is consistent with the reality at this point. It's taken many years -- many decades, frankly, several decades to have brought VR to this point. And I think that it surely it looks like it's ready. As to the question of what can we do more in VR, there's quite a bit that we can do in VR, and we're working with Oculus and we're working with Valve to really integrate the entire rendering pipeline, the entire experience into a seamless one. That's an extraordinary amount of work to do already. In the other industries, we're going to see a lot of adoption in VR. This is an area where our workstation business, our Quadro business is going to get a really great lift. And the reason for that, of course, is being able to see and experience a product in virtual reality before you manufacture it. And so whether you're designing a building or designing a car or creating a showroom, the ability to be able to put it on VR and experience it before you build it is quite an extraordinary benefit. And so we're going to see some exciting adoption in the design community as well. So there's plenty of work to do, plenty of innovation at the rendering layer for us to do. So I think that's plenty for now.",391,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Well, answering the second part first. We monitor sell-out in the channel literally every day, and so that's how we manage inventory. We don't manage inventory on sell-in, we manage inventory on sell-out. And so having our own specialized platforms instead of selling into OEMs gives us a lot more visibility, frankly, than we've ever had before. As you know, we really changed our business model. From a company that sold components to PC OEMs and OEMs -- mobile OEMs, we're now focused on specialized platforms for specialized applications. And we have identified 4 applications where we could add a lot value. And in each one of these 4 applications, we're so much closer to the marketplace that the visibility is just surely better. If you go back to the first part of your question, I think 90 days ago, just about everybody was rather uncertain about what was happening. There were a lot of changes going on around the world. Surely, there's still changes around the world, but for

Jen-Hsun, as my follow-up, could you talk about your average content in the car? Where is it now? Where can it get to? Because I think you mentioned that 30 million cars -- I think you have mentioned 25 million before, and if I take the 30 million cars [indiscernible], it means it's roughly 10% share of all the cars that are sold in a given year. So you're penetrating just the high end of the car. So please talk about like what the direction is? If you could quantify, that'll be very useful. And then, in terms of penetration, is it just the high-end or are you able to get it to the midrange and mass-market as well?",121,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

And our value proposition, as you can imagine, tends to be where visual computing is really important, and it could be because of large surround and dynamic infotainment systems, virtual cockpits where you've got the digital dashboard, and it's rich and it's moving, and infotainment's integrated into it and maps integrated into it. You might have several virtual machines that are running at the same time so that infotainment and digital clusters are not integrated into one computer and provide a safety among itself. It could be, in the future, several computers inside the car, some in the front, some in the back, as displays become more affordable and people's expectation for rich graphics continue to grow. You could expect us to have infotainment systems, virtual clusters as well as drive computers that are used for driver assistance or autonomous driving. And so there's a lot of different ways that a computer is going to be included in cars. I think, largely, the trend is very, very clear that in the future, the best way to add value to products is to connect them to the Internet and make them computerized, make it a software-defined product. And I think your car is going to become a software-defined car and the amount of processing inside will continue to grow at an exponential level. And as a visual computing company, we think we can add a lot of value here. And so I think our software content is going to continue to grow. This isn't like our parents' car industry anymore.

We are really, really proud of our software. And in the final analysis, a computer is not just a bunch of silicon, the computer is silicon and software and algorithms and system software and all kinds of stuff in the middle. And you can't just be a good transistor slinger, if you will, and you have to create ultimately a great experience. And in the final analysis, NVIDIA is a visual computing company, which is everything that includes architecture and silicon and system software and algorithms and deep understanding of applications and everything in the middle and being able to optimize it across that entire stack. So first of all, I appreciate that comment. However, it turns out that it's not solely because of our software that the Maxwell architecture delivers so much performance, even though the memory that we use is relatively available. And the reason for that is because Maxwell includes a groundbreaking piece of memory technology inside the chip that compresses, reorders and does amazing things so that we effectively received 1.5x our bandwidth through amplification of compression and others. And so it's a brand-new technique that has taken us several years to create. And as a result, we got a lot of defective bandwidth out of Maxwell because of that. The benefit of doing it with this approach, of course, is that we can scale it across the entire family of Maxwell GPUs, all the way from the Titan X to the GTX 980 Ti to the 980 to the 970 to the 960. And so we could take it all the way to the mainstream because of this technique. I think your question about long-term roadmap, I'd like to reserve the opportunity to surprise you with some new products in the future. However, one thing that I can tell you is this, and I think maybe you're alluding to it, people have observed us increasing performance 2x every 1.5 years for quite a long time, 2x maybe even in a year's time frame. And we defied Moore's Law. But the reason for that is because Moore's Law isn't a transistor law necessarily. Moore's Law is an innovation law, and we can innovate across multiple layers, from architecture, to the silicon, to the silicon design, to all of the system components around it, to the algorithm on top, to the system software that you mentioned just now, great software. We can innovate across so many layers independently and together, that we can bring value to the marketplace irrespective. For example, you're probably alluding to the fact that we stayed on 28-nanometer for quite a long time, and we did. And yet during that time, we increased performance by a factor of 4 to 5 in 1 node. And so I expect that we'll be able to continue to do that.",485,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

And maybe if I could talk about the workstation and the Tesla business? It seems like it slowed down a little bit in Q2.

And do you expect some kind of acceleration either in Q3 or Q4?",69,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

And I would say that in the case of our workstation platform, it probably was also postponed because the new platform architecture from Intel was delayed by a little bit. And Skylake is a really excellent platform. It has a higher-speed connectivity, it has the ability to support more memory, and including DDR4 memory. And in the space of workstations, where the data set is very, very large and moving data in and out of the computer is so important, having that connectivity and IO capability is really important. And so I think that, along with everybody else, we're all delighted that Windows 10 is now out and Skylake is now ramping in production, and hopefully, the OEMs can launch a new line of great workstations. Long-term, the way to think about it is this, and the way I look at it is, Quadro is all about design and creativity. And there's no question that more and more people are using digital approaches to design things and create products. And so long as people design and create in digital, it's going to be a growth opportunity for Quadro. As for Tesla, it is a growing business, but it's still a lumpy business. And the reason for that is because every so often, the data center comes in or a supercomputer comes in and buys tens of thousands of chips to outfit a data center or outfit a supercomputer. And so we're going to expect to see lumpiness. But the trend is clearly visible, that accelerated computing is the way to the future. In fact, I don't think that we've ever experienced something like this. But President Obama, this last week, signed an executive order that multiple agencies in the government will collaborate with education and industry to create an exascale computing platform. And then just to put that in perspective, exascale is literally 30x faster than the fastest supercomputer we have in our country. And with President Obama's executive order, we're going to be able to create not only the world's fastest supercomputer, but 30x faster than what we currently have in United States. Now just to help you understand some of the sentiments around that executive order, it's really to help the nation find a path forward in the post-Moore's-Law era, and it says it so explicitly. In order to achieve an exascale computing capability in some reasonable time without power going through the roof -- let me just give you one example. In order to reach approximately 1 exascale in the next several years or half decade, we would need a power plant using -- if we just use CPUs alone, we would need a power plant of about 1 billion watts. That's effectively powering a computer with a nuclear power plant. However, using accelerated computing, which is the way the Titan supercomputer, which is the fastest supercomputer in America today, powered by 18,000 NVIDIA GPUs, that consumes only 10 to 20 million watts -- 10 to 20 megawatts, which is about the power envelope, if you will, of a supercomputer today. And so what we're going to do is we're going to really endeavor to continue to advance in accelerated computing. It's very clear now, this is the path forward. And for many applications, whether it's life sciences research or energy research or work in big data and artificial intelligence, that this approach to computing is really a fantastic way forward. And so I'm really enthusiastic about Tesla.",593,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

Let's see how to answer that. I guess, there's several different places in the automotive industry where innovation is happening. I think largely, infotainment is a relative commodity. It is possible to build infotainment systems relatively easily. However, a virtual digital cluster, where the digital dashboard, the mapping system, the infotainment system, all unifies into one virtual display, that is relatively complicated work. And the reason for that is because there are several operating systems at play. It's a very powerful virtual computer, virtual machine that's running, and the quality of software needs to be utterly exquisite. Otherwise, problems in one functionality, like infotainment system, could cause all kinds of trouble for you with your digital cluster. So that's an area where we're doing a lot of very good work, and we're finding a great deal of interest. And our software capability and the performance of our processors is a real advantage. Another place where we see a lot of traction is autonomous driving. In the first implementations, of course, it is driver assistance, observing something, an object in front of the car and applying the brakes if the car is not slowing down. That's relatively easy to do. But that's far, far, far away from autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles are going to require sensor fusion, radar's going to get involved, LiDARs will get involved in the future, sonars get involved, of course, and cameras all over the car. And so this particular approach of autonomous driving, autonomous vehicle, I think is a rather promising approach and is recognized around the world as a reason [indiscernible]. And so where sensor fusion comes in, the processing capability of Tegra and CUDA connected with smart cameras is a really wonderful approach going forward. And so that's one of the reasons why we're engaged with just about every autonomous platform, that I know of anyways. And the DRIVE PX is really doing well there.",322,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

In the PC OEM business, of course, Windows 10 has come out, and before it came out, there's really no reason to buy a PC in advance of it. Skylake is out and both of these platforms should contribute to growth. But we'll see how it turns out. We don't control the PC OEMs, and we stay very close to them. And whatever opportunities comes our way, we'll surely be delighted with it. With respect to enterprise, I guess your guess is as good as ours, when the enterprises come back and purchase. I think our position with workstations, Quadro visualization is surely excellent, and our position with accelerated computing with Tesla is surely excellent. Both of them are highly differentiated in the marketplace. Their niche is very clear and the value we deliver is very clear.

So now the mix of the business is where PC OEM is now only maybe 15% of sales down from, say, 30% of sales at the start of last year. So I just wanted to get a sense of that. Is that correct? And the new growth segments. If you could talk a bit about what's going on in gaming and auto, because gaming and auto and enterprise are now almost 85% of our revenue.",137,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

If you look at it year-to-year, and I will just use rough CEO math here, year-to-year, our OEM business -- PC OEM business and mobile OEM business are down nearly $200 million, yet the company grew about $50 million, which basically says that the specialized platform strategy and these 4 applications, these 4 markets that we've targeted, have made up, and some, the decline of OEMs. The benefit is even better than that, of course, as you surely would know. The resilience of the business is greater, the value that we add to the marketplace is much, much greater, which will eventually reflect itself in gross margins. But the business model is more resilient and our end-market engagement is much deeper. And so I think in just about every possible way, it's a higher-quality business, it's a more resilient business, and it's a business that our shareholders frankly would enjoy better long term. It gives us much larger growth opportunities, whereas a long time ago, I guess maybe a couple of years ago, people asked why we could grow a $4 billion graphics business in a market that was only $4.8 billion large. Well, nobody would think twice if we could grow into a $100 billion gaming market. And so if we could add more and more value to a much larger end market, I think it's just a much better company. And I think that's all you're observing is the transformation -- the successful transformation of our business model from a component business model to OEMs to a platform model with specialty in an area that is related to visual computing.",281,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

The first dynamic is the size of the market is growing and it's driven a lot by eSports and MOBA. This is a type of game that's quite viral and it is also very social. And it has the ability to grow to larger numbers whenever we reach larger numbers, and it has a network effect. And the reason for that is because you want to play with your friends. And if 2 of your friends are already playing a particular game and you want to hang out with them, and when they're playing, they're talking and they're enjoying each other's company, they're hanging out, then the third friend's going to get invited, and the fourth and the fifth. And before you know it, just about all of your friends are playing. And so it tends to work in a social effect and it grows from large numbers. The second is the production value of games, I don't know if you've noticed or not, they're almost cinematic now. And that's all made possible because of the rich algorithms that we put on top of our GPUs, we call GameWorks, because of our GPUs. And when the production value is high, it consumes a lot more GPU, which is very different than movies. A movie -- a Blu-ray movie whether it's beautiful or not so beautiful, is basically Blu-ray. But for computer games, in order to have beautiful games, you need more powerful GPUs, and so that's very mathematical. And the third is 4K displays is a lot more pixels than 1080p, 8 million pixels over 2 million pixels. It's a lot more pixels. And the number of pixels that it takes -- the number of pixels we can process is directly relation -- related to the power of the GPUs. And then all of a sudden, you add VR on top of that. And so you need very high-resolution displays, you need 2 of them because you're in stereo, and you also want to render it at a much, much higher frame rate. Instead of 30 frames a second, you want to render it at 90 frames a second. And so it's times 2, times 3. So -- and so many of these type of experiences are driving the GPU adoption upward, and we're definitely seeing that trend. So both the larger market and the increasing adoption of higher-end GPUs, and that's what you're basically seeing.",419,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

And let's see, how do we -- how do you think about it? I guess the way I think about it -- the way I think about it is it's related to the number of gamers. It's related to the production value of games. And so long as the number of gamers continue to grow -- and the number of gamers have practically doubled in MOBA in the last 3 years to almost 100 million gamers. And yet 100 million gamers is not that many gamers in the context of people who watch television. And we know that just about every young adult is a gamer today. And so it stands to reason that gaming is going to be a very, very large industry, and almost everybody is going to game. It's about $100 billion today. It's hard to say exactly how big it's going to get, but it's hard for me to imagine that it will stay at $100 billion. So those things hopefully will continue to drive the growth of gaming.

In fact, we see the most success when there's pressure on CapEx. And the reason for that -- and it seems counterintuitive, but the reason for that is this: The consumption of flops and the need for fast searches, whether it's voice search, natural language processing and translation of voice, image search, transcoding of images, when you send video up in one resolution, they want to maybe store it or transcode it or stream it at a different resolution. The ability to take a poor video and enhance it, a herky-jerky video, and all of a sudden you stabilize the video and make it beautiful, all of that video processing and all of that search is going to require the data center to be much, much more powerful. And the benefit of GPUs is that by adding GPUs, you don't have to incur a great deal of expense, but you can increase the performance of your data center tremendously. Let me give you the case in point. We increased the performance of the Oak Ridge supercomputer by a factor of 10, by a factor of 10 with just 18,000 GPUs. It was a retrofit. The most powerful supercomputer in our nation today is a retrofit. It's a retrofit of an existing supercomputer. And so if you could imagine retrofitting data centers with GPUs, it would increase the throughput, the computational throughput, arguably by a factor of 10, just like we've done for the Oak Ridge supercomputer, and as a result, the CapEx doesn't have to go up very much. So that's one of the benefits of acceleration. It takes advantage of your current infrastructure and you can improve its capability by upgrading with a GPU.",290,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Most of the 50 are new customers, and the reason for that is because the number of companies that are working on autonomous driving cars are not just necessarily car companies. Car companies are using -- are going to invest in more and more autonomous capabilities. However, there's -- there are many companies who are creating autonomous cars that could be used as a service. And so you're going to see the car industry bifurcate in some really exciting and interesting ways. On the one hand, car companies are going to make cars more capable and safer and more joyful to drive. On the other hand, you're going to see new startup companies and maybe exciting startup companies that create fleets of autonomous vehicles that are operated as a service. And so they come at the world very differently. And autonomous vehicles come in a lot of shapes and form. They're not all passenger cars. So -- and this is an area of a lot of very exciting development, and we're working with a lot of them because we have a platform that was really designed to fuse computer vision cameras from all around the car, as well as radars and LiDARS and sonars and be able to do path planning and all of those kind of capabilities that you're going to need for an autonomous vehicle.",233,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If I look at combined discrete GPU market between NVIDIA and AMD, if my estimates are right, AMD lost roughly $300 million in discrete GPU market from 2014 to 2015, and you are gaining $300 million roughly. So if I look at the whole discrete gaming market between both of you, it would appear it's stable. So how do I reconcile this and the commentary that the gaming is growing for you? Is it growing for the -- between both of you or is it growing for you? I just wanted to understand how would you reconcile this.",106,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The gaming -- the GPU business is larger than it has ever been, and so I can't imagine that being a share gain. And the application that we're in is -- are applications that have never been conceived of before. And so I can't imagine it being something that's a share gain matter. So whether it's in deep learning, whether it's the growth of MOBAs, the number of gamers around the world that are engaging in eSports and MOBA, is surely an increase. The gaming market in Southeast Asia is growing. The gaming market in Latin America is growing. The gaming market in China continues to grow even through a slower economy. People are just getting born and they grow up and one day they discover that -- their other friend's game and they get into gaming. And so I think the number of gamers of the next generation is more than the gamers of the previous generation. And I think all of that is very logical and is kind of sensible. And so that's kind of how we see it. And we're really not correlated at all to anything that AMD is doing anymore. Not that I...",218,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Thanks for that opportunity to answer the question. Enterprise trials surely takes a long time, but the benefit of an enterprise business is that it remains sticky for a very long time. The same time -- this time last year, we've deployed 100 customers, and today we've deployed 300 customers. Our partnership with VMware is on full steam. You probably heard from their conference call and their commentary on how enthusiastic they are about end-user computing. And since Horizon supported vGPU in the last couple of quarters, the engagement across the board is just incredibly high and the pipeline is very healthy. And so I think this is an area in enterprise computing that's just going to take time, and this is a long-term bet. But there's no question in my mind that the value of virtualizing an enterprise end-to-end, because of heterogeneous computing, because of security, because data is getting so large, it is better to keep it in the data center. And because people's work styles are more mobile and more flexible than ever, these dynamics are not going to go away and virtualization of the PC applications that are not going to go away either that are relied upon by enterprises all over the world, virtualizing those applications is really the right way to go forward in modernizing your company.

However, when our products are bought and sought out one at a time, we tend not to -- we tend to experience what the large industry would experience. So in the case of gaming, it's a consumer product, it's a consumer market. And people buy the product not because they can afford it necessarily, they buy the product because they want to play the game. And so when a new game comes out and it's too good not to play, something like Star Wars or something like Call of Duty or something like League of Legends, it's just too good not to play, people will find a way to afford one of the GeForce graphics cards. And in the case of cars, the car industry is moving forward in autonomous vehicles, and cars are becoming more and more computerized. And irrespective of the economy, the high-end segments of the car market seem to be doing quite well. And so I think -- and maybe oil prices have something to do with that as well, but we're seeing just a really exciting adoption in the higher-end segments of the market, where new technology is really transforming the car. And then with respect to deep learning, I think the jury is now -- well, I was going to say it's pretty clear now that deep learning has an opportunity to make a real difference in computer science. Using a large amount of data to write the software itself is a pretty astonishing development. And our GPU is making it practical to train networks that are trained and taught by just an enormous amount of data. That has really opened up this field for rapid innovation, and so we're seeing a lot of excitement there. So these platforms that we talked about, I think, are exciting and making contributions at fundamental levels, and I am hopeful that we'll continue to grow through the rest of the year.",341,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The -- what really drives our business are the games that come out, the quality of the games, the production value of the games and the global growth of gaming. The United States is not very much a -- well, let me just say the opposite. The United States is very much a game console market, and the reason for that is very clear. We have the benefit of family rooms and people have their own bedrooms. But around the world, especially markets that are just developing and growing, the PC platform is a platform that every family needs and every individual needs anyways, and so they tend to be a PC gaming market. And in addition to that, because of eSports and MOBA, which is very clearly the most exciting area of gaming today, that is largely a PC phenomenon. And so those are really the factors that drive our growth. And this second half of the year, we're really fortunate to have some amazing, amazing titles coming out, whether it's Star Wars or Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Metal Gear Solid.

We're a visual computing company with 4 platforms, and one of our platforms is autonomous driving or DRIVE, which is our car platform. Our approach to -- the current market for what is called ADAS, driver assistance, relies on a smart camera, if you will. It's a camera that can detect objects and objects of a certain list. And in the future, autonomous driving is surely more than detecting objects and it will surely require more than cameras. You can't drive in the dark. You can't see in the dark if you can't see, and so having cameras alone is not good enough. And for cars using LiDARS, and using radars and sonars and cameras all over the car, that is what the industry calls sensor fusion, to realize insight by fusing the input of multiple sensors. And in our case, we're going to use deep learning, the same approach that we've been using for much of the work that we do that we've talked about in deep learning to assist and help realize this vision of an autonomous vehicle. Along the way, of course, we're going to have all kinds of capabilities. And the benefit of our approach is it's very compatible with smart cameras. And so most of the platforms that we're in today, in fact, are harmoniously working with smart cameras that are either home brew or bought from a third party and also processing on our platform. And so we see it as a compatible path to the future. And the road to autonomous driving is -- there's lots of innovation yet. And your last question was? Chris?",284,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

An FPGA is a configurable computer and so if you don't have that many different types of algorithms and you can afford the expense and the difficulty of designing an FPGA, you can get results. It's basically designing your own custom chip that runs slower because ASICs are faster, but still you're designing a custom chip. On the other hand, a GPU is not about designing. It's about programming. And so if you a have large -- different types of algorithms, you're changing your algorithms on a regular basis, the throughput that you get with a GPU that we built, which is arguably already the most complex that any processor has ever been built anyhow, and so it gives you a lot more flexibility. And so these are all spectrums, if you will, of accelerated computing.

On the second one, the thing that I feel much more confident in answering is our position in the market and the health of that market. I am pretty sure that gaming is a large-scale phenomenon and growing. I'm pretty sure that MOBA is a social network that when you -- when you're playing games, you're hanging out with your friends. And when some of your friends are hanging out on MOBA, you've got to join in, otherwise, you don't get to hang out. And so it's the reason why these large markets get larger. The benefit of a very large market is that finally developers, publishers can invest several hundred million dollars in building a new game of extraordinary production value and launch it into a very large market. The benefit of a large production-value game to us is that it needs really, really great GPUs. So those positive feedback systems, those positive feedback effects are things that I understand very, very well. How's the seasonal buying in the second half and exactly how many percent and how many we're going to sell is kind of harder for me to tell, but I do know that our gaming business is quite robust. On the other extreme, I know what I know about the autonomous vehicles and the processing that is necessary to achieve and realize that dream and where we are on that dream. We're still quite a ways from it, in fact, to do something that we can really, really count on. And then on accelerated computing, I'm pretty confident at this point that accelerated computing has reached the tipping point and that it has been recognized around the industry and globally that this is a very good approach forward, both for supercomputing, already adopted by our nation's fastest supercomputer, but -- and also the recognition by the presidential initiative to adopt methods to bring exascale to the marketplace in the next several years. Accelerated computing will surely be required. And so I think that those things I feel very strongly about and I think it's pretty clear, our position within each one of those are very good.",378,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And the answer to that is yes, yes and yes. At the value that we delivered in our high GTX cards, we're truly well received by the market. That high value affords us a great ASP and a great revenue growth. We've seen tremendous volume over this quarter as well, which has helped us.

About 40%, I guess, just shy of 40% of our total gaming business is in China. The Chinese market is surprisingly resilient because most of the games are free to play. It is probably one of the most affordable forms of entertainment that you can possibly imagine. And as I mentioned earlier, these network games are really social environments, they are social networks, and one of the reasons why Tencent grew so fast in China. Once you -- once the social network gets traction, it grows faster than linear. And so there are some reasons why the Chinese market is more resilient, the gaming market is more resilient than expected. We're also seeing a shift to higher-end GPUs in China. Some of that probably has to do with the dramatic change and improvement in production value of games in China. There was a time when the Chinese games were enjoyed and fun. However, the production value weren't very good. But now if you take a look at the Tencent games, the production value are just absolutely phenomenal. They're beautiful, they're artistic and in those cases, require a lot more GPU capability. And so we're seeing multiple dynamics happening in China, and they all seem to be quite healthy.",213,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Third quarter revenue was a record $1.305 billion, up 7% from a year earlier, up 13% sequentially and substantially above our outlook of $1.18 billion. Growth was driven by record revenue for gaming, particularly for our GTX platform and automotive infotainment systems.
From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue was $1.11 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. Tegra processor revenue was $129 million, down 23% from a year earlier.
Our strategy remains focused on creating platforms for gaming, professional visualization, data center and automotive. Our progress is the result of product innovation, our strong position in growing markets and disciplined execution.
In Q3, our 4 market platforms contributed 85% of our revenue, up from 71% a year earlier.
First, let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue rose 44% year-on-year to $761 million. Growth is being fueled by a number of factors, among them: the significant increase in graphics production value, the rise of eSports, the anticipation of blockbuster games for the holiday season and the emergence of new technologies like VR for richer, more immersive game play.
Professional gaming competitions, or eSports, are well on their way to becoming a global entertainment category, with an audience of 188 million viewers. There were 30 million viewers alone for last month's League of Legends World Championship.
The launch of great gaming titles drives gaming platform sales. We are excited by the strong pipeline of AAA games ready for the holiday season, including Star Wars Battlefront, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Rainbow Six and Fallout 4. Meanwhile, we are looking forward to the launch of virtual reality, with the approaching availability of VR headsets from Oculus, HTC and others as well as new VR games such as EVE: Valkyrie. 
During the quarter, we enabled a new category of high-capable enthusiast-class gaming notebooks, with the launch of GTX 980. For the first time, notebooks are able to deliver the same gaming experience as desktops and have the processing power to drive frame rates needed for VR. 
Our long-term bet on Android gaming is SHIELD. During the quarter, we extended the reach of SHIELD Android TV, the market's most advanced 4K smart TV console, in 2 key European markets. We launched GeForce NOW, which provides Netflix-like service for streaming games from the cloud to your SHIELD device. 
Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue increased 8% sequentially to $190 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year. At the SIGGRAPH professional computer design conference, we introduced NVIDIA DesignWorks. This suite of algorithm libraries and tools enables developers to easily incorporate photorealistic visualization of product and building designs. And with DesignWorks VR, developers can easily provide the amazing experience for such areas as theme park design, product design, telepresence and surgical training.
In data center, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 13% sequentially to $82 million, reflecting demand in deep learning, high-performance computing and graphic virtualization. Revenue declined 8% year-on-year due to lumpiness from large deep-learning projects. Most of the world's leading web services companies have adopted Tesla for deep learning to power next-generation services. In addition to using our GPUs for training servers on massive datasets, companies like Baidu are using them for inference for such work as real-time voice recognition.
In high-performance computing, we increasingly find that GPUs are moving from the domain of researchers to commercial use, in such areas as weather forecasting and seismic processing. We continue to make progress as well, with our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphic-rich applications to employees on any device anywhere. At VMworld in San Francisco, we launched GRID 2.0, with twice the user density and application performance of its predecessor and support for both Linux and Blade servers. A dozen Fortune 100 companies are completing trials of GRID 2.0 and more than 125 OEM-offered servers are qualified to run it.
Also reflecting momentum for NVIDIA data center offerings, Microsoft Azure announced that it has integrated NVIDIA GRID into its rapidly growing cloud service in response to customer demand for GPU acceleration in the cloud.
Finally, automotive revenue rose 51% year-on-year to a record 79% -- $79 million. At last month's international auto show in Frankfurt, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Honda all showcased a range of production vehicles and concept cars with NVIDIA-powered digital cockpits. And our partner, Tesla Motors, just introduced its Falcon Wing Model X, like the Model S, the Model X is equipped with both a multi-touch infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster powered by NVIDIA. 
Finally, we are continuing deeper collaborations with over 50 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies using NVIDIA DRIVE PX. These include car manufacturers, Tier 1 OEMs, start-ups and research institutions. DRIVE PX is an advanced autonomous driving platform that fuses data from cameras, LIDARs, radar and ultrasonic sensors to determine the path forward using deep learning techniques. We look forward to sharing more details about this work at CES 2016. 
Our OEM and IP business was $192 million, up 11% sequentially, driven by seasonal demand for notebooks.
Now turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP gross margin was 56.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.5%, in line with our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin increased from a year ago, reflecting our strong gaming revenue. GAAP gross margin increased sequentially as the previous quarter included a charge related to the NVIDIA SHIELD tablet recall. Non-GAAP gross margin was nearly flat sequentially.
GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $489 million, inclusive of $8 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses including litigation charges were $430 million, slightly lower than our outlook. We continue to focus on operating efficiencies and we manage investment growth while growing operating margins.
GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, up 15% from $213 million a year earlier, reflecting strong revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $308 million, up 17% from $264 million a year earlier.
GAAP net income was $246 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.44, including $0.01 of restructuring and other charges as well as a benefit of $0.09 from a tax reserve release. Non-GAAP net income was $255 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46, an increase of 18% year-over-year.
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q3, our cash and marketable securities balance was $4.73 billion. During the third quarter, we paid $53 million in cash dividends and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.6 million shares returned. As a result, we have returned to shareholders an aggregate of $604 million fiscal year-to-date of our full year intent to return $800 million.
As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, we have announced an 18% increase to our quarterly cash dividend to $0.115 per share to be paid on December 14 to all shareholders of record on November 20.
In addition, we are pleased to announce our intention in fiscal 2017 to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming continues to accelerate, and eSports, VR and a pipeline of exciting games will lift it further. GPU-accelerated data centers are expanding in both high-performance computing and cloud, driven by the acceptance of deep-learning techniques. And the transition to autonomous driving is well underway. We had excellent positions in each of these growth markets.
We expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be $1.3 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our non-GAAP and GAAP gross margins are -- our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.7% and 57%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $503 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. For fiscal 2016, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding litigation costs, to be approximately flat with fiscal 2015. Litigation costs are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million as we defend our intellectual property.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook excludes restructuring charges, which are expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million as we finalize the wind-down of the Icera operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

Vivek, first of all, thanks. Well, I think that we've been consistent that our PC gaming business is driven by several factors. The first factor is the great AAA titles that are coming out with ever increasingly graphics production value. The second is just the number of eSports players that are growing around the world, and it's a very social phenomenon. The more of your friends are joining eSports, the more you have to join eSports so that you could hang out with your friends. The third is the developing countries. One of the things about PC gaming and overall gaming is that you really need to have broadband access anymore so that you can download these amazing games. And so as broadband adoption continues to grow in the developing countries, the PC is really the best way to get into gaming. It's a platform that you need for your daily lives, anyways. And surely, most young people need it for school. And so that's been helpful. All of those factors have increased both the units as well as the ASPs that we're enjoying. If you look at the size of the overall market, I think it's probably fair to say that we're not fully penetrated. And our expectation is that as we look into next year, all of the great games that are coming out, whether it's Call of Duty that's coming out or Star Wars that's coming out or Assassin's Creed or Tomb Raider. And surely, everybody's quite excited about VR coming out in the beginning of next year. So I think there are several growth drivers that are still quite powerful. And our expectations is that this is going to be a large market going forward.",290,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

There's nobody at NVIDIA who is low-key about it. There's no question that when you enjoy the Oculus headset with a GeForce GTX 980 or GeForce GTX TITAN, it's -- the experience is unbelievable. And recently, we even produced a whole family of notebooks that are able to enjoy VR directly from the notebook. And so we're super excited about VR. The sense of presence that you have in enjoying VR headsets, whether it's from Oculus or Valve's Vive, it's really fantastic. We also see that the applications of VR is quite sweeping. It could -- of course, we were quite enthusiastic about games, and the games that we've seen are really amazing. But it's used for industrial design, architectural design. It's used for -- whether it's medical imaging, even scientific computing. We're seeing entertainment, large-scale entertainment, large-format entertainment. And so we're seeing all kinds of applications from places all over the world. We're tracking over 250 companies now that are working with us on VR. And it ranges everywhere from video games to entertainment to professional graphics, as I've mentioned. Our approach is to provide a platform by which all of the entire VR industry can be built upon. And so we call it our DesignWorks VR for our enterprise products, our professional products and GameWorks VR for our consumer products. And by using -- by connecting to our APIs and connecting to our SDK, the performance and the experience is just phenomenal. Now maybe your question is much more related to financial. And I guess, our approach there is to be as enthusiastic about the work that we're doing to support the entire industry as it moves into VR. We're engaged deeply with the industry in doing so. I think that we've built the premier platform for VR for both PC gaming as well as professional graphics. And as far as financial is concerned, realize that the shipment hasn't really started yet. And I think it's prudent to wait and see. But our -- my expectation long term is that VR is going to be a very powerful growth driver for us. I mean, that is almost undeniable at this point based on everything that we've seen and all the effort that's going into it.",389,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It's -- I guess, in the end, it's hard to predict. There's only a few things that I -- that we do know. The first principles of what we know are that the gaming market overall is growing. The number of eSports players is continuing to grow. The number of countries, developing countries that are now able to bring more people into gaming is growing as they continue to adopt broadband. The production value of the video games are just amazing. If you just look at Star Wars and Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty and Tomb Raider, I mean, they're almost cinematic. And so our expectation is that these factors combined is going to continue to drive the gaming market forward. And so we'll see from quarter-to-quarter how they do. But at the moment, everywhere in the world, we're just seeing gaming to be quite vibrant.",148,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

I guess, first of all, at your last Analyst Day, you guys mentioned a sort of an aggregate backlog number for an estimate on the rough value of the design wins over a number of years looking out. I was wondering if you could potentially provide us an update on how that number may have changed over the last several quarters. And then related to that, just given the nice pipeline you guys have building up, can you talk about what sense of urgency your customers are telling you guys in terms of how quickly they need to get Tegra into some of these systems, whether it's infotainment or ADAS-type products and what that translates to in terms of the revenues coming on for Tegra?",135,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

Thanks a lot, Stephen. I guess, first of all, the -- our automotive business is growing quite robustly. And year-over-year, it's grown over 50%. And our expectation is that it's going to continue to grow through next year and in a couple of years after that. Meanwhile, there are 2 very important dynamics that are happening in the car industry that is very favorable for us. One dynamic has to do with the central car computer. It is very clear now that your future car will be software-defined, that there would likely be multiple operating systems. These operating systems will control graphics-rich experiences, that this centralized computer will be built like a data center, so that it can be secure, it can be robust, it could be mission-critical. And software is going to play just a huge role in it. And so when the car becomes more and more computerized, more than just digital, more than just electronic, but it's computerized and that it's software-rich, it plays into our hands because we're such a great software company. I mean, we know systems software incredibly well. And software capability is one of our major differentiating advantages. It's one of the reasons why we're able to do what we do. The second dynamic is that whereas the first generation of driver assistance was made possible with radars and the second generation included cameras, the first generation of autonomous driving is about to come. Autonomous driving hasn't really made its way into the market yet. And we're seeing the early versions of that. But architectures that enable fully autonomous driving is yet to come. And this is an area where we really have a great deal of capability. It's going to require sensor fusion, it's going to require an enormous amount of software, it's going to require artificial intelligence and it's going to require the ability to support an open-computing platform that NVIDIA is built upon. If you look at our accelerated computing platform, it's programmed by so many people in the world. And this is a real advantage because car companies need the ability to develop their own artificial intelligence network so that they can ultimately own their driving experience. And so this is something that I think the second -- the new era of autonomous cars and autonomous vehicles is a great opportunity for us. So those 2 dynamics are going to be fundamental to the future growth of our automotive business.",412,9.0,7.0,1.0,0.7

And my follow-up question, I was wondering if you could help parse out some of the drivers within the Tesla and GRID product families, just between high-performance computing, cloud data center and traditional corporate enterprise-type customers that are currently buying your Tesla and GRID products. Can you talk about the near medium term demand trends across these different verticals?",60,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I appreciate that question. PC gaming, of course, is a very powerful growth driver for us. Our automotive business is a growth driver for us, and I fully expect our data center business to be a growth driver for us. We've simplified our data center strategy over the course of the last several quarters. Whereas we used to have multiple data center strategies, we now have basically one data center platform with multiple applications that drive it on top. The data center platform -- accelerated data center platform is called Tesla. On top of it, we have multiple software stacks. The most -- the first software stack that we created was for high-performance computing, for scientists to be able to do things like weather simulations and molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry simulations and material simulations. And so HPC, high-performance computing, was our first stack. We also talk about GRID. GRID is our enterprise virtualization stack. We have GeForce NOW, which is our cloud gaming stack. And one of the things that's super important in the future is the work that we're going to do in hyperscale data centers that allow cloud data centers to do their work around artificial intelligence and to take the pressure off of the enormous amount of new traffic that is going -- that is swamping and flooding data centers from users generating their own video. Basically, people are -- kind of everybody's going to become a broadcaster. And there are PC gamers that are already broadcasting on a daily basis, and Twitch is the name by which we all know it by. But you're going to see YouTube Live, YouTube Live is doing incredibly well. And then you're going to see applications like Meerkat and Periscope, and there are more coming, that basically lets almost everybody become a broadcaster. You're going to have billions of people broadcasting to billions of other people. And all of those videos today needs to be somehow processed, and our GPUs are really fantastic at that. And so we have multiple ways to -- multiple applications, if you will, that sit on top of our data center platform. Now the dynamics, the dynamics that -- I've mentioned some. One, one of the most important dynamics around data centers is Moore's Law needs a boost. We know now that Moore's Law is under some amount of pressure and it's not growing as fast as the industry needs it to. So Moore's Law needs a boost. And that's really what Tesla is about. Tesla is an accelerated computing platform that boosts the microprocessor, and so that's one dynamic. The second dynamic is what I mentioned, the global race to AI. The global race to AI, there's not one data center on the planet, there's not one cloud service on the planet, frankly, there's not one application company on the planet that we know of that's not trying to figure out how AI can completely revolutionize the applications that they provide. And then, of course, accelerating the cloud and making it possible for cloud to offer smart services and graphics-rich services, like the announcement that we recently did with Microsoft Azure. Azure now provides the NVIDIA GRID to power graphics-accelerated applications as a service, and we're super excited about that. So those dynamics are happening all in real-time, and it's contributed to our sequential growth of 13%.",566,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Hans, first of all, thank you. Well, I think it's very clear at this point that boosting Moore's Law is an essential path forward. That relying on CPUs alone for the entire workload of a data center is unrealistic and, frankly, unnecessary. There are no supercomputing centers that I know of that are not considering accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because just relying on traditional methods, unfortunately, doesn't allow you to scale your data center in an efficient way anymore. There are no hyperscale data centers that I know of that aren't somehow overwhelmed and flooded by the user-generated video content or the need to move to machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide smarter services. And so these dynamics are putting a lot of pressure on data centers. And it's one of the reasons why there is so much talk about new approaches for improving the throughput of these data centers, whether it's supercomputing data centers or hyperscale data centers across the board. And I think that's an enormous opportunity for us. This is an area that we've invested almost 10 years in. And as you know, I've been talking about accelerated data centers now for, well, 10 years. And this is an area that we're seeing a lot of momentum. And as other people pursue other ideas, I think it's just an acknowledgment that this is really a good path forward. I think that in your question, you also specifically asked about FPGAs. And FPGAs -- we use FPGAs at NVIDIA and we use FPGAs to do simulations and emulations of our products. FPGAs have been around a long time and they have -- they are perfect for certain applications. The challenge for -- I guess, the trade-off is an FPGA is like it's designed. It's designed and configured on an array of transistors and gates, whereas a GPU is a full custom processor that is designed completely by hand. Whereas one FPGAs is designed probably by a handful of engineers, a GPU is designed by thousands of engineers. And a GPU performing a task could be 100x the frequency -- 100x the performance of that of an FPGA. And so it stands to reason that it's a result of handcraftsmanship and a processor that's designed to go very fast. An FPGA, however, can do specific tasks quite well. If you only want to do 1 or 2 things, you can surely limit the functionality and make an FPGA quite efficient. However, our perspective is that a data center doesn't do 1 or 2 things. A data center runs thousands of applications. A data center has video, has imaging, it has voice, it does machine learning. The algorithms are changing every day. Today, the algorithms are convolution neural nets. Tomorrow, it has memory. After that, it's recursive. And so the type of neural nets just keep growing and the algorithms just keep on moving forward. And so our belief is that the vast array of applications and the evolution of the algorithms really makes a processor much, much easier to adopt and much faster to increase the overall throughput of your data center. And so we'll see how it plays out. But at the moment, we're seeing a -- we're enjoying a lot of enthusiasm around accelerated computing.",554,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So it's not much to talk about. I -- but I think that the way to think about it is this: SHIELD and GeForce NOW is our long-term bet on the future of gaming. When we look out in the future, I think there are 2 dynamics that I think are unquestionable. One dynamic is that Android is going to become more important of an operating system. Don't forget gaming is about computer gaming. Gaming is made possible because it's built on top of a computer architecture, and Android is the most popular operating system in the world. And so it's undeniable that it will become a major force in gaming someday. And SHIELD is our bet in that. The second is that cloud services -- application as a service, and therefore, video games as an application as a service will eventually come. It took many years for Netflix to eventually become mainstream, and my expectation is that it will take several years for GeForce NOW to become popular all over the world. And so those 2 dynamics, I think, are largely unquestionable. The question is not so much if. The question is simply when. And then maybe the next question is who. Who is best equipped to be able to bring this future into the world? And we feel that as the world leader in visual computing and as one of the major platform leaders in video games today, that this is an area that we can really make a great contribution. It's a modest investment for us, and we're thoughtful about the level that we invest to make sure that it times with, long term, the opportunity. Okay, but if we were to recognize the revenues -- just to put it back into the original question, if we were to recognize revenues, it would go into gaming.",318,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I appreciate you bringing up the notebook work that we did. Maxwell, the GPU architecture that we created, and the craftsmanship of the GPUs we make are so incredible that it's finally possible for a notebook to be able to deliver the same level of performance as a desktop. And our timing was timed so that people who want to enjoy VR with a notebook can finally do it. And so the latest generation of notebooks with GTX 980 are just amazing. I mean, they are so many times more powerful than a game console. It fits in a space smaller than a game console. And it can drive VR.

One is back on the professional side, Jen-Hsun. If I look at Quadro and Tesla, what reverses the year-over-year decline that we've seen the last couple of quarters? Is that -- as it relates to Tesla, is it just a matter of timing of when the HPC systems get launched? And the second follow-up was for you, Colette, on the IP side and the expenses for IP, what is the -- it's not debatable that you guys have a very unique IP portfolio. But I'm wondering given the reversal -- the initial reversal you had on the lawsuit against Qualcomm and Samsung, why should expenses be -- continue to be higher on that front?",116,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Thanks for the questions, Ambrish. Let me take it in reverse order. So first on IP. It's not over. We -- the administrative law judge has opined that of the 3 patents that he had to rule on, the 2 were not infringed and 1 was infringed but he opined invalid. Of course, we disagree with that. And we have submitted our rebuttal. And to the -- and now all of that has to go to the commission, which is ultimately where the ruling happens. The commission -- the next phase is for the commission to decide whether they want to review. And we hope they do, and it's not uncommon that they do. And then in the February time frame, the commission would determine their judgment. And it is not uncommon at all to have the commission disagree with the administrative law judge. And so I think it's far from over. And therefore, I guess, it's not over. But I think that the higher-level point is this: the higher-level point is that our IP is very important to us, that invention as the world leader in our field is fundamental and core to our future. We had to invent the future. We are the world leader after all. And from time to time, we may decide that as a one-off and strategically decide that we will defend our IP and this is what we have done in this case. But it's not our business model. We don't litigate for business model. We don't depend on licensing for our business model, and I hope that all of you on the call today don't invest in our company as a result of IP royalties. What I hope that you see is that we are quite a unique company and we are a world leader in the space that we endeavor, that visual computing is more important than ever and applies to more industries than ever. And that our business model is really about selling products into vertical markets that are really exciting and quite vibrant and growing. And so I hope that you decide to invest on the basis of the products, the business model and our special position in the marketplace. On the two questions related to Tesla and Quadro. As you know, Quadro is about design and it's about workstations, it's about manufacturing, it's about things that people make. And we are a very, very, very significant leader in this market. We make a great deal of contributions to this market. But it's also a mature market. And so the way that our strategy for growing Quadro is very, very simple. We have to reinvent it, and we have to reinvent it by bringing new capabilities to it. And we have two that we're quite excited about. One, one is a new technology called Iray. And Iray is a brand new way of generating images that is photorealistic and physically accurate. It's almost like inventing the font of desktop publishing. What you see is what you will get. And it's just really quite amazing. And so I think Iray is going to rejuvenate the way that people do computer graphics and it will create -- I hope that it will increase the size of the market, make it easier for people to design products and it will increase our ASPs quite significantly. Number two, VR. We've already mentioned before that from design to architectural design to medical imaging, to scientific computing, we're seeing that -- to a large-scale entertainments, we're seeing that VR is going to be very important. So those 2 we hope will drive the future growth of Quadro and get it back on the growth track. As for Tesla, we grew 13% quarter-over-quarter. We declined year-over-year. Frankly, I'm -- it didn't meet my expectation either. However, the fundamental dynamics, the reasons don't really matter here or there. But the fundamental dynamics are incredibly sound and the groundswell around the fundamental dynamics is unquestionable. Moore's Law needs a boost. AI, every company on the planet is racing towards the future of AI and cloud computing needs to be accelerated with graphics as Microsoft Azure has demonstrated. And so my expectation is that we'll grow sequentially again and that the fundamental dynamics around Tesla is just really, really positive.",722,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

But I think a lot of third parties and I think you guys have mentioned that it actually requires much more in order to get a pretty reasonable experience. So can you kind of help us understand what we should be expecting in terms of the average setup for, let's call it, an early adopter of Oculus? Should we expect 2, kind of, GTX 970, should we expect a 980, a TITAN? Anything will be helpful there. And also, can you kind of walk us through the economic fall through for NVIDIA in terms of what kind of revenues you would expect to see or ASPs NVIDIA would recognize for a, let's say, $300 card and what kind of gross profit dollar, ballpark, we could see from that as well?",145,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So I would say that the 970 is the minimum requirement. It is the minimum requirement. And I think Oculus has done a good job setting the minimum requirement. And I think a minimum requirement simply means that anything below it is not going to be a great experience. We're seeing just more and more content coming. And usually, the content gets richer, content doesn't usually move backwards. And so the production value is going to continue to grow. If you buy into a 970, it will be able to give you a limited amount of growth over time. But if you buy into a 980 or GTX TITAN, you just have a lot more opportunities to continue to enjoy the platform for a longer period of time as content gets richer. And so in terms of the economics, our gross margins are higher on 970 and above, it's higher than our corporate average. And so we appreciate the adoption and the growth in that segment of the marketplace. But ultimately, our focus is to help enable the entire ecosystem of hundreds of companies who are working on VR to be able to deliver this experience to the marketplace and that fulfills the promise of VR. We're just intensely concerned that if we don't do a great job, that we'll ruin a great thing. This is really, really a great thing. And the folks at Oculus and the folks at Valve, the folks at HTC, ourselves and the 230 companies that are out there working on VR, we all want to deliver just a fantastic experience. And that's our focus at the moment. And our recommendation, to anybody who were to walk up to me and asked me for recommendation, I would tell him that a GTX 980 Ti will be the baseline. And in my own case, I'll probably have a pair of TITANs. Who doesn't need a pair of TITANs?",326,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Well, our guidance is the best guidance we think we should provide at this moment. And we'll see how the market plays out. We're not in control of the market as you know. But I think at the foundational level, we have multiple growth drivers. And some of them on some day, exceeds our expectations and some of them don't exceed our expectation. But that's one of the benefits of our business model today. That's one of the benefits of our strategy today. We have multiple growth drivers in the company. PC gaming is a growth driver. Artificial intelligence is a growth driver. VR is a growth driver. Autonomous driving cars is -- autonomous cars is a growth driver. And I really don't know of that many companies in the world that is working on these important dynamics in the industry that's going to shape the future of computing altogether. And so we have multiple growth drivers in our company and they're -- I believe that those drivers are fundamentally sound and powerful. However, we'll see how they turn out at the end of the quarter. And I remain optimistic. And so we are enthusiastic about the guidance we provided and are optimistic that we'll do a good job on it, and then we'll just have to see how it turns out.",223,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

The reason we decided to classify it a little differently is because I changed the architecture of it. We used to have several different product lines. And each one of the product lines were planned differently and they were specified differently and so on and so forth. We decided to unify all of our data center product lines and abstracted out the software from it. And so from those one unified platform, Tesla, Tesla is our accelerated computing platform. And on top of it, are software stacks that allows us to solve a problem for a particular marketplace. So for example, we have our entire software stack for HPC. We have our rich software stack for enterprise virtualization, we call GRID. We have a software stack that is incredible for providing cloud gaming around the world that's called GeForce NOW. And then we're going to have a software stack for hyperscale. And so each one of these software stacks are built on top of one common architecture, one common platform called Tesla Accelerated Computing. And so as a result, we decided to unify all of that and report it simply as data centers. And quite frankly, I think it will just be easier to understand.",211,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But this seems to be changing pretty rapidly with high schoolers and some of the older demographics here in the U.S. I don't know what the stats are.

I think that there is no question that the U.S., even the U.S. is seeing growth in PC gaming. And the fundamental reason is really quite singular, eSports. eSports is -- it is -- it may be the new social platform. It is the new digital playground. It is -- you go hang out with your friends. It's the new virtual arcade. This is how you hang out with your friends. Not only do you play. If you're not playing, you're watching. But at all times, you're talking to your friends. This is how you hang out. And so this is a big deal. This isn't something you can do easily on mobile. This isn't something you can do easily on TV. This particular platform really, really benefits from having a PC. And so eSports is probably, if I had to tag it on one thing, eSports would probably be it. The growth of eSports, as you know, not only is the gamers enjoying eSports and growing faster than anybody would have expected. And I think the reason for that is because it's a social platform. And therefore, it grows not linearly but arguably, exponentially. And in the case of eSports, there's also viewerships and now, all kinds of businesses are cropping up, to help people enjoy watching eSports and sharing the moment with other people.

But what are your own big picture thoughts on the implications of Moore's Law for your core GPU business? And then associated with that, if I think about the increasingly -- increasing challenges of Moore's Law, as well as the power of some of the big OEMs, and it can be either on the hardware or on the cloud side and many of them are both, how does that not mean you need to have some sort of licensing business or a strategic partnership business in order to move your technology forward?",114,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Well, semiconductors and chips is really important to us. And on balance, on balance, it's a lot easier if the world will just get better without anybody having to work for it, i.e., Moore's Law. And so if every year, transistors got faster and they got more of it and they got cheaper and so on and so forth all the same time, this surely would make for an easier ride. However, accelerated computing is a very different beast. The way that accelerated computing works and some people have characterized NVIDIA's growth and performance to Moore's Law squared. And I don't think it's much far off from that actually. And the reason for that, the reason for that has to do with the fact that we changed our -- we can innovate change, improve our GPU underneath, the software stack on top, the algorithms that we innovate on top of that. And then also targeting specific applications. One of the things that most people don't realize is that we're not a general-purpose processor. We only target a few specific applications. And the specific applications, as you know, that we focus on is visual computing and this particular field has become quite large. And because of the work that we've done, whether it's visual computing, images, video and very parallel applications, which artificial intelligence falls into, these applications are just right down the strike zone and right in the bull's eye of accelerated computing. It just has -- maybe it happened by serendipity. But we hope that we have a large part to do with it, that the accelerator that we created made it possible for these applications to move forward and then, as a result, move forward more quickly and became large markets. And so I would say that the answer to your question is that we don't just do chips. And the value proposition of our platform is really about chips, about software, about algorithms and applications that we select. And that combination is really, really powerful. Now your second question has to do with IP licensing. I would say that 5 years ago, as a technology component company, a PC graphics chip company, whereas our path to market is only through OEMs. Our path to market is only through OEMs. And our path to market is only through OEMs that our industry -- where our products are industry standard with, i.e., with Intel or PC or so on and so forth. But that's no longer true. We now have 4 vertical markets by which we engage the market ourselves and we can go directly to the market, we can innovate openly. And we have specialized platforms whereby we can innovate without dependency on somebody else. And so whether it's accelerated data centers which has a specialized platform, gaming where we go to market ourselves and we have a specialized platform there, these markets are really, really large. And so the reinvention of our company put us in very large markets that are growing quite robustly. And so I think that our primary focus today is through product sales. And so we changed our business model that way, if you will, instead of remaining a components company and moving, if you will, backwards into licensing. We decided to move forward into the market vertically and creating specialized platforms.",568,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I would say that I don't care. And the reason for that is these desktop -- these notebook GPUs are really high end. And they're all GeForce platforms to us. They're all good to the same gamers. And -- so I think the most important thing is this, that we would like the games to have higher graphics production value, the AAA games. I would like eSports to continue to grow. I would like developing countries to have broadband, and I would like VR to be incredible. And so I would say that those are really the drivers for our business.

Maybe you can help us understand and break down the growth between unit growth or overall installed base growth versus upgrade sales from the current installed base? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is the segment, the growth between that and what's the upgrade cycle you see from someone, say, that bought a high-end GPU from you a year ago, what's the upgrade cycle and link them, what are the real drivers to that upgrade cycle for someone that has already engaged with you and your installed base?",129,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

So, of course, one of the most important -- one of the most important drivers is the combination -- it's the combination of really, really high-production value games and our installed base. Because our installed base are already gamers, our installed base are already GeForce customers. And when new games come out, new amazing games come out, the installed base wants to upgrade their GPUs to support it. And so I -- if you look at our installed base, just take a look at our, if you will, first base, the mainstream GTX, let's take the GTX 950. The GTX 950 class installed base represents probably less than 1/4 of our installed base. Another way of thinking about it is that 3/4 of our installed base really needs to get upgraded, so that they can enjoy today's exciting AAA titles. And so the installed base alone is a really exciting opportunity for our growth. And that's only possible because of the amazing AAA titles. It's the Star Wars of the world, the Call of Duty of the world, the Assassin's Creed and the Batmans that really, really causes our installed base, inspires our installed base upgrade to new GPUs. And so that alone has really great growth opportunity. And not to mention the other factors that you started with, which was eSports and developing countries having broadband and then, of course, what we hope to be a big driver in the next, in the coming year with VR. And so the installed base, I think, is a big growth driver for us, okay?",264,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

I think, first of all, just the recognition that our PC OEM or OEM businesses has largely, the decline has abated. We are still -- we obviously still work on OEM projects. And we're selective about the OEM projects. We're thoughtful about the projects we're working on, and so we care very much about working with our strategic partners. For example, some of the really amazing projects that have been announced recently, the Microsoft Surface Book. I mean, holy cow, what a great laptop. Mine should be arriving any day now. And so I'm super excited about that. I thought Panos and the guys over at -- over a Microsoft just did a killer job on that laptop. And it was incredibly challenging. And we love to work and we love building groundbreaking work. And then the other project over at Google, with Google Pixel C, I thought it was amazing. I mean, it's just a fantastic laptop and it's based on our latest generation Tegra, Hiroshi and the team did a great job building it, and what a fantastic new tablet model. And so we're going to continue to work on these type of OEM projects. And so we have excited once that we're in the project -- in the process of working on. And so my expectation is that the PC OEM business and the Tegra OEM business is going to be here. But it's just not, it's not a huge focus of ours. Our focus -- focus is not the right word. It's not where we expect our growth drivers to come from. Our major growth drivers are the 4 that we've talked about several times during the call. In terms of growth rate, I think it's -- I think it's going to take potentially a couple of years for us to have some kind of a feeling for growth rate. Let me tell you why. In no time in the history of our company did we have a brand-new business model, right? First of all. We have a brand-new business model. This new business model leverages one architecture but instead of going towards just serving OEMs, we've largely engaged the vertical markets ourselves. It's a platform strategy. It's an ecosystem strategy. We engage the markets directly ourselves. So this new business model transition and approach in this market is really working and accelerating. Because we're engaging the markets directly and we're looking at some very large markets, I mean, the autonomous driving market is going to be a large market. The accelerated data center market is going to be a large market. AI is going to be large. VR is going to be large. PC gaming is going to be large. And so we're now working -- we're now engaging large markets and we have multiple growth drivers. And so I think that the TAM for the company is larger than any time than we have ever enjoyed. And so that's kind of the second thing. We have multiple growth drivers and they have large TAMs. And then finally, gosh, we're just doing really exciting and important work that will shape the future of computing. I don't know any time in the history of our company that we're working on things like AI and VR and self-driving cars and cloud computing, all the same time. And so all of that leveraging one fundamental architecture, which gave us the ability to simultaneously engage these vertical markets with a very powerful singular investment behind it. And so I think our business model is very different. The vertical markets we engage are very different and I hope that as a result, our growth will continue to surprise.",622,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We don't really control anything. Our products are purchased by our gamers freely. And so it's not really a matter of control. And I mean that in a way that, look, we've got to earn, we've got to earn the love and loyalty of our customers every single day. And whereby -- whereas we used to be a PC OEM company, an OEM company where that responsibility lies on our OEMs, today, the responsibility really lies with us. And we take it really, really seriously. We have 70 million gamers that are connected with us. I hope that we add value to them on a continuous basis and that we earn their trust and their loyalty over time. The beauty of this model, the beauty of this model, of course, it's much, much harder. It requires much, much greater understanding of the software stack. The way that you digitally connect and engage your community has to be very different than before. Obviously, the PC OEM model is simple. The selling motion is simple, the marketing motion is simple. Everything we do today, the selling motion is much more complicated and the marketing motion is much more complicated. But the end result is that the promise that we made to them, whether it's Quadro's ability to help you realize your imagination, to GeForce that helps you enjoy your game to the fullest, these promises, we have the ability to deliver on a day-to-day basis. And so over time, I believe it allows us to create much deeper connections with our customers, which in business talk, is stickiness, but we don't think of it that way. We think of it as earning the loyalty and the trust and hopefully, the passion of our customers. Okay?",299,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Yes, I think our focus over this last several years has really been focusing around one single unified architecture and investment. That's really helped us to make the appropriate investments that we need in these 4 different markets that we're going after. But allowing us also to really focus on a single architecture, that allows the efficiencies that we are seeing in our operating expenses. That is still going to be our focus as we move into the current quarter, Q4, and as we move forward into fiscal year '17. As our financial performance is very important to us and improving that financial performance in the short term.

If we can get a $5 microcontroller to drive, and it's just a matter of software, and driving is like one of the most complicated things we do, I think humans can be replaced in just about everything we do with a $3 microcontroller. And so it seems unlikely. It -- I agree that smart microcontrollers could be used to enhance smart cameras and do some -- to do computer vision. I think that for ADAS, it is really, really good, I mean, just to be serious here. I think that smart cameras, whether it's from Tier 1s or from companies in Japan or various companies around the world, ADAS driver -- better cruise control to automatic braking, to lane keeping, those things are all important things. And it improves our driver experience. But autonomous driving is just a whole different thing. Autonomous driving, nobody's figured out. And obviously, there are several companies that we know who have real cars on the market, who are doing autonomous driving and there's no pretense. Nobody's saying that all it takes is a $5 microcontroller to make that happen. It takes a lot of computing to make that possible. And so our strategy is not driver assistance, I've been consistent about that. I appreciate all of the people's work that are enhancing driver assistance, whether it's radar or ultrasonics or cameras to move all -- driver assistance forward. Our strategy is really a computing platform for autonomous driving and it's going to take a lot of software. And it's going to take a lot of software that it's going to be owned by the car companies themselves. And our strategy is to provide a platform by which we provide a lot of the capabilities of artificial intelligence whereby they can embrace it, modify it, enhance it so that they can make their personality of the driver experience in their own software long term. I just can't imagine how every single car company in the world will have exactly the same driver experience. The way that the car responds to you, the way that the car responds at all is something that I believe, long term, is going to require a lot of computing. This is an area that's just far from being done, and I think it's a -- it's very complicated stuff. And we don't even know what we don't know yet. But the one thing that we do know, it's going to need a lot of computing horsepower. It's going to need a lot of software. Artificial intelligence is going to be the core of it. And I think if we succeed in doing so, we're going to make the world a much, much better place. I mean, there are a lot of people that shouldn't drive. There are a lot of people that would love to get around but they can't drive. And I think we're going to keep a lot of people out of harm's way, okay? So I think the work is incredibly important.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2015. With us on the call today from NVIDIA is Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer. I'd also like to introduce Arnab Chanda, who joined us last week, as the Head of Investor Relations. Arnab and Raj will closely work to support the investment community. 
I'd like to remind you, today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It is also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until February 18, 2015. The webcast will be available for replay up until the next quarter's conference call to discuss Q1 financial results. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our written prior consent. 
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Form 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of our statements are based as of today, February 11, 2015, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. 
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You may find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. 
With that, let's start. We achieved record revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year, with impressive growth in each of our markets' specialized platforms. NVIDIA's strategy of creating an ecosystem in gaming, enterprise graphics, accelerated computing and automotive continues to make excellent headway. Our gaming platforms grew more than 30% year-on-year and accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by our 10th-generation Maxwell processors and the vibrant gaming market. 
Launched in September, our GeForce GTX 980 and 970 GPUs continue to be enthusiastically received. The Maxwell architecture provides new capabilities such as real-time, dynamic, global illumination, which simulates the true interaction of light with the environment and is the most energy-efficient GPU architecture ever created. We added to our lineup the GTX 960, which brings Maxwell to $199, what we see as the gaming market sweet spot. Powered by 1,024 CUDA Cores, it plays even some of the most demanding titles on 60 frames per second on full HD displays and it leaves plenty of headroom for over-clockers. The GTX 960 will let gamers enjoy the latest games at quality and performance greater than even the best gaming consoles at half the price. 
There are now more than 50 million PCs with GeForce Experience, our application for the gaming ecosystem that optimizes the user settings for each title and enables players to record and share their victories. In the month of November alone, GeForce Experience users downloaded our drivers over 30 million times. GeForce Experience brings the simplicity and the community benefits of the console to the PC. 
NVIDIA powered the holiday season's 2 best-reviewed Android tablets, the Google Nexus 9 and our own SHIELD Tablet, which are based on our Tegra K1 processor. More than a dozen media outlets recommended SHIELD in their holiday gift giving guides. Over the course of the quarter, SHIELD, which has pioneered a premium gaming experience for tablets, became one of the very first devices to be upgraded to the Google's latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. 
The NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization platform continues to gain momentum. More than 300 companies worldwide tested the product in recent months and experienced the benefits of GPU-accelerated virtualization. They range from large institutions such as the University of Southern California, leading manufacturers such as Airbus and Lockheed Martin and defense proprietors like Raytheon. Enterprise virtualization leaders continue to deploy GRID. Just last week, VMware rolled out the latest version of its vSphere virtualization software, including full support for our GRID vGPU graphics virtualization technology. 
Quadro professional graphics continue to maintain market leadership. Refreshed in Q3, the lineup is now being shipped in all major OEMs. For the sixth year in a row, every film nominated for an Academy Award for special effects was made using Quadro. 
Our accelerated computing platform performed very strongly. Tesla's revenue growth from a year ago exceeded 50%, as HPC customers and cloud service providers continue to deploy large GPU-powered systems. These provide deep learning capabilities that help enable our amazing capabilities, like voice recognition and natural language processing. Using Tesla, our customers have seen dramatic benefits in application performance, radically reducing run times. 
During the quarter, we introduced the Tesla K80 Dual-GPU, our new flagship Tesla offering. It provides nearly twice the performance and double the memory bandwidth of its predecessor, the Tesla K40. A single server with Tesla K80 delivers the same performance as 8 servers with our old Fermi generation GPU accelerators for a range of applications. A powerful endorsement of Tesla came just ahead of the recent Supercomputing 2014 Show. The U.S. Department of Energy announced that its next generation of supercomputers will utilize Tesla GPU accelerators in conjunction with our powerful new NVIDIA NVLink high-speed interconnect technology. These systems will be deployed at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We'll be at least 3x faster than today's most powerful systems. These supercomputers will serve scientists across our nation in every field of science to accelerate their research for the next 20 years. 
Finally, NVIDIA's automotive platforms remain on a sharp upward trajectory, registering better than 80% growth on the year. More than 7.5 million cars with our technology are now on the road, up from 4.7 million a year ago. 
At CES, we announced NVIDIA Drive, a computing platform for next-generation advanced driver assistant systems and digital cockpits. NVIDIA Drive makes driving safer and more enjoyable by introducing surround vision and auto valet capabilities. Its cockpit computing platform includes 3D navigation systems, natural speech and image processing capabilities, dramatically transforming the automotive user interface. NVIDIA Drive is the first car computing platform, utilizing advances in deep learning. Drive will leverage our dramatic advances in deep learning for voice, language and image recognition to enable surrounding and situational awareness in cars. We believe deep learning is the key enabling technology to continue advancements and autonomous driving capabilities. 
At the heart of NVIDIA Drive is the recent announcement of Tegra X1, a 256-core super chip with over 1 teraflops of floating-point processing power built on the same Maxwell architecture. Rolled out only months earlier for high-level gaming, Tegra X1 provides the computational horsepower, computer vision and graphic capabilities for cars that can see and learn. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at the financials. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% year-over-year to a record $1.25 billion. Growth was driven by strength in gaming, data center, cloud and auto. 
Fourth quarter revenue was up 2% sequentially. The GPU business grew 8%, helped by Maxwell GPUs and the seasonal increase in consumer PCs. Overall, Tegra processor sales decreased 33%, as growth in our automotive and SHIELD devices was more than offset by lower revenue from smartphone and tablets. Fiscal 2015 revenue grew 13% to a record $4.68 billion. In our GPU business, revenue grew 13% in Q4 from a year earlier. Revenue from our PC gaming platforms rose 38% due to the popularity of our high-end Maxwell-based GTX GPUs. 
Tesla GPUs [ph] for accelerated computing increased strongly, driven by large project wins with cloud service providers. 
Tegra processors declined 15% from -- in Q4 from a year ago, as smartphone and tablet designs reached the end of their product life cycle. This was partially offset by the increased revenue from auto infotainment systems, which more than doubled, and from SHIELD devices. 
Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margin was 55.9%, above our outlook for the quarter and up 70 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.2%, also above our outlook and was up 70 basis points sequentially. Strength in margins from gaming and accelerated computing was partially offset by those from Tegra processors and certain inventory provisions for prior Tegra architectures. 
For fiscal 2015, GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8%. These full year record levels were led by the strength of our high-end GPUs for gaming and accelerated computing. 
GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $468 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $420 million, in line with our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. For fiscal 2015, GAAP operating expenses were $1.84 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.66 billion. The low single digit growth from the previous year represents discipline from our continued management of our investments in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance return on invested capital. 
The U.S. Federal R&D tax credit was reinstated for calendar 2014. For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5%; non-GAAP was 16.9%, incorporating the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit. 
For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $193 million, up 31%, driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.35 increased 40% from a year ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. For the full year, GAAP net income was $631 million, up 43%, and GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 51% from a year earlier. 
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the full fiscal year of 2015, we paid $186 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.4 million shares for $814 million. As a result, we returned to shareholders $1 billion during fiscal 2015. Since restarting our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately $2.22 billion to shareholders. This represents 111% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal year 2013 through '15, reflecting the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years. 
In November of 2014, we announced our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, with the intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2016. 
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $474 million, down from $563 million in the prior quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was 483 million, up from 408 million in the prior quarter. This sequential increase included the ramping of our new Maxwell-based GPUs and Tegra-based SOCs and SHIELD devices. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $443 million, up from the $216 million in the prior quarter, reflecting higher net income and the annual payment from Intel. Free cash flow was $412 million in the fourth quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $54 million. Capital expenditures were $31 million. 
Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2016 to be $1.16 billion, plus or minus 2%. Growth year-over-year is expected from our key platforms, gaming, data center and cloud and automotive. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.2% and 56.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is slightly higher than our Q4 performance, driven by our gaming and accelerated computing platforms. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $478 million, with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $425 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect to maintain our operating expense levels near Q4 levels. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%, excluding the benefit of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit, which expired December of 2014. 
In summary, we are pleased with our record revenue for the quarter and the full year, which reflects strength across our platforms and businesses. Profitability as measured by earnings per diluted share increased 51% in fiscal 2015, as our revenue and gross margin growth continued to outpace our investment.

First of all, thanks. Our strategy for Tegra is the focus on automotive, gaming. And wherever opportunities arise in OEMs, we surely will entertain it, but our fundamental focus is automotive and gaming. And you already heard Colette say that our automotive business nearly doubled year-over-year. Our gaming business is really strong, and we have some exciting things that we'd love to share with you at the -- in the near future. But that -- those are our 2 focuses for Tegra. And if you look at the opportunities that we're pursuing in the area of automotive, obviously, more and more cars are becoming computerized cars. And at CES, we announced a brand new platform called Drive. And Drive is basically a mobile super chip, a mobile super computer, with a ton of software on top. And it provides for 3 basic functionalities: The first is a very advanced digital cockpit. You know that we're incredibly good at computer graphics, and the things that we can do in the car with more and more displays showing up in the car is pretty wonderful. The second is a technology called surround vision. Beyond surround view, which is basically cameras connected around the car, surround vision not only allows you to see the images from the videos around the car, but also create a virtual environment around it and, using computer vision technology, keep your car alert of the surroundings. And the third is using a technology called deep learning that has been revolutionized recently and it's something that we're very much at the center of. Using deep learning, we can do voice processing, natural language processing and understanding of imagery so that the car can be more situational and environmentally aware. All of those technology -- technologies that I just described, we believe, will help pave the path to the self driving car. In the area of mobile, the gaming -- in the area of mobile gaming, the gaming market, as you know, is huge and is growing quite rapidly internationally. It's about a $70 billion business now. We know that mobile cloud is probably one of the most important disruptions in the history of computing, and yet there's really no computer gaming architecture that serves mobile cloud very well. And that's what SHIELD is all about, to create the platform that allows mobile cloud to bring gaming to a lot more people. And we think that by doing so, we'll be able to engage a much, much larger part of the overall gaming market than just PC gaming, okay? So our Tegra business model is about focusing on automotive and gaming.",443,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Those are the 4 major segments that we -- 4 major markets that we serve. GPUs serve gaming, enterprise graphics and cloud. Gaming, as we've said earlier, has grown, as you mentioned, 38% year-over-year. Our enterprise graphics business, the workstation business, is relatively flattish. However, our enterprise virtualization -- virtualized graphics platform called GRID about doubled year-over-year. And our Tesla business, which is our accelerated computing business about doubled year-over-year. The PC OEM business declined. The PC OEM business represents, I would say, low-teens maybe approximately part of our overall business. We've been talking about its decline for some time now. And this year, again, it declined. Obviously, the PC OEM business, representing umpteen percent of our overall GPU business, represents a substantially lower part of its profits because the gross margins at OEMs tend to be much lower. But nonetheless, it declined year-over-year, okay? So looking at those segments then, gaming grew, enterprise grew, cloud computing and high-performance computing grew, OEM business -- PC OEM business declined from a low umpteen percent level, okay?",191,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We guided seasonally down. And of course, as usual, we'll see how it turns out. But if you look at the position of each one of our platforms, our position in gaming is very strong. The gaming market globally is quite robust. We're still seeing gaming growth all around the world, and the production value of games is increasing all the time. And whenever the production value of a game increases, it requires more GPU performance. For the very first time in history, a game console has come out that uses essentially a PC architecture, and its performance is substantially higher than the average PC performance. And so as a result, we see a lot of adoption to our higher-end GPUs, and that's good. We also expect that the Tesla platform continues to be quite robust. We know now that GPUs are wonderful processors for massively parallel applications like deep learning. Deep learning could be used for voice recognition, natural language processing, image recognition, video tagging, all kinds of interesting applications that are made possible because of cloud computing and because there are so many sensors and images and voice being uploaded into the cloud. That's one of the drivers for Tesla, and the Tesla business has doubled year-over-year from a fairly large base now. My expectation is that this coming year, Tesla will remain on that trajectory, and I hope that Tesla will grow very nicely this coming year. GRID, another part of our GPU business, is all about enterprise virtualization. Because of GRID, we're now able -- companies are able to now virtualize beyond the data center all the way to the end-user computing device. For the very first time, it is now possible to virtualize graphics-intensive applications and make it possible for people to enjoy their applications wherever they are. So now you can be virtualized, it can be more secure, you can be more mobile, enjoy graphics on any device. That platform is growing nicely. A year ago, we had about 400 trials. Today, we have well over 1,000. And recently, the most -- the largest enterprise virtualization company in the world, VMware, has integrated GRID into vSphere, and it has been -- it has gone to production, and so we're seeing quite a bit of momentum from that production release. So these platforms are all growing nicely, and I expect this year to help drive our growth.",403,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The way to add -- the way to increase our gross margins is to continue to innovate and increase the amount of value-added that we bring. And if you recall a long time ago, a long time ago meaning about 10 years ago, NVIDIA's gross margins was about 30-some-odd percent. And over time, we made the platform more and more software-rich. Today, our gross margins are surely much, much higher than 35%. And so my expectations is to do the same on the NVIDIA Drive platform. It's intensely software-rich. I think somebody said that today, a car is about 10% software, but soon, the car will be about 80% software, and I think that's right. I think that's right. I mean, in the future, with electric cars, you have obviously still very sophisticated drivetrain and such, but the car is going to be largely a computer with software. And that's where we can add an enormous amount of value, and that's what Drive is all about. Adding value through a very powerful processor, of course, but most of the capabilities I described from the digital cockpit to surround vision, to deep learning is all about software. It's all the software that runs on top of TX1. So that's #1. On your question about high-end versus midrange, I believe that more and more of the car's value will be delivered through software. And if you have to deliver it through software, then the processor underneath it is obviously more and more important. And my expectation is that great computing platforms will extend well into midrange into the low-end part of the marketplace. And that's just -- that's a belief. And just as I believed a long time ago, that the car is going to be one of our most sophisticated computers, which is obviously, at this point, coming true, my sense is that it's going to continue to go down that path, and we're going to see a lot more computation capability inside the car. To the point where I actually believe that every car will have a good processor, the high-end cars will have many good processors.",380,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

First of all, mobile is much more than phones. Mobile is a fundamentally new way of designing computers, and I believe that mobile will impact almost every segment of computing as we know it. It'll impact refrigerators. That's not a phone. It'll impact drones. That's not a phone. It'll impact earrings. That's not a phone. It'll impact watches. That's not a phone. It'll impact game consoles that is not a phone. It'll impact cars, and that's not a phone. I think mobile is going to be important in all kinds of computing devices. When I say mobile, that's what I mean. I don't mean mobile as in the mobile phone. Mobile technology is really important. I also believe that mobile cloud in combination is one of the most powerful computing forces that the computer industry has ever known. Because of mobile cloud, we've been able to extend the capabilities and the benefits of computing to billions of people, whereas in the PC area, we were able to benefit hundreds of millions of people. And yet no one has yet created a game platform around mobile cloud, the technology of mobile cloud, the power of mobile cloud, the architecture of mobile cloud, so that we can extend gaming not to tens of millions of game console users, but billions of users. I think that that's the great opportunity. And I don't have anything to announce today, but that's what we're trying to endeavor. So I appreciate you asking that question.

Again, we are looking at a cash balance lower than where we ended at fiscal year '14, due to our $1 billion return through shareholders, but also the increase in cash flow. Nothing has materially changed in terms of our cash flow from international and our cash flow in the U.S. So again, the majority of our cash flow tends to arrive from international overall operations. We have about the same mix of overall U.S. cash versus international cash, a little lower than where we ended at the end of fiscal year '14.

We're always moving to the next node. And Tegra X1, the mobile super chip that we announced at CES, is 20 nanometer, and so we're always moving forward. But the equation is much more complicated than that, and the reason for that is because we have the ability because of the fact that we architect and innovate from architecture all the way to software, we have the ability to improve our performance and efficiency and features on all of those dimensions. We can improve at the architectural level using the same process. We can innovate at the design level using the same process and same architecture. We can innovate at the process level. We can innovate at the software level. We can innovate at the algorithm level. And because we control all of that, we have the ability to move the needle forward in multiple dimensions. And so if you look at Maxwell, Maxwell is an unbelievable energy-efficient processor. And because of the energy efficiency of Maxwell, not only did we make all of GeForce higher performance, lower power, quieter, we were also able to take that GPU just a few months later and put it into a Tegra X1, and the performance is really quite shocking. And so we could innovate on multiple levels as a company. That's one of the benefits. But overall, we're moving forward all the time in process technology.",237,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

I appreciate that question. I think it's a great question, and the answer is actually really simple. I mean, we are in 2 different things. We make 2 different things, and so we're very complementary. Mobileye, think of it as a computer vision signal processor ISP, if you will. It's connected to the camera, and they do wonderful work in computer vision in that area. The Drive platform is a computing platform. Just as a phone has an ISP as well as the application processor, in this case, we're the application processor, if you will. This application processor has been designed to be incredible in the 3 areas that I talked about, digital cockpit, surround vision and deep learning-based computer vision. And so many of the customers -- in fact, most of the customers that I know, where there is ADAS work being done, we're both involved. And so we're connected to many Mobileye devices, and we're delighted by that. But even if you're able to detect images and objects, you still need to do something to process that information, and we can do it -- we could reconstruct the surround environment. We still have to drive infotainment in the digital cluster. And of course, we could apply higher-level deep learning algorithms to figure out what to do with the objects that you detect. And so I see ourselves very, very complementary. And of course, because we're a general-purpose processor and it's 1 teraflops of computing, we can do a lot of things for computer vision. And that's probably where people are questioning the overlap. But from where I see it, we're very complementary.",276,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

The dynamics are that more and more of the value of a car is going to have to go into its computing -- the heart and soul of its computing platform. And our expectations about our computer car and the software capabilities we can bring to bear over mechanical, electronic type of widgety things is going to grow substantially. Second, the fact of the matter is you can't spend 5 years designing a car anymore. Consumer electronics moves way too fast. People's expectations are set by what they have in their phones, and so you've got to move faster. And the most progressive car companies are moving at the speed of light now. They've taken their design cycle from 5 to 3, and I think I'm seeing them moving down to 2, potentially 1. And so this is going to be a brand new automotive industry. And the third thing that you mentioned is the content. Well, if you think about cars as a chip opportunity and it's an application processor opportunity like an infotainment like a smart phone, then, of course, it's in tens of dollars. But I actually see the car as a multi-thousand dollar computer opportunity. Some are one computer, some are many computers. And we're a computer company. We're a visual computing company. We are software-rich. All of the applications that I mentioned, the capabilities I mentioned are all software, we provide the entire BSP. We're one of the few companies in the automotive industry that can provide literally end-to-end solutions, and that's what Drive is about.

Maxwell made it possible. So first of all, the background. Maxwell made it possible, for the very first time, the ability to put a high-end GPU in a laptop and deliver a desktop-quality experience. So you can now get a laptop with a GeForce in it and have -- and run AAA titles at 1080p and at quality levels and frame rates higher than the state-of-the-art game consoles. That's pretty amazing. You can now just have a nice and thin laptop, and it's better than a game console. It's better than a game console. And so people are quite excited about that. Maxwell made that possible. We see this business growing well over 100% per year at the moment simply because it's off of a small base. This has been an underserved part of the market for some time. We've really welcomed just about every company in the world -- laptop company in the world into this opportunity, from ASUS to MSI, GIGABYTE. Recently, even HP came into this. And I say even because, of course, HP is largely focused on enterprises, and yet this opportunity is so significant that their notebook business decided to jump into the GeForce platform. Of course, Dell; of course, Alienware; or course Razer. We're just seeing a lot of support from every notebook maker in the world because this is an unserved -- underserved market, if you will, and with the tech -- with the Maxwell energy efficiency, for the first time, we're able to deliver an experience that, quite frankly, is pretty amazing. And so where do I see the attach? I guess, I don't think about attach anymore, and the reason for that is because PC OEM business is not really our focus in the sense that it's already umpteen -- a low umpteen part of our business. The way we think about that business is, that's really a gaming business. And how big can it be really is a function of how many gamers are there in the world. And I think the numbers are actually quite substantial, are really quite substantial. So I see this as a growth opportunity for some time.",368,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Just about anybody who has virtualized their enterprise had done so with VMware's technology. And so I think that this is a really big deal. And if you look at our trials, we went from about 400 last year at this time to well over 1,000 this year this time. Our revenues doubled. My sense is that there's no reason for that pace to slow, and we'll see how it turns out. But I would think that my intuition would be kind of like yours, that, if anything, you've got to accelerate. But there's really -- the most important thing about enterprise virtualization all the way to the client is to have deep integration with VMware, and we've done that, and they've done a great job.

Baidu announced that they built a supercomputer based on Tesla for deep learning, and it's used for natural language processing, translations in real-time from language to language, image recognition. Another one that was public, I just saw yesterday -- and this is actually quite a monumental event. The event is, for the very first time, for the very first time in history, a computer is able to understand images better than humans. This is a milestone event in the development of neural nets, the development of computer vision, and it was announced by Microsoft yesterday. A human has -- the best human has the ability to detect and make errors on about 5.1% of the time or recognize 95% of the images that they are presented. For the very first time in history, a computer is now able to recognize over 95%, better than a human. That, I think, is really quite a record. We will remember this day for a long time and look back on it. And they also said that their deep neural nets were trained using NVIDIA GPUs.

You definitely, over the last few years, have transformed from a component supplier to more of a platform-based business, where you're getting higher margins. I'm just wondering kind of where we are in that development cycle. And how do you look at the overall business model over the next 3 to 5 years for the company?",70,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

First of all, if you look at our company 10 years ago, 10 years ago, we were 100% PC OEMs largely. Maybe it wasn't 100%, but it was close. And now we're less than, we're only umpteen percent, substantially less than 20%. And so the company has been -- has been transitioning to this new model with our own platforms, largely software, and they serve 4 vertical markets. These 4 vertical markets have a characteristic that really, really benefits from great visual computing technology. And those 4 vertical markets, as I've mentioned, is gaming, is automotive, is enterprise graphics and is high-performance computing and cloud computing. And our PC OEM business is continuing to decline because PCs have largely become good enough, and it's fragmented. Most people use their PCs for information access, for working, and some people use it for gaming. And so for those gaming markets, we serve those. But for most of the generic and mainstream PCs, we've largely been out of those for some time. And so if you look at our business, it's now really focused on serving these 4 markets with our market-specialty platforms, and so I really appreciate that. The gross margins are obviously higher because it's very software-rich. If you extracted out the PC OEM business and just looked at those 4 segments, our gaming business, I think somebody mentioned, was growing at over 30%. Our automotive business has doubled. Our Tesla cloud computing business has doubled, and enterprise computing, our GRID business, has doubled year-over-year. And so those value-added, highly differentiated platforms are really growing nicely, and it's more than making up for the decline of our PC OEM business, which, as a result, our margins also increase. And so now you're starting to see the dynamics of the business, and it basically works like that.",311,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And last question for me with respect to GRID. So I was wondering if you could maybe update us on the design engagements with GRID in 2014 relative to, say, 2013. And as you continue on this trajectory, can you talk a little bit about how the enterprises are beginning to realize the leverage that a cloud-based visual computing architecture enables? And when do you think -- because the installed base is very large, as you've mentioned. And do you think this year will be the inflection point or are we already past the inflection point and you think we're going to start to see more acceleration of this cloud-based digital system?",115,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Well, there's -- let me break that question down into a couple of pieces. One, the number of OEM platforms that we were designed into, that we were designed into, was about 50 last year. It's almost 100 this year. About 50 this time last year, about 100 this time -- at this time. The number of trials we had last year was about 400. The number of trials we have here is about 1,000 plus. And the difference -- and I think the difference going forward for this coming year, when we stand here and look at this coming year backwards, I believe that what we're going to see is because of our now-completed integration with both VMware and Citrix and the fact that every single enterprise OEM has now adopted GRID and that GRID is making its way through just about every enterprise -- every company in the world as they get to be familiarized with them, I believe that this year could be a very important year for GRID. Now the second question that you asked is what are some of the things that people found are benefits of GRID, and I would say that there are several. The first one, the very first one is, of course, mobility. Mobility as in the sense that you can now access your PC applications from anywhere you happen to be, on any device you happen to be on. And so whatever device you have, all you have to do is have a browser and -- or an application, a receiver, if you will, a receiver application from VMware and Citrix, and you remote back into your PC. And every graphics application is perfectly compatible. The performance is wonderful, and it's where you left off, okay? So one is mobility. Second, for the benefit of the IT department, is security. No more digital downloads. The computer has now moved to the data center. The computer has moved to the data center, where the data is, so that you don't have to move the data to the client. I think that that's going to be an utter transformational event for security. And then the third is collaboration. Because more and more of us are working on the same data set and the data has become quite large, the ability to move the computer, if you will, to the data prevents all of us from having to download large data to our own client and become out of sync. And so now we can collaborate on the same data set because our computers are all right there in the data center. There are many other benefits, but these are the 3. I mean, I've also heard great stories. In Japan, one particular car company wanted to move all the workstations into the data center because it's dangerous to have so many heavy things in such tight environments. And during earthquakes, it's harder for them to manage all those different computers. And so they just have a mandate, push it all out into the data center. Another one, because of flexible workforces, this is now in Europe, large car companies do a lot of outsourcing. And because they work with different Tier 1s from a lot of different industries, it's hard for them to collaborate with them by having -- without having all their engineers of the Tier 1s of the subcontractors move on-site. And so now with GRID, they can actually have the computer be remotely accessed off-site in a secure way without digital download of the data, and the engineers, their subcontractors, can literally be everywhere. There are all kinds of anecdotal stuff. IT departments of colleges. Colleges are the perfect example -- another example. They have a large number of computers, but the computer per square meter is very, very low because, as you know, colleges are very large in campus. And then also, the people come and go. They only stay for a couple to 3 years by definition. And so in that particular case, putting all of the workstations in the data center has tremendous benefits to the IT department. So I hope that answers your question.",700,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Our largest market is China. As you know -- as you probably are -- could guess, GeForce is the largest game platform in China, and the reason for that is because it's a market that historically hasn't had access to game consoles. It's still extremely important, given how extremely expensive consoles are. And of course, most of the titles are from the West, and most of the titles that people enjoy in China tends to be multiplayer. It tends to be role-playing games. It tends to be Internet-based games. And so though China still remains our largest market, the fastest-growing market is probably Southeast Asia. These developing countries -- developing markets, excuse me, developing markets, then they get to a certain point in their computer history and Internet history, all of a sudden, the gaming market booms. And in that area, Southeast Asia, we know now the economies have become sufficiently vibrant because of the outpouring of opportunities from China. Those local regional economies have now become quite large and quite vibrant, and we're seeing the same thing now as we saw 5 years ago in China. We're seeing the same developments in Southeast Asia. So I would say that Southeast Asia is still -- is probably the fourth largest region, but it's the fastest-growing region by far.
