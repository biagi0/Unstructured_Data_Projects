I'm very pleased to report another quarter of record performance for Applied Materials. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we've seen a continued acceleration of demand in our semiconductor business as major macro and industry trends fuel increasing consumption of silicon across a wide range of markets and applications. 2020 was an excellent year for Applied as we outperformed our markets while growing our earnings nearly twice as fast as revenue. We carry this strong momentum into 2021. Our broad portfolio and exposure to technology inflections, combined with the traction of our new products, put us in a great position to substantially outgrow our markets again this year and into the future. 
I want to thank our employees and suppliers for everything they are doing to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Our operations and field teams are doing an incredible job as we run the company at record levels and successfully overcome significant logistics and other challenges created by the pandemic. 
In R&D, our teams are working in new ways to accelerate the time to market of critical innovations for our customers, and we're doing all of this while maintaining a relentless focus on keeping our colleagues and families safe. 
As Mike outlined, we plan to hold an investor meeting in early April. At that event, we will provide our in-depth analysis of the major growth drivers and inflections that will shape our markets over the next 5 to 10 years and describe our strategy to deliver innovative new technologies to enable our customers' power, performance and cost road maps, accelerate their time to market and drive Applied's long-term profitable growth. 
In today's call, I will focus my comments on the near term, first, covering the dynamics we currently see in the market and then highlighting some of our recent accomplishments that illustrate the momentum we have across the business.
Starting with a high-level view of our markets. We are seeing a diverse combination of macro and technology factors fueling very strong and sustainable demand for semiconductors. As the world continues to navigate the current challenges and prepares for a post-pandemic era, the digital transformation of the economy is being accelerated. Companies are rethinking and reengineering the way they operate, and there's an immense pull for advanced technology. 
In addition, consumers are making different choices about the way they spend their time and the products and services they buy. I strongly believe many of the changes we're seeing today are irreversible since new ways of working offer compelling advantages in terms of time and productivity.
Within the electronics ecosystem itself, key technology inflections are driving increasing silicon consumption. I'll highlight 3 examples. Cloud service providers are forecasting data center CapEx growth of more than 15% this year on top of record spending in 2020. With the broader adoption of 5G handsets, silicon content in smartphones is growing at double-digit rates. And in automotive, where there are known supply shortfalls, total semi consumption is expected to expand more than 15% this year, translating these factors to industry investments. In foundry/logic, leading-edge investments are very strong and have been well articulated by our customers. 
On top of that, our ICAPs business that serves the IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets is expected to grow even faster and is on track to exceed $3 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. And then 2020 was a strong recovery year with spending up more than 30%. And in 2021, we expect customers to invest at modestly higher levels. In DRAM, supply-demand fundamentals look more favorable than NAND. And as a result, we still expect DRAM investments to outgrow NAND this year. All of this adds up to a very strong demand environment for wafer fab equipment, and we believe this strength is sustainable well beyond 2021. 
Digital transformation touches every sector of the economy and is nondiscretionary for many industries. In addition, industry investments appear disciplined. When you look at wafer fab equipment intensities, that's wafer fab equipment revenues as a percentage of semiconductor industry revenues, they are well below recent peaks in all 3 of the device segments: foundry/logic, NAND and DRAM. 
Turning to Applied's business performance. Our Semiconductor Systems revenues for the first fiscal quarter were up 26% compared to the same period last year. At the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, Semi Systems will be up around 50% year-on-year. And based on our current outlook, we expect to again grow faster than the market for the year as a whole.
There are a number of factors contributing to this outstanding performance. First, our business is very well balanced across devices and customers. Second, we have the broadest portfolio of products and capabilities, spanning materials creation, modification, removal and analysis. These technologies, combined with our ability to connect them in unique ways, are fundamental to enabling our customers' power, performance and cost road maps. And third, we have an incredible pipeline of new products and integrated solutions that are winning applications, expanding our served opportunities and reducing the time it takes our customers to bring important new innovations to market. 
Node-over-node opportunity growth in both foundry/logic and memory favors Applied's leadership businesses, including epi, thermal processing, CMP and PVD. In fact, we believe our PVD business can grow more than 40% this year and generate more than $3 billion of revenue.
Our latest-generation products have strong momentum, and more than 25% of our 2021 revenues will come from critical applications that we've targeted and won since 2018. Some highlights include CVD, where we grew revenues 30% in 2020 and have strong customer pull for new, differentiated material solutions that are highly enabling for advanced patterning; conductor etch, where we're winning new applications in DRAM and foundry/logic that contributed to our 32% revenue growth in this market last year; process diagnostics and control, where we believe we can grow more than 25% this fiscal year on top of the 45% growth we delivered in 2020, thanks to new optical wafer inspection and e-beam products that are still in the early stages of adoption; in packaging, where we expect revenues to be up 50% year-on-year on top of strong growth in 2020. 
Also, over the past few years, we've started introducing a new class of highly differentiated products that we call Integrated Materials Solutions, or IMS. Our IMS products can combine multiple process technologies with onboard metrology and sensors within a single system that are capable of enabling unique films, structures and devices. We have numerous IMS engagements with our leading customers. And this year, we will generate meaningful revenues from our initial IMS products.
Moving to service. AGS delivered another record quarter. Over the past 5 years, we've grown our services business at a compound annual growth rate of 12%, which is twice as fast as our installed base growth. In this period, we've increased the percentage of service and parts revenue generated by service agreements from around 40% to more than 60%. These long-term agreements enable us to deliver more value to customers with our advanced service products while providing us with stickier and more predictable recurring revenue streams. Our renewal rates for these agreements are also very high at over 90%. 
Finally, in display. Our outlook remains consistent with the view we shared in November. We expect 2021 revenues to be similar to 2020 as we continue to manage through the current market trough. We do see encouraging leading indicators of future growth, including higher OLED adoption in the smartphone market with the vast majority of 5G handsets being equipped with OLED screens and increasing OLED consumption beyond phones in TVs and IT applications. We still believe OLED is a compelling technology, and this inflection is a great catalyst for the display market that will create expanded opportunities for Applied. 
Before I hand the call over to Dan, I want to again thank all our employees for their outstanding contributions to Applied's success. 2021 is off to a great start with record results and outlook. We see strong and sustainable demand in our semiconductor business, fueled by a combination of macro and technology drivers. We have great momentum, thanks to our broad market exposure and differentiated portfolio of new products. And we believe we're in a great position to outperform our markets again this year. 
Finally, we're looking forward to sharing our long-term vision for the industry and Applied Materials at our investor event in April.
Now Dan will give his perspective on the business environment and provide more color on our financial results and operational performance. Dan?",1432,8.0,5.0,0.9444444444444444,0.5
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3660.0,2216201.0,86181220.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll begin by summarizing Applied's performance in Q1, and then I'll share some of the key drivers of our growth relative to the markets in calendar 2020, and I'll finish with our guidance for Q2.
Beginning with our Q1 performance. Applied delivered record revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. We grew revenue by 24% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance. I'm pleased that we increased gross margin by around 100 basis points year-over-year, particularly since we are still experiencing COVID-related manufacturing protocols and logistics costs. We also generated record non-GAAP operating profit of nearly $1.5 billion, which was up 40% year-over-year. We increased non-GAAP EPS by 42% year-over-year to $1.39.
Our teams operated with discipline, and this enabled Applied to deliver record free cash flow of $1.3 billion, which was up 47% year-over-year. We increased cash and investments on the balance sheet by nearly $950 million to $8.22 billion as we await the regulatory decision for the Kokusai Electric transaction. I look forward to updating you on our capital allocation plans when we get together for the investor meeting in April.
Turning to the segments. Our Semi Systems group increased revenue by 26% year-over-year, including new quarterly records in etch, metal deposition and CMP. Operating margin grew by 320 basis points year-over-year. Applied Global Services also delivered revenue above our expectations while reporting its highest operating margin over the past 2 years despite ongoing challenges related to COVID. The display group exceeded its revenue target and increased operating margin by 590 basis points year-over-year. Looking ahead, our demand outlook calls for growth. We currently expect all 3 of our segments to post higher revenue in the second half of our fiscal year.
Next, I'll comment on our semiconductor equipment revenue performance in calendar 2020, which is equal to our Q2 of fiscal 2020 through Q1 of fiscal 2021. As I previewed on our November earnings call, 2020 was a memory growth year in which NAND equipment spending grew at nearly twice the rate of the overall market. DRAM customer spending also grew faster than the market, and foundry/logic investments grew slower than the overall market but still accounted for over 55% of total spending. Applied has balanced share, and our revenue profile resembled the overall mix with our highest growth in NAND at 34%. We grew by 27% in DRAM and 23% in foundry/logic, and we believe we significantly outperformed in both of these end markets. 
Within the semi systems group, our growth was strongest in areas where we've made significant investments to drive the new playbook to develop integrated material solutions for our customers and introduce new products where we have significant room to gain share. One of our fastest-growth areas was in advance packaging, where we have the industry's broadest portfolio and by far the highest share. As Gary said, we expect this momentum to continue into 2021. 
Our dollar growth was highest in CVD and etch, which reflects the success we've had co-optimizing new CVD films with our Sym3 etch system to create unique patterning solutions across 3D NAND, DRAM and foundry/logic. Among new products, our latest optical wafer inspection system grew by 44% in 2020, achieving over $400 million in cumulative revenue. We'll officially introduce the new system in the near future to explain its unique architectural features, along with breakthrough AI capabilities that are generating strong customer pull.
Turning to calendar 2021. We expect strong foundry/logic spending to continue. We also expect DRAM spending to grow at a faster pace than NAND. This 2021 mix expectation plays particularly well to Applied's technology innovations and strong product road map. 
Now I'll share our Q2 business outlook. We expect company revenue to be approximately $5.39 billion, plus or minus $200 million. The midpoint would be up about 36% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.50, plus or minus $0.06, or up about 70% year-over-year.
Within this outlook, we project Semiconductor Systems revenue of $3.85 billion, up around 50% year-over-year; and AGS revenue of about $1.14 billion, up around 12% year-over-year. These forecasts do not include any revenue from shipments that still require government licenses. We expect display revenue of around $370 million with growth resuming in the second half. We expect Applied's non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47% or up around 240 basis points year-over-year, and we expect non-GAAP OpEx to increase to $890 million. Our Q2 guidance assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 12% to 13% and a weighted average share count of around 929 million.
In summary, I'm pleased that Applied delivered another quarter of record performance in Q1 with strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. 
I'd like to join Gary in thanking our teams for supporting our customers under challenging circumstances and operating with discipline to generate higher margins and free cash flow. Execution by our employees has been and continues to be nothing short of superb in what is still a challenging COVID environment. 
We look forward to giving you more insights into our markets and our company's growth plans at the investor meeting in April.

And obviously, you talked about favorable mix coming into 2021 led by foundry and DRAM as well as, I assume, your strong position on the legacy side. So curious if you can kind of speak to what kind of outperformance we should be thinking about relative to WFE in 2021 and if you can point to the particular drivers that we should be focused on.",84,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Thanks, C.J. So in 2020, if we say the market's around $60 billion in 2020, I would say it's up a little more than 16% against that backdrop. If you look at our Semi Systems segment, we grew our Semi Systems segment revenue by 26.5%, so significant outperformance, as you've called out. 
As we look at the drivers in 2020, foundry/logic grew below the industry average. It was really a memory-driven growth year; NAND, about 2x; DRAM, a little more than the industry average. So the company performed really well in that environment.
As we go to 2021, we view the spend mix to be a more favorable environment for us as a company. Foundry/logic will continue to be strong in 2021. We see DRAM outgrowing NAND. And so against that more favorable spend mix, we would expect to significantly outperform the market again this year. So we feel really good about how we're positioned against the market opportunity. We've got robust end markets and strong product momentum within those end markets, so we feel good. 
And then as we look beyond 2021, we see from an overall market standpoint and a company-specific momentum standpoint, we see continued strong performance into 2022. So again, we like how well we're positioned. 2021 is a more favorable mix, and I would expect us to significantly outperform again.",226,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

C.J., this is Gary. Thanks for the question. I'll give a little bit more color relative to our specific opportunities. If you look at the industry overall, certainly, technology is transforming every aspect of our lives. That's driving the overall business sustainably higher. And at the same time, we've talked about 2D scaling coming to an end. So really -- and you can even see in recent meetings with some of our largest customers where they're publicly talking about the road map going forward around new chip architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together, design technology co-optimization, again, around certain structures and materials. And so that's really where we're focused. 
And when you think about what's going to enable the future, it really is about new structures, new materials. We talked about packaging up 50%, new ways to connect chips together. And we're just in a sweet spot relative to the technologies we have. When you think about creating those new structures and new materials, PVD is a big driver for us. Our epi business is going to be very strong this year. The thermal processing, CVD, all of those areas are very strong. Etch, we're continuing to win. 
And when you think about shaping those structures, our Selectra product is a leader in the industry, creating and shaping those structures and then the modification with CMP and implant. And then in PDC, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, that business is growing for us. So I can certainly give more color later on the call on that. 
But again, we're just in a really great position. When you think about what's going to enable the future inflections and the power and performance for the infrastructure, going forward, we've never been in a better position.",302,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dan, it's probably not all that surprising that half-on-half growth is expected, both in services and display. But in the Semi System businesses, that's a little bit different than kind of the tone that some of your peers have talked about with kind of a first half weighting of WFE. And it might be explained by your last comment to C.J.'s question about having a little bit higher view on overall WFE. 
But I'm kind of curious, given that your fiscal year doesn't match up with the calendar year, do you think, on a calendar year basis, that we're going to have a stronger second half than first half? And just relative to your fiscal year commentary, what gives you the bottoms-up confidence of half-on-half growth, specifically in the Semi Systems business?",139,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Sure, John. Thanks for the question. Let me try to unpack it a little bit so we can talk about sort of what we're seeing in our business versus maybe what others see in theirs. So I guess the first thing I'd point to is we've got very broad end-market exposure. We're very balanced across all 3 device types: foundry/logic, NAND, DRAM, really strong positions in each of those end markets. But within those markets, we've got product breadth and momentum around a number of our businesses. So we've got more balanced end-market exposure than, say, some who are more narrowly focused. 
Second thing I'd point to, and this ties into the answer I just gave to C.J.'s question, we've got a more favorable mix setup in 2021 with foundry/logic continuing to be strong, DRAM outgrowing NAND. So I think that serves us well for continued and significant outperformance. And then we talked about carrying the momentum, both from a market and product standpoint, into 2022. So I feel good about how that transition looks.
And then lastly, as you rightfully pointed out, within the fiscal year, we see back-half momentum with each of our respective reporting segments. So again, where we sit today, we think we're really well set up for strong performance throughout the year.",218,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Do you think this $70 billion WFE for the industry is sufficient to address these shortages? Or can the WFE number be higher? Or do you think that this actually could push out some of the demand into next year as well before the shortages are fully met?",63,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

So a couple of things on that, Vivek. First of all, our number for the aggregate size in 2021, we weren't point-specific, but we're a little higher than where the -- a bit higher than where the industry consensus is. I do think there's good, strong positive momentum. 
I think the capacity our customers put in place is around multiyear demand statements. To make these investments make sense over the long run, drive a return on those investments, there has to be a substantive, not a transitorial, demand statement that sits behind those investments our customers make. And so we do think there's a bit of catch-up spend. When you think about shortages in the auto industry, we think that's going to be a good end market. But I don't think that market, in and of itself, is sufficiently large to drive the types of demand that we're talking about in the current environment. 
So then we look at greater than $70 billion in 2021, the demand statement that sits behind that, it's diverse. It's broad. All the respective end markets, NAND, DRAM, foundry/logic, are strong. Some grow faster than others. And it's on the back of these trends we've been talking about playing out over time. We think we're in the very early innings. This is going to be a decade-plus investment cycle. Semiconductors are going to be on the key path of enabling some pretty major trends that play out around the world.

And I guess, going into the second half of the fiscal year, would it be fair to assume sort of a gradual progression higher given potentially faster growth in your leadership products and hopefully COVID inefficiencies going away?",80,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Thanks, Toshiya. When I think about gross margins, company is performing well. We're up 100 basis points year-over-year in the most recent quarter's results. On the guide, we're up about 240 basis points year-over-year, and that's against the backdrop of still some pretty sizable headwinds as it relates to the pandemic safety protocols in our factories, logistics costs to move material around the world. And so I think the company is performing extremely well in the current environment. 
And when I think about what's driving that, there's a set of company-specific actions that drive discipline and efficiency into the core operations of the business. No matter where our gross margins are, I will never be satisfied. We've had a number of actions inside of the company to drive that efficiency, to drive that discipline into the core of the operations, and we're beginning to see some of those really take hold in the current environment. So we feel good about the work streams, a lot of hard work inside of the company, doing some really hard work and fundamental things to drive that efficiency. 
You'll always have an element of customer mix and what we happen to be selling in any 1 quarter that will influence things from quarter-to-quarter, but there's a whole host of substantive actions that we think are serving the company really well in the current environment. 
As I look forward into the back half of the fiscal year, this is not a 1-quarter phenomenon. The top end of our long-term target model for gross margin was 47%. And even in the COVID environment, we're operating at that level. I would expect us in the back half of the year to be -- continue to be in the 46.5% to 47% top end of our long-term model. 
At our Analyst Day, we'll talk about what we see beyond the current horizon over the next several years and opportunities we see to work the gross margins up even higher off of these levels but definitely not a 1-quarter phenomenon. Company is performing well.",346,8.0,5.0,0.9444444444444444,0.5

Let me -- so I do think that everyone can see that, relative to economic growth and employment growth going forward, it's going to look different. And the digital transformation of every industry is being accelerated in the current environment that we're in. So this is very strategic from -- again, from an economic and employment growth perspective. 
From Applied's perspective, we have been engaged with customers and also government initiatives around investments in different locations. And what I would say from Applied's perspective, there are a couple of things to think about. One is, as these companies are moving into new locations, you have to look at the scale of the factories that they're building and -- at least what's been announced is smaller scale, somewhat less efficient. Now supply-demand eventually works itself out, but that somewhat less efficient factory size is a positive for Applied. 
And the other thing, what we've seen in every case where a company is moving from one geographic location where they have tremendous amount of talent concentration and experience that, that creates an opportunity for our service business as they move into a new location. So I think both of those things, the factory efficiency and the service business, our service agreements are much higher also in those cases. That creates an opportunity for us. This can play out over time. But certainly, I think from a strategic perspective, we can all see that the pull there is very strong.",248,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The question I had for Gary was you spoke about process control growing over 40% last year and possibly over 20% this year, which is very impressive, given you're outgrowing peers. Just kind of curious, is it all primarily coming from the new optical inspection tool? Or is e-beam, patterning adding some extra fuel to it? Or can you give some puts and takes around the PDC growth this year?",90,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3660.0,2216201.0,86181243.0,Answer,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,26,"Yes. Thank you, Krish. So really, I would say there's 3 major drivers. One is the new optical wafer inspection system where we've seen tremendous pull. And especially in foundry -- leading foundry, we've seen a tremendous ramp of that new optical wafer inspection system. And it really gives the customers tremendous performance at a much better cost of ownership so they can insert inspection points in more places in the line, and that has a big impact on the speed of the yield ramp. So that's really in the early phase of adoption, the new optical wafer inspection system. 
Our e-beam products are tremendously strong. If you look at a 2021, our e-beam growth would exceed every prior year for PDC total systems business other than 2020. So that business is very strong. We have leadership in electron optics. We've introduced a new source technology that gives us much higher resolution, much faster imaging in one segment of the EB market. We will take that core technology in electron optics across all of our different platforms, and it creates just a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to extend our leadership in the e-beam part of the market. So that's growing very fast.
And the third thing I would say that's really important, when you think about power performance area and cost, what's really important to our customers is how fast they can drive all of those different key metrics. So accelerating, certainly for us and for them, we talk about PPACt, is enormously important. And there are cases with the -- especially our e-beam products where you can generate orders of magnitude more data in a much faster period of time. 
So when you're thinking about optimizing the new materials, the new structures with unique imaging and algorithms to accelerate both our internal R&D at Applied and also the PPAC road map for our customers, that synergy is increasing from an overall company perspective. 
So again, I think the optical inspection, we're in the early phase of the adoption. E-beam, leadership in imaging. We'll extend that leadership with new capabilities. And the synergies with our overall business has never been better and never been more important for us and for our customers.",374,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Thanks, Harlan, let me just pull up some statistics on the split. So trailing-node versus leading-edge this year, we kind of see -- if it was maybe -- yes, probably a follow-through on 70-30 again this year: 70% leading-edge, 30% trailing-node geometries. 
As we go back in time, we've been talking about this a fair amount here over the last couple of years. So strength on the trailing-node geometries is -- has not been new. In fact, if we go back 2010 to 2020, take that 10-year window, if the foundry business over that time, in aggregate, grew just about 90% a little bit less, the trailing-node geometries have been above the foundry segment average at about just over 110% growth. Leading-edge has grown at about just over 75%. So this trend has been playing out for quite some time. We're well positioned in this segment. We're delivering key technologies, and the company is performing well.

Harlan, I can add just maybe a little bit to this. I think this opportunity in what people refer to as specialty semiconductor is significant. About 2 years ago, we formed an organization we call ICAPs focused on IOT, communication, auto, power, sensors, pulling together all of our capabilities across the company. And we now see this as one of the fastest-growing opportunities within Applied Materials. 
And when you think about what drives those markets, whether it's sensor technologies or power devices, RF, any of those types of businesses, it really plays to our leadership products: epi, PVD, CVD, implant, thermal, CMP, etch and PDC. So we really have a good position there. We pulled together an incredibly strong group within Applied, and we've also -- we also have a focused device integration team just on those particular devices. So we talk about Integrated Material Solutions, and we have some really dynamite integration engineers beyond the unit processes so that our role -- our strategic role in enabling that market has been increasing as we've refocused the organization.

So thanks, Joe. So we talked about, in the prepared comments, growing this business at twice the rate of our overall installed base. So this has been playing out over multiple years. Company has done a good job outgrowing the installed base. We're outgrowing it 2:1 over an extended period of time. 
Embedded in that growth are a couple of things. Service entitlement on the new technologies is greater than what we used to ship, say, a decade ago or more. The technology is more complex. The customers' integration windows, process windows are tighter, so it requires continually tighter specs and the performance of our equipment and tighter windows. And so that creates a nice adder as well. 
And then when you think about the strategy, 5 years ago, we had around 40% of our revenue covered by long-term service agreements. The vast majority of those service agreements had a tenor of about 1 year in duration. Fast-forward to today, we've penetrated over 60% of the revenue covered by long-term service agreements. 1/3 of those long-term service agreements have now stretched out their tenor beyond 1 year, so we feel really good about the value that we're adding to customers. And it's underpinning nice growth for the business. So we feel good about the strategy. We feel good about the execution of the opportunity, and it's a nice, stable source of profitability, cash flow and value creation for our shareholders.

Thanks, Quinn. So from an Austin manufacturing standpoint, I would say our business was subjected to the power fluctuations that most commercial enterprises -- manufacturing enterprises saw in Austin. What I would say is we don't see a material impact to the business. We think the weather gets better here another day, power stabilizes. We've been in close contact, as you can imagine, with our team there. We've got risk-mitigation plans in place. We've got labor prepositioned. I think we're ready to respond quickly once the power stabilizes. And the guidance we've put forward contemplates everything that's going on in that region and the way we are going to respond and drive output as quickly as possible once we get the stable power back, and so we feel good about where we sit today in support of the guide that we put out there. 
As it relates to localization of supply chains disaggregation of manufacturing footprint, here's what I would say from a business impact standpoint and a market perspective. I would say global supply is going to meet global demand. And Gary mentioned that if you've got 2 50,000 wafer start a month factories, that's less a capital-efficient manufacturing footprint than 1 large 100,000 wafer start a month facility. So while I don't think it's a step-function change from an overall wafer fab equipment standpoint, I would say that wafer fab equipment is probably positively biased to the upside as a result of those multiple smaller-scale facilities. 
The other impact I would say from a business perspective as these supply chains localize is we've got a great global footprint of our service organization. They do great things for our customers around the globe. When our customers locate capacity in areas outside of their home geography, that's been a nice service adder. We've seen a nice service adder and increased entitlement on that capacity historically, and I would expect that to continue. So we think that that's going to be a nice tailwind for our service business as that trend materializes going forward.",344,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So a couple of things, and thanks for the question, Blayne. Just a couple of things on the transition from Q1 to Q2. What I would observe about Q1 is as we get a holiday shutdown in that period at the end of a calendar year, you also have partial impact of annual merit increases, 1-month impact. As we move into Q2, you no longer have a shutdown, and you get a full quarter impact of merit increases. So there's an embedded cost escalator in that time frame. 
The other thing I would say, and Gary spent a lot of time talking about this, there is a very fundamental transition happening in our industry. Traditional Moore's Law is shrinking -- I mean traditional Moore's Law 2D shrinks are beginning to hit a wall. The industry is pivoting to a new playbook, and we have a meaningful key enablement role to play in each element of that new playbook. We are going to be disciplined, but we are going to invest to grow. We're going to drive innovation. We're going to be a key enabler of our customers' road maps. 
From a discipline standpoint, I think the company has got a good track record. From an OpEx perspective, close to 70% of what we spend is fuel for growth, R&D with pretty tight containment from a discretionary spend standpoint. So we're close to 70% of all OpEx goes to R&D. 
And then from an OpEx leverage perspective, an observation I would make is -- and this goes to growing the company in a very disciplined manner, delivering innovation but doing it in an efficient manner. Over the last 12 months, we've got 340 basis points of OpEx leverage that we've delivered. And if I take it out to 8 quarters, we've got to 460 basis points of OpEx leverage that we've delivered to the P&L. So I think the company has demonstrated a great track record of delivering these innovations but doing it in an efficient way that drives significant value for shareholders.

So we're going to see gate-all-around maybe late next year but definitely in 2023. And then we go to FinFETs maybe in '24 or definitely '25, which seems like a long way away, but it's not really that far out there. And there seems to kind of be a broad view that litho is going to be a big headwind for the films companies like you. But it actually seems like the same thing could happen in logic that happened in NAND, where you start to stack transistors so that you could capture the incremental dollars versus litho if you look out, say, 3 to 5 years. So can you just kind of talk about what's happening in logic?",129,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So what I would say, I meet these CEOs and R&D leaders for leading foundry and logic on a very regular basis, actually more often now than I did before the pandemic because we're doing all of this virtual. I deeply believe -- and you can see even this week, there was one of our leading customers talking about how they're driving their technology road maps going forward. And it's really around the 5 elements that we've been talking about: the new structures; new chip architectures; everybody is designing their own application-specific chips; new materials; new ways to shrink. I've talked about packaging and the growth there, but I think we're just in a tremendous position. 
And when you think about what's going to drive power performance and cost going forward, there's no question, it's about these new structures and these new materials. And when you look at really all of the different markets, you talked about the new transistor structures going forward, whether -- people call gate-all-around or nano sheets or also the wiring, the resistance in the wiring, there's tremendous focus in those areas because that is really what enables power and performance going forward. So we're just in a really tremendous position. 
When you think about the materials that are needed to create those nano sheets or the wiring or 3D DRAM or any of those big inflections that are going forward in the future, we just have, by far, the best portfolio of materials that creates those structures. 
Then you think about shaping the structures. We have strength in conductor etch. We're -- we've certainly had a strong position in memory. We're growing in foundry/logic. You'll see our share continue to grow there. Shaping with the Selectra product is also really important for nano sheets and for other new structures, the modification of those different structures and also accelerating the time to market. I talked about the synergies with our PDC and especially our e-beam business. When I'm building this new transistor, if I can see the materials -- residual materials inside that structure as I'm driving the R&D versus having to cross-section one particular transistor and look inside that, their learning rates go up by orders of magnitude. So those unique imaging capabilities, combined with the unique capabilities in creating and shaping and modifying those structures, again, I just -- if you look at what's being presented by our leading customers, even this week, you'll see exactly aligns to this new playbook and enabling capabilities for Applied. So again, I've never been more excited about our opportunities to enable the road map.",442,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And does your WFE outlook for this year include the assumption that we don't see any license from customers that are required by the government right now?",44,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

Joe, thanks for your question. So from a domestic China standpoint, we think we ended the year 2020 around $10 billion. We think we're up a few billion off of that level. So we'll see this year what we've been seeing for several years now, which is slow, steady ecosystem development. You're going to see some investment in technology road maps and still some pretty modest capacity additions that sit behind those technology road maps. 
And then from a licensing standpoint, just given where we sit in the process, we think it's prudent to forecast and guide revenue and market sizing, assuming the licenses do not come through. And when we receive the licenses, then we'll adjust the expectations. I would expect revenue to go up, and I would expect the market sizing to go up. But the current forecast expectations of greater than $70 billion this calendar year for the overall market size does not assume that those licenses come through.

My only little nitpick here, just on the display business, I feel like every quarter, we kind of try to call a bottom here. But then you made comments about all of the segments kind of being up in the second half. Can you maybe just help us understand what the magnitude is at for the display business? And then secondly, if you've got any sort of like actual visibility into that and confidence around display being up in the second half of the year.",93,3.0,5.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5

So a couple of things on display. I think we've been very consistent in this business over time. We know that from quarter-to-quarter, this is a business that will bounce around a little bit. But we've been saying now for many quarters that the sizing in 2021 from an overall market spend perspective, as well as the proportion of spend in TV, in mobile, is going to look and feel a lot like 2020. And that's exactly what we see playing out. 
The implication for our business revenue, and we've been saying this for many quarters now, the revenue that we see in our display business in fiscal 2021 is going to be very similar to what we produced in fiscal 2020. And so I think that gives you the math. You know what we've done in fiscal Q1. You know what we just guided to in fiscal Q2. That gives you a sense of the step-up that we see in the back half of the year. 
And then as we look forward into 2022, we are monitoring a number of green shoots. We talked about on the last earnings call, our confidence interval around them continue to increase, and the confidence interval around 2022 being a robust investment point in the cycle continues to increase. So we feel good about where we stand, growing off of the guide we just gave in fiscal Q2. 
From an order standpoint -- we can see it from an order standpoint growth into the back half of the year, and we can also see it from a customer deposit perspective. And so we feel good about how we're shaping expectations around this market, and I've got no anxiety given what we see and where we sit around the second half being stronger than the first half in that business.",307,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thanks for the question, Patrick. So I'd start off by saying we've talked about this as being 1 of the 5 key drivers for the PPAC road map going forward. And if you look at what leading customers are talking about, packaging is incredibly important for power and performance and cost. So for me, personally, I've engaged much more so with the R&D leaders in this particular industry than I ever was. 
Relative to your question about existing products versus new products, I would say it's both. If you look at wafer-level packaging, we're #1 in wafer-level packaging; advanced wafer-level packaging with PVD, CVD, CMP, plating. We have a new Sym3 via etcher also, where we won one of the largest -- one of our largest customers in that business. So we have all of those combinations of products in packaging. 
And we also announced recently a new integrated hybrid bonding system working with another company that is really important. And we have very strong pull from every one of the -- our leading customers with that new technology. So again, it's a combination of both, where we're innovating with our existing products, also looking at accelerating the big inflections in packaging, and hybrid bonding is one example of that. 
So I think it's just a tremendous opportunity for the company. I think this is going to become more important as we go forward, and we're in a unique position with the combinations of capabilities that we have.",249,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

I'm pleased to report another record quarter for Applied Materials, underpinned by strong and broad-based demand across our semiconductor businesses as large secular trends fuel increasing consumption of silicon. I'd like to thank our passionate and hard-working team for delivering these great results. And in particular, I want to acknowledge our operations group and suppliers for successfully overcoming logistics and supply chain challenges in the quarter.  
At our recent investor meeting, we described our thesis for the industry, laid out our growth strategy and provided our new financial and capital allocation models. Therefore, in today's call, I will focus my comments on 3 main topics: how we see the current market environment; how Applied is outperforming our markets today; and how we're positioned to grow faster than our markets over the longer term. Later in the call, Dan will talk about our subscription revenues, the strength in our service business and provide more color on our financial performance and outlook.  
I'll begin with the industry environment. As the world starts to transition to the post-pandemic economy, demand for semiconductors continues to grow. The pandemic accelerated key technology trends that make semiconductors more pervasive and indispensable in people's lives. Current capacity shortfalls in some areas of the market show the highly efficient, just-in-time supply chains that have served the semiconductor industry well for the past 2 decades may not be the most effective strategy going forward. There's a clear desire for the chip industry to build more resilient and flexible supply, including more regionally distributed capacity as the strategic importance of the semiconductor supply chain is increasingly acknowledged at a national level.  
It's also important to recognize that we're still in the early innings of major secular trends that will play out over the next decade and drive the semiconductor and semi-equipment markets structurally higher. At the investor meeting, we described 5 overlapping inflections. First, at a macro level, digital transformation of the economy is rapidly advancing. For individuals, companies and nations, embracing digital transformation is nondiscretionary because it changes the basis of competition. Those who quickly and effectively embrace these new ways of working will emerge as winners. And those who don't or can't adapt, will not keep up.  
Digital transformation is driving exponential growth in data generation, which leads to the second major inflection, AI computing. New computing approaches are needed to create value from these massive volumes of data. AI computing works best with workload-specific software and hardware built from customized and entirely new types of silicon.  
Third, the benefits of traditional Moore's Law 2D scaling are slowing down, and the semiconductor industry is transitioning to a new playbook to drive power, performance, area, cost and time to market. As the PPACt playbook is adopted, it is driving a step-up in investments across the ecosystem.  
Fourth, there's an increased focus on ensuring that growth is sustainable and responsible as the industry scales and advancing energy-efficient computing is critical.  
And fifth, there's a business model inflection as companies migrate away from products and transactions to outcomes and deeper collaborations focused on speed and time to market. These 5 factors add up to strong and strengthening demand for wafer fab equipment and advanced services that we believe is sustainable well beyond 2021.  
For the first time, customers are providing capital spending guidance for multiple years into the future, which is a new leading indicator for demand sustainability. In 2021, we expect foundry/logic to be the fastest-growing wafer fab equipment market with strong investments in both leading edge and specialty devices. DRAM is the next fastest-growing market, with all major DRAM manufacturers investing in new technology and capacity. Finally, we see NAND growing at a more modest rate this year on the back of about 30% growth in calendar 2020.  
More importantly, Applied is outperforming the overall market. Recent VLSI market data confirmed that our semi-equipment business grew 23% in 2020 versus market growth of less than 19%. We outperformed even though the device mix would not typically be considered favorable for Applied.  
There are several reasons why I'm confident 2021 will be another strong year of outperformance. To start with, our leadership areas are in the fastest-growing parts of the market. We expect CMP epithermal implant to all grow more than 50% this year.  
Next, we're very well positioned to serve the fast-growing specialty markets. We anticipated this market growth several years ago and formed a new group inside the company called ICAPS to focus on IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor applications. In addition, we have strong traction with new products, especially in areas where we have space to grow share. In 2020, we gained 240 basis points of market share in conductor etch and 220 basis points in CVD, thanks to the momentum we have in patterning applications for DRAM and foundry/logic. This year, our etch and CVD businesses combined will generate more than $7.5 billion of revenue.  
In process diagnostics and control, we expect to grow around 50% in 2021 and generate more than $900 million of revenue from our e-beam products. Extending our leadership in e-beam has been a major focus as it is a highly strategic capability that accelerates adoption of our differentiated semi products in integrated material solutions as well as being a key component of our actionable insight accelerator.  
Finally, we're seeing increasing adoption of our integrated solutions where we're bringing together unique combinations of technologies and capabilities. In 2021, we expect to generate more than $400 million of revenue from our first Integrated Material Solutions. In addition, revenues from our advanced packaging product portfolio are on track to exceed $800 million, almost doubling since 2019.  
Looking beyond the strength in our business today, we believe we're in a great position to deliver sustainable outperformance over multiple years. As the industry roadmap transitions from traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling to the new PPACt playbook, materials engineering becomes critically enabling. This is because significant PPACt innovations in transistor and interconnect, structures and materials are taking place and these innovations are enabled by Applied's leadership technologies. We'll cover this topic in more detail at our upcoming logic masterclass.  
As we described at our investor meeting, to serve our customers' evolving needs and maximize our growth opportunities, we've built a comprehensive strategy to position Applied as the PPACt enablement company, shift more of our business to subscription revenue and optimize our investments in synergistic adjacent markets to drive profitable growth and higher free cash flows.  
Our PPACt enablement strategy has 3 differentiated pillars. First, Applied has the broadest and most enabling portfolio of technologies, spanning materials creation, modification, removal and analysis. At our recent memory masterclass, we talked about how we're taking unique Applied technologies that were originally developed for logic, including Black Diamond low K materials and high K metal gate transistors into the DRAM market, opening up new billion-dollar opportunities.  
Second, we can combine our technology portfolio in unique and highly enabling ways that no one else can do. A great example is our Draco hard mask material for capacitor scaling in DRAM. Draco has been co-optimized to work with Applied's etch system in a process development that we accelerated with our e-beam technology. Today, we offer a spectrum of solutions from co-optimization of processes and tools like Draco all the way to fully integrated material solutions that combine multiple processes and customized metrology and sensors within a single platform.  
The third pillar is time-to-market acceleration. We've developed a proprietary suite of solutions to accelerate every stage of the product life cycle, from R&D to technology transfer and high-volume manufacturing. We call this the Actionable Inside Accelerator, or AIx platform, and it brings together process tools, sensors, metrology and analytics and machine learning capabilities.  
There is tremendous pull from customers, and we already have AIx engagements with all major memory manufacturers. One example of how we're applying machine learning in real-world applications is extract AI that allows us to combine the most powerful attributes of optical and e-beam inspection and provide a solution that's many times faster than traditional approaches. In simple terms, optical inspection is fast and can find critical defects, while e-beam is slower but has higher resolution to accurately classify those defects. So we use our e-beam system to train the extract AI engine for defect and noise classification.  
As Applied's e-beam technology has best-in-class resolution and imaging, we get the most accurate classification to train our AI models. We then use inferencing to turn an unclassified map of millions of potential defects into an actionable map of thousands of yield-impacting defects.  
Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. We see strong and sustainable demand in our semiconductor business, underpinned by a wide range of macro and technology drivers. We believe that we're in a great position to outperform our markets again this year, thanks to our broad exposure to the major industry inflections, our strong portfolio of differentiated unit process products and accelerating adoption of our Integrated Material Solutions and advanced packaging products.  
We feel very positive about the longer-term secular trends that are driving semiconductor and wafer fab equipment structurally higher. And we're confident that we have the right strategy to accelerate PPACt and grow significantly faster than our markets. Dan, over to you.",1553,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Today, I'll begin by summarizing Applied's performance in Q2. Then I'll recap the latest third-party data on the semiconductor equipment and services markets. I'll build on Gary's comments about the equipment demand environment. And then I'll give you an update on our plans to grow our subscription business and generate incremental free cash flow in synergistic adjacent markets. I'll finish with our guidance for Q3.  
Beginning with our Q2 performance. Applied delivered record revenue that was up 41% year-over-year and near the top of our guidance range. Our teams executed well, delivering strong gross margins in a challenging operational environment, and this led to record non-GAAP earnings that exceeded our guidance range. All 3 of our operating segments exceeded the revenue guidance, and we continue to expect each to post higher revenue in the second half of our fiscal year.  
The semiconductor systems team also delivered the highest non-GAAP operating margins in nearly 14 years while AGS delivered the highest margins in nearly 15 years. These accomplishments helped us generate record non-GAAP operating profit and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 700 basis points year-over-year. We increased operating cash flow by 87% year-over-year, delivering over $1 billion for the third quarter in a row. We're pleased that Moody's recently upgraded Applied's credit rating by a notch to a2.  
We also resumed the buyback program in Q2, deploying $750 million in the limited window available to us, and we expect to be more active in the current quarter. Also during the quarter, the Board approved a new $7.5 billion stock buyback authorization, along with a 9% dividend increase. And we announced our commitment to return 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.  
Next, since our last earnings call, VLSI Research published its market sizing report for calendar 2020, which is important for 2 reasons: one, it distinguishes front end equipment spending from back end assembly and test; two, it includes company services and spares revenue in addition to equipment revenue, allowing observers to distinguish between recurring revenue and WFE.  
Applied Materials was #1 in both equipment and services for 2020. The equipment market was $61.2 billion, up nearly 19% year-on-year. We significantly outgrew the market, gaining 60 basis points of industry market share with gains in deposition, removal and process control. As Gary described, major inflections are increasing the demand for materials engineering, and we're on track to significantly outperform once again in 2021.  
Next, I'll discuss the demand environment. Last quarter, we indicated the equipment market would be in the low $70 billion in 2021, which was above the consensus at the time. Demand has strengthened further, and we now expect equipment spending to be in the high $70 billion for the year. At the investor meeting, I showed you a chart with the rolling 2-year sum of equipment spending for each period since 2012 plus 2013, each successive 2-year period has been higher. And I now believe that spending in 2021 plus 2022 will be greater than $160 billion.  
Our demand thesis for the past several years is that data generation is growing exponentially while 2D scaling is slowing, which means more process equipment will be needed. Over the long history of the industry, equipment capital intensity has been close to 12% on average. But because of the higher technical complexity and the slowing of 2D scaling, capital intensity is closer to 14% today.  
Multiple industry forecasts call for the semiconductor industry revenue to reach $1 trillion by 2030. If capital intensity stays flat from here, then WFE spending could be over $140 billion in the same time frame. I realize there are questions about whether the unprecedented demand we are seeing today is secular or cyclical. When I listen to what our customers say, I hear a firm belief that the data economy is real and driving secular growth well into the future.  
This perspective is being reinforced by plans for substantial multiyear capital investments, which are needed to support demand and fuel profitable growth. Against this backdrop, we've never felt better about our opportunity to enable our customers, generate free cash flow and return cash to shareholders.  
Next, as we discussed at the investor meeting, we're also focused on growing beyond equipment sales. The more we deliver solutions and outcomes for our customers, the more we can increase our subscription revenues, which grow and generate free cash flow every year. The report I mentioned earlier shows that over 90% of Applied's reported services business is composed of recurring services and parts revenue, which is the highest amongst our peers. We generated $3.7 billion of this true services revenue in 2020, with 60% in long-term agreements and renewal rates of around 90%.  
In Q2, the trend towards long-term subscriptions was even stronger. Nearly 70% of our services and parts bookings were subscriptions and 50% had terms of at least 3 years. Our strategy in AGS and as a company is to combine our technologies in unique ways to create higher value solutions and outcomes for our customers, which are best delivered under the subscription model.  
We also discussed our strategy to redeploy our technology in synergistic adjacent markets where modest investments can generate attractive supplemental free cash flow. Today, the largest example of this strategy is our display business, where our CVD, PVD and e-beam technologies have been adapted to glass substrates. Over the past couple of years, we've strengthened our products for the next wave of OLED investments targeting foldable smartphones, notebooks, tablets and TVs.  
With these investments completed, our focus is on increasing free cash flow. We're committed to increasing non-GAAP operating margins from the high teens level today to over 20% in the coming quarters and then between 25% and 30% over the target model horizon.  
Now I'll share our Q3 business outlook. We expect to increase company revenue to approximately $5.92 billion, plus or minus $200 million. The midpoint would be up about 35% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.76, plus or minus $0.06 or up about 66% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we project semiconductor systems revenue of $4.25 billion, up around 46% year-over-year. And AGS revenue of about $1.23 billion, up around 19% year-over-year. We expect display revenue of around $415 million.  
Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should be roughly flat sequentially at 47.7% or up around 270 basis points year-over-year. We plan to increase non-GAAP OpEx to $930 million. And as a percent of revenue, non-GAAP OpEx should decline by 290 basis points, with nearly 70% of the spending earmarked for R&D. Our guidance assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of around 12%.  
In summary, I'm pleased that Applied delivered another record quarter of performance in Q2 with strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. And I'd like to join Gary in thanking our employees and supply chain partners for supporting our customers.

Gary, nice to see the uptick in your forecast for WFE for the year. I'm kind of curious, when you look at your ability to supply customers -- or the ecosystem's ability to supply customers, relative to the high $70 billion WFE, is there potential for upside this year? Or are you already starting to see kind of the backlog for next year fill in, just given some of the constraints and lead times on tools?",81,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So this is Dan. I'll jump in on this one. So what we're seeing from our own business, we talked about it in the prepared comments. We see a market that's up strong from a year-over-year standpoint, high 70s probably puts us up high 20%, 27%, 28%, 29% versus where we were last year. And that's off of a baseline of $61.2 billion.  
What I would say is we're planning for our business to be up second half over first half. And we're also planning for our business to be up as we look into 2022. And as I look at it by reporting segment, I would say all 3 of our segments are up half over half. And then all 3 of our segments are up as we look into 2022.  
So I can't comment for everybody. What I would say is, is we've been very aggressive in terms of managing this upward gradient of the industry. We started several quarters ago, 3, 4 quarters ago. You can see an uptick from an investment standpoint to make sure that we've got the infrastructure and capacity and capability.  
And that's not only investments from our physical infrastructure, but also working with our supply partners to make sure that we can fully satisfy all the demand that we see from our customers based on the great innovation that we're delivering to market. So we feel good about how we're positioned to outperform in this environment. And as we look forward into the back half of the year in 2022, we're planning for our business to be up.",268,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And then for my main question, as I think about your operating margin for silicon at 39.1%, this was your best print since -- I had to look back since, I think, June 2007.  
And so I guess, as we think about WFE moving higher from here into '22 and likely beyond, how should we think about the trajectory there? And how important was mix in hitting the numbers that you put up in April? And how -- again, how should we think about it going forward?",113,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Thanks, C.J. Let me jump in on this one again, and you get a lot embedded in there, and let me try to unpack it. And if I miss something, please follow-up and let me know what else I can shed some color on.  
So the first part of the question, second half over first half. That's both fiscal year and calendar year. And again, we're planning on being up as we look into 2022. So we've got a market that's showing signs of strength. The first half of the calendar year, when you take a look at our actual results plus our guide, our systems business is up 50% year-over-year. So we feel good about how we're positioned against this opportunity to outperform, and  second half over first half being up both on a fiscal and calendar year basis.  
When I look at our silicon business and the performance of it, what I would say is, as a company, gross margin for our company is up 310 basis points year-over-year. The company has got a lot of work on driving productivity gains, operating discipline, efficiency into the core of our operations. We're adopting digital capabilities inside the 4 walls of our company to make sure we are far more agile as a company to respond to upward and downward gradients.  
And there's more work to do. We'll never be satisfied with where we are. But we've got a whole host of initiatives at work to help this company become more efficient over time. And you see that profiling into the results of the company.  
As an overall company, you see our operating margin up 700 basis points year-over-year. From a semi systems standpoint, the margins will always be influenced to a certain extent by customer mix, product mix, factory loadings. But I think you can see on both an absolute and relative basis, this is a company that's performing very, very strong right now. And I would expect us to continue a trajectory of strong performance as I go forward.  
And so I guess the last thing I would say, it all starts with innovation. Your ability to drive economic value creation for your investors starts with innovation. We've got the industry's broadest portfolio of industry-leading technologies. And at our investor meeting, we talked about combining them in unique ways to solve really high-value problems for our customers in a way that's incredibly valuable to their road maps, delivery of those road maps from a time perspective that they can make their customers successful. So we'll continue to drive the industry's best technology. We'll drive efficiency and operating discipline while we do that, and we think we've got an opportunity to create significant value over time for our investors.",461,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

So it's the only business of yours that hasn't really inflected. Both foundry and flash were up pretty decently sequentially year-over-year. DRAM was kind of down both sequentially year-over-year. And yet you're still looking for it to grow pretty materially through the year.  
So I guess -- and I know -- we know supply in that market is actually very tight. So I guess, can you talk a little bit about the dynamics you're seeing in DRAM? And maybe talk a little bit about the contribution of DRAM to the guide next quarter. Is that primarily what's driving? I mean has that sort of ramped more materially in some of the others into the second half? Or are we still waiting for it?",135,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

So in 2020, we talked about an overall WFE market that was up high teens. I would say the DRAM market was pretty much in line with that, maybe a little better than that. Against that opportunity, our DRAM business was up over 27%, almost 28% last year. And significantly outperformed others in the industry that were up a few percent and down a few percent. So we had a really strong showing in 2020.  
And if you recall 3 months ago on last quarter's call, we had signaled that the profile around the DRAM market, we view it as significantly back half loaded. So we expect off of calendar Q1, our fiscal Q2, momentum in that business to significantly pick up as our customers add bit supply to be more in line with bit demand.  
And so we see that market playing out roughly in line with our expectations. And how calendar Q1 played out, I would say it's pretty much in line with how we viewed the market 3 months ago, probably 6 months ago, and it's playing out as expected. We see DRAM as a back half loaded market this year.",237,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

This is Gary. Relative to the major inflections in DRAM, certainly high-speed DRAM, they're going to logic-like structures in the periphery where Applied has leadership. I think we talked about that in our memory masterclass, a couple of billion-dollar opportunity as those inflections are being adopted.  
Capacitor scaling is another one, where Applied has real strength, new patterning applications. So as Dan said, we had really great performance last year.

Is WFE elevated right now because of capacity shortages, which would be more of a cyclical driver? Or is it elevated more because of secular reasons, which would be rising complexity, et cetera? I wanted to get your perspective on that because when we ask the semiconductor companies, they say the shortages are perhaps not as much on the foundry side, they are more on the back end. So I just wanted to get your perspective that what we are seeing right now, is it a cyclical thing? Or is it more of a secular aspect?",113,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Thanks, Vivek. Appreciate the question. Here's our point of view on this: what we see is we are in the very early innings of a multiyear secular growth trend around this industry. And I think we've been talking about it for a couple of years, and now we see it really hitting its stride.  
When we think about the general consensus from third-party research, you're at about $1 trillion of semiconductor revenues by 2030. The demand driving that is broad-based. You're seeing a handoff from consumer-oriented devices to something that's far larger and more substantive around this fourth wave of compute, the data economy. By 2025, machines will generate 99% of the data. Humans will generate 1%. You're seeing a decoupling of semiconductor demand for the first time in the industry's history from population and population growth in consumer behavior.  
Content is increasing across devices, servers, autos, handsets. So what we see are strong secular growth drivers, and we're in the early innings of that playing out. And I would say that, that is more of what is driving our end markets today than anything else. And so when I look at that backdrop, combined with things like an upper bias over time of capital intensity, I think the opportunity for our markets going forward is quite attractive. And given what we talked about with the new playbook at our investor meeting, our opportunity to outperform as we drive those key inflections with our customers, our opportunity to outperform against that multiple year secular growth tailwind around this industry, we think, is quite substantial.",265,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Let me just add that certainly today, we hear a lot about supply chain issues from an automotive perspective. But really we're, as Dan said and as we talked about in our investor meeting, we're in the early innings of every industry being transformed, and the fundamental nature of competition being completely different. So semiconductor content is going to be at the foundation of that infrastructure. Certainly, the way we work, the way we learn, the way we shop, transportation, health care. Today, we're talking about automotive. But content is going to increase more, I believe, than what anyone can see today. And it's really about who delivers power, performance and cost faster than others in enabling that infrastructure that is the basis of competition of every single industry.  
So -- and then from Applied's standpoint, as we've talked about, classic 2D Moore's Law really ended a few years ago, and the foundation for the chips from the edge, the trillion edge devices to the high-speed computing in the data center is really about new materials, new structures, new ways to connect chips together, new architectures and new ways to shrink. And Applied is just in a really tremendous position when you think about again, the basis of enabling a competitive advantage, time to market on all of that is incredibly important for the entire global economy. And certainly, from a country standpoint, countries are starting to recognize the importance of semiconductors as a foundation for competition.  
So definitely, we see this as a secular change. And I really do believe people don't understand the magnitude of this yet.",270,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dan, I wanted to double-click on your NAND business. It was up significantly in the quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. At the same time, I think it was Gary, you talked about having relatively modest expectations for WFE for calendar 2021.  
So I guess the question is, are you guys gaining share? Or is the expectation for NAND to be first half weighted this year? Or is it a little bit of both? And kind of related to that, Dan, you talked about more than $160 billion in WFE for this year and next year combined. Within that sort of context, how are you thinking about NAND?",112,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thanks, Toshiya. Here's our perspective on NAND. If we were to go back 3 months to last quarter, we said that NAND was the one segment that was first half weighted versus second half. In the subsequent 3 months that bring us to today, I would say our perspective on NAND, it strengthened a little bit.  
But of the 3 segments, we've seen foundry/logic strengthen quite a bit, DRAM strengthen quite a bit and NAND strengthened a little bit. And while foundry/logic and NAND, we view as second half weighted from a segment standpoint, I think there's a question mark on NAND, where we sit today, is it first half weighted or second half weighted. It's too early to tell.  
And so we got out of the gate very strong in calendar Q1 on NAND. So we expect the growth rate to moderate quite a bit as we go throughout the year. And from a first half, second half weighting again, I think it's too early to call.  
When I take a step back and I think about the combination of 2021 plus 2022, what I would shape from an expectation standpoint around 2021, foundry/logic is greater than 55%. NAND is less than 45% -- I'm sorry, foundry/logic greater than 55%, memory less than 45%. I think that construct still holds in 2022.  
As we think about a market that's up high 20% range, in the current year, we think about foundry/logic significantly outgrowing the industry average. DRAM being in line plus or minus with the industry average. NAND growing, but significantly below the industry average.  
I think all 3 of those markets are strong levels of spend next year. And we have an upward trajectory on the overall industry. But I think it's too early to shape expectations by device type. Let's let some more time elapse. Let's crystallize the contours of the industry this year and assess how our customers are going to invest to drive even higher returns for their investors in a few quarters.

So I think the display industry this year is going to play out very much in line with our expectations. From our business perspective, we're well penetrated in the segments we participate in. We've got a good read on the market. And we see our business in calendar -- or in fiscal 2021 being very similar to fiscal 2020.  
We talked about the environmental strengthening. We still see older generation capacity coming out of the LCD market. We see increased consumer demand. The combination of that is leading to increased panel pricing. Spot pricing in the panel market is going up and that's leading to increased profitability. So there's goodness there. We continue to see average area size increase. OLED screens are continuing to penetrate 5G handsets. And OLED penetration of handsets in general is on an upward trajectory.  
The next leg of OLED growth into the IT market and the TV market and foldable phones becoming more widely adopted from a consumer standpoint, all of that is intact. So we see an increase in the levels of investment. As we go into next year, we feel good about that.  
The other thing I'd offer here is we talked about an investment profile in our products to deepen our moats around our market position and get our product portfolio ready for the next leg up from an OLED investment standpoint. Exiting the year, the vast majority of those investments will be in the rearview mirror, and you're going to see us start to reposition this business for enhanced cash flow and profitability. We'll get into the low 20s. And then by 2023 and 2024, we'll be consistently operating this business with an operating margin between 25% and 30%.  
So we feel good about market development, revenue growth as we look into 2022 and then complementing that with an enhanced level of profitability to drive value for investors.",325,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Gary, when you look at the -- some of the technology inflections, like gate all around coming up, it seems like the critical technologies of the horizontal and vertical FEs, for like the removal and conductor etch. Just want to find that from your vantage point, what are the important technologies? And more importantly, can you help quantify the dollar opportunity it means for AMAT?",76,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks for the question. So all of our customers are focused, as I said earlier, to deliver lower power, higher performance and better cost ahead of others. And we talked in the investor meeting about the wiring innovations we're driving, improving wiring 50%. And in gate-all-around, that's another very important technology if you look at the overall ecosystem. So that opportunity, I think we've estimated around $1 billion incremental opportunity.  
And you think about the key enabling technologies, certainly, epitaxial deposition and selective removal are very important. We're working with every one of the leading customers on gate-all-around technologies. The other thing I would say that's important is our -- and there are a number of other technologies where we have very strong positions, leadership positions. So that will all ramp when gate-all-around goes into high-volume manufacturing.  
But time to market is also important, the T of the PPACt. And our e-beam technology leadership is really fundamental, whether it's in the transistor, the wiring, the Draco and the memory or any of these different innovations, it's really mapping out and fingerprinting those processes because they're so complex with so many different variables. And then being able to tune those recipes and the process knobs as fast as possible.  
So gate-all-around certainly is one of those cases where seeing things like residual germanium or seeing in those structures incredibly, incredibly important and having enough of a picture across a chip whether you have isolated or dense structures across the wafer, but that speed in the learning rate is very fundamental. So we have leadership in some of these foundational technologies for gate-all-around. But also our leadership in e-beam is really important for gate-all-around and other key inflections in the industry.",290,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

On the mature foundry, logic and specialty manufacturing segments of the market, your ICAPS business. I think you guys had said, lastly, you expected this business to be $3 billion-plus business for the team this year.  
But since then, I mean, the supply-demand gap for the analog, microcontroller, power, MEMS guys is actually widening to somewhere around 20% to 40%, in addition to the secular content gains that you guys talked about in auto and industrial. And some of these customers are saying that they can't get 2 deliveries on orders placed today until next year. So do you guys have a revised estimate on your ICAPS business this year?

Let me jump in and see if Gary wants to offer additional color after I take a crack at this. So we saw this trend towards more robust spending from a trailing node geometry, a specialty node geometry. Several years ago, we reorganized the organization. We've got leadership driving this group. And the company is performing incredibly well against this opportunity.  
We talked about this segment of our business being greater than $3 billion. We don't want to be more specific than that for competitive reasons, but it's much greater than $3 billion. But we'll just leave it at greater than $3 billion for now. Company has got great technology, great leadership positions. And then from a margin structure standpoint, it's accretive to the overall company margin. And so as this business continues to grow for us and we continue to outperform, we think it's going to be value-accretive for our investors.  
And so we feel good about how we're positioned and our ability to drive this market. Like we talked about, we're planning for our business to be up second half over first half. We've got an ability to continue to drive output and delivery of technology to customers. So we feel good about how we're positioned in this market as a key enabler of our customers to be able to satisfy their customers.

Gary, maybe for you in terms of the process control business. You have overall good share -- or actually great share in the e-beam marketplace given the gains you've made with the provision tool. Recently, you've introduced the new optical inspection kind of a hybrid tool with AI capabilities.  
Can you discuss where the future lies between e-beam versus optical inspection? And how are your customers, I guess, receiving the feedback in terms of these differing technologies?",84,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So maybe -- first, let me start with our top level PDC business, and then I'll get into this optical e-beam question.  
So really, there's 2 major focuses for our PDC business. Certainly, this is a growth opportunity. But also what is increasingly important is PDC accelerating billions of dollars of Applied-enabled PPACt inflections. I talked about earlier, gate-all-around and the wiring and the memory and all of these different areas. And we have the highest resolution e-beam platform in the industry. We're probably 50% higher resolution. So we can see things that other platforms cannot see.  
We also have an advantage in the speed of imaging. So mapping out these fingerprints to dial in these processes faster with bigger process margins, that synergy -- Applied is the only company in the industry that has that combination of the unit processes, integrated material solutions and leading e-beam technology.  
So that is strategically important. And I think that really, we see a great opportunity to accelerate our PDC revenue going forward. We talked about 50% growth this year on the top of 25% last year, but also that pull in the synergy with the rest of Applied Materials is incredibly valuable and very important. 
Relative to optical inspection, we did introduce this new platform, the Enlight. We see very strong pull and adoption, especially in leading foundry. And the combination of these technologies, basically, you have an optical inspection system that is incredibly cost-effective for line monitoring types of applications. And certainly, in the discussions that I have with many of the R&D leaders, tremendous pull for that technology, but also combining that with industry-leading resolution to accurately classify defects. And then having that capability to combine with AI gives customers a better overall performance in finding yield-limiting defects. 
So we're seeing definitely strong adoption of this concept with customers. But the key thing for me really is the e-beam leadership, that is fundamental. We're more than 5x larger than our overall largest PDC competitor. We have clear imaging leadership. We will be introducing new imaging technologies that will further strengthen our leadership in that part of our -- in that part of PDC. And the synergy in the T for PPACt is very, very, very important.",382,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

China looks like it was a record on a dollar basis and about 1/3 of revenue. Did that business skew a little bit more demand given the NAND strength?

As we look at our China business, it was a strong performance in the most recent quarter. But it's in line generally with the historical profile of that business over time. Some quarters will be a little better than others, but certainly in line with the historical profile on a percent of our overall business. 
As I take a look and double-click at the China domestic market and think about the levels of investment there, I would say that there is slow, steady development of the ecosystem. I see investments from a 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter standpoint. And then within the 300-millimeter geometries, we see investments across all device types. We see NAND, we see DRAM, we see foundry/logic. 
So I wouldn't say it's driven by one specific market, one specific customer. It's really broad based, both from a customer perspective as well as a market perspective. We feel good about how we're positioned against this opportunity, and we'll do well over time as that business continues to grow.",170,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So let's say, over 5 years or maybe a bit more, we could still see WFE doubling. 
And then Gary, you talked a lot about -- like this upcoming inflection points to which we feel very close now, where materials is almost taking a revenge over critical dimension reduction. And so my question was, in a world in which the industry spends $150 billion on wafer equipment spending, the incremental $70 billion that would be spent compared to what is spent today, where would that go? If you could give, like, what in your view would be the most significant drivers of growth for the industry over that kind of long time period where we double again spending?",151,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Thanks for the question, Pierre. So for me, I spent a lot of my time with customers across our entire -- all the different market segments, the leading customers. ICAPS, I spend a tremendous amount of time there more than ever. And I have a very strong perspective, and we can see things that we can't talk about publicly relative to where customers are going. 
But I really believe that we're at the point where we have the biggest economic competition of our lifetime with technology transforming every industry. And semiconductors are part of that key infrastructure, the data economy going forward. And it really is about power, performance and cost from the edge to the cloud and everything in between. 
And I do believe -- and we can see it when you go from 5 to 3, 3 to 2, and what's going beyond that, that the playbook that we discussed before, and you even see customers supporting this view that the classic 2D Moore's Law will not enable the future infrastructure. I think that is crystal clear. 
And it really is, certainly, there's going to be shrink as part of that 2D shrink. But that's not going to enable power and performance across that whole infrastructure for the future. So it's about the new materials. It's about the new structures, the gate-all-around, the 50% reduction in wiring, high-speed memory for a number of different applications. We're adding logic to the periphery, shaping the chip architectures in a very different way. 
And the other thing, and we talked about -- I talked about this earlier on the call, packaging is, I think, underappreciated and very important. This year, packaging will be over $800 million for us. And you think about connecting chips, or chiplets, or IP blocks, that is going to be an enormous opportunity going forward. And Applied is in a great position. We have very strong products in PVD, CVD, CMP, plating, this new hybrid bonding technology where you can bond 2 chips together. We're the only company in the industry that has a full flow advanced packaging lab. 
So Pierre, I think there's going to be tremendous innovation that's happening there. And again, that's another -- a segment of the industry where I think people under-appreciate how important from a competitive standpoint and in a PPACt-enabling standpoint, that's going to be. 
So again, those are the things that we see as we go forward. It's really about those 5 elements of the new playbook. And the other aspect is time to market, that's where we're focused with AIx, and  especially our industry leadership in e-beam to drive the T.",444,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

So you gave a 2020 WFE number from VLSI, that's like 61 billion. And you did 12.1 in SSD last year. So that's about 20% WFE share. Then if I take your July SSD guidance, we know that you're doing about 8.2 billion in the first half, and you're saying that it's going to be up in the back half. So that's like 16.5 to 17 for the year, which off of your high 70 billion WFE number is like 21.5% WFE share. So that's up like 150 basis points this year. 
So I guess my question is, where is that share coming from? Can you sort of double-click on that? I know you highlighted process control. But I'm wondering if you can kind of double-click on that. 
And then the second part of the question was for domestic China, you had talked about 10 billion WFE this year. Is that still the thinking?",168,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So Tim, thanks for the question. I think it's important to really get the facts on the table for 2020. If you look at our semi systems business in calendar 2020, it's up 26.5% against a market that was up high teens. And so significant outperformance. We view it as gaining 60 basis points a share. So we ended 2020 at 20.5% WFE share. 
And so you referenced the 21.5% share in 2021. We think we're going to significantly outperform this year. You saw us grow almost 2:1 in foundry/logic last year. You saw us significantly outperform peers in 2020 in the DRAM market, and we showed strength in our NAND business. 
And when I look at the customers node over node, whether it's memory or foundry/logic, our opportunity is going up. When I look at the end market profile, we talked about it, strength in foundry/logic, DRAM, strong business in NAND. So we feel good about the market perspective. 
And then when I look at the product portfolio, we showed share gains in deposition and removal and process control. Gary talked about packaging. We talked about 240 basis points of conductor etch, 220 basis points of CVD. We talked about strength in PVD, ePi, thermals. 2021, I would expect to do even better across that product portfolio. 
We talk about the new PPACt playbook. We talked a lot about the enabling technologies at our investor meeting. We've held one master class. We've got an upcoming master class on foundry/logic. We see these inflections is real. We've got the industry's broadest portfolio of industry-leading technologies, and we've got unique abilities to combine those technologies and bring them together in a way to solve our customers' highest value problems.

In our third quarter of 2021, Applied Materials again delivered record performance capitalizing on strong, broad-based demand for our semiconductor products and services while navigating a challenging supply environment. Over the past 18 months, the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of the economy and adoption of advanced technology creating a permanent, structural shift for the industry. At the same time, COVID-19 has disrupted global supply chains and logistics, a transitory challenge we'll continue navigating over the coming quarters. Across the company, I want to thank our teams for doing an incredible job to successfully overcome these near-term disruptions, provide outstanding support to customers and keep our R&D road map on track.
In today's call, I'll focus on 3 main topics: first, I'll provide our perspective on the market, starting with our near-term outlook and then recapping our longer-term thesis; second, I'll summarize the 3 pillars of Applied's growth strategy; and third, I'll explain how Applied is outperforming our markets today and is well positioned to play an even bigger, broader and more valuable role in the future.
I'll begin with our near-term outlook. Overall, there is no significant changes to our view of the market. Demand is strong and sustainable, with customers making strategic investments to address long-term secular trends.
In 2021, foundry/logic is the fastest-growing wafer fab equipment market, and we believe it will represent more than 55% of total customer investment for the year. This spending is split relatively evenly between leading edge, the 3 most advanced nodes in foundry and logic, and technologies for IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics and sensor applications or what we call ICAPS.
We expect DRAM spending to be the second fastest-growing WFE market this year, and we see a positive setup for sustained investment in capacity and new technology. Supply-side inventories remain below normal levels and long-term demand drivers are strong, fueled by memory-intensive AI computing.
On an absolute basis, we expect NAND investments to be similar to DRAM for the year. We believe NAND inventories are at normal levels, both on the supply-side and demand-side.
Looking further ahead, I strongly believe there has never been a more exciting time for semiconductor companies. We are only at the beginning of decade-long trends that will underpin secular industry growth. As I've said before, digital transformation is built on silicon and broadens the drivers for semiconductor innovation. Demand for semiconductors is no longer about 1 or 2 killer applications, but rather an expansive structural shift in the economy towards digitization and automation.
Smart and connected devices at the edge not only consume more silicon, they are driving exponential growth in machine-generated data. To make sense and create value from the vast volumes of data available, new AI computing approaches are needed, fueling further demand for current and next-generation semiconductors.
While global consumption of silicon is accelerating, adoption rates of new technology vary considerably by region. As we showed at our investor meeting, we estimate that by 2025, China will have only reached the same levels of silicon spend per capita the U.S. saw in 2015. And India trails China by another 8 to 10 years.
Since the impact of digital transformation is so wide-reaching, national governments are increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of semiconductors. As government incentives become available in the U.S., Asia and Europe, they can provide multiyear support as the industry moves from lean and just-in-time supply chains to more resilient, flexible and secure approaches, including regionally distributed capacity.
However, putting the right manufacturing infrastructure in place is only one piece of the puzzle. Investment in innovation infrastructure to lead in the development and commercialization of next-generation technologies is even more critical to winning the future. Early access to superior semiconductor technologies, or what I refer to as winning the PPACt race, will determine the countries and companies that thrive and those that won't.
At Applied, we have a strong point of view that the industry's future will not be like the past, and we've aligned our strategy and investments accordingly. Our strategy has 3 pillars. First and foremost, we are focused on being the PPACt enablement company to provide the foundation for customers' power, performance, area, cost and time-to-market road maps. We have the broadest and most enabling portfolio of process technologies that we can co-optimize and combine in unique and highly enabling ways.
Second, we're shifting more of our business to subscriptions as we believe this model provides significant benefits to customers and for us. We have already converted a meaningful portion of our installed base business to recurring revenues, and we are starting to monetize new products and services using subscription approaches. And third, we continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses that serve adjacent markets, including display, to drive profitable growth and higher free cash flows.
This strategy is yielding results and 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year of outperformance for Applied. Starting with our unit process tools, we are seeing very strong demand for our leadership products. For example, taking the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, both our epi and thermal businesses are on track to grow more than 70% this fiscal year, while CMP will grow more than 60% and implant more than 50%. We're also seeing outperformance in our growth areas, especially process diagnostics and control, where we expect to grow more than 60% in calendar 2021.
On top of this, we have strong momentum with our co-optimized and integrated solutions. By revenue, about 70% of the semiconductor products we sell today have already been co-optimized at some level. Co-optimization allows us to see and solve higher-value problems for customers, speed up technology transition to high-volume manufacturing and make our solutions stickier. Beyond co-optimization, our integrated material solutions, called IMS, combine multiple processes with customized metrology and sensors in a single system typically under vacuum. Our latest IMS product, that lowers interconnect resistance by 50% in advanced foundry/logic, directly addresses a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next 5 years. With IMS, we can target the most complex and valuable challenges in the new PPACt playbook, and we have an exciting pipeline of new solutions for both foundry/logic and memory.
Another area where we're seeing strong and sustainable growth is our ICAPS business that serves a broad spectrum of customers and applications in IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensors. Within ICAPS, demand for 28-nanometer and larger nodes is especially robust. Revenue from products serving these applications is expected to double this year. By acting early and forming a dedicated ICAPS team in 2019, we've been able to increase our focus on these customers and accelerate our share of this market. We're developing new products specifically designed for ICAPS markets, including integrated and co-optimized solutions. As a result, we're deepening our partnership and collaborations with these customers. For example, we recently signed a 5-year contract with a leading ICAPS customer designed to provide more assured supply for them and more predictable revenues for Applied.
Today, we are demonstrating strong momentum in our leadership and growth businesses, IMS and ICAPS, and as I look ahead, I'm confident our opportunities are even better. It's clear that advances in materials engineering are foundational to the industry's PPACt road map. The PPACt playbook has 5 key elements: new architectures, including workload-specific ASICs and new memories; 3D structures, including gate-all-around transistors, buried power rail and 3D DRAM; new materials for gate, contact and interconnects; new geometric shrink and advanced packaging.
We believe that the relative contribution of these 5 elements to PPACt at future nodes is evolving in ways that create opportunities for Applied to play an even larger and more valuable role. Let's take advanced packaging as an example. We identified this inflection early and began investing in differentiated technology years ago. Today, we enjoy a clear leadership position in the advanced packaging equipment with more than 60% share of our served market. We will generate more than $800 million of revenue from our equipment business this year. And through a combination of organic R&D and strategic partnerships, we're also developing highly enabling future technologies. We are very excited about our opportunities and pipeline, and we'll share more details with you at our upcoming packaging masterclass.
Finally, when we talk to customers about PPACt, they consistently highlight the importance of t, time-to-market. Time-to-market acceleration is a critical component of our PPACt enablement strategy. We've developed a proprietary suite of solutions to accelerate every stage of the product life cycle, from R&D, to technology transfer and high-volume manufacturing. Our Actionable Insight Accelerator or AIx platform that we officially launched in May brings together process tools, sensors, metrology, data analytics and machine learning. We have strong momentum and are adding new installations at multiple leading customers. For example, AppliedPRO is our process recipe optimizer within AIx and used to accelerate R&D qualification of individual chambers and tools as well as enable larger process windows and higher chip yields. Over the next 12 months, we expect to double the number of AppliedPRO customer engagements from around 25 this year to more than 50.
Before I hand the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. We see strong and sustainable demand for our semiconductor business underpinned by a wide range of positive macro and technology drivers. While COVID-related supply chain disruptions persist, our teams are doing a great job working through these challenges. We believe Applied Materials will outperform our markets again this year thanks to our strong portfolio of differentiated unit process tools for both leading edge and ICAPS markets, combined with accelerating adoption of our IMS and advanced packaging products. As we look ahead, we're confident that the strength of longer-term secular trends will drive semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher, and we believe Applied is in the best position to accelerate our customers' PPACt road maps and grow significantly faster than our markets.

251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2021",2021-08-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3492.0,2382802.0,90914417.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary.
Today, I'll begin by summarizing Applied's overall performance in Q3. Then I'll discuss our Semi Systems results, including new details about our foundry/logic business. I'll also give you a number of metrics surrounding the large recurring revenue portion of Applied's Global Services segment. Then I'll add my perspective on the demand trends in our markets and provide our guidance for Q4.
Beginning with our Q3 performance, Applied generated the strongest revenue in company history with each of the segments exceeding guidance. We increased gross margin to 48%, which is the highest in 14 years despite the ongoing cost headwinds related to COVID. We also delivered the company's highest-ever operating profit, operating margin and earnings per share. Our results included record operating cash flow and record free cash flow of $1.5 billion. In fact, we've generated nearly $5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the past 4 quarters.
At the investor meeting in April, we made a long-term commitment to return 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. And in Q3, the buyback window was available to us for the full quarter. We repurchased $1.5 billion of Applied's stock during the quarter and returned 111% of free cash flow to shareholders including dividends. We ended the quarter with around $6.5 billion remaining in our share buyback authorization. Given the secular growth trends in our end markets and our view of the intrinsic value of the company, we expect to continue to be active in the market for our shares.
Finally, last quarter, I mentioned that Moody's upgraded Applied's credit rating to A2. I'm pleased that earlier this month, Standard & Poor's also upgraded our rating from A- to A.
Now I'll provide some insights into the strong performance of our Semi Systems business, which generated its highest-ever revenue in Q3. Our demand is broad-based across foundry/logic and memory, and within foundry/logic, across a wide variety of nodes. We're increasing our technology leadership in many areas, and that's being reflected in our operating margin, which crossed 40% for the first time.
About half of our foundry/logic revenue is being generated by our ICAPS business, which focuses on all but the 3 most leading nodes. Our ICAPS business has a large global presence and serves a very large number of customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Many of the ICAPS applications have long product cycles, which generates lasting opportunities for us, both in equipment and services. We have high share and the margins are accretive to the company. We look forward to giving you more insights into the ICAPS markets and our strategies at the masterclass next month.
Turning to Applied Global Services. We're building a solutions-based recurring revenue business that delivers predictable free cash flow across market cycles. Our segment reporting gives you good insights into the business. And I'll continue to help you with key performance indicators that demonstrate the unique qualities of Applied's services business and the progress of our strategies. From our segment reporting, you know that AGS delivered record revenue of $1.29 billion in Q3, up 24% year-over-year.
87% of AGS revenue was recurring services, parts and software. The remaining amount was primarily legacy 200-millimeter equipment, so Applied generated $1.1 billion in recurring revenue this quarter. This is by far the highest among our process peers and demonstrates our progress in generating lifetime value from the industry's largest installed base.
Today, our semi installed base is just over 40,000 systems, and we have over 160,000 chambers in the field. At the investor meeting, we shared our goal to increase revenue per system by 20% between 2020 and 2024. As of Q3, we're already halfway to achieving our goal.
Now I'll put some metrics to our strategies for adding customer value to further grow our recurring revenue. Connecting the installed base to our AIx servers enables us to perform data-enabled services for our customers. Today, we have just over 4,300 connected tools, which is up over 30% from our 2020 baseline. We're also growing the number of secure remote connections, which allows us to connect our best experts to the installed base to perform remote analytics, diagnostics and optimization from anywhere in the world. The number of remote connected tools now exceeds 3,200, which is up over 36% from our 2020 baseline.
Another key focus is transitioning our recurring revenue to subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. Today, we're generating 60% of our recurring revenue from subscriptions, and our goal is to reach around 70% by 2024. We also have a subscription renewal rate of around 90%.
Another sign of customer value is the tenure of the agreements. Across the entire base of subscription agreements, we've increased the tenure from 1.9 years at the end of 2020 to 2.2 years today. In fact, of our subscriptions booked in Q3, 77% were multiyear agreements. We track all of these KPIs very closely. I hope they give you a good sense of the size and growth of our recurring revenue and the strong customer pull we're generating by focusing on customer time-to-market as well as cost, output and yield.
Finally, another key metric we disclose is AGS segment operating margin, which provides a good indicator of the value our services bring to customers. In Q3, it crossed 30% for the first time in 15 years.
Next, I'll add my perspective on the demand environment. While Q3 was a record quarter, we see further growth ahead. In fact, our overall backlog is close to $10 billion, with record levels in both Semi Systems and AGS, and strength across all of our geographies. I still expect equipment spending to be higher in the second half of calendar 2021 for both foundry/logic and DRAM. I expect WFE to be up in 2022, and I expect all of our reporting segments to be higher.
Now I'll share our Q4 business outlook. We expect to increase company revenue to approximately $6.325 billion, plus or minus $250 million or up around 35% year-on-year. We've widened the revenue range this quarter because of near-term risks within our supply chain. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be around $1.94, plus or minus $0.07 or up around 55% year-on-year.
Within this outlook, we project Semiconductor Systems revenue of about $4.60 billion, up around 50% year-over-year and AGS revenue of about $1.30 billion, up nearly 18% year-over-year. We expect Display revenue to be around $400 million.
Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should be flat sequentially at 48% or up around 230 basis points year-over-year. We plan to increase non-GAAP OpEx to $960 million, which is around 15.2% of revenue and below our longer-term target of 16%. Our guidance assumes a slightly higher non-GAAP tax rate of around 12.5%.
In summary, I'm pleased that Applied delivered another record quarter of financial performance in Q3, with strong margins and free cash flow. The demand environment continues to be strong, and I'd like to join Gary in thanking all of our teams and partners for their hard work in a robust but challenging environment.

You talked about foundry/logic being 55-plus percent of the mix this year and ICAPS perhaps half of that. And so I guess, did I hear that correctly? And as you think about the spending there, can you walk a little bit in more detail around leadership versus growth penetration for you and how we should think about the sustainability of spending there into 2022 as well as the positive mix shift to gross margins? And then finally, as part of that, is there a subscription angle that's a greater part of the story there given lagging edge or no?",112,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I'll start and Gary can jump in with some perspectives after I'm done. So as we think about the ICAPS market and the setup around foundry/logic, I think the contours you drew create the right perspective, greater than 55% of WFE this year is foundry/logic. When we look into foundry/logic and look at leading edge versus ICAPS nodes, you're seeing balance in those 2 markets. We had balance in those 2 markets in 2020. We've got balance again in 2021. So we're really encouraged by the strength we're seeing across the entire node profile and geometries within foundry/logic. We think we're incredibly well positioned on the leading edge to drive key enabling technologies as the new playbook rolls out. We're equally well suited in the ICAPS nodes to drive those road maps going forward. Innovation is back across the entire node profile.
As our customers pursue unique opportunities in IoT, communications, auto, power, sensors, there's very unique technologies and capabilities that need to be driven as intelligence finds its way to the edge. Those road maps are vibrant. We've got key enabling technologies that's driving really good market positions for us at attractive margins. So we think we're really well set up to perform extremely well as both of these sides of foundry/logic profile going forward in a very balanced way.

C.J., this is Gary. Thanks for the question. So I think ICAPS, maybe some people would think as trailing technology nodes. But if you really think about the digitization of everything and this big inflection, people are talking about the future having 0.5 trillion or 1 trillion connected devices at the edge. And certainly, as we talk to system companies that are deploying those eyes and ears and sensors in all of those different applications that are transforming every industry, there needs to be a tremendous amount of innovation in power, performance, cost in both the chips and the packages. And we will cover this some more in the September 8 masterclass.
But I would think about edge innovation, certainly in the cloud you need high performance to extract the actionable insights. But that latency, power, cost, all of those things on the edge, that innovation is really important. And I think relative to the sustainability, certainly, you can see the explosion of data, especially machine-generated data, this market is very, very strong. And we think as you go to 0.5 trillion connected devices at the edge in the future, it's going to stay very strong. And as Dan talked about, we made a strategic change in our organization in 2019, pulling together key parts of our company, 200-millimeter, 300-millimeter, unit process innovation.

So obviously, it grew pretty nicely sequentially in the quarter. It sounds like you're still pretty positive, though, on the trajectory, and it's still below prior peak levels. And given the strength of your positioning and everything you've talked about, is there any reason to believe that like whenever we hit DRAM peak, like whenever that is, is there any reason to believe that, that level, wherever it is, shouldn't be higher, potentially significantly higher than where we saw the prior peak, which was several years ago?
And I think on the other piece of memory, NAND. You talked about foundry/logic and DRAM. You didn't really mention NAND at all. I know last quarter, your views on NAND were a little more muted than the rest of it. Have your views on the trajectory of that market into the back half downticked at all versus where you were 3 months ago because one of your competitors downticked a little bit?",169,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Thanks, Stacy. Let me take a track at those questions. And if I leave anything out, please follow up to make sure I hit all of the points that you put on the table. So first, I think our view around WFE this year. There's very little change. We said it's now over $80 billion. We think it's a mid-30% grower plus/minus. And embedded within that, we see strength across all device types, your fastest-growing foundry/logic, second half weighted; next fastest-growing DRAM, second half weighted, still see strong demand and pull from customers there, so we feel good about that. Last quarter, we put a question mark on the profile of NAND. Is it flat? Is it down a bit? We needed a bit more time to tell. I think we're still in that category. I think there's a question mark. Is it flattish? Is it down a bit? So very little has changed in terms of the shape of the profile throughout the year.
Taking a step back and taking a look at our DRAM progress. This is a business that we've had strong momentum in now for several years. And as we take a look at the road map, we talk about increasing our opportunity node over node, and that seems to be playing out in the market. Right now, you're adopting logic-like structures within the DRAM market, and this plays to a traditional source of strength for us. And so we're playing a key enabling role for our customers, and you see that playing out in the most recent results, and we would expect that strength to continue through the back half of the year.
As we look into 2022, we do see the overall WFE market up year-over-year. We see continued strength in all 3 device types: foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND. And so we like how well we're positioned against that opportunity. And the way we see it, right now, we're planning for all 3 of our reporting segments to be up year-over-year. So the concept of peak is a really interesting one in this context. If we take a step back and look at the secular trends shaping this industry, we know industries are going through a digital transformation, increasingly going to drive adoption of semiconductors. And I'd say the demand for semiconductors 5 years from now is going to be greater than it is today and certainly greater than it was 5 years ago. So all of that is playing out nicely.
What I would also say in the DRAM market, that your node over node shrinks are producing less bit growth than they have historically. So you're seeing capital intensity rise in that market. You're seeing capital intensity rise in all device types, frankly. But when I look at the investments our customers are making in this environment and I compare it on a historical basis as a percent of profitability to what we've seen historically, you go back about a decade and the customers are spending more from a WFE standpoint, but WFE as a percent of EBITDA is down 40% over the last decade.
So the monetization of these investments is greater today than it's ever been. So we really like the long-term secular drivers around our industry. And while every year may not be a peak, the trend line is definitely up. And we do think it leads to higher highs and higher lows as this industry continues to drive its road map and deliver the power, performance road map. We think we're incredibly well set up to perform really well as those trends play out.",606,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If you look over the last 2 quarters, you've grown revenue over $1 billion. And the biggest chunk of that, by far, has been China. And so I'm wondering if you can help us just better understand the makeup of spend in China today. And to the extent that we're all expecting this regionalization of supply, when and how do you think that takes place?",102,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Thanks, John. Let me take a crack at it. So what we would say is, we take a look at the business we do in China. We've got 3 reporting segments. The numbers we report are both semi systems to domestic China market participants as well as the international market participants that are building facilities there, all of the services that go into supporting those facilities as well as the display equipment that we ship into the market. So there's a lot of moving pieces that produce revenue in China in any given quarter.
As I take a step back and look at what's going on this year and we compare it to maybe the $10 billion of domestic China spend in WFE last year, what I would say is that you're seeing meaningful spend across all 3 device types: foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND. I would say the weighting this year is towards ICAPS market in China. And from a growth perspective, I would say it's probably growing a little bit above the overall industry average. So we feel really good about how well we're set up against this opportunity with long-standing relationships, key enabling technology, but we've got a broad and diverse business that serves this market across 3 reporting segments. And so we feel good about how we're positioned and continue to drive strong performance as the market evolves.",231,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

John, on the other part of your question about when do those investments happen from a regional perspective, there's no question I'm involved in a number of different discussions. There's tremendous pull across many different regions: U.S., Europe, Asia. And what I would say is that, certainly, it's important from a supply chain continuity to have more regional capacity. I think that's a big area of focus. But personally, I think, even more important is having not just physical infrastructure or manufacturing infrastructure but innovation infrastructure. And if you think about the infrastructure that's going to enable this multitrillion-dollar digital inflection, it really gets back to, as I talked about earlier, edge innovation, cloud innovation, everything in between for power, performance, cost ahead of others.
So we certainly see an opportunity and that is moving forward relative to physical infrastructure and regionalizing capacity. Also, certainly for Applied, the United States and many governments, having those foundational technology puzzle pieces for innovation to win this PPACt race of the future is incredibly important. And certainly, Applied is in a position where we're going to continue to invest on top of what we've already done in the United States with the Maydan Technology Center in Silicon Valley, the META Center in New York. But this is the race of our lifetimes and this innovation infrastructure, I think, is another key aspect of what needs to happen to win the future.",239,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So if you could give us some insight into how much additional capacity you're planning to bring online and then where do margins go from here?",90,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thanks, Vivek. So if you notice, we've been investing at a nice rate as a company now for multiple quarters. You saw us begin to take that up, invest in our infrastructure. We took a point of view on where we saw this industry was going, and we made sure that we had capacity in place to serve our customers and make them successful. So we'll continue to do that along the way. We won't be point specific about how much capacity that we're bringing online, as you can imagine, for competitive reasons, but we'll invest ahead of that materializing and continue to do what we've been doing now for several years as this industry continues to go structurally larger and we put a capacity statement in place to support it.
From a margin standpoint what I would say is, the company is performing really well in this environment. You see it in the current results. We told you it wasn't a 1 quarter phenomenon. We see follow-through at these levels. And this is despite the near-term headwinds we see from a COVID environment. And so as those headwinds begin to dissipate, I think you see an upward bias off of these levels on a like-for-like basis from a margin standpoint.
And then I'd also say, the long-term model that we've put out at our Analyst Day talked about 48.5%. I think we're making good progress against that. It's a good way to think about the company. But no matter what our gross margin is, I would say we'll never be satisfied with it. We'll be constantly looking for ways to increase the baseline level of productivity at the company and do even better than we're doing today. So we feel good about how we're set up. We'll continue to make investments to support the business, and we'll continue to drive results.",313,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

All 3 outperforming what I believe is your full year implied guide for semi systems. I guess my first question is, what are some of the key drivers there? And my second part is, how should we think about sustainability into fiscal '22 based on what's in your backlog today and based on the conversations you're having with your customers and ask the question because it obviously has important implications for mix and gross margins.",115,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Toshiya, thanks for the question. So I've been in constant conversations with R&D leaders many hours actually in each of the last 2 weeks and also CEOs for our leading customers. And what I would say, when you think about the PPACt road map, power, performance and cost and time, getting there ahead of others, that's what determines who wins and loses in the industry. And when you think about the relative, the key drivers for that. We've talked about 5 drivers, new chip architectures, new materials, new structures, new ways to shrink and new ways to connect chips together.
So if you look at what our customers are saying, even, I think, earlier today, but in many different forms, people are talking about new materials in the periodic table of elements and packaging technologies and new structures like gate-all-around or design technology co-optimization with technologies like buried power rails or contact over active gate. And in some of those cases, with no smaller pitch, you can drive significant area savings.
So when I look at the road map, and you see this today in our leadership businesses, and we also talked about in our investor meeting a new innovation where we can enable 50% reduction in wiring with integrated material solution where we're combining many technologies under vacuum, ALD, PVD, CVD, copper reflow, surface prep technologies to drive a 50% reduction in wiring across many different levels. That is enormous when you think about power and performance. And that one integrated system is worth billions of dollars. That's what we've communicated.
So Toshiya, I think that the opportunity for Applied has never been better. When you think about really, the relative contribution of power, performance and cost going forward, whether it's in the leading edge, where you're processing all of that data in the cloud, the edge innovation that I talked about earlier today, new memory technologies, it's really in the sweet spot for Applied for materials innovation, structure innovation.
We have a very strong position in advanced packaging. We're driving innovations not only with our breadth in our unit processes, but also in combinations with partners with new integrated material solutions. We're going to share more of that in our masterclass on September 8. So I think the strength that you're seeing, if I look out for the next few years and I look at the relative contribution to PPACt, I just think we've never been in a better position. And our leadership areas and the strategies and investments that we've been driving are paying off now, they'll pay off even a bigger way going forward.",439,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Thanks, Atif. Let me jump in on that one. So we talked for several quarters now about strengthening fundamentals in the overall display market, capacity coming out, strengthening panel prices, screen sizes continue to increase. You see 5G OLED penetration in the handset and then future road map, foldable displays in the handset. You talked about OLED penetration of larger format displays, IPTV. All of those strengthening market fundamentals, I think, give us a good sense that in 2022, you're probably going to enter a more attractive point of the investment cycle. I don't think it's going to be a dramatic step-up off these levels, but you'll certainly start to see better levels of investment.
So I think we're on the cusp of that right now. Too early to tell exactly when it hits, in the beginning of '22, in the back half of '22, but we're on the cusp of entering that more attractive point. I think there's technical solutions that need to be solved in the OLED market to drive it into large-format displays and start to replace LCD. So I think that's a little ways out, but we're certainly watching the customer's road map, the success with the technology inflection and then putting capacity behind that inflection.
Once that happens, I think you've got an opportunity to take this market structurally larger. And it will be a long-term technical shift in the industry's road map on those large-format displays. Those solutions will be more capital-intensive than LCD technologies today. And from an Applied Material and display business standpoint, it will be an attractive piece of business for us when it happens. But I still think we're a little ways away of that inflection actually hitting the market and customers putting capital behind it.",297,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So when I think about our PDC business, there are really 2 aspects. One is, certainly, we're seeing tremendous growth within PDC. And that's our certainly e-beam leadership. We're extending our e-beam leadership. I'll talk about that. We have the new optical product, the Enlight. We're expanding traction of that product. But the other aspect that's really important is the synergy with those technologies and our unit and IMS innovations.
I talked about in the prepared remarks the AppliedPRO process recipe optimization, extending that from 25 different engagements to more than 50 next year. And so basically, what we're doing is taking our e-beam leadership. We have the highest resolution, and we can generate massive data with unique imaging and algorithms so we can look at fingerprinting across a chip for things like pattern loading or across the wafer and really dialing those recipes in for our unit process and IMS innovations, whether it's wiring or gate-all-around or capacitor structures in DRAM or any of those kinds of things, that's worth billions of dollars to us, and it's worth a tremendous amount for every one of our customers. So that combination and the synergy is also very powerful. And relative to the revenue growth within PDC, again, that's been really great to see.
Our e-beam portfolio of products is extremely strong. We're also deploying new technology, and we'll talk more about that at the upcoming masterclass to extend our leadership from a resolution perspective certainly across all of our products, across EUV types of applications. So that's very strong. The optical part is also growing where we have real strength with some leading foundry/logic customers across a broader set of customers. So I'm very optimistic, your question about sustainability, very, very optimistic about the sustainability of revenue growth within PDC. And I'm even more excited about the synergy for R&D acceleration and big process windows and higher yield for the rest of the Applied portfolio.",330,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If we just look at the commentary here into the back half of this calendar year. It seems like we're doing about $45 billion in WFE for the back half of the year, sort of run rating around $90 billion. And if you just take the cumulative Street consensus for semiconductor revenue, it's in the $290 billion to $295 billion range. So WFE intensity seems a bit above 15% here in the back half of the year. And I think you've sort of said that you think 14% is the right longer-term number. So I guess my question is sort of, how do you think about the puts and takes for where the systems business could go on the downside? Because as you say, Dan, we do have subsidy-driven WFE coming on beginning in 2023. So I guess I'm just wondering how you think about the puts and takes around all of that.",176,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks, Tim. So when you think about run rates and you think about market share and you think about quarterly run rates, first of all, you're going to see things move from quarter to quarter. So it's hard to extrapolate what happens in any given quarter with a broad trend. The second thing I'd say is, depending on what you assume from a market share standpoint, you can get some pretty big swings in the analysis.
So from my perspective, we got a market that we think is over $80 billion this year, mid-30% grower. Our systems business in the first 2 quarters of actual results, 1 quarter of guide, those 3 quarters, our Semi Systems segment is going to be up over 50% against that market opportunity. We're seeing strength across all 3 device types and node over node momentum. We see our opportunity increasing. As we look into 2022, we see WFE up. Our confidence interval on that has gone up in the last 3 months. And so we feel good about that perspective. Then you see regionalization of capacity. And so hard to always call with precision the profile in any given year.
As I take a step back and think about the importance of semiconductors to digital transformation of virtually every segment of the economy, you think about rising capital intensity, I think there's an upward bias on capital intensity over time as a result of traditional 2D Moore's Law, traditional 2D shrinks hitting a wall, the new playbook that has multiple elements to it. We're certainly going to play a key enabling role to each element of that new playbook. I see there being an upward bias of capital intensity over time. And I don't think it tops out at 14%. And then you think about regionalization of capacity to create a secure supply of semis, I think that provides an even further upward bias.
And we've been on this observation for a while. If you go back a decade and look at 2-year rolling averages of WFE, every year won't be up, but each successive 2-year window has been up over the prior. And as we look forward over the next decade, we see those secular trends shaping our industry showing nice signs of strength. You will get a cyclical overlay on top of that trend line. It's going to lead to higher highs, higher lows, but it's hard to call with precision the timing of when those peaks and valleys hit.",419,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So as I look at the most recent quarter, one big takeaway I'd take away from the quarter is just how much the foundry/logic market has broadened. What used to be a leading node only spend in the past is now evenly balanced between leading edge and ICAPS markets today. I think that speaks to the momentum we see of edge computing, IoT. When you put intelligence at the edge, it sets up a virtuous cycle where the data generated at the edge is going to create more demand for advanced logic and memory in the cloud. It's a nice virtuous cycle.
Another observation, despite the supply chain headwinds the industry is seeing, our teams are working incredibly hard in driving gross margin initiatives, and they're delivering some of the best results the company has ever had.

I'd like to start by thanking our employees for delivering the best year in Applied Materials history while navigating a dynamic and challenging environment.  
Demand for semiconductors and wafer fab equipment remains very strong. And in fiscal 2021, we generated $23 billion of revenue, which represents 34% annual growth. In fiscal Q4, we hit the midpoint of our earnings guidance despite larger-than-expected supply chain constraints. These constraints worsened in the last few weeks of the quarter as we experienced delayed shipments from several suppliers. Without these supply shortages, we estimate that our Q4 revenues would have been at least $300 million higher.
We expect supply chain headwinds to persist into fiscal 2022, and mitigating them remains our top priority. For this reason, I'll begin today's call by providing some additional details about the industry's supply dynamics, both near term and longer term. Next, I'll describe the demand outlook, which is very strong and broad-based. I'll then talk about the progress we're making against our growth strategy and how Applied Materials is positioned to outperform the market over the coming years.  
I'm also happy to welcome Bob back to the CFO seat while we conduct the search for our next CFO. Later in the call, Bob will share his perspective on the state of the business and provide color on our financial performance.
So let me start with the supply side of the equation. Applied has made and continues to make strategic investments in our own global manufacturing infrastructure, so factory capacity is not a limiting factor for us. Like many in the industry, the primary challenge we face today is availability of certain silicon components. For Applied, our issues are relatively narrow, and we are proactively collaborating with our suppliers and directly with the chip companies to find solutions and work around bottlenecks. I deeply appreciate their partnership and teamwork as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances together. Looking further ahead, I believe we will see permanent changes in the way supply chains are designed and operated.  
In the semiconductor industry and beyond, there's a shift from just-in-time to a just-in-case approach, which will require higher levels of inventory, more built-in redundancy and more burst capacity. Because the economic value of capturing upside opportunities far outweighs pure efficiency savings, we're also seeing changes in supply agreements across the ecosystem as companies place a premium on having preferential access to capacity.
In addition, our customers are providing us with longer-term visibility, and we are collaborating more closely than ever when it comes to capacity planning. On top of that, the strategic importance of semiconductors is now recognized at a national level. Over the next few years, as incentive programs become available in the U.S., Europe and Asia, we expect to see a trend towards regionalized supply chains that are more resilient, but also increased capital intensity.
Now I'll characterize the demand environment, which is extremely healthy. The pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of the economy, fueling semiconductor consumption and driving the need for next-generation silicon technologies. As a result, we see wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2021 up around 40% year-on-year, in other words, in the mid-$80 billion range and constrained by supply, not demand.  
There is still a long way to go before supply and demand is balanced, especially as demand drivers continue to grow. We, therefore, expect wafer fab equipment spending to be up again in 2022. While we're currently focused on resolving near-term challenges, it's important to recognize we're only at the beginning of major technology and market inflections that will play out over the next decade.  
As everything gets smarter from our phones to our cars, to our homes, we see a combination of unit growth and increasing silicon content per unit. For example, if you look at this year's high-end smartphones, by dollar value, the application processor semiconductor content is up about 20% compared to last year's models, and RF content increased at twice that rate. And in data center applications, the average DRAM and NAND content per server is also growing at a 20% compound annual growth rate.
As more and more smart devices are connected at the edge, they are driving exponential growth in machine-generated data that must be stored, moved and processed. Then to create value from these vast volumes of data, new AI computing approaches are being developed, fueling further demand for current and next-generation semiconductors.
When I talk with customers, their message is clear and consistent. They are investing strategically to be in the best position to capture value as these long-term secular trends accelerate.
In our core market, foundry/logic is about 60% of wafer fab equipment spending in 2021, and we expect it to remain at this level or higher over the next several years. Within foundry/logic, the spending mix is relatively balanced between the most advanced nodes where we see a fierce battle for leadership playing out in ICAPS.
ICAPS node serve the fast-growing IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics and sensor markets. In memory, supply and demand fundamentals remain healthy, and we expect investments to be up next year, although not as much as foundry/logic.  
Finally, capital intensity is also providing an important tailwind. With the deceleration of traditional Moore's Law scaling and the transition to the new PPACt playbook, complexity is increasing. Simply put, more innovation is needed to get from one node to the next. And this higher complexity translates to higher capital intensity.
Against this backdrop, I'll now describe Applied's performance and progress towards our strategic goals. In fiscal 2021, we grew semiconductor equipment revenues almost $5 billion or 43% year-on-year, outpacing the market growth rate during that period. However, as I described earlier, we were unable to fully meet demand in our fourth quarter due to component shortages, and we expect to remain supply constrained going into fiscal 2022. As a result, we've grown our backlog at a company level to $11.8 billion, which is up 77% compared to the same period last year.  
Our near-term results do not fully reflect the underlying strength in our business or the progress we're making against our long-term strategy. As a reminder, our strategy has 3 pillars: first, to be the PPACt enablement company and provide the foundation for customers' power, performance, area cost and time-to-market road maps; second, to shift more of our business to subscriptions; and third, to generate incremental free cash flows and profitability from our businesses in adjacent markets. We've aligned our organization and investments around these critical focus areas and are demonstrating strong momentum.  
Applied's PPACt enablement strategy is built upon 3 differentiated elements. We have the broadest and most enabling portfolio of unit process solutions. We can co-optimize and integrate these technologies in unique and highly enabling ways. And we're focused on time-to-market acceleration with our AI(x) or Actionable Insight Accelerator data platform.  
Starting with our unit process tools. Demand in our traditional leadership areas is very strong. Our epi and thermal businesses both grew 70% this fiscal year, and CMP grew more than 60%. And in our targeted growth areas, we expect our process diagnostic and control revenues to be up more than 60% in calendar 2021.  
Packaging is another very exciting area for us. Our equipment revenues are up more than 55% year-on-year, and we're on track to exceed $800 million for calendar 2021. We're also bringing highly enabling future technologies to market through a combination of organic R&D and strategic partnerships.
Moving to our co-optimized and integrated products. The customer pull for these solutions is strong and increasing for future nodes. Co-optimization allows us to see and solve higher-value problems for customers, speed up commercialization of new innovations and capture more of the available opportunity. One example is dielectric materials where we're driving parallel innovations in materials deposition, modification and removal. Our CVD group has more than 15 new materials either in development or recently released. These enable new structures or manufacturing techniques in both foundry/logic and memory. The revenue opportunity we've opened up for the co-optimized etch and CMP steps is almost twice as large as the market for the stand-alone deposition equipment.  Another example is advanced patterning where we're co-optimizing CVD, ALD and CMP with our Sym3 etch, enabling us to gain more than 5 points of share in patterning this year.  
Integrated Materials Solutions, or IMS, go one step beyond co-optimization by combining multiple processes with customized metrology and sensors in a single system typically under vacuum. With IMS, we can target the most complex and valuable challenges in the new PPACt playbook. For example, this year, we delivered 5 new low R, or low resistance metallization integrated solutions to customers that address next-generation applications in foundry/logic, DRAM and NAND. This included our copper barrier seed IMS that combines 7 different process technologies in one system under vacuum, ALD, PVD, CVD, copper reflow, surface treatment, interface engineering and metrology. This enables a 50% reduction in interconnect resistance at the most advanced foundry/logic nodes and creates a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Applied Materials over the next 5 years.  
The final component of our PPACt enablement strategy is time-to-market acceleration. New digital tools that accelerate R&D, technology transfer and high-volume manufacturing are a major focus area for our customers. In the coming years, these technologies will have a huge impact on productivity and innovation to commercialization speed. They will also play a key role in making regional supply chains economically competitive and sustainable. Our AI(x) platform brings together process tools, sensors, metrology with data analytics and machine learning. We currently have 25 AI(x) R&D acceleration engagements with leading customers, and we now expect that number to triple over the next 12 months.  
Another highlight for 2021 is the progress we're making with subscription revenues. In our service business, we've already converted a significant percentage of our spares and service revenue from on-demand to long-term service agreements. We now have nearly 15,000 installed base tools covered by these agreements, up 12% year-on-year. The tenure of these agreements has grown from 1.9 years at the end of 2020 to 2.3 years today, and our renewal rate is about 90%. Several customers have highlighted how these long-term agreements have allowed them to better manage disruptions in parts supply and technical support during the pandemic.  
Before I hand the call over to Bob, I will quickly summarize. As the digital transformation of the economy accelerates, demand for semiconductors continues to grow and is significantly outpacing supply. We expect supply shortages of certain silicon components to persist in the near term, meaning that we don't expect to fully meet demand in Q1. Managing these constraints in partnership with our suppliers and chip makers is our top priority.  
Looking beyond the near-term disruptions, I feel very positive about the future. Longer-term secular trends are driving the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher. And at Applied, we're making significant progress towards our strategic plans. We are in the best position to accelerate our customers' PPACt road maps and grow significantly faster than our markets over the next several years.  
Now I'll hand the call over to Bob.",1857,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I want to begin by saying I'm very happy for the opportunity to work with all of you again. I have 3 main messages today. Number one, demand is very strong and growing, and I think it's likely to remain strong in 2022 and beyond. Number two, supply chain constraints are impacting our ability to meet all of our demand in the near term. Number three, Applied Materials is making very good progress toward our financial targets, and we're in a great position to return capital to shareholders. I'll cover each of these topics in order and give you our guidance. And then Gary, Mike and I will help with your questions.  
I'll begin by giving you more detailed insights than we typically share about the demand for our products and its sustainability into 2022. Specifically, our Semi Systems revenue grew by 43% in 2021. Our Semi Systems orders grew by 78% for the year. In fact, our Semi Systems orders grew in every quarter. In Q4, they were up 136% year-over-year.  
Looking ahead, we currently expect our orders to be higher in the first half of fiscal 2022 than in the second half of 2021 across Semi Systems, AGS and also Display. In short, the demand environment is very strong.  
What's happening on the demand side is that all of the trends Gary and I talked about years ago are playing out in an even bigger way than we imagined. First, semiconductor demand is higher because we're designing more intelligence into practically everything that gets built and sold. Second, equipment capital intensity is higher. We don't have wafer size increases anymore, and the industry has run out a number of efficiencies, including fab automation, industry consolidation and the foundry model.
Used equipment is now scarce. So even in the ICAPS markets, customers are buying new equipment and spending more. The industry is adding more wafer capacity to keep up with demand, particularly in foundry/logic, and we believe spending will remain strong.  
Specifically, the industry grew foundry/logic wafer starts by around 40% over the past 5 years alone. At the end of our fiscal year, overall fab utilization for the industry increased to the highest level of the past decade. We see foundry/logic continuing to grow as a proportion of the industry's mix. Five years ago, foundry/logic represented around 53% of WFE spending. As of 2021, it's grown to 60% of WFE, and we see it being even higher into the future.  
Even with higher wafer capacity and high utilization, we have a global semiconductor shortage that's affecting a wide range of industries, including our own. Industry-wide, we are tracking 59 fab projects with available and announced expansion capacity of 3.5 million wafer starts. These projects represent potential equipment spending of around $300 billion in future years. All of this data leads me to believe that demand is likely to remain strong.
Now I'll give you more insights into our own supply situation. In Q4, our Semi Systems backlog was at record levels and growing quickly. In our guidance for Q4, we targeted modest Semi Systems revenue growth. We also widened our overall guidance range due to our concerns about the supply chain.  
Toward the end of Q4, we experienced later-than-expected deliveries of the components we need to complete and ship our build plan by the end of the quarter. The reason for the delays is that our suppliers couldn't get enough parts from their own suppliers, which include chip makers and distributors. The supply issues are directly related to the semiconductor shortage, particularly in logic, power and analog ICs.  
Not all of our semi businesses were affected in Q4. Our process control, CMP, etch and packaging businesses beat our revenue targets. Yet our overall Semi Systems revenue was $293 million below the midpoint of our expectation. The full semiconductor revenue impact of the shortages during the quarter was well above $300 million.
In Q1, we are guiding for sequential growth of around 3%. We have the internal capacity to easily ship several hundred million dollars more of semi equipment, but we are planning for only modest supply increases. Looking ahead, I believe WFE spending will be up again in calendar 2022 and will remain strong, particularly for foundry/logic, both at the leading edge and ICAPS notes. I also believe Applied's business will be higher in the first half of calendar 2022 than in the second half of calendar 2021, both in Semi Systems and AGS.  
Next, since it's the end of our fiscal year, it's a good time to assess the progress we're making towards our 2024 financial model. In April, we outlined targets to grow our revenue, profitability and earnings in a variety of WFE scenarios, including a base case of $85 billion and a high case of $100 billion. With everything we're seeing in the industry today, our high scenario of $100 billion is increasingly likely. 
One year into the long-term plan, we've made good progress, increasing revenue by 34%, non-GAAP gross margin by 240 basis points, non-GAAP operating margin by 540 basis points and non-GAAP EPS by 64%. We believe our Semi Systems group is well on track to its growth targets based on our strong product road maps and the deep customer engagements Gary described.  
We believe AGS can exceed the growth implied in our model after growing by 21% this year alone. In fact, AGS had record backlog of over $4.33 billion at the end of the year. 72% of the Q4 backlog was subscription business with terms of 1 to 3 years, and 65% of new subscription bookings were multiyear. 
While our focus is on recurring revenue, AGS also includes our 200-millimeter equipment business. Our 200-millimeter business has been growing along with the rest of the ICAPS market, approaching $650 million in WFE revenue in calendar 2021.  
Turning to our profitability metrics. We expect to achieve our non-GAAP gross margin target of 48.5% once the near-term material and logistics cost headwinds subside. We also feel confident in our non-GAAP operating margin targets. The Semi Systems group increased its operating margin by 590 basis points this year, while AGS delivered record operating margin of 31% in Q4. A major focus for us is increasing the display group's margin to between 25% and 30%. And we plan to be in that range by the second half of 2022.  
Another of our targets is to return 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. In fiscal 2021, we generated a record $4.77 billion in free cash flow, and we returned 96% mainly through stock buybacks. We ended the year with over $5 billion remaining in buyback authorization. And given the strong demand outlook and our view of the intrinsic value of the company, we expect to continue to be aggressive with the program.  
Now I'll share our Q1 business outlook. Given the supply chain challenges, we expect to modestly increase revenue to $6.16 billion, plus or minus $250 million, or up around 19% year-on-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be around $1.85, plus or minus $0.07, or up around 33% year-on-year.  
Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.46 billion, up 25% year-over-year. We project AGS revenue of around $1.33 billion, up 15% year-over-year. We expect Display revenue to be around $350 million in Q1 and higher as we progress through the year. Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should decline to around 47.4%, primarily due to higher near-term cost headwinds. We plan to increase non-GAAP OpEx to $970 million, which is around 15.8% of revenue, below our long-term model target of 16%. Our guidance also assumes a 12% non-GAAP tax rate.  
Finally, along with Gary, I'd like to thank all of our teams and partners for their hard work in a challenging environment. Now Mike, let's begin the Q&A.",1308,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

I'm sure you're happy to be back from the golf course. So I guess a couple of part question on supply constraints. You talked about not being fully resolved in January. Do you expect it to be resolved in April? And how are customers reacting to the shortages? Are they waiting on a full suite of tools? Or are they taking whatever tools they can get? And then, I guess, lastly, considering the backlog that you highlighted and also that longest lead time ASML is essentially sold out for all of 2022, it certainly looks like your visibility extends now into 2023. Can you speak to that?",110,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Thanks for welcoming me back. A few things. One, supply chain; two, overall demand environment; and three, visibility, I guess. The first one, supply chain, we actually did pretty well managing this through about 11 months of the year and a week, and then it got a little worse at the end of the quarter. And that was our issue. So now we're all over this thing. 
In the short term, managing the next quarters is about prioritization, project management and execution. So we have set up a cadence that every week, I'm going through all the detailed performance by week of how we're doing on receipts, shipments, shortages, individual supplier names. And Gary is going through it almost every day, okay? So we are escalating this thing. 
So then you say, why do we think we're going to do better in Q1? So if you look at some of the public companies you know, they're up 3% to 5% on average, some of our suppliers. We believe that our allocation will be somewhat better than that. We also believe that we have internally allocated that effectively, and we are working with our suppliers' suppliers, who are our customers, to free up more demand. 
Secondly, if you look at the early data, in the first 2 weeks of the quarter, receipts were up about 15% from the previous quarter. So I think we're going to be okay. If you look at the stuff that caused these problems, there's miscellaneous problems all over the place, but most of those are manageable. What hit us hard was this thousands, theoretically, of electronic components that our suppliers use in our products to us. There are about 100 that we're closely monitoring last quarter and 10 that gave us problems at the end of the quarter. These are particularly around PLCs. We are monitoring the top 10 suppliers of our products, and we are monitoring those 100, plus 200 other components. We want to make sure nothing goes bad. 
So I feel pretty good that, number one, the demand is really good. The backlog is there. The orders are up every quarter. It looks strong next year. It doesn't feel or looks strong next year. I think supply chain is going to get better incrementally every quarter through the year. 
In terms of -- visibility is great. In terms of a full suite of tools, we are -- customers are taking all the tools we can ship. And we're largely keeping them happy, but we want to not get the backlog too big. But I think we're going to make progress throughout the year.",441,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

It's great working with you again. My guess is you're going to get multiples of C.J.'s questions on the supply side. But I'm just kind of curious, Bob, to follow up, as the supply chain gets better, do you think by the April quarter, there's a big step function pickup to the $500 million, plus or minus, that you can't ship in sort of October and January? Or will it be a little bit more linear than that as supply comes online? 
And then to your point earlier, Bob, about the backlog, just how do you safeguard against sort of a frothy backlog in this kind of environment? There are impressive numbers. But typically, when customers can't get what they want, they tend to order more than they need. So how are you safeguarding against that?",141,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So in terms of rate of recovery, what we're modeling from discussions with suppliers and our suppliers' suppliers and our internal analysis, which we're doing the best we can to model this, and we believe it's accurate, we think Q1, the rate recovery, if you look at it, our Semi business is up a little over 3% equipment. And that's about what the industry is quarter-on-quarter. Our AGS business is a little bit lower because it's 14 weeks last year in Q1 as the Chinese holiday falls into Q1 this year. But if you look at rate of recovery, we think it goes up a little over 3% in Q1. We think the equipment business picks up a couple of points more every quarter and builds more momentum later in the year. 
Now as we get more visibility, next quarter, I'll be more confident in those numbers. But that's the kind of acceleration we're picking up in shipments. We hope to do better. We might do better, but that's what we're modeling.",196,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I don't think that's a problem right now, double booking, John. If you look at breakout between memory and the foundry/logic, foundry/logic was 60% this year of the business. We actually think it's up next year. If you look at public statements from TSMC, Intel, another big foundry/logic manufacturers, they're talking about multiyear commitments to WFE spending and very strong businesses on their side. We look within the mix that foundry/logic increases as a percentage of the mix next year. We look at memory as being slightly up, a little bit more on NAND, a little bit down on DRAM. So we think that's muted and reasonable. And we don't see double booking then. We see China down a little bit next year.

Our services business is doing great. This year, we're up 21%. We're ahead of plan to hit the 2024 model. I think we might have said on the call even that we need a compound rate of growth of 7% a year to hit that model. We think we'll exceed that, probably do double digits this year growth in service. 
If you look at our service business, it's multiple components. It's a 200-millimeter tool business. There is a contract services where you sign up for services 1 to 3 years, including different types of service arrangements. And then it's kind of time and material stuff. 
If you look at the service business, we think it's going to grow strongly this year in double -- strong double digits. And in fact, our customers are thanking our service guys for getting them on to parts service contracts in the past year or 2 because our customers are in good shape in terms of support and parts. So I think that the parts issues, supply chain issues are not really impacting our service business. 
The other thing, which we'll point out, and Gary might give you more detail, if you look at the parts of the constraint, things like PLCs and stuff, which are components -- in components, those are not the parts that are high replacement service parts in the service supply chain.

Thanks for the question. There's 2 parts to this. I'll take the first part, and then Bob can take the second part. Relative to Display, we've talked about that many times, really good adjacent market where we can take our semi deposition and e-beam technologies into a market with larger substrates. 
For '21, as expected, we're on track for a little over $1.6 billion in revenue and maintaining strong share of our served market. We think '22 is a little higher than '21, more second half versus first half. And as Bob also discussed in the prepared remarks, we're on track to achieve our target for higher profit and free cash flow in the 25% to 30% range exiting 2022.

So if you look at gross margins this past year, we're up 2.4 points, which is great performance. We're on track to hit the model, which is, I think, about 48.5% in the out years. We're a little soft right now in Q1, and that's all supply chain stuff. As we go out through the year, we expect gross margins to rise up again as we get the supply chain issues behind us. 
In terms of the things that impact gross margin, we did a lot of good things in 2021. We had very good cost reduction. We had high-value products and services. We sold to the customers, and we recognize that value back from the customers. And then we have pretty good volume and mix, which helped, too. 
If you look at prospectively, the cost reduction is a little slower. We will continue to realize high value with the customers. We share that value, and we think that's going to help our margins.

Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about localization of semiconductor capacity going forward. Obviously, there's a lot of talks in the United States and Europe, in Asia as well, more recently, Japan. How are you thinking about the potential impact from all these projects? I think from a timing perspective, most of us are thinking 2023 or even later. But based on what you know, all the discussions you're having, how are you thinking about that? And sort of related to that, how should we think about the competitive threat from the local Chinese semi-cap companies? I know they've been around for a very long time. And up until this point, there remains a very significant gap between incumbents like yourselves and them. But how concerned should we be as we think about your business over the next 3 to 5 years?",146,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Thanks for the questions, Toshiya. Relative to localization of supply chains and things like the CHIPS Act, that's obviously good for our business. We're in discussions. As I mentioned earlier, I've met with all of the top CEOs here in the last quarter. And that's -- as they move to these other new locations, that creates an opportunity for us to support them, especially with our services business. So we're in very close cooperation with those customers as they move forward with those plans. And there's opportunities. 
I think for them, they're also concerned about cost and cultural differences and all of those things. And so that creates a tremendous opportunity, not just for our traditional services, but opportunities like AI(x), Applied Actionable Insight Acceleration, where I think they're also extremely focused on how to accelerate R&D ramp and optimize high-volume manufacturing in new locations. So I think that really creates a tremendous opportunity for us. 
The other part of the CHIPS Act is really how every government runs faster in innovation and commercialization. And we're also in deep discussions with a number of leading technology companies. And that will also create an opportunity, I believe, for Applied. 
Relative to the China equipment suppliers, really, if you look at what every single customer is focused on, it's providing power, performance and costs ahead of others. We talk about PPACt, and the T is incredibly important. And whether it's -- we talk about low-resistance wiring, which is probably one of the biggest issues in the industry where we have tremendous strength, or gate all around transistors or the scaling in memory or packaging, that is incredibly complex and difficult. And the companies that are ahead on power, performance and cost capture really the majority of the market.

I just wanted to check on the fact that some of these constraints are pushing out revenues into next year, and it looks like maybe in the first half of next year, the WFE run rate could hit $100 billion. So I just wanted to figure out from your vantage point, how do you think about that?

I think we probably said in the script it could be up -- I think at this time, we don't want to be too specific. We're talking to kind of 10% up next year. And I'd say pretty confident in that, frankly. 
If you look at the run rate in the first half, the visibility is a little better in the first half. And we have very strong orders and booking potential in the first half. We actually think the second half is going to get a little stronger even on bookings than what we have today, frankly. Everything we've talked to customers is bullish, particularly in the foundry/logic area. 
If you go look at the model, it's -- $100 billion, I think that's a real number nowadays. I don't know that it's a real number next year at this point. I think we achieved that $100 billion. We'll hit the model, and it was the model $10. I think we'll do it.",171,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And some of this, obviously, I can't share publicly, but I have very high confidence that the business is going to remain strong through '22. And right now, '23 also looks good for us.

Tim, thanks for the question. Certainly, Q1 would have been significantly higher. I think Bob gave some color on that. But certainly, demand is far higher than supply. When you take us -- and outperformed in '19. We outperformed in '20. We're definitely -- we're on track to outperform in '21. We also feel very good about '22 and going forward. But I don't know if I want to be more specific other than what the color that we've already given on the call, but definitely would have been significantly higher in Q1 and then going into 2022. 
In terms of the different parts of our business, we've talked about wiring resistance in foundry/logic really is the biggest challenge for our customers. As they shrink these features, resistance goes up. And we gave some color on copper barrier seed tool with 7 different technologies that is worth billions of dollars. And what I said in the prepared remarks is that we have 5 of these innovations that we're delivering to customers, and we haven't quantified all of them, but it's very sizable in areas where Applied is really unique in enabling the solutions to wiring resistance. In the one case, we've talked about 50% improvement in resistance. 
And then you look at gate-all-around, again, we feel very good about our position in the transistor to gain share. That's $1 billion opportunity. And relative to our FinFET position, we believe we're positioned to gain share as that goes forward. Certainly, in foundry/logic, our etch share is increasing. Our EUV etch share is increasing. Our PDC share, we've talked about our business being up more than 60% overall. And just, again, really very, very strong position with integrated solutions. I gave some color on co-optimization and gave an example in the memory market where, again, we have a big opportunity.

And Tim, I add one more thing for you. So I know in the past, instead of waiting for Gartner group to come out with market share, what you always did is you took our fiscal Q2 through fiscal Q1 as a proxy for our revenue. And what's interesting is what we did back in February, we kind of disclosed in our conference call. And then in April, I wrote everybody that we've made a similar adjustment ourselves. So what we're now doing is our calendar year revenue for VLSI share purposes, it's now based on our financial reporting in fiscal Q2 through fiscal Q1. And one benefit of that change is that as soon as we guide Q1, which we just did today, now you can forecast our WFE revenue for share purposes, and you can make an apples-to-apples with the peer group. 
And then I just wanted to call your attention to one other number in the script today. Bob sized our AGS 200-millimeter revenue at around $650 million for the calendar year.

Does that apply to memory as well? Or should we think about that growth being mostly foundry/logic-driven and maybe memory is more second half-weighted?,42,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So if you look at our 2021 data in terms of memory versus logic, we were a little stronger in the first half on memory. And then if you look at -- I'm going to look at the actual data. So our foundry was a little stronger in the second half, and our memory NAND was a little strong in the first half, DRAM a little strong in the second half, actually. 
If you look at next year, we think the year is kind of flattish. We think it's probably a little more second half weighted in memory next year. I think foundry is pretty strong throughout the year, but I don't think there's a big delta.",118,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

So welcome back. Maybe just following up on the AGS side of things. Given the high utilization rates, the high demand for chips today, have you seen any incremental type of pickups in your services business just because your customers are trying to keep their tools running as best as possible? Are you seeing any incremental pickup in subscription businesses just because of the current environment?",77,6.0,4.0,0.8333333333333334,0.4

I think the answer is yes. I'm not sure if I covered it completely the call. I'll give you some data. You guys like data. If you look -- I want to look at sustainability of all this. So we looked at bookings, backlog, orders rates, stuff like that. The other thing I looked at was growth in wafer starts and tool utilization, right? So I'm not sure if we said it in the call, but tool utilization at the end of the calendar fiscal year was at an all-time high in the last 11 years I look back at across all device types. So that gave me confidence this thing is sustainable and looks pretty good and is good for our service business. 
And then I also looked at growth in wafer starts. And growth in wafer starts, I think I said in the call, is about 40% foundry/logic and kind of about 20% memory since 2016, particularly strong in 300-millimeter wafer starts for foundry/logic. So then if you go with the question you asked, Patrick, we grew our service business 12% -- 21% last year. We're looking at about 12% this year. And if you look at high utilization, foundry/logic tools growing particularly well for us. We did pretty well in etch in previous years also. I see our service -- and we increased our contract and the life of our contracts from 1 to 3 years. The subscription revenue business, sustainability of the service business looks really good.",252,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Just one other comment. In the discussions I've had with all of the CEOs, one thing that was pointed out was that having these subscription agreements and forecasted parts management, they said we're profiling better than others because they have those parts there. So from a supply standpoint, they said that was a big differentiator and gives them more conviction to continue and expand that type of approach.",72,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

In 2022, you said it would be down slightly. Wondering if you could give us a little bit more color what's driving that decline. Is it just digestion of capacity put in place this year? Do you see any political or export control impact or perhaps a trend towards supplier localization in China next year?",67,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

So 3 things in China. It's down some next year but pretty strong. 
The second thing is if you look at trend and local versus -- spending by local companies versus international companies, it's trending up. It was high 70s, kind of 77% this year, about 82% next year. 
The third is mix and business. So they've trended like the rest of the world to go a little bit more foundry/logic. So they were like 52% -- 48% memory this year, going to  like 52% next year. So they're trending that way. In terms of where it's down, I think DRAM is down a little bit in China next year and foundry. But the mix to foundry is trending up.",137,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

You guys talked about process control was not an area that was impacted by supply constraints, and now growing about 80 -- 60% for this year. You guys also talked about a number of AI(x) engagements potentially tripling next year instead of doubling. Just can you help us understand how these engagements impact your revenue growth potential? Do they generally translate into revenue in the same year or a number of years? Do they increase the overall size of the market or just an opportunity for Applied to gain shares? And generally, just how you measure success with those engagements?",109,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

This is Gary. Thanks for the question. So the fastest-growing largest part of our PDC business is our e-beam product family, and we have tremendous leadership there. We're growing share a significant amount. The strength is really on our resolution and speed of imaging. And we're expanding that gap with coal field emission where we have about a 50% resolution advantage versus others. 
And so when you think about the -- certainly, the growth there -- and we have line of sight to really good growth also in 2022. This co-optimization with e-beam is very, very important. We talked about that, an example, for capacitor scaling where we're combining a new material we call Draco, with innovative etch technology. And basically, optimizing these process is incredibly complex. You're trying to optimize many, many different parameters at the same time. And the goal is to optimize those recipes as fast as possible with big process windows because that directly impacts yield. So this combination with e-beam is incredibly important. 
When you think about, again, capacitor scaling or gate-all-around or any of these big inflections, the ability to map that out and look at those fingerprints across the chip, you look at pattern loading for isolated dense structures, fingerprints across the wafer, being able to map out this multi-dimension space, and with the unique imaging of those features, which we have with our e-beam system, and then we talked about the Applied process recipe optimization, AppliedPRO within AI(x), it's really an enormous focus for all of our different customers. 
So it certainly is growing our PDC business, but even more impactful, the opportunity for us to capture value with our IMS platforms, our co-optimized platforms is worth billions of dollars. So that is an accelerator for us that we're -- that gives us a tailwind, whether it's low R, gate-all-around, memory scaling, all of those different capabilities. And that's a great leading indicator going from 25 engagements to 75 next year. It does translate into wins in terms of these big inflections, accelerating the inflections. The T of the PPACt is worth an enormous amount for our customers. So it's really -- it's tremendously synergistic with our overall strategy and opportunity.",370,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I have some summary thoughts. But first, I'm going to go off script and just say it's great to be back. We have a good team, included Gary. And when I visualize coming back, I thought of myself a little bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator. I'll be back. And then unfortunately, everyone hears [indiscernible] Welcome Back, Kotter, but I'm back anyway. 
So let's do the 3-legged stool. Our markets are in strong and in great shape. We think WFE is up next year and, frankly, positively biased until '23. 
Second, Applied's position is strong. Our spending -- our demand is great. Our orders are great. Our backlog is great. The mix of the demand is really favorable for us, including foundry/logic, these advanced devices, ICAPS. It's really great. 
Number three is our financial performance and capital returns. I have to admit, I was impressed that the gross margins went up 240 points this year, and we were up 540 points or 5.4% operating margins. And last year, we returned 96% of free cash flow to investors, and we're looking at a really strong cash flow this year. So I think the company is just in fundamentally great shape. 
We have supply chain headwinds. We take full accountability for making it work and delivering to customers. We are all over this issue. And next quarter or so, we're going to make a lot of progress. But fundamentally, this company is in great shape, and I'm looking forward to working with all of you again.",257,8.0,4.0,0.9444444444444444,0.4
