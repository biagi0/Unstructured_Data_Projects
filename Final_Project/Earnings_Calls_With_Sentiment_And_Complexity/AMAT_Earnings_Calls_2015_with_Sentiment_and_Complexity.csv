251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3468.0,760556.0,33316879.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let me start by providing an assessment of our overall progress. First, our long-term strategy. We are driving profitable growth by enabling major technology inflections using our precision materials engineering leadership to gain share and grow faster than the markets we serve. 
Major transitions in semiconductor and Display technology create great opportunities for Applied. We are making meaningful progress towards our long-term strategic goals, and this will be accelerated by our upcoming merger. 
In the midterm, we have been focused on those opportunities that move the needle for customers and for Applied. We have strengthened our R&D and field teams, while increasing investment in product development. We've also created a pipeline of new, differentiated products that accelerate Applied's growth when customers move to new technology -- when customers move new technology into high-volume production. And we're managing the effect on margins as we ramp these new products. 
In the short term, the forecasted levels of invested by our -- investment by our customers provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. While there are challenges inherent in our spending mix and some uncertainties about timing, we remain firmly on our trajectory of profitable growth. 
At the same time, we are completing our preparations to merge with Tokyo Electron. The Applied and Tokyo Electron teams are very excited about the strategic opportunity this merger creates and share a strong commitment to work together to achieve our performance goals for the new company. 
We believe we are making progress with regulators around the world on a coordinated proposal that would allow us to move forward with our business combination. We are working to secure the remaining approvals and complete the merger as soon as possible. 
During this phase, we've been advised not to provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussions. 
Turning to our market outlook. Industry growth is fueled by evolving trends in mobility, connectivity, video and wearable devices. This is accelerating innovations in mobile processors, solid-state storage and interactive displays. 
Our customers are focused on winning share in these inflection and this is resulting in a period of sustained investment by semiconductor customers. We believe wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2014 was approximately 15% higher than the previous year. And as we look ahead, we maintain our view that the market could grow another 5% or more in 2015. 
In foundry, we expect investment to be maintained at the same healthy levels seen in 2014, with the potential to be slightly higher than last year. Our current view is that spending for advanced nodes will be heavily biased towards the second half of the year. 
While we see some timing uncertainty with the ramp of this complex technology, the FinFET inflection is highly beneficial for Applied, expanding the opportunity for our leadership products in FE, metal deposition, implants, anneals and CMP. 
In memory, supply remains tight with a healthy pricing environment and robust investment. In the past quarter, we booked our highest orders from memory customers in over 7 years. This includes our highest quarterly DRAM orders since 2010. 
DRAM bit growth for 2015 is expected to be around 30% with mobile DRAM standing out as the most significant driver. While technology conversions are currently providing a large portion of the needed supply, increasing device complexity and additional process steps required at the smaller nodes are reducing effective factory output. 
In addition, mobile DRAM devices are typically larger than PC DRAM and the combination of these factors is leading to new capacity additions this year. 
The market for NAND memory is also expanding. Leading smartphone makers have doubled the average bits per box over the past 12 months and this, added to growth in solid-state drives is supporting NAND bit growth in the range of 40%. Although we believe the majority of NAND investments will still be focused on advanced planar capacity, we see 3D NAND spending for the year at approximately twice the 2014 level, with more customers starting to move to this technology. 
The industry's transition to 3D NAND has been slower than forecast, however, it remains a positive inflection for Applied, expanding our served available market by 35% to 50%. 
The outlook for Display also remains very healthy. Average TV sizes are growing faster than historic rates, and we are seeing a surge in unit sales, fueled by consumer spending on new 4K and OLED models. Demand for bigger, higher resolution, low-power screens for mobile applications is also a key factor behind Display growth. 
In TV and mobile, supply is tight, and our customers are investing in new capacity and advanced technology. This quarter, our Display business delivered its highest revenue in the past 3 years. 
As we have said before, major inflections like FinFET, 3D NAND and new displays represent unprecedented technology advances that are enabled by materials innovation. 
We are still in the early stages of these inflections and as they play out over the next several years, they create great, long-term growth opportunities for Applied. 
To fully capitalize on these transitions, we have aligned our structure and talent around key areas of value creation. We will continue to aggressively manage our product portfolio so we can quickly shift resources to areas that are truly enabling for customers and generate the best returns for us. 
We are starting to see the impact of these changes. In 2013, we won 1.4 points of share in wafer fab equipment while delivering innovative and enabling new products to customers. 
In 2014, we consolidated our new product positions and strengthened our product pipeline. We believe we gained share or held share in almost all our businesses. And based on our current view of customer spending, we expect to grow our overall wafer fab equipment share again in 2015. 
We are making our largest gains in areas where the market is growing rapidly, including CVD and Etch. This past calendar year, we estimate that we won at least 3 points of share in CVD and 5 points of share in conductor etch. Etch is a business where we continue to build momentum. We have been focusing on key technology inflections in market segments, where we believe we have sustainable technology differentiation. 
New wins in memory combined with our traction in foundry, helped us deliver our highest Etch quarterly revenues in orders since 2007. Our latest generation Etch system has one of the fastest adoption rates of any new Applied product in recent years. We shipped 3x as many chambers in the first quarter than we did in the prior quarter, and we expect to double shipment volumes again in Q2. 
We also see great opportunities to grow our service business. We are bringing together capabilities from across the company to develop expanded service offerings that help customers ramp complex new device technologies faster and at lower cost. 
At both leading and trailing nodes, wafer starts and fab utilization are at very high levels. We are winning new service contracts from a broad base of customers and growing faster than the market. 
Over the past 2 quarters, our service business booked its highest orders for any 6-month period in our history. 
In summary, while there are risks related to the timing of customer investments, our current view is that 2015 will be a solid market growth -- a year of solid market growth, driven by robust memory spending in the first half and foundries ramping FinFET production in the second half. 
Applied Materials has a strong platform to gain share, driven by tremendous customer pull for enabling precision materials, engineering products and services. And across the organization, we remain highly focused on improving execution. We are driving alignment, speed and scale as we prepare to merge with Tokyo Electron and hit the ground running as we become one company. 
Let me now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide further details on our performance and outlook.",1323,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2015",2015-02-11,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3468.0,760556.0,33316880.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Gary gave us an update on the market environment and the status of technology inflections. I'll begin by translating how we expect those patterns to play out in our business during the current fiscal year.
First, you'll notice that memory spending is particularly strong in the first half of our year. In Q1, our memory orders top foundry and logic orders for the first time in 5 years, and we could see a similar mix in Q2. 
Next, you will notice that while our foundry customers are intensely focused on ramping FinFETs, the order pattern is shaping up to the back half loaded, also for the first time in years. We expect this mix to put more revenue and margin in our fiscal second half. 
Gary indicated the calendar 2015 WFE could be up by 5% or more. The greatest swing factor in our model is how much of the expected foundry spending is captured by the end of our fiscal year in October. 
From where we sit today, we expect a very strong fiscal second half. The high mix of memory in Etch resulted in gross margins being below our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, Etch grew 90% sequentially, higher than our previous goal of 60%. 
Gary spoke about our focus on portfolio management. Like we discussed, some of the results we're seeing in our efforts to generate profitable growth across our businesses. In AGS, we've strengthened the linkages to SSG and operations, invested in higher-value offerings and focused on delivering long-term service contracts that could help customers with uptime, yields and cost. 
After 2 years of declining sales, AGS posted 9% growth in fiscal 2014. AGS delivered near-record orders in Q1 and is on track for continued revenue growth and margin expansion. 
Our Display business was the first one to fully deploy our product development engine best practices and received internal funding to capture share in CVD, PVD and new products based on large area precision materials engineering. 
In Q1, the Display group posted a second sequential quarter with operating margins above 25%. Display also had strong momentum, with new Gen 6 PVD products for advanced mobile displays and new CVD encapsulation systems for OLEDs. 
In FSG, the increased investments we made beginning in the second half of 2012 are starting to pay off by giving us memory share gains during a period of renewed memory investment. 
In calendar 2014, memory spending drove the growth of the Etch and CVD markets at a higher rate than overall WFE. We believe Applied's Etch and CVD businesses grew more than 50% combined in calendar 2014, which is 1.5x the rate of the Etch and CVD markets and over 2x the rate of our largest competitor in these areas. 
Our latest Etch platform is generating traction in foundry, as well as memory. We have a task force in place to drive our Etch gross margins to higher levels as we mature our new chamber technology and increase our scale. 
In foundry, our investment and advanced deposition techniques is enabling strong adoption of CVD cobalt for interconnects, and new Epi steps in emerging nodes. 
In Logic, we have nearly doubled the number of D2R wins in the past 2 years, which is a good leading indicator of share gains in next-generation transistors. And finally, over the last 2 years, we have tripled our corporate technology groups funding of disruptive new products and markets for our longer-term growth. 
In short, we are seeing strong early returns for our growth initiatives within FSG, Display and AGS that will allow us to grow revenues and profitability, particularly as our customers ramp new nodes into higher volumes. 
Next, I'll summarize our first quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 1% sequentially, with increases in FSG and EES, offsetting decreases in AGS and Display. 
Although AGS orders were down from our Q4 record, they were the second highest ever and up 16% from Q1 of 2014. Net sales of $2.4 billion were near the high end of our expectations. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $552 million were near the low end of guidance. As a reminder, many of our groups had a holiday shutdown during the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 was at the midpoint of our guidance. 
Operating cash flow of $60 million, reflecting high revenue from Display tools that were previously secured with cash in advance. 
In Q1, we also had annual incentive compensation and withholding tax payments. Absent the timing of these items, operating cash flow remains strong. 
Now I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. FSG orders of $1.4 billion were up 7%, with increases in memory, offsetting decreases in foundry and Logic. FSG net sales of $1.4 billion were slightly above the midpoint of our expectations. 
FSG non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 24.2%. AGS orders of $690 million were down 8% and remained at near-record levels. AGS net sales of $583 million were in line with our expectations and AGS non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1.7 points to 26.4%, reflecting favorable product mix. 
Display orders declined to $107 million, and we expect the booking pattern to remain lumpy. Display net sales of $275 million were up 45% as customers began to ramp the new TV capacity booked over the last 6 to 9 months. 
Display non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5%. EES orders grew slightly to $50 million and net sales of $55 million were below our expectations. EES both posted a small non-GAAP operating loss, and we continue to monitor the solar market closely. 
Now I'll provide our second quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to up a couple of points sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect FSG net sales to be up by about 4% to 8%. AGS net sales should be up by about 5% to 10%. We expect Display net sales to be approximately $160 million, and EES net sales should be approximately $75 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $570 million, plus or minus $10 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.30.

And then, Bob, I just wanted to ask about margins. You talked about the second half being stronger.

The biggest thing that's going on is mix for us within SSG. So SSG we're doing very well and gaining share in Etch, particularly in memory. So if you look at memory, I think over 50%, 52% of orders in the first couple of quarters are memory-related, which is a high point for us. And a lot of that drive is Etch and CVD. Etch, we're shipping new tools. Our C3 chamber is doing really well. So that's dragging margin a little bit and what we usually see as we see foundry picking up around a little stronger, a little sooner and the mix of tools there is a little better for us and the margins. So the mix is hurting us a little bit. We had some of this in the first -- early part of last year, but foundry picked up a little early last year. So it should go better in the second half but that's what's going on.",165,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Well, that's a question we talked a lot about, too. I'll tell you my opinion. Typically, it's first half loaded and last year, it was even a little earlier than previous years, in my opinion, because a leading foundry had the Apple business and they wanted to ramp very effectively. So things like our Epi tools, they took a little earlier even to make sure they're working well and they had a good ramp. This year, it's not clear how many -- when the cutover to FinFET devices are. So all the customers are saying they're going to ramp FinFET, spend a lot of money, but it looks like the ramp of that is a little later and part of that is also impacted by what is the relative rate of reuse of tools, too. So it was probably a little bit early last year and it seems a little bit later than the average this year.",158,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

If you look over the last couple of years, in Etch and conductor etch, we talked about 5 points of conductor etch share gain this year. We had 6 points of share gain last year in 2013. So we have really significant momentum. Certainly, memory is where we see the largest revenue now, but we also have traction outside of memory that provides an opportunity for growth going forward.

Nonesemi, I'll do solar first. On solar, we're managing that pretty darn well and the market, the end-used market for solar panels and solar cells is pretty good. But there still is an overhang of excess capacity out there that's being eaten up. So it's sort of a neutral market, it's treading water. And so it's just quarter-to-quarter variations on small numbers. In the Display market, our position has been very strong in Display. We've gained share, we've come up with new products, execution has been a very good and that market is made up of 2 primary customer types, Display equipment we sell for TVs and Display equipment we sell for smaller form factors like iPhone -- cell phones and pads, iPad-type things. So if you look at it, this year looks like bookings will be a little bit more swinging towards the smaller form factors. And so what we're doing is the build out of TVs which are helping revenues. So we've got really big bookings last year if you remember that was shipping those. This year, we think the bookings on TVs will be a little less, but the bigger -- the smaller form factors will be greater.

Now as a practical matter, the way we sell, most of our costs are in dollar-denominated and our revenues are fundamentally dollar-denominated. Now when we priced in Japan, we are somewhat competitive to Japanese competitors, but we largely price in dollars and translate that into yen and largely hedge the impact.

Certainly, this is the -- a major competitive battle for our customers and everybody is focused on -- as I said before, not just first generation but also second generation FinFET. So for us, when we -- I think one of the other callers, maybe it was Wes, I talked about announcements from customers, TSMC and Samsung being pretty bullish on CapEx. I think for us, the uncertainty, as you said, is around allocation. Where are those dollars going to go? They're going to go to one of those different companies and so there's still some uncertainty around that. I think that for all of these companies, this is a huge bet. This is the biggest change in terms of the transistor technology that we've seen in a very, very long time. So all of these companies are extremely focused. They're investing a lot also in technology so they can shorten their cycle between first generation and second generation and all of that is very good to us because, as we've said before, our total available market increases a significant amount and we're very leveraged around the transistor. Our businesses like Epi and PVD are extremely strong, implants, a number of different areas.

So it is true that there's reuse but for us, in our business, there's a huge opportunity for TAM growth.",90,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We don't really see a significant change in the CapEx spending in China. Actually, our position there is very, very strong. The leading foundry in China, we have a great relationship, our share there is very high. In general, foundry is an area where we have high share at all customers. But in China, we have a very, very good position, very good relationship. So if that spending would ramp, that would be a good thing for us.

So certainly, OLED ramping would be very good for our Display business. Overall -- there was a question earlier on Display. That group has really done an incredible job. They are gaining share in the market. And when we look at our model for the company, Display really is pretty much on model versus what we had discussed a couple of years ago. Growing share, really focused on how we help customers make these technology transitions from amorphous silicon to LTPS, metal oxide.

The biggest single swing for us within the SSG business is what tool types we ship. So Etch is -- we're gaining share and Etch, particularly in memory, we're getting more D2R positions, making progress in foundry and places like that. We get a lot of sales in Etch, high aspect ratio Etch and also all types of Etch steps and depositions steps seen in NAND and DRAM.

One of the things relative to the overall market, the overall wafer inspection business actually grew less than we had thought it would in 2014 and slower than the overall market growth. So that was a negative. Optical wafer inspection, as Bob said, we lost some share due to the customer mix in 2014. E-beam, where we have technology leadership, we actually gained share in e-beam review, about 15 points of share, we think, in e-beam review. We gained share in CD metrology and we think that e-beam inspection is also an opportunity for us.

But the timing for 3D NAND is later than what some people had expected. I think everyone is seeing very strong pull for 3D NAND. There's compelling pull from customers around the performance of the 3D NAND technology. And when you look at bit scaling over the longer term, that is the direction for every single one of our customers. There's a huge focus there and we -- although it's later than what we had expected, we start -- we see the second half of this year switch over in 3D NAND being more significant. And FinFET is also a great opportunity. It is the #1 competitive battleground for all of the foundry customers. And we certainly see that all of the customers will move to that technology.

In our second quarter of fiscal 2015, Applied delivered our highest quarterly revenue in the past 3 years and earnings near the top of our guidance range. These results reflect robust customer investment in both semiconductor and Display and most significantly, that Applied is delivering the enabling products and services our customers need as they transition complex new devices into volume production.
The magnitude of the technology change facing our customers is unprecedented and this creates incredible opportunities for Applied Materials, now and in the future.
Our core competencies and unmatched talent in materials engineering provide a great platform for profitable growth. Applied has a compelling strategy, we are investing in that strategy and making meaningful progress towards our goals.
The traction we are demonstrating is made possible by our employees' relentless focus on moving the company forward and their tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors.
Over the past few years, we have been driving significant changes across the company, strengthening our capabilities and processes while aligning the organization to take advantage of our best opportunities. We have aggressively shifted spending within the company to better support our customers, provide additional fuel for product development and improve our financial performance.
By increasing investment in key areas, we have created a pipeline of differentiated products that will accelerate Applied's growth, and we are already seeing a positive impact. Starting with our semiconductor equipment business, the trend is clear; we are winning market share. Over the past 2 years, we have increased our overall share in wafer fab equipment around 1.5 points. And based on our current view of customer spending, we expect to build on those gains this year.
Our traditional leadership businesses, where we have high share, remains strong. And in 2014, we added around 3 points of share in both PVD and FE. We have our strongest momentum in areas of the market that represent large growth opportunities for us.
Our combined revenues in CVD and etch were up over 50% year-over-year, significantly outgrowing the market. This past year, we gained 2 points of share in CVD, and we have highly-differentiated products in our pipeline that will expand our addressable market. We are very excited about how our new products are positioned, and we'll provide more details about our progress at our Analyst Meeting in July.
Since 2012, we gained 7 points of market share in etch, including 12 points in conductor etch. In the past 2 quarters, the install base for our latest generation etch system has grown from 10 chambers to more than 160.
This is one of the fastest adoption rates for any new Applied product and customers are telling us they see technical advantages in uniformity and defect performance. We believe our technical position is getting stronger, and this provides a foundation for future share gains.
We are also driving growth in our service business, where we delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue and we're on track for a record year. At both the leading and trailing edge, our customers face incredible challenges as they strive to bring new innovations to market faster and more efficiently.
By helping our customers solve their device performance, yield and cost challenges, we believe that service can be a meaningful component of our long-term growth. We have adapted our strategies, strengthened our team and are bringing together capabilities from across the company to deliver expanded service offerings that provide more value for our customers.
Service and spare parts revenues have grown more than 17% from this time last year. During this period, we have significantly increased the number of tools under service contract, which we believe is one indicator of our growth potential.
Turning to Display. We expect 2015 to be a third consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, and to increase our overall share by about 2 points. 
As we've highlighted before, our revenue and margin profiles in this business can be uneven. While we see some margin headwinds in 2016 due to customer mix and a weak yen, overall market trends remain positive. 
As the display industry introduces new technologies, customers' manufacturing processes are becoming more complex and capital-intensive. We have invested in a strong portfolio of products aimed at enabling next-generation TVs and mobile displays. One example of this is organic LED, which expands our served available market. We recently received a large order for our OLED encapsulation tool and in 2015, we expect to book about $200 million in this new application.
Overall, our growth trajectory in semi and Display is supported by a sustained period of industry investment in both capacity and technology. Even after recent customer announcements have been taken into account, we still believe 2015 wafer fab equipment investments will be up slightly over 2014, driven by increased memory spending.
Sustained NAND bit growth in the 35% to 40% range, similar to 2014, enables these customers to maintain their investment levels. We expect 3D NAND to represent more than 40% of NAND investment in calendar 2015, and installed capacity should exceed 120,000 wafer starts per month by year-end, which is only around 10% of total NAND capacity.
This inflection not only increases our available market, but is also enabling us to gain share. Based on the positions we have won, we believe that in the transition from planar to 3D NAND, we will increase our served market share by at least 5 points at these customers.
In DRAM, supply and demand remain well balanced, and we anticipate bit growth of 25% to 30%. We are expecting this to translate to an increase in customer spending of 15% to 25% relative to 2014. These investments are primarily focused on 20-nanometer upgrades for mobile DRAM with some capacity additions.
In foundry, the leaders are engaged in a fierce battle to ramp FinFET technology at the right yield and cost. The intense pressure for our customers to accelerate volume production of their FinFET devices is a major area of focus for Applied and creates a great growth opportunity over the next few years.
In summary, our customers are making incredible advances in technology, enabled by materials innovation and this plays directly to Applied's strengths. Across the company, we are making meaningful progress towards our growth goals and driving opportunities to accelerate our strategy.
Going forward, we are prioritizing 3 areas to further improve execution. First, we feel very positive about our new product pipeline and our ability to drive growth at Applied. In the near term, as we ramp these new products, we see some effects on our margins, particularly in cases where rapid adoption has exceeded our expectations. Bringing margin performance back in line with our financial model is a major company-wide focus. 
Second, we will continue to actively manage our product portfolio to ensure we are deploying our investments and resources towards our most promising growth opportunities. In the past 2 weeks, based on our view of future market potential, we have taken actions to further lower the breakeven level of our solar business. 
And third, we are taking additional steps to optimize our structure, making sure that the organization is aligned to major areas of value creation for our customers and that we have the right talent in the right areas.
Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional detail about these priority areas and our financial performance.",1239,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, May 14, 2015",2015-05-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4292.0,817983.0,35484131.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. I'll add my comments about how we're doing in the transition underway at Applied Materials. 
Gary talked about how we've moved money from headquarter functions and underperforming businesses to higher growth opportunities, notably in etch, CVD, Display and AGS. We've also strengthened the linkages between SSG and AGS for growth. SSG plus AGS revenue grew 20% in FY '14, and we expect both businesses to outpace WFE in 2015.
Focusing on the total life cycle of our products will increase both our revenue and profit growth. When excluding EES, Applied's trailing 4-quarter revenue was the highest in 7 years. 
Now let's look at profitability. You will recall that our non-GAAP gross margin was 40.9% in 2012, grew to 42.1% in 2013 and reached 44.1% in 2014 or 43.6% when excluding non-run rate items. Our progress was trending ahead of plan. This year, we faced some headwinds to the mix and the higher initial cost of fast ramping new products. In Q1, our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3% and in Q2, it increased to 43.2%, which was nearly 1 point better than our forecast. We expect gross margin to be flat to up a little in Q3. 
Looking ahead to FY '16, gross margin remains a key challenge to financial model performance. Within SSG, if we have similar demand in new product ramp pens [ph], we could experience gross margin headwinds in the first half. 
In Display, Gary mentioned some of the margin challenges associated with the strong mobile ramp along with yen-based competition. However, leaders throughout the company are intensely focused on gross margin improvement. Based on our gross margin initiatives, we believe we can achieve year-over-year improvement in fiscal year 2016, but we expect it to be below model performance for the year.
We are equally focused on managing our operating expenses. Quarterly non-GAAP OpEx should be around $575 million through the end of this year. We have a number of new products to launch, which require additional support, but we'll stay focused on our cost structures and continue to optimize our portfolio investments. Last week, we further reduced our solar spending and we will continue to monitor the market closely.
Looking to our overall model. We continue to believe that non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 is the right level of profitability for the company when WFE spending is at $33.5 billion. With the merger pending, we were unable to take certain actions, including share repurchases. 
Next, we will begin to buy back stock under our $3 billion -- 3-year $3 billion repurchase authorization. We plan to be opportunistic and we could execute the program in under 2 years.
As the buyback and other initiatives take hold, we believe that we are on a path to $1.70 in 2017, assuming WFE demand of $33.5 billion. We'll share our detailed model with you at the Analyst Meeting in July.
Now I'll summarize our second quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.5 billion were up 11%, led by SSG. Net sales of $2.4 billion were up 4%, which was above our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.2%, which was better than expected due to a favorable customer mix.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $579 million, in line with guidance. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.29 was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments and about $2.8 billion of this was offshore.
In SSG, orders of $1.7 billion were at a 3-year high and were up 19% on increases in foundry NAND. SSG net sales of $1.6 billion were up 8%, at the high end of our expectations. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin grew by almost 3 points to 26.8%, driven by higher volume and a favorable product mix. 
AGS orders of $641 million were down 7% sequentially due to a seasonal decline in service contract renewals. AGS orders were up 19% from the second quarter of 2014. AGS achieved record net sales of $646 million. The 11% increase was driven by growth in spares and services along with 200-millimeter equipment. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%.
Display orders increased slightly to $120 million, and net sales declined to $163 million as expected. Display non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 24.5% on lower volume. 
EES orders were $50 million and net sales grew to $73 million as expected. EES posted a non-GAAP operating loss of $4 million. 
Now we'll provide our third quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up 2% to 6% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be up 3% to 8% sequentially; AGS net sales should be up 2% to 7%; we expect Display net sales to be approximately flat; and EES net sales should be approximately $50 million.
We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35, which would be up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint.

That's helpful. And then if I could follow up, Gary. On the 3D NAND ramp, it really seems like that's gaining some incremental traction in the back half of this year. What is it that's finally making customers feel more comfortable to ramp the 3D NAND? Is it that yields are where they need to be? Is it that the opportunity in enterprise solid-state drives is bigger? Is it just the customers trying to make sure one doesn't get too far ahead of the other? What's really -- why are we starting to see this inflection because it's been kind of a while in the making?",107,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

The yield was certainly a big challenge. This is the biggest change in memory technology in decades, going from planar scaling to 3D. So that was a big, big challenge. All of the customers were focused on making the transition, as we had discussed before. But the yield is getting to the point where more volume is going towards 3D NAND. All the customers have been focused with heavy technology investments in that area, but more customers now are moving to that technology into manufacturing. So that certainly is a big transition. And what we said for Applied Materials is that the transition from planar to 3D NAND is really good for our business because planar is more litho-intensive and 3D NAND is more in the sweet spot of materials engineering types of technologies, etch, deposition, we have additional epi steps there. So we talked about the opportunity for us on an equivalent wafer start basis going up 35% to 50%. And what we're seeing, we are very optimistic more towards the top end of that range relative to the opportunity for us in growth. And the other aspect is not only is the TAM increasing, but we believe that we will increase, as I talked about in the script, our share of that TAM. So that's another incremental growth driver for us within Applied. So we see the 3D NAND ramping certainly in 2015. And then really, the majority of spending in NAND, in -- beyond '15, is really towards 3D NAND. We also said that capacity for 3D NAND is really 10% of total NAND capacity by the end of this year. So there's still opportunity as customers make that transition and really good tailwinds for us in terms of TAM and market share.",303,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

If you go look at the transition though at NAND, as Gary said earlier, the growth at 3D for a company like Applied is we said 35% to 50% increase in the greenfield. It's probably a little more even. And if you look at our share gains are about 5 points in that transition. So we gained 5 points of that TAM. So the transition from DRAM to NAND, 2D NAND is somewhat better for us.

Okay. All right. Then I guess to follow on to that, if you look at that element relative to your financial model, that seems to be the area where given where your revenue is, that's the line item that's sort of the most out of whack.

Yes, the model was a '16 model, so we actually see growth -- we actually see revenues growing next year. We think this year is probably a little under a $33 billion year for WFE. Next year, the model's a $33.5 billion, so WFE's a little better in that model. Second, we think our share will be up in WFE this year and next somewhat. And then we think AGS is showing good growth momentum. So -- and Display should be pretty good in revenues next year. So we think the revenues could be an uptick and approach the model next year. In terms of the biggest discrepancy, in my opinion, frankly, is a little bit the gross margins, right. 44.5% was the model. If you look at the document, it said 45%, but the math is 44.5%. We're up to 44.1% in fiscal '14. The quarter just ended, we're at 43.2%. We go up a little bit maybe the second half. But in the first half, if etch is heavy and there's a little bit of Display mix problems, we're not up. So I'd say the biggest delta is probably the gross margin line. If you look at expenses, we're at $575 million. If we hold at that line, which is what we're saying, then we'll be at $2.3 billion; the model's $2,228 million, so we're $72 million over, but a lot of that is related to all the new products coming out.

So let me talk a little bit about the model, Bob. Tim had asked this question earlier. In semi, we're very optimistic. We talked about the growth in our business as these new memory technologies are ramping into production and certainly in the FinFET first generation, 10-nanometer, that's a great opportunity for us with the products we have enabling those transitions. We gained 1.5 points over the last 2 years. We indicated we believe we'll gain share again this year. And as these transitions ramp, we're still in the early innings in terms of some of these transitions in the semiconductor area. So we're optimistic in that area. Display, we've -- I talked earlier today about 3 years of double-digit gains in revenue in the Display market. We have -- again, there are major technology transitions there. We talked about a new area where that generated $200 million in revenue, will generate $200 million in revenue this year. So again, we have some good growth opportunities in Display. And service, our service and spares was up 17% in our service and spares from last year, record revenue. So we have really good growth opportunities. So when you look at the model, the top line revenue growth, if you look at where we were when we published that model, to where we think we'll be, we're going to be in the range of that number for top line revenue growth, which was an incredible accomplishment versus what we said we would do. We still believe these opportunities are great opportunities for us. One of the things I also talked about was in etch, we went with a -- we're introducing a new chamber that customers are telling us technically has advantages in uniformity and defect performance. But as you're ramping these new -- many new areas simultaneously, we have great, great new products that are targeted at these inflection. There's going to be some margin pressure with start up in some of these areas and frankly, they're going even faster than we'd expected due to the pull from the customers. The key thing in any business is to have value, technical value and differentiation you're delivering to our customers. So our focus is to enable these inflections for our customers in semiconductor and Display. And in that process, we will drive market share higher and hopefully, the value for the customer with these differentiated products will also go up over time. As Bob had said earlier, in 2016, due to mix, we believe that the margins are going to be behind, but we are still driving to achieve those margin goals. The timing may be a little bit later than what we had talked about, but the momentum for the company relative to revenue growth is in the range of what we discussed when we published the model. And again, the margins are going to be off, as Bob talked about, but we are driving -- there are number of opportunities for us to drive to close and exceed that gap from a gross margin standpoint.",516,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Got it. And then, just as a follow-up along the same path. If I look at the SSG products, the one that has the biggest potential for share gain is conductor etch. But that also looks like it has probably a little bit lower gross margin. Would the conductor etch product, do you think, get to the same level as most of your other dominant products like PVD?

I mean certainly the share gains over the last couple of years have been pretty significant. Our business went from, I think, 2012 from $350 million to about $1 billion last year. So just dramatic gains in the etch business. We think over time, there's still a lot of upside potential and it really, as I said, comes back to how are you technically positioned in the markets. And there are some significant advantages that customers are seeing. It's in the early innings of that being validated with customers. But you really look for architectural advantages in your products where you can solve high-value problems for customers in these inflections.

If I look at the CapEx divided by the capacity, your CapEx per unit capacity it's kind of flat over last year and that's partly because the 20-nanometer demand wasn't strong and they're using more equipment. So my question is if I look at 10-nanometer, how should we think about that ratio of CapEx to capacity as you move to 10-nanometer for the equipment makers?",84,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I've heard some customers say that this is the most important node in the history of their company. So if you look really at where the pole is from an end-user perspective in terms of mobile devices, certainly, there is a lot of value. People are trying to pack more performance, more features and drive lower power for those devices. So 10-nanometer is a big battle for all of the different companies and there's tremendous focus there and the engagement with the customers are very deep and very broad. When we look at the opportunity for the CapEx, if you take equivalent number of wafer starts, it goes up a significant amount versus what we're looking at for the 16- and 14-nanometer node. I don't -- we'll talk more about this at SEMICON. But it is a great opportunity and there's a significant change in that device as the customers are ramping 10-nanometer. And we look at that being a great opportunity for us. In the transistor area, we have more epi steps, real strength in PVD, implant, a number of different areas, and then also the interconnect structures there will also change. So this, as we have said many times, is the sweet spot relative to materials engineering and we look at 10 being a really, really great opportunity to drive our business over the next few years.

If you want to look at sort of this capital intensity and reuse and nodal transitions, you have to look at 3 things, really. One is what's the relative capital intensity of the node; two, where are they in the transition to a node; and three, how big's the node? So what is worrisome to some people right now is, geez, they're getting a lot of reuse and is that not as good for you on capital intensity? I'm not actually too worried. If you look at the data, we think this year is probably a $33 billion year and if you adjust for foreign exchange, with the weaker yen and weaker euro, it's probably north of $33.5 billion. So the year is pretty good. Now look at what they're spending on. For 3 years in a row, '12, '13 -- '12 to '13, '13 to '14, and '14 to '15, the percentage of the spending that's going to companies like Applied -- actually, Applied has gone up as a percentage of the 100%. So this PME thing is really taking traction. Third, if you look at where they are in the nodal transition, 16 to 14, they're pretty early. 20 wasn't a big node and they're doing some reuse. But if you look at it, as they get later into the node, the percentage reuse probably goes down somewhat. And two, as Gary said, 10 is a big node. And if you look at the capital intensity, which we'll talk to you more about at the Analyst Day, it looks like 10 mix, again, plays for companies like us.

So that's translating into significant growth in our services and spares business what I talked about earlier, was 17% growth in service and spares year-over-year.

The point question that was asked earlier is can etch gross margins get to be where some of your higher product gross wins are? I think the answer is they can certainly improve from where they are. But even if you look at other etch companies in our industry, the overall etch gross margins aren't as high as some of our other high gross margin businesses -- higher share businesses. But what is very attractive about etch is a few things. One, if you look at our growth in operating profit since 2012 in etch, it's outstanding in terms of what's dropped through to the bottom line, it's very good. Second thing is if you look at etch in the aftermarket and we're focused more and more at the product -- total product life cycle profitability of a business, etch is probably the biggest opportunity because these tools, as Gary said many times, eat themselves.

So if you look at it, we're a little below where we want to be. We'll be up next year, we believe, in SSG in absolute gross margin percentages, but not as far up as we want. Now the reason we're not getting as far as we want is mostly mix. The reason we're improving in absolute dollars is within each product, we're doing better, okay. But the mix is still a little bit off, particularly in the first half. Within Display, again, it's a mix thing that's next year -- our business predominantly, for many years, has been driven by TV equipment. So we sell equipment to make TV panels or TV screens. Next year is a disproportionate number of sales of very high, I think the highest ever, and probably the highest we will have for the foreseeable future, sales of smaller screen sizes, which is somewhat mix -- different mix of tools, somewhat different mix of customers.

The -- so I think our position on EUV is consistent with what we've said in the past. We think it's post 10-nanometer, when you would start seeing any real volume on EUV. And so as we said, over the last -- over the next few years, the real big driver for us will be the 10-nanometer node and maybe the second generation of the 10-nanometer node. That we anticipate to be a big node, a real important competitive battle for our customers, and we'll talk more about this at SEMICON, but really a great driver for us from a TAM standpoint. EUV is out beyond that time frame, so it's out beyond the next few years. And then the other aspect is when EUV comes in, we believe that will also come in potentially with multiple patterning. So the time frame for EUV to really have any impact on our business is out there several years. So we don't see anything really near term.

The revenue growth, as I talked about earlier, we have a lot of momentum around these inflections in semiconductor and Display. And in semi, we gained 1.5 points over the last couple of years. We expect that we will gain share again this year. And as these new technologies ramp, we're still in the early innings in terms of the change in memory technology and the whole FinFET battle that is happening with our customers. So we're very optimistic based on the investments we've made and the -- our teams that -- we will continue our momentum in growing our share of WFE in the semiconductor business through those transitions. As I said earlier, in Display, 3 years of double-digit revenue gains in the Display business. So we have very good opportunities there. And also in Display, that market is undergoing significant changes from a technology standpoint, including this new area in OLED that we're ramping. So again, we have a lot of confidence in the growth longer term in our Display business. A great team, they're gaining share. And also, we're expanding our TAM with these new applications. So that part, we're very, very, very happy with the progress that we're making in all of the major parts of our business. The OpEx question, relative to the $575 million number, that -- where we're at right now, our #1 focus is that we want to capture these inflections with our products in semiconductor and Display and continue to grow the service business. And as I said earlier, we're pretty much on track for significant top line growth. If you looked at where we were at when we talked about the model versus the momentum that we have, we're in the range of what we talked about earlier for top line revenue growth. So as you said, it's really hard but I am very proud of this team that we have at Applied and what we've been able to accomplish and the momentum that we have in these different businesses. We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize the business. We moved hundreds of millions of dollars over the last couple of years into areas that will drive longer-term shareholder value. Bob talked about the action that we are taking in the solar business right now. There are probably more opportunities for us to continue to optimize the portfolio. Longer term, we will continue to look at structural changes that will lower our overall spending in the company and improve productivity.

And that's through material cost absorption. So the cost-reduction efforts across the whole company in terms of PPV are picking up reasonably, not heroically yet. We're getting better.

I think the VNAND thing is going to pick up momentum because I think you're going to see more and more go to 3D. Patterning doesn't play there. So in fact, if you look at the mix of etch, deposition plays particularly well for us. If you go to DRAM, patterning does play an increasing role there. I agree with that. Now if you look at DRAM, prices are down a little bit. So they are very driven by economics in that business. So the cost is getting a little higher to make those devices. So the patterning is positive for them, but the cost is an issue in the pricing. So I think the DRAM capacity adds will be moderate.",140,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

So that transition is really a good one for us. And the 10-nanometer transition, we believe, is a great opportunity. So those are going to be some of the major drivers for us over the next 2 or 3 years. And then we try to size the business relative to kind of a normal run rate on WFE.

I don't have this in front of me, Mahesh. Our take on it was the initial transition from planar to 3D, they get traditional type of bit growth that they get in the planar shrink. They get the bigger capital efficiency and bit growth going from first-generation to the second-generation 3D. Now what we used to run in models was a lot of 32 to 64, right. So at 32 to 64, you get over 100%, right, because you get the scaling and also the size -- I don't even know if the shrinks are 40-, 50-nanometer stuff.

But as I talked about earlier, our business is really, if we look at 2015, more heavily weighted towards the e-beam segment, where we have a lot of strength, really great technology. Those -- that segment of the market is growing fast. And we really see a great opportunity for us to leverage that strength in growing that part of the market. And the optical inspection area last year, certainly the mix of customers worked against us. But we recently had a really strong quarter relative to orders from a couple of large foundries.

At our recent analyst event at SEMICON West, we outlined how Applied Materials is focused on delivering profitable growth. Overall, the company is executing well, as seen in our third quarter results, where we delivered our highest quarterly earnings in the past 4 years, the highest service revenue in our history, and more than $2 billion of 300 millimeter semi-equipment orders, which is also a record.
While progress towards our strategic goals and financial model remains on track, changes in the business environment over the past few weeks have created some near-term headwinds. 
Looking at the market as a whole, we now see 2015 wafer fab equipment spending being approximately flat relative to 2014 with potential downside risk. The most substantial revision to our outlook is foundry spending, where we have lowered our estimates for the remainder of the calendar year. This is primarily due to customers managing excess inventory, improving their yields and reusing equipment. While we see a pause in capacity additions, the leading foundries are still aggressively pursuing 10-nanometer technology, and we expect this to become a key battleground in 2016 with the buildout of pilot production.
As we have discussed before, the 10-nanometer node expands the available market for Applied and plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses. With the majority of development tools selection already made, we are confident about our growth opportunities at this node.
In logic, we do not see any major changes to our previous outlook and the cadence of our development road map remains tightly aligned with our customers' needs. 
In memory, 2015 continues to be a year of strong investment. DRAM bit growth is in the 20% to 30% range, with supply and demand more or less balanced. We maintain our view that 2015 DRAM spending will be around 20% higher than last year, driven by 20-nanometer upgrades and some capacity additions.
Most significantly, we are increasingly optimistic about the pace of the transition from planar to 3D NAND. Our customers are telling us they are under significant pressure to ramp this technology faster because of its performance and reliability advantages. Consequently, we see the buildout of 3D broadening and accelerating.
We expect installed capacity will now surpass 150,000 wafer starts per month by the end of calendar 2015. While this number is higher than anticipated, at the start of the year, it only represents around 15% of total NAND capacity.
These are still the early phases of the buildout and as the adoption of 3D NAND speeds up, it will become a more meaningful driver of Applied's growth.
Our NAND orders were at an all-time high this quarter and we expect our combined and -- etch and CVD share at these customers to grow between 7 and 10 points during the 3D NAND inflection. 3D NAND is also enabling us to expand the available market for our epi products by between 5% to 10%. 
In Display, the shift to 4K TVs and larger average screen sizes is sustaining area growth in the 10% range, which supports ongoing investment in new TV capacity.
In mobility, our customers continue to invest in LTPS for high-resolution screens and the penetration of OLED displays is ahead of our prior forecast. We now believe that around 1 in 5 smartphones shipped in 2015 will use OLED technology.
Currently, mobility makes up a large part of industry investment and this spending mix is not as favorable for us. When combined with the weak yen, our Display business faces some margin pressures over the next few quarters, however, the overall market trends are positive, and we are on track to grow in line with our financial model.
As we discussed at SEMICON, the entire Applied organization is focused on delivering for our customers and shareholders. Our strategy and investments are aligned so that Applied is in the best position to address major materials innovation challenges in semiconductor and display.
We have developed a very strong product portfolio targeting key inflections and are demonstrating significant traction with new products. Our etch Sym3 chamber that we officially launched last month is one of the fastest ramping product in Applied's history. And by the end of our first quarter of 2016, we expect to have shipped around 450 chambers. This product is enabling us to grow our overall etch market share. And this year, we believe we are adding to the 7 points of gains we made between 2012 and 2014.
In the past few weeks, we secured major application wins in 3D and patterning, giving us increased confidence that we will continue to make gains in 2016.
We also have very strong poll for our Olympia ALD tool as customers are telling us that ALD film quality is one of their top issues for 10-nanometer device performance. We are expecting to ship more than 50 chambers by the end of our first quarter.
Our service business is also delivering profitable growth. Our AGS revenues were at record levels, again, this quarter and 2015 remains on track to be the biggest year in our history.
We have made some significant improvements to our service business and aligned our strategy to enable customer success. We have brought together capabilities from across the company so that we can deliver and capture more value with our service products.
We believe that this momentum is sustainable and service is a meaningful component of our long-term strategy for profitable growth. While we are maintaining investment in development programs that support our strategic priorities to increase share in wafer fab equipment, grow our service business and expand our total available market, we are equally focused on reducing operating cost and the complexity of our organization.
We recently made enhancements to Applied's structure that will enable us to accelerate those opportunities that are most critical to our growth. By aligning the organization around key areas of value creation, we are improving the way we collaborate with customers and speeding up the delivery of new products and services to meet key technology inflections.
In parallel, as we navigate the near-term industry environment, we remain highly focused on managing our expenses and financial performance. We are carefully prioritizing R&D investments, while reducing discretionary spending. 
To provide you with more details about the actions we are taking as well as our financial results and outlook, let me now hand the call over to Bob.",1071,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Aug 13, 2015",2015-08-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4303.0,859318.0,37019625.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining today's call. Applied delivered strong results in the third quarter, posting our highest revenue in the past 3 years. Over this period, we have repositioned the company to capitalize on key inflections in foundry, logic and memory and increased our share of WFE.
As Gary has already mentioned, our strong position in foundry will drive further growth when 10-nanometers ramps next year. I'll take a moment to summarize how the changes we've made to our strategy and investments have improved our position into today's memory-driven environment.
We expect memory spending to make up nearly 50% of WFE in 2015 compared to less than 25% in 2012. Over the same time frame, Applied's memory is on -- memory revenue is on track to grow by more than 150%. We are significantly outpacing the market and believe we are gaining 4 points of market share in both DRAM and NAND.
Within NAND, the 3D inflection is gaining momentum with a broader set of customers. Based on new product positions across the customer base, our share of 3D NAND spending is now approaching the high levels of share we have in foundry.
At the product level, our substantial investments in etch and CVD are having a positive impact on our results. This past quarter, we secured our second highest etch orders in the past 15 years as well as our highest CVD orders ever.
Importantly, through our strong engagements with customers, we have developed a deep pipeline of new and disruptive products to give us further opportunities for share gains and profitable growth as semiconductor and Display technology inflections play out over the next several years.
Now I'll comment on our third quarter results. Revenues of $2.5 billion were up 10% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 43.9% was slightly higher than expected and non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 was at the midpoint of our range.
We used $625 million to repurchase 32 million shares of stock, deploying more than 20% of our 3-year $3 billion buyback authorization in the first quarter of the program. We will continue to be opportunistic with the buyback. Including dividends, we returned nearly $750 million to shareholders. 
Next, I will make some comments on our segments. Silicon Systems orders of $2 billion were up 18% sequentially and set a record. This performance was led by strong 3D NAND momentum across multiple customers, notably in Japan, where revenue is recognized upon sign-up. Backlog was at an 8-year high, net of an $84 million reduction due mostly to an order cancellation in foundry. We also significantly reduced our Q4 foundry forecast.
AGS posted a second consecutive quarter of record revenue and remains on track for a record year. Display orders more than doubled sequentially, including a large order for our new CVD encapsulation tool for OLED displays.
Next, let me provide some additional insight into our gross margin and OpEx patterns. Over the past 2 years, we have made significant progress with our gross margins. But this year, we are experiencing headwinds due to mix effects and the higher initial cost of new products.
As Gary explained, overall WFE demand is trending lower versus earlier forecasts, with memory higher and foundry lower. We are seeing exceptionally strong pull for our semiconductor products. And in Display, our revenue mix is rapidly shifting to mobile.
Taking these factors into consideration, we are modeling Q4 non-GAAP gross margins to be down by about 2 points sequentially. We are driving actions to improve gross margins, particularly for our new products in high-growth markets.
We are also reducing our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx was $576 million in Q3. In Q4, we plan to reduce it to $555 million, plus or minus $10 million.
We took further actions in solar, where we discontinued our wafer saw and solar implant product lines, resulting in one-time charges of approximately $51 million in the third quarter. 
In summary, 2015 wafer fab equipment spending is trending lower than our prior expectations. Our focus on technology inflections and new products is producing revenue and share growth opportunities, notably in memory. But the demand mix presents gross margin challenges in the short term.
Over the model horizon, we expect the mix to return to levels that are more consistent with historical patterns and more favorable from a gross margin perspective. In the meantime, we are heavily focused on gross margin improvement and operating expense reductions.
Now I will provide the fourth quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 7% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect Silicon System net sales to be down 6% to 12%. AGS net sales should be approximately flat. We expect Display net sales to be up by 25% to 35% and EES net sales should be approximately $55 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.31.

So some of the orders we booked this quarter will trail into the next several quarters in terms of shipments and revenue recognition. So that's a little bit of a disconnect between our strong orders this quarter and the revenues which are a little less robust next quarter. But give you higher than typical backlog from this quarter that will sustain in the Q1, okay? The second thing in terms of what's our outlook. I'll give you my observations. I think there's a couple of different things going on. In VNAND, which I think more and more people are resonating, there's a lot of momentum around that for several reasons. One, there's more and more data that suggests that the VNAND flash device is a superior device in terms of performance. And then the second thing is you can't sustain a planar shrink effectively. So the push to go to VNAND is picking up momentum than anything. And the second aspect to that is that we -- that is particularly good for Applied on many levels. The first is that VNAND is much more deposition, etch, RTP, CMP and even some epi in terms of the 2D. The second thing is the tool mix is somewhat different, so the level of reuse for us is much less. So we actually do say, and I believe it's very accurate, and you're starting to see in the bookings, that the opportunity for Applied from the planar shrink mode, which was primarily reuse and most of the incremental CapEx might have been tilted toward lithography to a VNAND mode, where a lot of it isn't available for use. It's about a 3x revenue opportunity for Applied. So that's my outlook that, I think, VNAND, I'm sort of bullish on for a while, including next year. In terms of foundry, we are saying we're seeing a little softer, in fact. One of the significant reasons why our gross margins in Q4 are down and less than we expected even a couple of months ago was that the mix has changed on us. We're seeing strong memory, but we're not quite seeing the foundry we might have anticipated. And we have to scratch our own heads on that, because how does that tie to the outside world. What we're coming up with is that the things that have been talked about in the last couple of months in the outside world, that is customers are reusing equipment more effectively and efficiently, particularly as they bought a little conservatively to have very good ramps for their customers in the foundries in the last year or 2. That tool reuse is creating a little bit of slowdown at this point. And that doesn't mean we think it's not positive next year, but they're more effectively using those tools they've bought earlier in the cycle. And the second thing we read about and hear about, they're continuing to improve yields, continuing to improve -- tool utilizations is quite high, too. So what we see in foundry is, in our fourth quarter, it's less than we anticipated. And we even saw, as we mentioned in my notes, that we had about $8 million pushout of the foundry booking, right, or cancellation rather. Now what does that mean prospectively? We're not pessimistic on foundry at all. The question is when do they, a, get through this utilization -- full utilization of some of these tools? And two, how's 10-nanometer do? So we haven't spoken to November and December yet, but we are relatively positive actually on next year in 10-nanometer and for Applied specifically. The mix of tools at 10-nanometer are very positive. And we think we're -- I think we're about 20% to 30% bigger opportunity. And as we get through this reuse sort of gap, that should help us on our revenue, our share and our gross margins, frankly, but that's what we're getting through.",725,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

We, at the beginning, before we started the stock buyback plan, we put together a thoughtful -- I hate to call myself thoughtful, but I think it was thoughtful, the treasury department was, a matrix, and what you do is a buyback grid. And you say, at various stock prices, we will buy various dollar values per day. And that pricing grid has given a lot of analysis to long-term valuation of the company in terms of net present value, intrinsic value, short-term valuations versus multiples of earnings. And when you cross certain price points, you buy more stock back and we -- the stock went down this quarter and triggered more aggressive buyback. At the end of this quarter, we will revisit with our board, the price grid and the volume grid and will we reset it or not. You don't typically reset them a lot, because a lot of the valuation there is what do you think the intrinsic and long-term value of the enterprise is. So my guess is that our pricing grid, as it exists, gives us fair amount of flexibility to be aggressive the type of stock prices we're seeing, and I would lead -- I think that would naturally lead us to be opportunistic because we see long-term value of the company.",227,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

If you go look at secular versus cyclical, I think some of it is timing and some of it other people talked about, about how you -- you see our customers talking about, we're getting higher tool utilization, Samsung talked about earlier in the year, TSMC is starting to talk about that, higher tool utilization, more tool reuse. So that's across -- and even inventory in the channel, you see some data on that. So I think what you have right now is a problem in fully utilization, more efficient utilization of tools. Now I think they're getting through that. And you might argue could you have seen some of this? Maybe higher tool utilization, greater reuse of tools. It's hard for us to measure it because it factors with yield and all that stuff, which we have no insight to, right? So I think there's a good part of that, that is sort of the cyclical thing, this window we're in here. In terms of why do we see it and other people aren't talking about it? We are a month later, number one. Number two, if you do look at the mix of Applied tools, sometimes they're bought a little bit earlier and heavier in the cycle. For instance, our epi tools take a while to qualify, they're complex tools and customers bought a little heavier earlier. PV tools tend to be back end and connect a lot of that stuff. So these tools get bought a little bit earlier. And then if you look in tools like that, our share is very strong and our tools are enabling in those areas. So there's no share loss there. We're seeing some volumes down there, frankly.",288,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Now the good news is that as the memory business is ramping, also our share is up. Bob talked about this earlier, several points in memory. So that's helping us offset some of the weakness in the foundry business. But if you look at our leadership products, we talked about this at Investor Day, we're up 5% in the leadership products over the last couple years, launching some great new products in those areas. And so that combined with our momentum with the -- in the etch business, with the Sym3, highest-ever CVD orders, new ALD position, we look at our position for 10-nanometer and we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow share in foundry. Right now, the mix is working against us in terms of foundry versus the memory.

One is generally thought it was more memory-centric, one is thought it was more foundry logic centric. And if you look at it, the person was more memory-centric. Probably a month ago, saw a little bit better outlook than we did. The one who's foundry -- more foundry logic-centric are significantly less optimistic, I believe, outlook than we did. And because we repositioned the company, we're more closely towards the memory. Whereas if you look a couple of years ago, we're more closely to the foundry model. So I think, one, if you look at our peers and sort of say, what is our position in those? We're somewhere in the middle, but we've moved a lot more holistically towards our good representation of memory, too.

You have some indicators now, Jim, they're not too bad. I mean, this year people have said this year is kind of -- sort of different peoples said different numbers, but some people said 33 billion WFE. We haven't updated, but we're a little bit more conservative on that, frankly. And so if you look at that, we have record orders this quarter. I think in SSG, we're going to be close to a record for the year on orders semi. I don't know what will be exactly but they're pretty in d*** good shape. If you look at our service businesses, which implies we're servicing more tools, that's a record and Displays pretty good. And you talked mostly about semi, and if you look at share within products, it's up. If you look at WFE share the last couple of years, it's been up. So there are some existing indicators. And then as we said on Analyst Day, we have some product positioning stuff that's going out. Now a little bit of wind in our back. There's good foundry in the last couple of years. So I'll give you the math that it's in my head, if you look at the -- it's 7.7 or 7.8, whatever the number is, it's between 7.5 and 8 for both DRAM and NAND this year WFE. We've kind of gained over 4 points on each, I think. And so if you take 4 points x $8 billion, that's about $320 million each that if we had reposition ourselves would be short $640 million there. Two years ago, with $2 billion in semi services, I mean, AGS, next year will be close to $2.6 billion, and couple of hundred that's positioning. So I think through repositioning the company and the products we have in the pipeline, you can see more robust revenues of arguably -- with this mix of probably $600 million, $700 million, $900 million.",337,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Thanks for the question. So 3D NAND as we've talked about before is really more materials enabled than less-so-enabled scaling. So if you look at the CapEx that is necessary for them to ramp those devices, it's very heavily weighted towards CVD, etch, also we have epi there for the first time in memory, where we have a very strong position. So as the customers are ramping, those 3D NAND factories, the area that are growing are the areas where we are gaining share. That's part of what Bob talked about earlier, where he said we're gaining several points of share in 3D NAND. And if we look at the products that we're introducing, the Sym3, etch, the record CVD orders, the -- again, a number of our products are very well-positioned as the customers ramp 3D NAND spending. So we believe that 3D NAND is at about 15% of the total NAND capacity. We believe that, that is going to continue to ramp in 2016 as a percentage of total spending. And we're in a very, very, very strong position there. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add any -- add anything?",211,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

I think the big inflection that's gone on the industry right now with 3D NAND is going on for years. It's about 1.3 million wafers out there. It's about 150 by the end of this year that are done. I think that's a bigger inflection than DRAM. Within DRAM, we're a little bit more bullish than somebody like Dataquest. We see that they didn't really add that much capacity this year. If you look at die sizes, they're bigger. If you look at more process steps so that -- they really didn't add that much capacity this year. So a little bit more bullish than some of the outside folks on total DRAM spending next year.

It could be up to 1 point for the company and what's going on there is, historically, for many years, 80% -- and even a few years ago, 90% of our business in Display was for TVs, equipment for making displays for TVs. We project that next year over 50% will be for small screens, your cell phones and stuff. So the good news is if you go back a few years ago, if TVs have turned down like this, we'd be losing a lot of money in Display because there would be no revenues. In fact, we think revenues will be pretty strong next year in Display because over 50% of our business will be small screen sizes. And that we are growing the TAM there, growing over -- this is the third year in a row of growing Display revenues. So next year with the TV downturn, we're still pretty d*** healthy. So the issue is gross margins there. So if you look at that, we're penetrating some new products and some new markets and some of our competition is Japanese yen based. So the Display thing is bad probably through that first couple of quarters of fiscal '16, but it gets a little better each quarter and then we pick it up. And that's when our mix gets more normal, we start to get some TV business back and the product mix changes a little bit. It's about 1 point now.

A company like Applied Materials and our peers predominantly are product conscious materials, stuff we buy. So we don't get this big absorption boost or downtick either with volume. So our gross margins are predominantly a function of mix, mix between customers, mix between products.

You can see we're selling a lot more into the small-screen sizes a little bit more in PVD, for instance, than CVD. So it's definitely mix in there. Now does it make it a little worse that our competitors are Japanese? Maybe, but mix is the biggest single delta in there. The second issue is semi where you hear more contrarian views from other people. So I went through -- the biggest delta is mix between some of our higher gross margin products are PVD, epi and inspection, right? And so some of the lower ones for us are etch. So you could see the mix is more weighted towards foundry for the first. And for the etch, it's more weighted towards memory. And you see the foundry memory mix happening so you know we're getting a bigger mix. So then you'll drill into me and say, well, are you being hypercompetitive on etch for instance? So I went through by deal what we've been doing in etch cost, pricing and our prices were -- our peers -- our competitors were very much the same type of prices, arguably higher. So what we got there is a cost issue, right, and a mix issue. Our competitors have a different mix of products and frankly, more mature products. So we have to do is get cost out in our products and start to get the mix across all of our products. So the road map for us is, let's get some more normal level of mix between memory and foundry. And particularly within foundry, let's get the normal level of things like epi, PVD, inspection, and then with etch, let's get our cost down and continue to get costs down and configurations down.",362,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

And then, I guess, really for you, Gary. This is a big picture question but it really is about your thought process around really shaking things up a little bit. The stock has certainly underperformed. If you look at the next worse peer, it's underperformed the next worse peer by a 1,000 basis points over the past 6 months. I know that -- much of that is due to the failed merger and -- but you sort of can't be happy with that. So I guess my question is about really shaking things up, maybe cleaving off some of the businesses, maybe pulling in the buyback, maybe getting out of some big markets you're in that are not as high margin. Really a question around your thought process are on that because the stock has significantly underperformed, I think, even your expectations.",143,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

So if you look at the way we structure the organization, the way we move the investment within the company in patterning, for instance, in etch and CVD, we've got the highest CVD orders ever in the history of the company. Etch, second highest orders in the history of the company this last quarter and our memory share is increasing. So if we look at each of these different markets, and really try to figure out like you talked about what moves the needle? Where are we going to invest? How are we going to structure the company around those inflections so that we're positioned when those new devices ramp? So patterning, again, tremendous momentum there. We talked about the 450 Sym3 chambers. It's really from -- in 5-quarter period of time, we're going from 18 chambers in the field to 450. And you asked the question about the margins relative to buying market share. We're winning in critical applications with a higher price than the competitors. In many the cases, where Bob and I went through the analysis. So there are some real technical advantages of those products that, again, we went through some of those at SEMICON. So it's focusing in this patterning inflection, focusing around the transistor and interconnect area as 10-nanometer ramp -- 10-nanometer technologies ramp, we're in a very, very strong DTOR [ph] positions. In service, we also made a number of changes there to really drive higher value and lower cost in our service business. And we believe that these inflections happen for our customers, these are tough inflections, they have to ramp quickly, get to the high-yield fast and so that's another area that we focus on where we've seen hundreds of millions of dollars in growth and we really believe that, that's another area where we fundamentally repositioned the company for more sustainable growth going forward into the future. And then as Bob talked about in Display, a few hundred million dollars of growth there, expanding as our customers move into some of these new technologies like OLED within film encapsulation. So we believe all of those areas are fundamentally stronger than where we've been in the past around all of those different segments of the business. Now the other thing that we did is we cut $400 million of OpEx. We cut G&A by about 25%. We've cut many areas that were low performing. We continue to look for those areas. We talked about some other businesses that we're ramping down right now and we will continue to look for those lower-performing businesses. Anything that we don't see that is going to be a good return and generate somewhere around at least the 20% operating profit, we have 0 bias about being in those businesses. So from a top-level standpoint, we've moved the money, we've structured the company around the areas that we believe will move the needle for Applied and for our customers. And the model that we presented at SEMICON, the $2 model, we believe we're on track. If you look at the indicators around the major areas of our business, we are gaining share. Now the mix in the near term, you look at that long-term model but the mix in the near term, the foundry versus memory, mobility versus TV, those are things that are headwinds for us, but fundamentally, we're in a much better position and confident that we're going to achieve that model.",604,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

We think some of the weakness we're seeing towards the end of this year is this tool reuse, increasing yields and absorption of the capacity they have. As they go in foundries, in particular, because memory is pretty strong. I mean, DRAM was strong in the beginning of the year. We're more bullish than your average outside guide for next year DRAM and NAND. I don't think anyone is too pessimistic right now. We're pretty optimistic actually. So it's kind of in discussion, foundry spending and timing, right? So if you go look at it, we believe that, and listening to our customers, 10-nanometer is going to be a pretty big spend year for them next year. So the rough mathematics is that if you look at node to node, sort of this 32, 28 versus 20, 16, 14 versus sort of 10, wafer starts might be down a little bit, maybe 10% per bunch [ph] but capital intensity per node is up about 20%, so the volume versus capital intensity is still not bad. I think the problem we have right now is we get this reuse. Now the other thing you have to go look at is all the macro stuff is beyond my pay grade, right? What's going to happen in China or in phone, next to Apple phone, I don't know that stuff. But in a reasonable demand environment, the increasing capital intensity and the importance of 10-nanometer to our customers and the fact they're absorbing the tools at this point means probably okay.",269,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

If you look at the point, the share gain that we have in both DRAM and flash, that's helping us offset some of the near-term weakness in foundry. So for us to hit the financial model, you have to believe that the mix comes back to some normal relationship between the foundry and the memory. And we think that's going to happen but certainly, if you look at our position in epi, PVD, implant, thermal products, CMP, you have to have a more normal mix that we've seen over the last few years for that part of our product portfolio to work.

The model we put up in July of '13 was at $2.228 billion actually in fiscal '16. We trended up over that a little bit in the last year or so, so that our run rate last quarter was like $579 million. So it was above the $2.3 billion or something like that. So we're a little bit above that because we have 1 more year of inflation. And what we've done is we've -- and part of the reason we're a little bit above those companies, one, you're tied up in the merger, certain things you couldn't address, and we have a lot of products come out of the pipeline right now. But we've engaged more brighter microscope on OpEx. So next quarter, we're at $555 million, and we're working to get down our OpEx back to the original number we guided for '16 which was the $2.228 billion.

And then we get to bigger issue, the extras, if it's yielding well and then a lot of tape-outs and extra sales.

If you look at the demand side, PC is declining year-over-year, smartphones is kind of peaking [ph] out. And now Moore's Law seems to be pushing out, which I'm curious about your view there. How should we think about the WFE spending growth going forward over the next few years rather than just next year? And is it just the spending being spread over a longer period of time?",83,1.0,8.0,0.5555555555555556,0.8

Let's segment the market. WFE -- 3D NAND we're pretty bullish on actually because this is a technology transition which were more akin to wafer-size transition because they have to switch from 2D to 3D for both device performance and how -- you can't keep shrinking, right? 8 electrons of the cell, it can't get any smaller, right? And so you can't, effectively. So they're going to go to 3D. It's like 300-millimeter. Your new customers going to go. It's just timing. So they sort of waited a year or 2, but it's happening. You can see the numbers going up rapidly, and everybody's says it. So I think of anything, you've got a solid baseline of predictable spending that's pretty healthy in 3D NAND for a number of years. On DRAM, we're a little bit more optimistic than some of the other folks because the things that are helping you there is the number of layers, capital intensity is picking up for greenfield, number one. Number two, the die size on average are getting bigger particularly on mobile dies and DRAM bit growth is pretty good, right? So I think DRAM is okay, right? Logic might be in the other thing helping DRAM in memory, in general. So the whole data center, Big Data, cloud stuff is definitely a positive, definitely, okay? Now let's go to logic. Logic hasn't been high growth for a while. It's mostly driven by PCs and for Applied it isn't that big either. So that one we don't think about it every single day because it hasn't been that volatile in the last few years. So then you go to foundry. Foundry, the big driver of foundry tends to be mobile devices and mobile devices have had very good growth, many people continue to believe they were pretty good. If they're pretty good, you're in good shape because capital intensity continues to go up. As we said, it's 20% to 30% going from 16, 14 to 10. So if you get pretty good consumption of mobile devices or related things like that, and even some of these Internet of Things stuff is picking up, frankly, then you get healthy foundry demand. So the one that these particular quarter is a little bit we're a little surprised on for next quarter in the foundry. But it doesn't mean we don't feel good about foundry fundamentals, given the capital intensity and user demand we think is good. So I think it's okay.",424,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

My follow-up question is a little more near term. You've talked about gaining 4 points of share in DRAM, which is great. And you also mentioned you expect DRAM orders will come to -- it can be lower in the second half versus first half, which we are seeing. What are your thoughts right now as it relates to when DRAM orders will start to grow again, especially in light of an oversupply situation this year?

I've got a fancy PowerPoint around here that shows me that. And so if you look at DRAM this year, it was more -- it was like 55-45 on the calendar year for us. So it's more heavily weighted to the first half. We think DRAM next year, we're not as pessimistic as others, we think it's probably down, but not down a lot, maybe just down 10%, who the h*** knows. But that's kind of where I'm leaning. In terms of timing next year, I have a little less visibility on that.",103,3.0,5.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5

So if you go look at with the new tool, I'll do the last one first, inflation warranty cost tends to run higher, so we can reduce that, number one. The second thing is the chamber, which we've ramped really aggressively even at Analyst Day, we said we're going to go from year ago, 5 chambers a quarter or something to hundreds of chambers and we said by the end of this calendar year at Analyst Day we'd beat the 300. I don't know if you picked up on the script. I think Gary said by the end of fiscal Q1, which is 1 month later, January or so, like 450 or something like that. So that chamber is ramping super aggressively. So that's an opportunity to reduce cost and many times you have 6 chambers on a tool, so 6 of those. So we'll work on that. And the other thing even the wafer handling equipment is probably an opportunity with the platform there. So it's installation warranty, it's burden and absorption with volume which some will come relatively naturally and then there's material cost reduction around both the chamber and the handling systems. And then also the other thing is configuration management. Can we have a little less heavily configured tools.",232,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

We're taking out costs, material costs and overhead and installation warranty. I have to admit that the shift in mix in the current quarter surprised me a little bit. So we're not being passive, we're pushing it hard. It just -- it kind of came 1 quarter earlier than we expected, to be honest with you. And the other thing I'll say to you, so the good news -- the gross margins, we definitely are committed to get them up. We definitely believe we should have higher gross margins, no doubt about it. Gary and I rail about this every day, basically. The glass is half-full on this thing. If you look at it, we've gained over 4 points of share in DRAM, over 4 points of share in NAND. We've gained -- expanded our TAM or SAM and Display by 50% and we've expanded our service SAM and revenues and service quite a bit. If we haven't done those things, you wouldn't be talking about gross margins being down 2 points. You'd be talking about over $1 billion less of revenues probably this year. And even the revenues if you don't like the gross margins, those are probably incremental operating margins of 30% or so, you'd be talking about a $300 million hole in profit. So we're spectacularly unhappy with our gross margins. I don't disagree. But it could have been a lot worse if we haven't penetrated these markets, gained share and got some new products out there. You would have had a sustainable problem of $300 million of property here, frankly. And if you look at the etch business for instance, where we don't like the gross margins, believe it or not, the one business where our operating margin delta from 2012 to today is greatest, is probably etch, all right? Because we've scaled up so much volume at pretty good operating margins. So we are spectacular and happy about the gross margins. But if we haven't gotten this stuff out and reposition the stuff, it would be an even worse call today. So that's my answer.",357,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

As this is our fiscal year-end call, I'd like to start by outlining the progress we are making towards our longer-term strategic and performance goals. I will then provide our market outlook and describe how this translates to opportunities and priorities for our business groups. 
Later in the call, Bob will give you additional color on our financial results and talk about how we are optimizing the company's performance and shareholder returns. Applied Materials' strategy is built upon our leadership in materials engineering. Our foundational capabilities are the broadest and deepest in the industry. We have more tools in our toolbox to help our customers address their most critical, technical challenges. 
Across the company, we are driving profitable growth by targeting major technology inflections and introducing new, differentiated enabling products and services for our customers. As a result, we are winning market share, growing our service business and expanding our available opportunities. 
In fiscal 2015, we grew revenues 6% year-on-year and delivered our highest operating profits in 4 years. And while it's too early to talk about specifics for the calendar year, we are confident that we have made sustainable share gains in both wafer fab equipment and Display. 
Investments we have been making in R&D and field technical capabilities are yielding results. This year, we released breakthrough new product platforms to address rapidly growing opportunities in etch, atomic layer deposition and selective materials removal. 
At the same time, we have made the company more agile and efficient by optimizing the organization, business processes and product portfolio. These changes allow us to fuel our growth programs while maintaining our operating expenses at approximately the same run rate we had in 2012. 
At the start of the year, industry forecasts expected 2015 wafer fab equipment to be up 5% to 10% year-on-year. Our latest estimate is that wafer fab equipment spending will be more or less flat relative to 2014. As the year progressed, the biggest change was foundry spending. We anticipate that calendar 2015 will represent the lowest spending levels by these customers in the past 4 years. 
While Applied has our most favorable share positions at the foundries, we have introduced products to strengthen our position in memory and continue to get stronger in this market. In the past 2 years, we believe we've increased our share of total DRAM wafer fab equipment spending by about 5 points. We also expect to increase our share of total NAND spending by approximately 5 points in the transition from planar to second-generation 3D NAND. 
Overall, 2015 is a year of very strong memory investments with the highest level of spending by these customers in 7 years. As we look ahead, we expect DRAM bit demand to be in the 25% to 30% range and investment levels in 2016 to be down significantly. 
In NAND, we believe next year's demand bit growth will be around 35% to 40%. And 2016 investment will be up year-on-year. We expect around 80% of spending to be focused on 3D NAND as all the major memory customers ramp this technology into volume production. 
In foundry, we anticipate investment levels will be slightly higher in 2016, with the bulk of spending in the second half of the year. We believe more than 50% of this spending will be focused on ramping 10-nanometer technology. 
In logic, we expect investment levels to be reasonably stable year-on-year. Overall, we currently see 2016 wafer fab equipment spending being approximately flat with some potential upside. 
Having provided this backdrop, I will now outline the progress and priorities for each of our major businesses. 
In semiconductor equipment, we delivered our highest annual revenue in 8 years, as major changes in device technology continue to expand our opportunities and provide a catalyst for market share gains. 
We have very strong momentum in our largest growth businesses, etch and CVD, and still have significant room to grow. In fiscal 2015, our etch revenues exceeded $1.1 billion, an 8-year record. And we generated our highest CVD revenues in 4 years. Combined, our etch and CVD revenues are up significantly year-on-year. And we continue to see very strong customer pull for our new products. 
At the start of 2015, we targeted 25 new applications as part of our growth plan. By the end of our fourth quarter, we have won 49 new applications. 
In our transistor and interconnect businesses, where we maintain strong leadership positions, we secured new applications wins at 10-nanometer that will enable us to increase our share of the available market as customers build out this node. At 10-nanometer, customers are making significant changes to interconnect technology to improve device performance and power consumption. We will be officially releasing new products to address advanced interconnect applications early in the new year. 
In addition, we are benefiting from new epi, thermal and implant steps in memory that expand our market. We also have a significant opportunity to grow in CMP, as the number of CMP steps double in the planar to 3D NAND inflection. This quarter, we shipped the 100 units of our latest-generation CMP tool, the LK Prime. The success of this product helped our CMP group post its highest annual revenues since 2011. 
In process diagnostics and control, we recently released UVision 7, a new version of our brightfield inspection tool. This is another area where we see strong pull from customers and believe we're on track for share gains in brightfield this year. 
We have also been investing in a new e-beam inspection platform. And this quarter, we posted our first revenue from both foundry and memory customers. 
In service, 2015 revenues represent an all-time record for the company. Our team in AGS has done a remarkable job to place this business on a trajectory of profitable growth. Over the past 2 years, we have aligned our service strategy to enable our customers' success while making significant enhancements to the organization, processes and operations that together, are enabling us to deliver and capture more value with our service products. We believe that our growth momentum in service is sustainable, and our fourth quarter orders represented another all-time record. 
In Display, 2015 was the third consecutive year of growth. As the display industry introduces new technologies for both TV and mobile applications, customers' manufacturing processes are becoming more complex and our market opportunity is expanding. 
As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, one of the key battlegrounds will be for OLED leadership. As this inflection plays out, Applied is in a great position to benefit with new enabling products, including our thin film encapsulation system. 
To summarize, in fiscal 2015, Applied Materials delivered solid growth and moved the ball forward towards our long-term strategic and financial goals. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the world for their tremendous contributions over the past 12 months. 
As we look ahead, we feel very good about our strategy, our customer positions and our product pipeline. Across the company, we remain laser-focused on delivering, delivering the enabling products our customers need to be successful and delivering attractive returns for our shareholders. 
To achieve our goals, we are aggressively driving our growth programs, making the company more efficient and effective and carefully managing expenses. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our results, performance and priorities. Bob?",1239,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2015",2015-11-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3606.0,903016.0,38628313.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I will start by outlining the progress we made in 2015. We remain focused on investing growth opportunities, increasing profitability and delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders. 
First, growth. For the year, our total orders grew by 5% to the highest level in 15 years when excluding solar. We grew our revenues by 6%. As compared to 2013, our revenues were up 29%. Our Silicon Systems orders and revenues were the highest since 2007. Revenues grew by 3% in 2015, building on a 25% gain in 2014. 
2015 has been a very strong year for memory spending and Applied made significant progress. Our strong position in 3D NAND gave us further growth in etch and CVD. Combined, these businesses were up 23% for the year and have doubled since 2013. Gary mentioned that our etch revenues exceeded $1.1 billion for the year, and they were up 140% versus 2013. 
Our transistor and interconnect product lines maintained their leadership positions in 2015. And we expect the strength of these businesses to become more evident when foundry spending resumes later in our fiscal year. 
Applied Global Services revenues grew 15% in the year, with continued momentum in comprehensive service contracts, as well as 200-millimeter equipment demand. And Display revenues grew 27%, reflecting the success of new products such as thin film encapsulation and PVD for mobile displays that are expanding our addressable market. 
Next, profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin declined 1.2 points in 2015 or about 0.7 points when excluding the non-run rate items that we reported in 2014. Operating margin remained at 19.6% for the year as revenue growth and spending discipline offset the gross margin decline. We made further progress in our tax structure and achieved a full year tax rate of 19.3%, which was down by 13 points over the last 5 years. 
Earnings per share of $1.19 were our highest in 4 years and the highest in 8 years when excluding solar. 
Now cash returns. Total shareholder returns from buybacks and dividends for the year grew to $1.8 billion, which was nearly 200% of free cash flow. In Q3 and Q4, we deployed 44% of our 3-year, $3 billion buyback authorization. We used $1.3 billion to repurchase 76 million shares, reducing our ending share count by 6% during the period. 
We also completed a $1.8 billion debt offering in September in an attractive interest rate environment. The offering was very well received and provides low cost capital to support increased financial flexibility for investments and capital returns. We also added $800 million of short-term debt to facilitate the efficient return of capital from one of our offshore entities. This debt is expected to be repaid within the current quarter. 
Next, I'll make a few comments about the fourth quarter. Our overall results were at the midpoint of guidance. Revenues declined 5% sequentially but grew 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.2% was modestly above our expectations and operating expenses were $11 million below the midpoint of guidance. We used $700 million to repurchase 44 million shares of our stock at an average price of $15.78. 
Turning to the segments. Silicon Systems orders were up 8% over the year. Orders declined sequentially following an all-time group record in Q3. And backlog remained strong at $1.7 billion. AGS orders of $761 million were up 2% year-over-year and set another all-time quarterly record. Revenues were below the midpoint of our expectation as 200-millimeter equipment sales were slightly lower than expected. 
Display orders were up 50% year-over-year. As expected, Display operating margins declined to 10%, reflecting a high mix of mobile products along with investments in new products that should significantly increase our addressable market and revenues. EES orders and revenues remained weak and we continue to reduce our exposure to solar. 
Now let me talk about our priorities for the year ahead. As Gary discussed, we expect 2016 to be another year of healthy demand across Silicon Systems, services and Display. In Silicon Systems, our early expectations are that demand should be higher in the second half of our fiscal year, particularly within foundry. Throughout the company, we are focused on making further progress toward our longer-term financial model. 
On the revenue line, our outlook for overall demand, market share and served market expansion is positive. Gross margin improvement is a top priority for the company. We expect improvements in our second half, driven by 3 factors: First, we expect a more favorable mix, including higher foundry demand in Silicon Systems and stronger TV demand in Display; second, we have line of sight to cost reductions for fast ramping new products; third, we are making progress on our materials cost reduction. 
For operating expenses, we are performing better than our model. Our focus is to maintain spending discipline and to fund growth initiatives using identified savings and portfolio rationalization. For the tax rate, we expect to make incremental progress towards the model. And we will continue to be opportunistic with the stock buyback program to reduce the share count.
Now I will provide the business outlook for our first quarter, which includes 14 weeks of operations. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect our overall sales to be down 2% to 9% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect Silicon System sales to be down 7% to 13%. AGS sales should be roughly flat. We expect Display sales to be up 5% to 15%. And EES sales should be approximately $50 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million, plus or minus $10 million. This includes 2 weeks of scheduled holiday shutdown, partially offset by the extra week in the quarter. 
Given we recently raised debt, we expect our quarterly interest expense to increase to approximately $38 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.27. 
In summary, Applied delivered another year of growth in orders, revenues and profitability. The investments we have made are resulting in share gains and a strong pipeline of new products aimed at key market inflections with strong customer pull. We are increasing our profitability in providing attractive cash returns to our shareholders.

Be happy to. Let me give you a little color on the mix issue because we've talked about it a lot. If you go look at the WFE mix the last several years, for the 3-year average from '12 to '14, foundry spending was about almost 44% of the WFE mix. If you go look at DRAM, it was about 14.5% and NAND was about 17.7%. If you go look at this year, foundry was about 34.5%, DRAM was up to 25.1%, and NAND is about 23.5%. We think foundry goes up as a percentage of the mix next year and NAND goes up. Now, foundry is our highest percentage of WFE. And NAND, which is to trail, is approaching at the 3D inflection, our share for foundry. So those 2 stronger relative spending areas we see next year are foundry and especially NAND around VNAND where we say it's over 80% of the NAND spending next year. So if you trail it down, we see gross margin and revenue opportunities for us, share opportunities and gross margin improvement opportunities. Now, we see those more in the second half because we think foundry is heavy in the second half, particularly around the 10-nanometer inflection. We think NAND is strong, but a little stronger in the second half. DRAM could go 50-50 split and logic could be pretty even. So that if you look at the quarters and year, and I'm going to get to your specific question, CJ, but to give you context, I thought this would be helpful, we're assuming that our Q2 revenues and gross margins will be similar to Q1 with pickup in the second half. And in the second half, we see a booster for our revenues and our gross margins. In the gross margins, the opportunity for the company to improve are -- we could go up quarter-on-quarter, half-on-half. We could go up. There's a lot of mix issues there, but the opportunity's a couple of points, half-on-half.",334,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

We've got a great team and great capability there, very strong customer relationships and very strong share positions with Chinese companies and the multinational companies that are in China. There are a number of projects that people are talking about and there's certainly going to be some incremental wafer fab equipment spending in '16. I don't know that we want to give a specific number right now, but I would say there are a lot of projects that are in the pipeline. And that could be from a strategic investment standpoint additive for wafer fab equipment. And our share there, Bob talked about our share in foundry, our sure in China is very, very, very strong.

We like our strategy. As I've talked about on the call and also Bob's talked about, we have a very strong position in transistor and interconnect when foundry ramps. And Bob talked about that being in the second half of calendar '16. We have strong customer pull for etch, deposition and inspection, very, very strong customer pull. We're growing the service business, significant opportunity to grow our Display CAM 2x, 3x above where we're at right now. Great alignment and pull from customers for our R&D pipeline. So we're very focused on our opportunities. Bottom line, we're winning inflections. We have a good position to grow as our customers move to next-generation technologies in semi and Display. Regarding Applied M&A, really nothing has changed relative to our strategy. We're very selective in the opportunities that we look for. There are really 3 criteria that are the same that we talked about before, financial returns, strategic alignment, leadership in whatever segment the company is participating in. So those are the things that we look for. The hurdle for us is very high. Obviously, we can't talk about anything that we're specifically looking at from an M&A standpoint.

Foundry is down a significant amount relative to the mix. And if you look out our position in transistor and interconnect when foundry ramps, that is a real strength and really a unique strength for Applied Materials; epi, PVD, implants, CMP, RTP, all of those areas are very strong leadership positions for Applied. The incremental profitability as that CapEx increases, there's a lot of drop through to the bottom line. So the mix this year of memory versus foundry is different than what we've seen over the last few years. So when foundry comes back, we're in a better position than any company, really, relative to the incremental profitability. The other thing on the foundry is that at 10-nanometer, different than 16-nanometer, there are big changes in terms of the device architecture. Interconnect is growing a significant amount. And our share and number of steps will grow as those devices ramp. So that's one that's a big driver for us when the mix comes back. We've talked about the products that we've introduced, the really tremendous momentum we have in etch, the CVD, ALD, these areas are growing for us at a very high rate. And I still think we're in the early innings relative to the pull that we have from customers. You're going to continue to see growth in those areas as we go forward. And as Bob talked about, our memory position has increased significantly. So as the customers are ramping the 3D NAND technology, that puts us in a good position. We're growing the service business and we believe it's sustainable growth in service. And as our customers move to new technologies and displays, that's another area where they're adding steps, deposition, materials engineering steps that give us a great opportunity.

So Gary, given the merger that we saw announced, there's a lot of bold moves to sort of shake things up in the industry. I guess most of what you've done so far is to consolidate markets that you're already in. But if you look sort of to those markets, there's not a whole lot that you can do that would really move the needle. So I guess I wanted to ask you about your willingness to sort of look outside of your traditional front-end wafer fab equipment markets maybe into the back end, maybe into some non-semi stuff. Sort of how do you think about the strategic way where you can grow the earnings to $2 or more? It seems like you might have to look outside of your traditional front-end WFE markets.",142,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

So if you look at -- again, if you look at our businesses, if you get to a mix of foundry and memory that's more similar to what we've seen in the past. The -- as I've said before, our transistor and interconnect business is very, very, very strong. So -- and we see growth in terms of the number of steps, as our customers are transitioning to these next-generation devices. If you look at etch and deposition, we've grown maybe $1 billion over the last 2 or 3 years. We still think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow there going forward, a significant opportunity. One of the things I talked about this last year is that we had a goal of 25 applications wins. We actually won 49 new applications. And that gives us a great tailwind going forward in terms of those areas. So that's $10 billion market opportunity where our share momentum is strong. We have great products. We're winning applications, critical applications with customers in those areas, so big opportunity for us to grow. Service has grown about $500 million over the last 2 years. And in Display, what we've talked about is the opportunity to triple our TAM. We could be somewhere around $1 billion in Display this year. And there are changes in technology that will happen in Display that are also great opportunities for us. So you put all those things together and you have a more normalized mix in terms of memory foundry, mobile TV, and you have a market around 33.5 billion in wafer fab equipment. We have a lot of momentum to hit the model that we had talked about before. Now relative to the areas that you talked about, Tim, all I can say here is that we have the same criteria that we had before, the financial returns, strategic alignment, leadership and whatever businesses that we're looking at, but we really can't comment in a public forum like this on anything that we're looking at. The other thing I would say, though, is we have a very high bar for M&A. But I also believe you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. We have a great team at Applied Materials. And I think if we find the right opportunity, I have tremendous confidence that we can execute on that opportunity. Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything?",414,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

There's kind of 3 ways we move the needle here. There's inorganic stuff, there's organic stuff and then there's capital returns to investors and how we do that. So if you look at the organic stuff, Gary's right, we look at everything and we are aggressively looking at everything and we're very open-minded to it. So we've closed no doors. On the organic stuff, I frankly think the results are even better than they appear. If you look in Display and AGS, we're growing them more them rapidly than they have in years. If you look at the semi business, if you look by vertical, our highest share is foundry where we've maintained that. We gained 5 points of share in the last couple of years in DRAM, 5 points of share in the transition from 2D to 3D NAND. And we gained 3 to 5 points, we think, in logic, okay? So in all the verticals, we're doing value that well. You say, well, I don't see it enough in the P&L. Well, foundry is down 9 points and sure, DRAM's up 9 points. I don't think anyone projects that's going to be a sustainable future. So as we gain share in virtually every vertical and the mix normalizes, that revenue growth opportunity looks pretty good in the semi business. And in the etch business, where we gained, up over $1.1 billion, we start to in later years get a lot more service business out of that, too, because that's a very attractive business. So within the organic markets, when you look at performance within vertical, performance by product, performance in terms of revenue growth or in -- also in AGS and Display, pretty darn good. No one predicted 9 months ago or a year ago, that foundry was going to be down this year and be 9 points down as a percentage of CapEx. And no body predicts it's going to stay that way. We managed to grow revenues, orders and profit in that environment. And I don't think you go to a cocktail party anybody says, historically, Applied's a DRAM company versus a foundry company. But we're growing our DRAM share 5 points, okay?",382,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So put all those things together and that's how you get closer to the $1 billion. And what I would say, if you look at -- we can't talk about specifically what customers are doing.

You can finish. So if you go look at 2015, a couple of things happened. The biggest thing was if you go look at this, you've got to look at the node and the previous node and the next node when you consider spending and reuse. So if you go look at it, I don't think anyone thought that 20-nanometer was a super device. A lot of customers, and you guys know this, look forward to the introduction of FinFETs and the FinFET device at 16/14 was a more powerful device for them in terms of processor and power, right? So not too many customers did 20-nanometer tape-outs, you know that, right? What we're seeing is that 16/14 by the time they're done, it's going to be a big node for tape outs. So what you had is a fair amount of the equipment at 20 can move to 16/14. So it is the height of the opportunity for reuse because there weren't a lot of tape-outs at 20. Now when you go to 10, now the one thing that helped you at 20 for the one particular customer that went big with 20, they'd buy a fair amount of equipment at the first part of this 2-node buyout 20/16 so the 10-7 because a lot of the equipment is necessary for interconnect. And they buy at the front of this 2-node buying pattern. Now that's very good for Applied, frankly. So as you look at the transition from 20 to 16 versus 16 to 10, the plus you kind of had in both is the big spend on interconnect and a little bit of the front end, we benefit from that. What you have is a minus, 2 minuses kind of at the 20/16 node. A lot of people moved their demand from 20 to 16 and there was a lot of backfill. So 16 projects to be a big long node, so a lot of that capacity is going to stay there and not move to 10. So you're going to get a fair amount of buying at the 10-nanometer node. So we think 10 is a pretty big spending node for us and I think the customers say that too.",379,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We'd never seen a ramp like that at Applied Materials. And you very rarely see that kind of adoption anywhere in the industry. And I was traveling actually most of the last 6 weeks with pretty much all of our major customers. The pull is really phenomenal. And I talked about the 49 application wins in etch and CVD. We have tremendous, tremendous pull from customers and we're winning critical applications also. This is not just noncritical applications. Some of the most critical applications, the design of our technology is outperforming the competition. So we look at that, the etch business, $6 billion market, it's a great opportunity for us. Relative to your question on dielectric etch, again, you have a $6 billion market. We certainly have gained share. But our position going forward on new applications is also very, very strong. And the pull from customers is tremendous. So our focus has been really on conductor etch. We wanted to go where we had the best opportunities, where we could create the most value for the customers. We continue to focus on areas that are the best fit for our differentiated technology and customer high-value problems. And I can tell you there's still a lot of room there for us to grow in the etch business. So tremendous growth over the last few years, but still phenomenal pull in momentum and opportunity for us going forward. In e-beam inspection, I wouldn't say the game is anywhere close to over. Our PDC business, the majority of our revenue in PDC comes from e-beam products. We have very strong position in e-beam review. We've gained some share in CD-SEM, CD metrology also. And really, the focus there is around the most critical imaging applications. We have world-class electron optics. And the team is bringing that technology leadership now into e-beam inspection. And we have a great opportunity, a great opportunity going forward. So I wouldn't say -- again, I've been in this kind of a business for a long, long time; I don't think this game is anywhere close to over.

So in '15, WFE for the industry, we think for the total WFE, was probably like 48, 52, something like that. I personally think next year, WFE is all of that and maybe a little more back-end loaded. Because in 2015, you had foundry back-end loaded more and you get that again next year. But I think the memory is not as -- it's pretty good generally by the next year, but not as strong in the front end as it was this year, okay? So I think 48, 52, it's that or more than that next in terms of back-end loaded. That's for the industry. Now for Applied Materials, we always tend to be back-end loaded just because the way we run quarters and the December calendar year-end. So this year, I think we were like 57% in the second calendar half. 43, 57. I don't want to give an exact number. But I don't know why we would be any different than that because I think the industry is similar, where we're strong, foundry and VNAND is more second half.

We did $700 million on the buyback in the second quarter. That's $1.325 billion. And then we have a matrix that tracks the volume by the price. So my guess is that Q3 is a good size buyback, maybe not quite as big as Q2 -- as the recent -- next quarter, I think might be a good size number somewhere between the first 2 quarters we did is my guess, but it depends on the stock price right? In terms of -- we originally said, we'd get done 3 years, then 2 years. It may be shorter than 2 years but I don't want to predict it right now because it's based on stock prices at any given point. Now on the dividend, your other question. We addressed -- the dividend is a board decision. We have that meeting in, like, February, March with the board every year. The board's always been very supportive of all forms of cash returns to investors. In fact, if you look at Applied over the last 1, 3, 5, I think even 10 years, we've returned about 100% of free cash flow to investors. So the board will talk to us about a dividend versus buyback versus other things in February, March.
