251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2024",2024-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3598.0,3026197.0,110533575.0,Presenter Speech,Gary Dickerson,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Mike. Applied Materials made a strong start to fiscal 2024 with first quarter revenue in the high end of our guidance and earnings that exceeded our guided range. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is delivering results. We have outperformed our markets for 5 consecutive years and believe we are in a great position as customers transition major new chip innovations to high-volume production over the next several years. 
The breadth of our technology capabilities, combined with our deep customer relationships, allows us to see inflections early and accelerate key technology innovations that are critical to scaling AI, IoT, electric vehicles and renewable energy. We have reshaped and expanded our portfolio of solutions that enable next-generation transistors, new interconnect schemes, including backside power delivery, high-performance DRAM, including high-bandwidth memory, and specialty applications in the ICAPS market. 
In my prepared remarks today, I'll provide some examples of how these inflections grow Applied's available market and are highly accretive to our share. I'll also talk about our long-term strategy to accelerate innovation and commercialization velocity through tighter collaboration with our customers and partners. But to begin, let me share our latest perspective on the market environment. 
In our discussions with customers, we're hearing that overall market dynamics are improving. There is a reacceleration of capital investment by cloud companies. Fab utilization is increasing across all device types, and memory inventory levels are normalizing. 
In terms of Applied's business in 2024, we see leading-edge foundry logic being stronger year-over-year even though some important projects are delayed. We're forecasting ICAPS demand to be slightly lower than 2023 with weakness in some end markets being offset by strong regional investments. We expect our NAND revenues to be up year-on-year but NAND to remain less than 10% of total wafer fab equipment spending. And we see continued strength in our DRAM business driven by customers ramping production of high-bandwidth memory. 
High-bandwidth memory, where high-performance DRAM dies are stacked and connected to logic die with advanced packaging, is a key enabler for the AI data center. The dies used in high-bandwidth memory are more than 2x larger than standard DRAM, which means that more than twice the capacity is needed to produce the same volume of chips. 
On top of this, the packaging steps needed for die stacking further increase our total available market. High Bandwidth Memory or HBM made up only about 5% of DRAM output in 2023 but is expected to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate over the coming years. DRAM is a great example of how our inflection-focused innovation approach is working, by focusing on the critically enabling process and packaging steps for next-generation technologies, Applied has significantly increased our share of the DRAM market. 
In 2023, we estimate that our DRAM share was more than 10 points higher than it was a decade earlier. And our DRAM revenues were larger than our 2 closest process equipment peers combined. We're also best positioned for future growth, thanks to our leadership in logic technologies that have been implemented for DRAM peripheral circuitry applications to enable significantly increased IO speeds, our strong position in DRAM patterning, our unique co-optimized hard mask solutions, which are critical for capacitor scaling, and advanced packaging, where we have strong leadership positions in micro bump and through-silicon via that will enable multiple generations of high-bandwidth memory. 
In fiscal 2024, we expect our HBM packaging revenues to be 4x larger than last year, growing to almost $0.5 billion. And across all device types, we expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.5 billion. Looking further ahead, we see opportunities for this business to double again as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted and we introduce new products that expand our served market. 
Another key inflection that will transition to high-volume production beginning this year is gate-all-around transistors in leading-edge foundry logic. These complex 3D structures can provide a more than 30% improvement in a chip's energy efficiency. This is especially enabling for high-performance AI data center applications. The shift from FinFET to gate-all-around grows Applied's available market by $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. And we're on track to gain share and capture over 50% of the spending for the process equipment used in this new transistor module. 
Major advances in leading-edge foundry logic and DRAM are also driving the need for more and better metrology and inspection to be integrated into the manufacturing flow. We have developed industry-leading cold field emission eBeam technology that enables highly sensitive 2D and 3D imaging at up to 10x higher speeds. We expect our CFE systems revenue to grow by a factor of 4 in 2024 and represent 50% of our total eBeam system sales. 
The incredible innovation we see in the industry today is not limited to the leading edge. In recent years, ICAPS customers have invested about 10% of their revenues or about $30 billion annually in research and development to accelerate the road map for IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor technologies. ICAPS technology depends less on shrinking device features, and customer investments are heavily weighted towards new structures, new materials and new integration approaches, playing to the core strengths of Applied. 
ICAPS is another area where we saw market inflections early. And 5 years ago, we formed a dedicated team to focus on the needs of these customers. Since then, we've released more than 20 new ICAPS products that target the highest-value device innovations in these markets. And we have a robust development pipeline of unit process and integrated solutions. 
While major end market inflections such as AI and IoT, electric vehicles and renewable energy are already driving semiconductor growth and innovation, it's important to recognize they are still in the early stages of adoption. For example, high-performance GPUs for AI data centers only represent 6% of leading-edge foundry logic wafer starts today. The full potential of technologies like AI cannot be unlocked without next-generation chips with better performance, power and cost. 
The technology road map for semiconductors is rich with possibilities and opportunities but also incredibly complex. No company is better placed to address this complexity than Applied Materials. With the industry's broadest and deepest portfolio of capabilities and products, we have a unique ability to combine, co-optimize and integrate our technologies to develop highly differentiated solutions for our customers. 
To bring these advances to market faster, we're also innovating the way we innovate, by driving earlier and deeper collaboration with our customers and partners. We are expanding our global innovation network that will connect into the EPIC Center we're building in Silicon Valley. During the quarter, we announced an expansion of our long-term partnership with Leti, which is focused on accelerating ICAPS innovation, and we launched a new collaboration with MIT, which is centered around next-generation power electronics. 
As industry complexity rises, we're also delivering more value to customers with our advanced services that enable our customers to accelerate R&D, transfer new technology into volume manufacturing faster and then optimize yield, output and cost in their factories. 
AGS has delivered 18 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. Revenue for the first quarter was up 8% versus the same period last year, and the business is now at a $6 billion annual run rate. AGS has the opportunity for double-digit growth this year, and we believe we can sustain this growth rate into the future. A significant portion of AGS revenue is generated from subscriptions. We have almost 17,000 tools under service agreements, up 8% year-on-year. And these agreements have a very high renewal rate, over 90%. 
Before I pass the call over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials outperformed our markets in 2023 for the fifth consecutive year, and we delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2024. The positions we've established at key industry inflections will support continued outperformance as customers ramp next-generation chip technologies into high-volume production. We are strengthening R&D collaboration with customers and partners to drive innovation and commercialization velocity, improvements in mutual success rate and R&D investment efficiencies. And we see growing demand for our advanced services that are helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as the industry scales. 
Now I'll hand over to Brice.",1378,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Feb 15, 2024",2024-02-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3598.0,3026197.0,110533576.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. And I'd like to thank our teams for delivering strong revenue and margins this quarter and making further improvements in our operating performance. On today's call, I'll discuss our value creation strategy and the results it is producing. Then I'll summarize our growth thesis and why we believe we will outperform our markets in the years ahead. Finally, I'll summarize our Q1 results and provide our guidance for Q2. 
I'll begin by discussing how our assets and strategy create value for shareholders. Applied has the broadest and deepest process equipment portfolio and expertise in the industry. We are highly invested in collaborating with our customers, allocating $3 billion in annual R&D to invent new solutions to the most critical semiconductor manufacturing challenges. 
Increasingly, the only way to solve these challenges is by co-optimizing and integrating our chamber technologies in new ways. In addition, identifying new materials and processes early and collaborating closely with customers leads to faster results, a higher probability of success, greater efficiency and stronger financial returns. 
The benefits of our value creation strategy are being demonstrated in our financial results. We generated record equipment sales, $20.7 billion in calendar '23, including legacy equipment reported in AGS. And we extended our strong position in DRAM with record calendar year sales of over $4.3 billion. In fact, over the past 10 years, the company has gained over 10 points of DRAM share and multiple points of overall share. This has contributed to Applied delivering a fifth straight year of overall WFE share gains and one of the best share outcomes of the past 20 years. 
Over the same 10 fiscal years, we've grown company revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30%, free cash flow at 33% and dividends per share at nearly 12%. Also, over this period, we increased return on invested capital from 8% to 35% and reduced net shares outstanding by over 30%. 
Next, I'll summarize our growth thesis. As we look out over the planning horizon, we expect Semiconductors to grow significantly faster than GDP. Second, we expect the equipment market to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors over time, driven by increasing technical complexity. Third, we expect Applied's equipment business to outgrow the market. And fourth, we expect our services business to grow as fast or faster than our equipment business. 
I'll take a moment to support the third pillar of our thesis that Applied's equipment business will outgrow the market. The reason is that our technologies enable the key semiconductor advances needed to drive growth in AI, IoT and renewable energy. Looking ahead to the semiconductor process inflections that will play out over the next several years, the company is extremely well positioned. 
In data center AI, we are #1 in process equipment for advanced logic and compute memory, both standard DRAM and high-bandwidth memory. We also have line of sight to share of 50% or more in gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery and advanced packaging. We are equally strong in edge AI and IoT with the #1 position in ICAPS silicon, which is used to sense and convert analog information and transmit it to the cloud. We are also innovating rapidly in ICAPS technology for the global energy transformation, including through new agreements with partners like Leti and MIT, which Gary described. 
In summary, we feel confident that our unique assets and collaboration strategy position Applied to continue to outpace our markets and deliver strong shareholder returns as these major inflections play out over the next several years. 
Now I'll summarize our Q1 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined slightly to $6.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 110 basis points to 47.9%. Non-GAAP OpEx grew 5.6% to $1.23 billion. And non-GAAP EPS grew nearly 5% to $2.13.
Turning to our segment results. Semiconductor Systems revenue was strong at $4.91 billion and included record DRAM and etch system sales. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%. While our operating expenses are primarily focused on R&D programs for emerging technology inflections, we are also investing to expand and diversify our manufacturing logistics and supply chain to efficiently serve future growth. 
Applied Global Services delivered record revenue and its 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. AGS revenue increased approximately 8% year-over-year to nearly $1.48 billion, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28.3%. Our installed base surpassed 49,000 tools during the quarter and grew to nearly 200,000 chambers. Around 2/3 of AGS recurring services and parts revenue was delivered as subscription agreements. Finally, AGS continued to produce more than enough operating profit to fund Applied's growing dividend. 
Moving to display. Q1 revenue was $244 million, and segment non-GAAP operating profit was 10.2%. We continue to look forward to our opportunity in the upcoming OLED IT growth inflection. 
Turning to cash flows in Q1. We generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow and $2.1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed $966 million to shareholders, including $266 million in dividends and $700 million in buybacks. We repurchased nearly 5 million shares at an average price of $152.60. 
Please note that our Q1 results include the following. First, as we discussed in our recent 10-K report, we increased the estimated useful lives of our plant equipment, and this increased non-GAAP EPS by $0.03. Also effective Q1, we refined the way we allocate stock-based compensation, moving the majority of the expenses from corporate unallocated to the operating segments, which gives managers greater visibility over costs. While the change has no impact on company operating profit or EPS, it reduces the segment operating profit and corporate unallocated costs proportionately. To help you with your segment models, our quarterly earnings presentation includes a table showing what operating profits would have been in fiscal 2022 and in each quarter of fiscal 2023 on a like basis. Finally, the reduction in depreciation and share-based compensation in cost of sales increased gross margin by approximately 40 basis points. 
Now I'll share our guidance for Q2. We expect revenue to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.97, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.8 billion, AGS revenue of about $1.5 billion and display revenue of around $150 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47.3% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.235 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.5%.

I think many of your competitors have suggested kind of a low to mid-single-digit growth, but within that, the move towards more leading edge and DRAM and less on the trailing edge. But just given how strongly Applied grew in some of your trailing edge and ICAPS, how does that position you in this new WFE environment? 
Because I think, Gary, you said that you only see only limited decline on the ICAPS side. But when I look at the CapEx of many of the auto industrial or analog companies in the U.S., they are cutting it quite sharply. So that's why I was curious why you think that it's only going to decline.

Thanks, Vivek. No real change, I think, in our outlook for '24 in terms of shaping how those end markets are evolving. So we do think DRAM will continue to be a strong market. We think NAND will improve from its low levels a little bit. We think leading logic will be larger as gate-all-around and new investments start to ramp towards the back half of the year. And we do think there will be some digestion in ICAPS in China, both. 
Just to be crystal clear, we had enormous growth for 2 years in ICAPS and the China-related ICAPS business. And so we won't see that enormous growth this year. It may be a little bit smaller.

I think the most important thing to think about is how we're positioned for major inflections. So if you think about foundry logic leading edge, gate-all-around, backside power distribution, those are incremental billion-dollar opportunities for Applied, where we have an opportunity for more than 50% share, which is very accretive to our overall market share. So we're really well positioned there. 
ICAPS, we formed that group 5 years ago, as I said earlier. 20 major new products have been introduced. We have a strong pipeline of future ICAPS products. And so again, they're -- and we have opportunities to grow in segments like etch and PDC, where we have a lot of momentum. So I like our position in ICAPS. 
DRAM, we've gained more than 10 points of share over the last 10 years. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, extremely well positioned for the major inflections in DRAM. In packaging, we have the strongest and broadest portfolio. And this is around $1.5 billion of revenue for us in '24 and an opportunity to double over the next few years. So all of those areas, I think, really set us up for continued outperformance. 
And then on your question about SPIE, one of the things we'll be talking about there is Sculpta. Just reminding people, that's a breakthrough pattern shaping technology that provides a simpler, faster and more cost-effective alternative to EUV double patterning. So we're engaged with all of the leading foundry logic customers and expanding Sculpta steps for advanced patterning, including high-NA EUV. And  we're also working with customers on new Sculpta applications. And we expect this business to grow to close to $200 million in 2024 and ramp to around $0.5 billion in annual revenue in the next few years. 
Also at SPIE, for those of you that will attend, you'll hear about new etch and CVD technology for patterning that will be very large growth drivers for the company and enable us to continue to outperform. And just for reference, in patterning, we've increased our served market from around $1.5 billion 10 years ago to $8 billion now and our share from around 10% to 30%. So when Brice said I was excited, I am absolutely excited. These are some really, really great technologies with very strong customer pull and delivering meaningful growth for the company.",399,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And then what we're hearing from customers is optimism, generally speaking, for 2025. We would echo comments we've heard from others that the semiconductor end market for devices is expected to be growing. And it's an investment cycle on the leading edge.

You have a broad-based product portfolio. You outperformed WFE last 2 years. I'm kind of curious for some of these new applications, whether it's HBM, gate-all-around or even backside power delivery, are customers looking at a one-stop shop or more going with best-of-breed solutions?

Chris, one thing I would say, that for all of these inflections, it's a tremendous advantage for us to have that broad portfolio. Again, when you think about -- one of the examples I've used many times is your processor chip and your smartphone with 15 billion transistors and 60 miles of wiring, which is kind of mind-boggling when you think about how do we do that, how do we create something like that. There are over 1,500 steps in building that type of chip. 
And when you're developing these new technologies like gate-all-around, like backside power or new DRAM technologies or any of these packaging technologies, the ability to combine and co-optimize these steps is an enormous advantage, enormous that 60 miles of wiring, we have one platform that combines 7 technologies under vacuum to enable that -- those 60 miles long, very thin wires to move the data at super high speeds, very low resistance and very low power. So it's completely unique. And that's about 1/3 of our portfolio, are those integrated solutions. 
We also have clear leadership in eBeam technology. I talked about our cold field emission electron optics. And that enables us to see those structures. When you're building gate-all-around and you want to look at the width of those nanosheets, again, we have unique technology that enables us to learn faster. And then we can co-optimize all of those technologies. 
So as we're driving our innovation with customers, we're deeper. We're earlier. We can see 4 generations out relative to those technologies. So super, super deep connectivity. That's why also I think EPIC is going to be a game changer in how we innovate, the way we innovate. We talked about the relationship with Leti for innovation and edge computing and ICAPS, all of those things. Then we have our advanced packaging lab in Singapore that is also a full flow lab, where customers are working on innovation and new architectures. So Chris, I think that gives us a tremendous advantage. We can see what's needed earlier. And then the ability to co-optimize all of that gives us a tremendous advantage.",358,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Appreciate the question. So yes, our gross margin reported in Q1 was 47.9%. We think that we've modeled what it would be without the higher China mix. And our view is the underlying gross margin is approximately 46.7% at this point. So as we go through the course of the year, we expect that gross margin to come down from 47.9% to a more normal amount. 
At the same time, where we are underneath that, the 46.7% will continue to improve slowly, if that makes sense. So if you normalize Q1 immediately, you'd be at 46.7%. We expect that to improve through the course of the year. And then we're not changing our goals. Our goal is 48% to 48.5% for 2025.

I think you said HBM accounted for about 5% of industry output. If you can clarify if that's wafer output or if that's bits. But my question is, as we look out to the next few years, I think you're forecasting about 50% growth for this business. So it's a little tricky to understand for us as to how much of DRAM WFE is going to HBM right now. And how do you see that evolving? I mean if the market grows 50%, should we expect, I guess, the equipment spending also to grow 50%? Or do you think it's going to grow faster than that?",115,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So on the first question, it's wafer starts when we think about the 5%. It's wafer starts. I think it is difficult to estimate the equipment purchases at this point because you probably understand that the DRAM business itself has been underloaded as most of the markets have. So I think what many of the customers are doing is shifting some of their capacity to HBM to get this output. 
Gary highlighted in his prepared remarks that the die sizes for the HBM are larger than the non-HBM. So it certainly will help drive up utilization, which will eventually increase equipment orders going forward. And we do think the DRAM business, if you look at the past few years, the level of WFE for DRAM, we do think that it's been fairly strong, and it will continue to be strong is our expectation. 
And then the last piece, of course, is customers are having to expand the HBM-related steps of their DRAM process. Gary highlighted what that is for us, and that's growing a lot faster than what you see on the general equipment side. So my understanding of the DRAM is about 700 steps in a DRAM process and about 15 additional steps, possibly 20, to do the HBM level of that. So for sure, you'll see customers growing the HBM packaging techniques and capabilities alongside the regular capacity. And then we'll expect to see utilization increase as time goes on.",260,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And are they disciplined from a supply perspective? Or are you seeing a pickup in your conventional DRAM business as well to the extent you have visibility there?

Toshiya, it's Brice. I'll just make a couple of comments, and maybe Gary will add to that. So on the DRAM side -- and this is true for DRAM and NAND, but I'll start with DRAM. We do see utilization improving, and we also see improvements in prices and we also see improvements in inventory positions. So we do think that's consistent with the rising optimism on the DRAM side. The utilizations have been low enough that there's a ways to go before they have to start thinking about adding capacity. So our view on the market is it's mostly from a WFE perspective, the nodal upgrades and the HBM that we talked about. 
And it would be similar for NAND. We're seeing improvements in inventory, seeing improvements in pricing. Utilization is starting to pick up. And our perspective would be the same as technology advances will be what drives the spending.

I think our perspective hasn't changed at all relative to how we see the market. So we still see semiconductors at $1 trillion by 2030. And if you look at -- there's some powerful drivers in the digital transformation of every industry. AI, certainly, there's a lot of focus there. And AI server has 8x more foundry logic content and 8x more DRAM compute memory content.
So as Brice said earlier, and I think as you've heard from others, I think there's a pretty positive perspective on '25. And I think longer term, we have a very positive perspective relative to semiconductor growth, equipment growing as faster or faster and Applied outgrowing the equipment market, continuing to outgrow as we have for the last 5 years. 
So I think quarter-to-quarter or half-to-half, frankly, we don't focus as much on that as we do this secular growth that we see in this industry and the great opportunities Applied has, as I've talked about, relative to the major inflections.

So the clarification, Brice. Is the 2023 WFE baseline, would you agree, with something like $86 billion to $87 billion? So if you can clarify what your baseline is when you say that you gain share? 
And then my question is on China WFE. So if I use your numbers, it implies WFE from China is roughly $30 billion in 2023, maybe a little bit less. I know the customers are not stockpiling tools per se, but we know that SMIC and some of the other public companies, they have revenue to support what they spend. But that seems like only about half of that amount. So I guess the question is, would you disagree with the idea that maybe half of what's coming from China is companies just kind of getting off the ground and trying to displace what's being imported from the U.S. or Europe? 
And I guess, Gary, the real crux of the question is that the China stuff is not really a free lunch. It's sort of duplicative with spending happening elsewhere. So how do you handicap that when you plan your business going forward?",196,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

Thank you. So on the 2023 WFE, we've been careful not to engage in the discussion about that. We just shared what our view of Applied's performance in our view of that market. And for us, 2023 was a strong year. We talked about ICAPS strength. We talked about DRAM strength, packaging strength, et cetera. And so we'll just have to wait and see what the third parties say about the size of the market. For us, we saw a strong market. 
On the China WFE, we agree. We don't see stockpiling. There are a number of new customers. So I don't know if it's exactly the partition that you described in terms of leading and public companies versus not. But we do think there are a large number of projects that are under investment, where we see over the next 4 years, added wafer start capacity planned wafer start capacity, that market will be a strong market for us across the planning horizon. 
And so I think it is a mix. You've got real demand there. When we look at the macro, we compare the amount of capacity put in place to local China consumption, and we think they're still behind the amount of local China consumption. So we think the investments are rational. And actually, the utilizations look okay. They're lower than rest of the world generally speaking, but they're improving, and we expect yields to be improving also over time. 
And then I know, Gary -- you're asking Gary, about the free lunch. We think you're right from the perspective of no capacity -- we're planning for all of the tools that we sell, whether it's to China or whether it's to a government incentivized project. None of these things, we think, increase the amount of equipment installed sort of abnormally such that it's not going to be used and not going to serve an end market. So we don't believe that China demand is an end line free launch. We don't believe the government incentives are a free lunch from that perspective.

Actually, that's a relatively small portion of your overall DRAM run rate at least. And I guess I would have thought it would be even bigger. Can you talk about that? And then there's more than just HBM when it comes to advanced packaging for AI DRAM. People are doing stacks for other types of memory.

So you guys talked a lot about the material engineering potentially driving outperformance. If I look at the back -- in the last 10 years -- I mean, I think of the back half of the last decade, I mean, between '15 and 2019, because the manufacturers are kind of slow to jump on the EUV, there was a lot more adoption of multi-patterning that actually led to like outperformance of the dep and etch equipment suppliers like Applied Materials. But the last 5 years, because of the EUV adoption, seems to be that trend has reversed a little bit. 
But looking out for the next 5 years, I know there are recent discussions about maybe high-NA EUV may not actually get adopted before 2030. Does that -- does Applied think that may lead to more of the multi-patterning EUV again and that could actually drive up the material engineering intensity again?

Thanks for the question. So one thing I would point to, one of our largest customers, they talked about what's driving their road map going forward. They talked about something called design technology co-optimization. So what they said basically was that much of the area scaling they were driving going forward is coming from new structures and new materials. 
So an example is backside power. You can get 30% area savings through that type of a structure with no change in feature size. So I think what -- certainly, what we see -- and we're working with customers for technology nodes out past the end of the decade. We see the relative contribution of materials innovations spending going higher, the percentage of that going higher. Gate-all-around, backside power, there's CFET technology. There's many different innovations, packaging technologies. All of those areas, we have over 50% share opportunity in those inflections that are very accretive. And again, we do see a relative contribution from -- of spending those innovations to go higher over time. 
I'll give you one more data point. So gate-all-around. Gate-all-around is a new innovation in the transistor to process the data faster. We see gate-all-around ramping to more than $1.5 billion for Applied revenue in '24 and almost double that amount in calendar '25.

With second quarter revenue and earnings toward the high end of our guided range, Applied Materials continued to deliver strong performance in 2024, and we're in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer term. Semiconductors are the foundation of huge technology trends reshaping the global economy. These trends are driving demand for more chip manufacturing capacity as well as better chips with higher performance and improved energy efficiency. 
Key inflections that underpin the semiconductor road map are enabled by Applied Materials and will support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies move into high-volume production. In addition, the complexity of implementing the industry's road map and bringing new semiconductor technologies to market is driving earlier, deeper and broader collaboration with customers as well as supporting double-digit growth for our service business. 
In my prepared remarks today, I'll provide some examples of how Applied's innovations are helping to enable multitrillion-dollar technology inflections, including AI. I'll explain how this translates to our performance in the near term and our future growth potential. I'll also describe how we're working with our customers and partners to accelerate major semiconductor inflections, all the way from research and development to high-volume manufacturing, and by doing this, how we are capturing more value in our service business.
I'll start with a big-picture perspective. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT and automation, electric and autonomous vehicles and clean energy will transform virtually every area of the economy over the next several decades. And they all have one thing in common: they are built upon semiconductors. As these new technologies are deployed, they are driving growth and innovation across the semiconductor ecosystem. In terms of impact and scale, I believe AI will be the biggest technology inflection of our lifetimes. And at the heart of AI are some of the world's most sophisticated chips. 
In simple terms, the advanced chips that power AI data centers are enabled by 4 key semiconductor technologies: leading-edge logic; compute memory or high-performance DRAM; DRAM stacking technology referred to as high-bandwidth memory, or HBM; and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together and create a system in a package. Applied has process technology leadership in all 4 of these areas, and we have made significant investments in next-generation solutions to make possible the key device architecture inflections that are essential for our customers' future road maps. 
In advanced logic, Applied has long-standing leadership in the materials engineering processes for both transistors and interconnects. The first nodes that use gate-all-around transistors are now transitioning to high-volume manufacturing. These new transistor process flows are considerably more complex, and the shift from FinFET to gate-all-around grows Applied's available market for the transistor module from around $6 billion to approximately $7 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. With the gate-all-around transition, we are also gaining share, and we're on track to capture over 50% of the process equipment spending for transistor steps. 
We also have very strong market share in interconnect or the wiring used to transmit data at high speed and low power. Our available market for the wiring steps is approximately $6 billion for each 100,000 wafer starts per month, and we expect it to grow by $1 billion when backside power delivery is introduced into volume manufacturing. Overall, we expect to generate more than $2.5 billion of revenue from gate-all-around nodes this year and potentially more than double that in 2025. 
In DRAM, one of the key approaches that memory makers are using to improve performance and power consumption is to implement logic technologies in the peripheral circuitry. Our deep capabilities in logic, combined with our strong position in DRAM patterning and our unique co-optimized hardmask solutions for capacitor scaling, makes us the clear leader in process equipment for DRAM today and best positioned for future growth. 
In the critical die stacking technologies used in high-bandwidth memory, we also have strong leadership positions, including in micro-bump and through-silicon via. Last quarter, we said that we expected our HBM packaging revenue to be 4x larger in 2024 than in 2023. As we have recently seen customers accelerate their capacity plans for HBM, we now believe that our revenue could be 6x higher this year, growing to more than $600 million. Across all device types, we now expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.7 billion this year. 
Looking further ahead, we see opportunities for this business to double again as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted beyond the AI data center, and we introduce new products that expand our served market. AI data center is just one example that illustrates how the major inflections that underpin the next generation of semiconductors are enabled by Applied Materials. 
Materials science and materials engineering are increasingly important to the industry's road map. Applied has invested early to develop a broad, unique and connected portfolio of materials engineering solutions that are critical to enable major semiconductor inflections, from AI high-performance computing to ICAPS edge computing. We are translating those investments into consistent outperformance. 
Recent TechInsights data confirms that in 2023, Applied grew faster than the wafer fab equipment market for the fifth year in a row. We accomplished this despite headwinds created by trade rules that we estimate restricted us from more than 10% of the China market during that period. While we have gained share overall, we are growing share within our served market even faster. This is important because as logic devices become more 3-dimensional, future generations of DRAM come to market and advanced packaging becomes more prevalent, we expect materials engineering to become an even larger portion of overall wafer fab equipment. 
Another key component of Applied's strategy is to address the increasing complexity faced by the industry. First, we are driving earlier, deeper and broader collaboration with customers and partners. We are changing the industry's innovation model with the goal to accelerate mutual success rates and increase investment efficiencies. Our global EPIC platform that we will build out over the next several years is specifically designed to support high-velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. 
Second, we are able to provide more complete and connected solutions that accelerate major device inflections. The portion of our revenue generated by integrated solutions has grown from approximately 20% in 2019 to 30% today. We expect demand for these fab-in-a-fab-type solutions to continue growing both at the leading edge and from our ICAPS customers who are serving specialty IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor applications. 
And third, we are helping customers transfer new technology into high-volume manufacturing faster and then optimize performance, yield, output and cost in their factory operations. This is supporting double-digit growth of our service business. AGS delivered a new record for revenue this quarter, $1.5 billion, with a significant portion of this coming from subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. 
Before I hand over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials continues to deliver strong performance in 2024, and we are in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer term. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT, EVs and clean energy, that are reshaping the global economy are built on semiconductors, driving demand for more chips and new chips with higher performance and better energy efficiency. 
Key device architecture inflections that underpin the semiconductor road map are enabled by Applied Materials. We expect this to support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies, including gate-all-around logic nodes, high-performance DRAM and HBM and advanced packaging, move into high-volume production. 
And finally, the increasingly complex industry road map is driving earlier, deeper and broader collaboration between Applied Materials and our customers and partners, accelerating demand for our most advanced, co-optimized and integrated solutions and supporting double-digit growth in our service business. 
Now I'll hand over to Brice.",1318,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2024 Earnings Call, May 16, 2024",2024-05-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3618.0,3130847.0,112791979.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary. And I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution, which resulted in another strong quarter for revenue and gross margin. Today, I'll discuss our overall business environment and share insights into our ICAPS business, which serves the IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets. I'll describe our capital allocation strategy and operating model, demonstrating how we are driving profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns. I'll also summarize our Q2 results and provide our guidance for Q3. 
In calendar Q1, the global market for semiconductors grew 15% year-over-year, and we're optimistic that the data center trends Gary outlined will help drive solid growth for the semiconductor industry. During the quarter, cloud service providers announced strong capital spending plans, which is good news for our customers. In the market briefing we issued earlier this month, we forecast that the data center market will eventually become the #1 driver of leading-edge foundry/logic wafer starts, surpassing PCs and then smartphones in the coming years. 
Within our business, we had a strong quarter in fiscal Q2 across DRAM, advanced packaging, ICAPS and services. In February, we projected that factory utilization would increase across all device types, and it did. Gary discussed how the data center AI megatrend is driving strong demand for our technologies used in leading-edge logic, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory and other forms of advanced packaging. 
Our ICAPS business is driven by 3 additional megatrends, notably: IoT and edge computing, electric and autonomous vehicles, and renewable energy. Across our ICAPS business, one of the largest demand drivers this year is edge computing, especially at the 28-nanometer node needed by smartphone companies and makers of IoT devices for industrial and home automation applications. A second large demand driver is power chips for electric vehicles, where industry leaders are now establishing supply chains to support their long-term growth plans. A third driver is the power chips used to capture renewable solar and wind energy, which are needed to achieve net-zero goals in the decades ahead. 
We believe our ICAPS business will remain a large portion of our overall foundry/logic business for several reasons. One, the megatrends we described will continue to increase unit demand for ICAPS chips. Two, we are innovating at the device level, which creates better chips, stimulates new system sales and extends Applied's position as the highest-value partner for our customers. And finally, we are introducing ICAPS products in additional market segments, which will help us broaden our reach and gain share. 
Next, I'll summarize our capital allocation strategy and the results it enables. Our efficient business model generates healthy free cash flow. Our first priority is investing in R&D and capital infrastructure to enable profitable growth. And our second priority is growing our dividend per share and using our buyback program to distribute excess free cash flow to shareholders. Specifically, over the past 10 fiscal years, we have reinvested more than $20 billion in R&D and over $5 billion in capital additions and distributed more than 90% of free cash flow to shareholders. Our capital allocation strategy supports our operating model, which I'll summarize. 
First, we invest over $3 billion in R&D each year, collaborating closely with our customers to invent new semiconductor technologies that are critical to their competitive positions in the global megatrends we've described. Second, we design high-volume manufacturing systems that enable our customers to deploy these new chip and advanced packaging technologies at global scale. Third, we manage a global factory and supply chain network to manufacture these systems. Fourth, we service our systems, which have decades of useful life, helping customers maximize the return on investment by accelerating ramps and optimizing output, yield and cost. Fifth, we reinvest a high percentage of the profits from this activity back into R&D to develop more new technologies and solutions. And finally, we distribute excess cash to shareholders. 
An important point is that every tool we manufacture and ship grows our installed base and our service opportunity, which leads to consistent and stable growth for Applied Global Services. In fact, AGS has delivered 19 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth, spanning 2 memory downcycles. Over 80% of AGS revenue comes from recurring services and parts sales, about 2/3 of which is delivered under long-term service agreements that have a 90% renewal rate. 
Connecting this to our capital allocation strategy, AGS has continued to produce more than enough operating profit to fully fund our growing dividend. In March 2023, we announced a 23% increase in our dividend per share. And in March of this year, we announced a 25% increase. 
In summary, over the past 10 fiscal years, our operating model has increased company revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30%, free cash flow at 33% and dividends per share at nearly 12%. Also, over this period, we reduced net shares outstanding by over 30%. 
Now I'll summarize our Q2 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales grew slightly to nearly $6.65 billion, non-GAAP gross margin grew 70 basis points to 47.5%, non-GAAP OpEx grew 5% to $1.23 billion, and non-GAAP EPS grew 4.5% to $2.09. 
Turning to segment results. Semiconductor Systems revenue remained strong at $4.9 billion and included record ion implant sales. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 34.9%. Applied Global Services revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $1.53 billion, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5%. Our tools under subscription agreement increased by 8% year-over-year, and our installed base of chambers surpassed 200,000 for the first time. 
Moving to display. Q2 revenue was $179 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 2.8%. We are becoming more confident that the OLED technology found in smartphones will be adopted in notebook, PCs and tablets whose larger screen sizes would spur an increase in capital investments. 
Turning to cash flows in Q2. We generated nearly $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $1.14 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $266 million in dividends and $820 million in buybacks. We repurchased 4.1 million shares at an average price of $197.77. 
Now I'll share our guidance for Q3. We expect revenue of $6.65 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.01, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.8 billion, AGS revenue of about $1.57 billion and display revenue of around $245 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.26 billion. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of 12.3%.

Great. C.J., thanks for the question. So when we look at our business and think about the largest customers, as we look at Q3 and our guidance for Q3, we know that the DRAM shipments that we've had for China that we called out that were fairly high in Q1 and Q2 are falling off in the second half. And what we've been expecting is that ICAPS strength and leading logic strength would backfill that drop-off in DRAM. 
And that's exactly what we see happening in Q3. And that's consistent on the leading logic side with the advent of gate-all-around process technology and equipment beginning to ship earnest -- in earnest for the HVM ramp that will be upcoming. And I think that's a good indication of what we're expecting in the second half. We talked about whether leading logic and ICAPS would be able to fill in for the drop-off in China DRAM, and that's exactly what we see in Q3. 
And then when we look ahead to '25, we'll point to the same fundamental ramp for leading logic. That will be gate-all-around. Gary highlighted in his remarks that we expected $2.5 billion of business related to gate-all-around shipments in '24. And we expect to be able to grow that significantly in '25 as that process technology ramps towards HVM, high-volume manufacturing.",224,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I guess I heard you right, you said $2.5 billion gate-all-around this year, doubling next year or more. So $2.5 billion of incremental year-over-year growth from gate-all-around, it sounds like you said the advanced packaging had the opportunity to double again over time, so that should be growing. HBM, in theory, should be growing. 
ICAPS, I know, has been a little weaker than it was. It feels like it's bottomed just given what we're seeing that ought to grow. And I mean NAND flash is -- for you guys is pretty close to 0 right now as well. So the other -- I mean how do I think about like -- you've talked about overdelivering versus the market. Like let's say the WFE market was flat next year. Given those drivers, how would I think about how you guys could grow relative to a market like that given those drivers?",170,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Thanks, Stacy, for the question. So the way -- our perspective, we start with the longer-term view. And as Gary described, we're investing in the key inflections for the fastest-growing markets. And so our perspective, if you stand back and think over many quarters or the next several years, is that the leading logic technologies like gate-all-around and backside power, the advanced packaging, HBM memory, our services business, we think all of those will grow faster than the average market and will help us gain share. And so it's harder to call any particular quarter or a short time period in the near future, but that would be our perspective.
And I think from an ICAPS perspective, you called out gate-all-around and ICAPS and DRAM and NAND, I think, thinking about all of them. We've talked about our DRAM share having improved over 10 percentage points over the last 10 years. And we expect that technology has great tailwinds. We talked about how HBM and utilization in DRAM is improving. So that's a positive. And if we think about ICAPS, the market, we have 3 quarters here that you can see, 2 -- our first 2 that are closed and our Q3 guidance. And ICAPS is very strong in those quarters and grows in Q3 to fill in some of that China DRAM business that drops off.
And then finally, gate-all-around, the $2.5 billion that Gary highlighted, that's not just the incremental. That's our shipments for the entire business that are associated with gate-all-around that are shipping this year, and we do expect that to grow next year.",269,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Really, the big focus for us is enabling and winning major device architecture inflections. So when you break out all of these different device segments, certainly, foundry/logic, leading edge, the opportunity there for us to grow is significant because we have a very high share of those big inflections. The gate-all-around, backside power delivery, wiring is a real strength for us.
As Brice mentioned, in DRAM, we gained 10 points of overall DRAM share over the last 10 years. And if I look forward at the architecture inflections in DRAM, we're even better positioned. Those will be much more materials-intensive, materials engineering-enabled. And that's going to be a really good position for us.
We also talked about packaging. We've increased our view of packaging in '24 to $1.7 billion. But as I mentioned and Brice reiterated, we have an opportunity to double advanced packaging -- our advanced packaging business. In HBM, that's -- we've increased that growth from 4x to 6x this year.
And the last one is our services business, 19 consecutive quarters year-over-year, where we've seen growth. And with these highly complex architecture inflections, it gives us a really great opportunity to add more value with our services business. Also as people are moving into new locations where they don't have an experienced workforce, we've talked about double-digit growth in services. Right now, that's a $6 billion run rate, but that's adding significant growth as we go forward. So there's just a few other thoughts.",251,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Gary, when you talk about like investing more in materials engineering, it seems like you're kind of climbing up the value chain to the place where your -- it used to be your customers' domain. And a lot of times when you see companies moving up the value chain and adding more value, ultimately, you see that reflected in improving margins. 
So appreciate that you engage in partnerships and that's the spirit. But like if you're adding more value, it seems like that ultimately, at the end of the day, should come back to you in higher profitability. And I'm wondering if you could just talk philosophically about that. Like how -- is that something you would expect to see happen?

Thanks for the question, Mark. So if you look at the industry overall, all of our customers are racing to be first to market to deliver those major device architecture inflections that determine their competitive position. So gate-all-around, backside power, those new DRAM architectures and packaging is becoming more and more important to power performance and costs. So that is really what shapes the competitive landscape in the industry. And it's very, very clear. We're working with our customers for technology generations out into the future.
So we have very high visibility, and this broad and connected portfolio that we have gives us an opportunity to engage with customers in those early and very deep relationships on those architecture inflections. And as we look forward, we do see materials engineering as a percentage of spend and the relative contribution increasing. And Applied has clear leadership, especially with this broad, connected portfolio. We built integration capability inside Applied that is really tremendous and really co-innovating with our customers as they're driving those architecture inflections.
So I do believe, for sure, that we will be creating more value in those relationships with our customers, and that certainly is valuable for them.

So you're raising the forecast there by $1 billion. I think on, I think, HBM, you're raising it by another $100 million or so. Is that all going to show up in July and October? So does it mean that conceptually, the second half of the year is over $1 billion higher than what you thought before?
And then on gate-all-around, what is driving such a significant growth versus what you thought before? $1 billion increase over $1.5 billion base is a very strong number. So I'm just curious, what are the kind of the qualitative factors? And then just also quantitatively, does it mean that second half is $1 billion higher -- $1.1 billion higher than what you thought before?",127,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I'll just do a clarification here. This quarter -- we decided last quarter when we talked about the incremental revenue for gate-all-around that it was a little bit confusing. So we changed -- in this quarter, we're talking about all of our revenue that's associated with the gate-all-around transistor and wiring. And so that's not just the increment. So the $2.5 billion that we're talking about this quarter is not supposed to be interpreted as an increase relative to the $1 billion we talked about last quarter. We're just changing the basis. Now we're just quoting all of the business that's associated with the gate-all-around product. So hopefully, that helps.
So as far as answering the question about what's driving the increase, I don't think our perspective has changed very much. It's $2.5 billion for this year. It can grow significantly next year as the technology ramps. And then what I would say is you do see some of that in our Q3 guide. So as you know, we took down -- or we're dropping off the incremental China DRAM shipments that we had. And in the second half, we're filling that in with ICAPS strength and growing leading logic shipments that are driven by gate-all-around.",209,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And so the customers -- and it's really all about this materials magic that we're able to provide with that broad portfolio of different types of technologies.
So step counts are increasing at every one of those different technology nodes as they are driving those road maps for performance power to meet the -- especially for high-performance computing, AI computing demand type of applications. So again, those are very, very, very difficult technologies.

So this -- the whole focus around advanced packaging heterogeneous integration is really a major drive across the entire industry. When you look at AI servers or any of these different kinds of applications, you see tremendous innovation in the high-bandwidth memory. You see tremendous innovation in how you're connecting together all of those high-performance logic chips and memory chips. And we really see the growth there being very, very significant because it's so important to the industry's road map as kind of classic Moore's Law has slowed down significantly. This is another major driver of how the industry will innovate going forward.
And with Applied, we have the broadest portfolio of technologies, PVD, CVD, CMP plating, etch. We've added hybrid bonding, digital lithography, eBeam test. We have a very broad portfolio. And as we see those road maps -- and this is why I come back to architecture inflections are really what drives your incremental business going forward. So we can see the road maps for our foundry/logic customers, for memory customers. All of them are investing very heavily in these types of technologies. And some of these areas also that are new innovations from Applied will help us drive that business 2x higher. And I think that the compound annual growth rate keeps going up from there.
The other advantage that we have besides this broad portfolio in the deep, multi-generation connection that we have with all of our customers is our full-flow packaging lab in Singapore. We're working with leading customers on those next-generation innovations, Chris. So we have pretty good line of sight to what those inflections look like, the architecture inflections will look like in a very strong position to grow our share as those inflections come to market. We're not giving a specific time frame on the doubling. It will happen over a number of years. But very, very optimistic about our opportunities in packaging.",325,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

I think last quarter, you said you expect China to normalize to about 30% or so by the end of this year. So my question is, is that still the expectation? And then it looks like ICAPS is still holding up pretty well. So is the decline primarily DRAM going forward? And I'm just curious as to given what we are hearing about what we're seeing in the end markets of ICAPS, I mean it looks like the broader analog is still relatively weak and auto is kind of mixed.

Thanks, Srini. Yes, first of all, our mix as we move to the second half of the year will normalize with respect to China as a percent of our total revenue. So it will be closer to 30% as expected. And it's the dynamic that you highlighted. We had some catch-up DRAM shipments to particular customers in China for the last 3 quarters. Those will fall off as we go through Q3 and Q4, and that really will bring our percentage of China revenue back down to -- closer to what's average over the last few years, which we'll call about 30%.
And then with respect to the mix of business. So as that DRAM business falls off, our ICAPS business and our leading-edge logic business does increase to fill that in. And so that's consistent with continued strength in ICAPS, which the rest of the market for us in China would be ICAPS-related.
And I think you described it well. The end markets are mixed. So industrial and auto have been weaker. Smartphone, PC-related products have been slow but gaining some strength recently. And then as we've talked about image sensors, power chips, micro-controllers, a lot of those markets have been stronger. So it's been mixed end markets, but the customers are investing for forward-looking demand and to get capacity in place for forward-looking demand. And when we see utilization in those markets, we've seen it improve. So I think when people ask us for guidance, hopefully, the best thing we can tell you is Q1 and Q2 were very strong in ICAPS, and Q3 will be another strong quarter in the ICAPS market.",276,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think again, one of the advantages that we have is this broad portfolio of technologies along with integrated tools and also our integration engineering, where we're working with customers, they're really co-innovating on these different technology inflections.
So if you look at gate-all-around, we have FE, PVD, ALD, selective removal etch, thermal processing, implant, CMP and eBeam. So it's a very broad -- a broad portfolio. And I'm not going to break out all of those different pieces. But what I would say is our ability to connect that portfolio together is really a tremendous strength in our ability to co-optimize as you're thinking about -- and we've done this back in FinFET also, where we were able to co-optimize and innovate in how you're building those structures so that you can improve power and performance.

So in HBM, your customers would tell us that they're sold out, certainly for '24. For the most part, they're sold out for '25 as well. So my guess is you've got pretty good visibility into next year. Gary, you talked about overall advanced packaging doubling over the medium to long term. But when you zoom into HBM, could that business for you multiply again in '25 on a year-over-year basis?
And then on the NAND side, the business continues to be pretty depressed. Your customers, their profitability is improving. Cash flow is improving or becoming less bad. Are you starting to see purchase orders from your customers come back? Or what do they need to see for them to spend on WFE again?",138,4.0,5.0,0.7222222222222222,0.5

Toshiya, it's Brice. I'll start and then Gary may add something on the HBM. So on the sold-out comment, what we do -- we have seen utilizations improve across the DRAM wafer starts. We've seen the allocation to HBM from a wafer start perspective increase from 5% to probably something closer to 20%. That said, it's not 100% utilized. So you could speculate what the -- if there's some restraints, it could be in the packaging side, and we have seen orders for HBM going up. So we'll have to let you think about that and talk to those vendors from that perspective.
On the NAND side, our perspective on NAND is that Moore's Law is still very much alive in NAND. The bit density is increasing with each generation of NAND fairly aggressively, and it's meeting the demand function for increased bits. And what that really means is that the business we see in NAND is for technology upgrades, more technology upgrades, not really new wafer starts. So that's what we expect to see as we move forward. And overall, we expect NAND to grow at the speed of semiconductors.
It's -- obviously, storage has a very important part, and several of the vendors called out how important storage is even for AI and that it will grow. So I think for us, it's been slow, but we expect it to grow over time and memory in total to be about 1/3 of our sales for WFE.

It seems that the industry has 2 approaches to it. One is the backside wiring with direct contact with the transistors. Another once is the nano-TFE approach. I'm kind of curious. You've spoken about the 100 -- incremental $1 billion SAM for 100,000 wafer starts per month. How does it split between those 2 approaches?

That's confidential for all of those different customers. I would say that going forward, that direct connect to the backside is the path that everybody is focused on. So I think over time, that will grow a fairly significant amount -- well, both of those approaches will grow a fairly significant amount. And we're deeply engaged with customers on that inflection.
We're leading in wiring overall. We have a very, very high share of wiring. And so wiring going to the backside, we've said that, that gives us an opportunity of 50% of that spend when that inflection happens. So we're supporting both of those different types of approaches for the backside, but I don't want to get too specific in terms of which one do we see bigger over time. I think that it could move to the direct connect. 
But that timing, I don't want to give specifically because that's going to be each one of different customers' road maps. Relative to timing for revenue, it's pretty small for us right now in 2024. It will grow in '25, but the ramp -- significant ramp for backside power is still out beyond '25 in revenue.",214,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And then more broadly, of the $1.6 billion worth of DRAM business, I'm wondering if you can kind of help us figure out how much of that is China.

The only quantification that I gave in prior quarters was that our DRAM as a whole was up more than $500 million in the quarters where we had that incremental. So I think I'll just leave it at that and say it's more than $500 million in each of the last 3 quarters.
And as we look into the second half, it doesn't drop completely to 0 in Q3, but it drops significantly, and then it's pretty close to 0 in Q4. And our mix to China revenue for the company, as I highlighted to an earlier question, will be about in the range of 30%, which is normal for us. So I think that's as close as I can get on that.

Yes, for China, what I would say is the last 3 quarters have been very strong. So if we're speculating about a slowdown or a digestion period, one of the reasons I didn't reemphasize that is we're kind of going by what we're seeing. So we had 2 strong quarters, Q1, Q2. Our Q3 guide again has strength in ICAPS and a strong fourth quarter for China.
When we think about the world right now, I think we have 3 regions growing and the rest of the regions not growing. So that corresponds with the end markets sort of being mixed at this point. Our view of China overall, the team showed a pie chart of the different device elements of WFE last year. ICAPS was about 40% of WFE by that pie chart on May 2 that was put out. China is our largest market in ICAPS, and we monitor that carefully.
We've got about -- we've got a large number of customers. We're tracking about 30 different -- more than 30 factory projects that are in ramp process. In other words, they have capacity. They're adding capacity. They're ramping. We're tracking utilizations. Utilizations are improving. We understand yields are improving. So we think that the China market will be a very large and important market for us going forward. We said we don't see a cliff for that market, and I think we'd stick by all those remarks at this point.",248,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Because picture sizes get smaller, so better resolution required, but also new and more defecting yield challenges, right? So it's probably a driver of your leading-edge CFE-driven eBeam portfolio this year.
Are you guys still seeing that portfolio grow like 4x this year? And how does the pipeline look for next year? And maybe mid- to longer term, like given the significant manufacturability challenges, does the Applied team see process control and diagnostics intensity rising faster than overall WFE intensity over the next few years?",140,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

This is Gary. So I would say that for sure, the connection that we have with our eBeam technology and these major architecture inflections is a real advantage for us because, again, it's a race on who gets there first relative to those major architecture inflections and learning rate. How fast you learn is one of the determining factors. So having this unique capability is a real advantage for Applied.
I mean obviously, it's a good growth driver for us from a revenue perspective. But that synergy with the rest of our broad portfolio, our connected portfolio, is a real advantage. On cold field emission, which is really one of the key technologies in the electron optics, it gives us the highest resolution, add up to 10x higher imaging speeds. So it really is highly differentiated. And we are still on track this year to grow our CFE systems revenue around 4x in '24, and that would represent about 50% of our total eBeam system sales.
And then when I look forward, again, I see PDC as a really great growth driver for Applied. We've had the strongest pipeline of new products than we've ever had. And the synergy with the rest of our process equipment business, all of that materials magic, materials innovation is increasing.

With record revenues in our third quarter and earnings toward the high end of our guided range, Applied Materials continues to deliver strong results in 2024. Secular trends are growing our available market, and our unique and connected portfolio of capabilities, products and services positions us to outperform the industry over the longer term. 
At our recent investor event at SEMICON West, leaders from our semiconductor business shared their perspective on the powerful multi-decade technology trends driving the industry forward and explained the role Applied is playing to enable the next generation of semiconductor technology. In today's call, I will summarize some of the key themes we talked about at that event, including how advancing energy-efficient computing performance is critical to deploying AI at scale, why the energy-efficient computing road map is increasingly enabled by materials engineering and Applied Materials, and how we're working in new ways to accelerate this complex road map and create new growth opportunities for Applied. 
Semiconductors provide the foundation for tectonic shifts in technology that will reshape the global economy over the next several decades, including AI, IoT, robotics, electric and autonomous vehicles and clean energy. These multitrillion dollar global inflections are increasing demand for chips and driving the need for significant advances in semiconductor technology. 
The biggest tectonic shift of all is AI. And the race for AI leadership will, in large part, be determined by which companies in the semiconductor industry are first to deliver substantial improvements in energy-efficient compute performance. In our discussions with leading AI companies, they are telling us that reducing power per operation is now more important than increasing operations per second. They are also talking about the need to drive a 10,000x improvement in performance per watt over the next 15 years. 
Evolutionary innovation is insufficient to deliver improvements of this magnitude, and we're seeing the emergence of a new industry playbook made up of major device architecture inflections in logic, memory and advanced packaging. These device architecture inflections are increasingly enabled by materials science and materials engineering, where Applied is the clear market and technology leader. 
For AI, the advanced chips in a data center used for training AI models are built upon 4 critical categories of semiconductor technology, leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, enabled by die stacking technology, and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together in a single integrated package. 
In leading-edge logic, key device inflections in both transistor and interconnect are currently moving from chip makers' R&D pilot lines to high-volume production. The transition from FinFET to gate-all-around transistors grows Applied's available market for the transistor module from around $6 billion to approximately $7 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. We also expect to gain share through the gate-all-around transition, and we're on track to capture more than 50% of the process equipment spending for the transistor fabrication steps. 
For the interconnect module, our available market is also about $6 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month. We forecast this will also grow by about $1 billion with the implementation of backside power delivery, and we expect to win more than 50% of the applications we address in interconnect when backside power ramps in volume manufacturing. 
In DRAM, we've also established clear leadership in process equipment and are in a great position for future growth. Over the past decade, we've grown our market share in DRAM by around 10 points. As DRAM plays a critical role in energy-efficient computing performance, there is a huge focus on advancing the road map. The next major DRAM inflection from 6F squared to 4F squared, or vertical transistor architectures, is materials enabled. And we expect our market opportunity to grow by approximately 10% to around $6.5 billion for each 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. We also expect to increase our share based on our position to enable the 4F squared inflection. In addition, we believe the subsequent transition to 3D DRAM will grow our addressable market by an incremental 15%, further compounding Applied's opportunity. 
In the die stacking technologies that enable high-bandwidth memory, we also have strong leadership positions, both in micro-bump and through-silicon via. We have seen demand for high-bandwidth memory accelerating in 2024 and expect to generate more than $600 million of HBM packaging revenue this year, which is approximately 6x 2023. Overall, including HBM, we expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.7 billion in 2024. We believe this business can double in size over the next several years as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted and we introduce new solutions that grow our addressable market. 
Advanced logic, high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging are all great examples of how future device architecture inflections are increasingly enabled by materials engineering. As a result, we expect materials engineering as a percentage of total wafer fab equipment to grow in both logic and memory through the coming node transitions. At the same time, thanks to our inflection-focused approach to R&D and the strong positions we've established at these future device architecture inflections, we expect to capture more of the expanded opportunities we serve. 
The value of bringing next-generation semiconductor technology to market faster has never been greater. At Applied, our strategy and investments are focused on accelerating the industry's road map to support the highest growth rates, global inflections, spanning AI data centers, edge AI and IoT, robotics, electric vehicles and clean energy. This strategy is enabled by 3 pillars. 
First, we have built a broad, unique and connected portfolio of highly enabling technologies. As well as providing traditional best-in-class unit processes, we can co-optimize, combine and integrate our technologies to deliver more comprehensive solutions that address higher-value challenges for our customers. These integrated fab-in-a-fab solutions have grown from approximately 20% of our semiconductor products revenue in 2019 to around 30% today. We expect demand for our integrated products to continue growing both at the leading-edge and from our ICAPS customers who are serving specialty markets. 
Second, we are changing the way we work inside and outside the company. Over the past 5 years, we have built new capabilities and dedicated teams focused on module integration, device design and simulation, data analytics and AI, advanced packaging and ICAPS. At the same time, we are driving earlier, deeper and more extensive collaboration with our customers and partners to win the device architecture inflection races, accelerate mutual success rates and increase investment efficiencies. 
To further support these collaborative partnerships, we will build out our global EPIC platform over the next several years, which is specifically designed for high-velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. 
And third, we are helping customers transfer new technology into high-volume manufacturing faster and then optimize performance, yield, output and cost in their factory operations. This is supporting double-digit growth in services, with a high percentage of our service revenue coming from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. Overall, AGS delivered another record quarter which is their 20th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. 
Before I hand over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Applied Materials is delivering record results in 2024, and we're in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer term. Semiconductors are the foundation for tectonic shifts in technology, which will reshape the global economy over the next several decades. This is driving increasing demand for chips as well as the need for significant advances in semiconductor innovation. 
The race for AI leadership depends on delivering significant improvements in energy-efficient compute performance in the range of 10,000x over the next 15 years. The need for more energy-efficient compute is driving major device architecture inflections within the semiconductor road map that are enabled by materials engineering and Applied Materials innovations. This expands our served market and is accretive to our share. And the increasingly complex industry road map creates new collaboration and growth opportunities for Applied, enabled by our broad, unique and connected portfolio of capabilities, products and services. 
Finally, as you may be aware, Mike Sullivan will be retiring at the end of this calendar year and handing the reins to Liz Morali, who recently joined Applied as our new Head of Investor Relations. I would like to say a huge thank you to Mike for his many contributions to the success of our company and congratulate him on an outstanding career. 
Now over to Brice.",1407,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2024",2024-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3496.0,3231190.0,114840371.0,Presenter Speech,Brice Hill,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Gary, and I'd like to thank our teams for their strong execution this quarter, which enabled us to deliver record revenue, improved operational performance and healthy gross margin. Today, I'll summarize the market environment, discuss our Q3 performance and share our Q4 outlook. 
As Gary mentioned, Mike Sullivan plans to retire from Applied at the end of this calendar year. Liz Morali has joined Applied as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike and Liz are working on a smooth handoff of the IR function beginning with our November earnings call. I hope you'll join Gary and me in congratulating Mike on his extraordinary career and leadership, and welcoming Liz to Applied Materials. 
Beginning with the business environment, our revenue in Q3 as well as our outlook for Q4 reflect the industry's focus on the major inflections Gary highlighted earlier. We are seeing particularly strong pull related to AI and data center computing. Specifically, our DRAM system shipments remain strong, even as DRAM sales in China declined as anticipated. Adoption of high-bandwidth memory and other forms of advanced packaging continues to grow. And in foundry-logic, leading-edge investment is growing each quarter and becoming a larger percentage of our mix, while ICAPS demand remains strong overall. 
Turning to our Q3 performance. We delivered record revenue of $6.78 billion, which was up 5% year-over-year, with growth in all 3 segments. Operationally, we saw improvements in a number of key metrics such as manufacturing cycle times, linearity and on-time delivery. These improvements give me confidence that we are preparing the company to more efficiently support the growth we are forecasting in the years ahead. The strong operational performance helped us deliver non-GAAP gross margin of 47.4%, which is up 100 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.26 billion were up 8% year-over-year, and over 70% of the increase was driven by R&D programs aimed at the technology inflections Gary described. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.12 was up 12% year-over-year and $0.01 below our highest EPS quarter ever. 
Turning to cash flows and profit distributions in Q3. We generated nearly $2.4 billion in operating cash flow and over $2 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders, including the first $0.40 per share dividend and $861 million in stock buybacks. 
Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems sales were $4.92 billion in Q3, up 5% year-over-year. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. From a device perspective, our DRAM sales grew nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.16 billion. Our DRAM sales in China declined sequentially as we anticipated, and this contributed to our company revenue in China declining by 11 percentage points sequentially to 32%, which is in line with our longer-term average inclusive of Semi Systems, AGS and Display. 
Our NAND memory sales grew 10% year-over-year to $203 million. Our foundry-logic sales were down 4% year-over-year to $3.56 billion. Leading-edge foundry-logic demand was lower year-over-year but continued to strengthen on a sequential basis. We continue to expect to generate more than $2.5 billion in system revenue from gate-all-around nodes this calendar year, with the potential to more than double next year. 
Our ICAPS business remains strong overall, with pockets of weakness in the auto and industrial end markets. Longer term, we expect the ICAPS market to remain around half the foundry-logic market as major inflections in IoT, autonomous and electric vehicles and the global energy transformation are expected to drive mid-to-high single-digit through-cycle growth in ICAPS semiconductors well into the future. We are investing in new products to compete in more areas of the ICAPS semiconductor and packaging ecosystem. We are also working with our customers to enable new power and sensor device architecture inflections using our co-optimized and integrated materials systems. 
Next, Applied Global Services delivered record revenue of $1.58 billion in Q3, which was up 8% year-over-year. AGS recurring parts, services and software revenue grew more than twice as fast as overall segment revenue during the quarter. AGS non-GAAP operating margin of 29.6% was up 230 basis points year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating profit was a record $467 million. From a business perspective, customer factory utilization continued to strengthen during the quarter across memory, foundry-logic and advanced packaging. 
Our leading indicators of future AGS growth remain positive. Our installed base of systems and chambers increased 7% year-over-year, and our average revenue per unit increased even more. Our average subscription agreement length increased to 2.8 years, and the renewal rate was above 90%. We continue to expect AGS to grow at a low double-digit rate over the long term. 
As a reminder, the consistency of our profitable growth in services gives us confidence in our ability to continue to increase our dividend per share. In fact, over the past 10 years, we have increased the dividend per share at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15%. 
Moving to Display. Q3 revenue of $251 million was up 7% year-over-year, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 6.4%. While LCD equipment spending remains low, we are becoming more confident that the OLED technology found in smartphones will be adopted in notebook PCs and tablets, whose larger screen sizes will require a significant increase in capital investments. Applied has built a leadership position in deposition and eBeam metrology technologies for the display industry, and we are well positioned to enable our customers to convert the notebook PC and tablet markets to OLED technology over the coming years. 
Now I'll share our guidance for Q4. We expect company revenue of $6.93 billion plus or minus $400 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.18 plus or minus $0.18, both up 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $5.1 billion, which is up 4% year-over-year; AGS revenue of about $1.61 billion, which is up 9% year-over-year; and Display revenue of around $200 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47.4% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.275 billion. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of 12.5%. 
Thank you. And now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.",1016,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Obviously, tremendous strength anything AI-related. But elsewhere, kind of seasonal at best.
So I guess, first part of the question is can you share with us how you're thinking about your silicon business in the second half of calendar '24 versus the first half? And then the early signs that you see today and how that informs kind of your view, both positive and negative into 2025?",103,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

C.J., thanks for joining the call. I think what we're seeing in the business today when we look at Q3 and our Q4 outlook, very strong energy around the AI inflections that Gary talked about. So leading-edge is accelerating, we highlighted that in the prepared remarks. We're -- our forecast for $2.5 billion of gate-all-around related equipment in this fiscal year, we haven't changed that forecast. That stays the same. And when we think about DRAM and HBM memory, those kind of all go along with this energy we're seeing around the AI inflections and investments in that area.
At the same time, our ICAPS business, in both Q3 and Q4, remains very strong. We think that's robust, and we can dig into that a little bit more during the call. But if anything, over the last 30 days, you asked us how we're feeling about the outlook, I would say the ICAPS business continues. It seems like every quarter, we sort of raise our expectations with respect to ICAPS. So a lot of energy around leading-edge, ICAPS remaining strong, very strong year for DRAM and HBM. Those are kind of the key themes.
For '25, we're not giving specific guidance. But we'd just say we're pretty enthusiastic about gate-all-around and the technologies we've talked about on the leading-edge.",220,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It sounds like a lot of that was DRAM. I guess that's -- was it all DRAM? And then in the guidance for next quarter and, I guess, your expectations going forward from there, do you expect the China mix to be staying around these levels in the low 30% or does it go higher or lower?

Thanks for joining, Stacy. So yes, on the 32%, I'll shift your perspective on that just a little bit. So the 32% is almost no DRAM to China. So you've got it right. Our business mix to China declined to 32%. And if I think back in time, just to remind everybody, if we go just over a year back, it was like 17% mix to China. We were having supply chain issues. So it was very low at that point.
In the last 3 quarters, we bounced up to the mid-40s, where we served the DRAM that we could ship, and that's the prior 3 quarters. And we feel this quarter, 32% is probably normal for us or in the normal range for us. That's across our entire business for shipments to China. And what it really represents is ICAPS. And the ICAPS market in total has been very robust. We think it will be a record year in our fiscal year for ICAPS.
In China also, we would call it robust. There's -- we're adding customers, utilizations are improving. It's a wide variety of products and factories. So we think that market is robust, both in Q3 and in Q4. So that gives you a sense of what's happening for us. And then next quarter, we'll have a small amount of DRAM, but nothing like we've had the prior 3 quarters.",234,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And then also ICAPS, you said the demand is pretty strong in China. Can you talk to what kind of trends you're seeing outside of China for ICAPS?",76,2.0,5.0,0.6111111111111112,0.5

Thanks, Srini. So the China DRAM in Q3 and Q4 will be at nominal levels. We have speculated you may see new investments in DRAM there. I don't have any comments to make on that specifically for the road map. But I would say that DRAM globally is very strong. It should be a very, very strong year for DRAM. Of course, that includes some of that China volume. But we think that goes along with the mix to HBM and utilizations in DRAM have improved, and there's a lot of energy around the high-bandwidth memory for the leading-edge systems.
And then on the ICAPS side, no surprise here for probably anybody. We expect the edge technologies that we describe as ICAPS to grow mid-to-high single digits over time. And that's driven by the inflections that we talk about, which is clean energy, renewable power, electrification, those sorts of AI edge sensors, all those sorts of usages. So mid-to-high single digits is our view long term.
And when we look at China for both Q3 and Q4 and the entire ICAPS business, I said before, it's probably going to be a record for us in our fiscal year, and it's not just China. We've had regions, other regions grow during this quarter.",213,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

You're right. We won't give a guide for '25 specifically, but we do think the DRAM -- even outside of HBM, we do think the DRAM will put new capacity in place, so we expect investment in DRAM. There has been additions in wafer start capacity in DRAM. And there's more allocation of the DRAM capacity to HBM, as you sort of highlight, so the investment level there is higher than NAND.
Looking forward in NAND, NAND still -- it still remains fairly low. But we did see, as I highlighted, utilizations improving. I would call them probably normal range for both DRAM and NAND. We see prices improve. We saw inventory positions improve at the vendors. So we think it's a more positive environment looking forward than prior quarters for actually both memory technologies.",137,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We grew 8% year-over-year in Q3. 9% is our expectation for Q4. And just a reminder for everybody, we expect low double-digit growth going forward. We're expanding our services book with customers kind of getting into information AI-related services that help them ramp, et cetera.
We actually did expect a little more growth in Q3. We had thought we would grow double digits this year. We're just short of that. And it's because utilization, while it grew, it grew a little bit less than we -- or a little bit slower than we thought. So there's good news here, utilizations are improving across the whole system, 8% year-over-year growth for us. And we expect that to pick up, as I highlighted, as we go into Q3 and looking forward.
And just one other comment, just for the rest of the investors. The other thing with this business, since it's mostly recurring revenue for us, about 85%, that gives us a very stable operating profit and growing.

It was probably stable this year with HBM, high-bandwidth memory, driving the growth in that area. And again, we would point back to the energy around high-performance systems and sort of the race Gary talks about to develop systems optimized for the AI workloads. So there's a lot of energy there at this point.

Toshi, I'll start on that. So 47.4% gross margin for us in the quarter, we're actually very pleased with our performance in cost and pricing this quarter. And I'll just highlight, as our mix to China, which are generally smaller customers, declined during the quarter to 32%, that gave us some headwinds on the gross margin side. We were able to get some pricing performance and also some cost improvements and improvements in managing our inventory that helped us offset that mix decline and deliver 47.4% in the quarter.
Since the China mix is 32%, we call that normal. I'll say now that 47.4% should be approximately our baseline level. And then we look forward, we've talked about a goal of getting to 48% or higher next year. That's still our goal. We think we can make improvements going forward.
There's a couple of headwinds. If services or display grow faster than the core business, that can be a headwind. But that's still our goal, and we think we'll make -- continue to make cost and pricing improvements. And then, Gary, on the...",184,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Whoever gets there first wins big, and everybody else is left behind. So we're driving tremendous innovations in foundry-logic, leading-edge, high-bandwidth memory, DRAM. There's new architecture inflections. I talked about 4F squared, advanced packaging. So our positions in all of those inflections are very strong.

So what we're hearing is that most of today's designs on these next-generation chips are targeting tape-out second half of '25 and beyond. They're specifically focused around these new 3D SOIC architectures, so using hybrid bonding, chip stacking approach, 3-nanometer on 3-nanometer die, 2-nanometer die on 3-nanometer die. The manufacturability challenges here are pretty significant, right?
But similar to your front-end integrated solutions, I mean, the team has been working on an integrated hybrid bonding system with some of your partners. What's the time line for introducing these integrated solutions? And will you be trying to intercept these next generation of 3D SOIC solutions coming to market, let's say, in the 2026 time frame?",168,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

So heterogeneous integration is one of the biggest areas of focus for Applied and for the entire industry. At our AI event, along with AMD at SEMICON, there was a discussion around driving a 100x improvement in energy-efficient computing. So again, this is the big race that everybody is focused on. And certainly, packaging is a key part of that. So we're in deep engagement.
It's really multiple technology nodes 5, 10 years out into the future. And there's going to be tremendous innovations. If you look even at new DRAM technologies like 4F squared or high-bandwidth memory, you're going to see adoption of hybrid bonding technologies that are going to be really important for those parts of this ecosystem, and you mentioned what's happening from a logic standpoint.
So I think the great thing for Applied is we have this broad portfolio in packaging. We have, as you mentioned, the hybrid bonding, digital lithography. We have other new technologies in the pipeline that even expand our portfolio further. We have an advanced full-flow packaging lab in Singapore, where we're driving co-innovation with our customers to accelerate those architecture inflections.
So I think this is going to be one of the most exciting segments of the market going forward. We're at about $1.7 billion today. We've talked about doubling the packaging revenue over the next few years. And I think it's going to keep going from there.

It looks like your China revenue has well passed the peak, around almost $3 billion per quarter level, and now it's down to like in the low $2 billion. And based on the commentary, it sounds like you are still expecting roughly 40%-ish of the China revenue growth year-on-year.
But I mean, should the current dollar revenue level sustains into this year, I'm just hoping if you can give us any color because that would imply that China revenue probably is going down year-on-year roughly 15%, 20% next year. I know you're not guiding, but that will be the conclusion I draw up on all the commentary you provided.
Plus, I do want to get a little bit more insight.

I think I would separate between ICAPS, our -- the edge technology markets, and the DRAM market for China. We had 3 quarters with elevated shipments that we described when we caught up on what was allowed from a DRAM perspective. If you separate that out, we're currently not expecting that to repeat, at least nothing near that magnitude for next year, so that leaves us with the ICAPS market.
And what we expect in the ICAPS market, our Q3 and Q4 and all of this year has been very strong in ICAPS. When we look at China, in particular, utilizations are improving. We have -- we're adding customers. We've got a large number of factory projects that are building out.

We think that's going to be a really strong business. Over -- I think many of the people on the call know that over 5 years ago, it's actually April 12, 2019, we formed our ICAPS group.

Your comment on what's happening on the different device segments.

If you could give us an update with the progression towards that 48%, 49% gross margin target, I assume that's for fiscal year '25. And how the funding for the EPIC R&D center, which I think is a $4 billion project, is going to impact those targets?",55,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks, Mehdi. So the update, the gross margin of 47.4%, we expect to make -- we talked about very gradual improvements as we work towards that 48%. And that would still be my expectation. You see actually the movement between last quarter and this quarter was modest. We fought those headwinds that we had from a mix perspective.
On the EPIC, we're -- we did get the notice that we're not getting the grants. But EPIC, that's an important platform for us. It stands for equipment process innovation and commercialization. It's going to allow us to accelerate co-innovation with all of our customers. We are continuing with that investment. It will elevate our CapEx as we look forward. And we are benefiting from the investment tax credit that's related to those types of projects. So we still do have some help from the government from that perspective.
And just a couple of other modeling notes since we're on CapEx. So as we look forward, the CapEx will -- for the EPIC center and in general will be at a higher run rate than we've had in the past. If you look forward in your modeling, I just want to highlight that Q1 will be our normal step-up for pay-related increases and that you can look at the history to see what that step-up should look like if you're modeling that.
And then the last piece would be our tax rate. Tax rate next year, expectation will be 14% versus the 12.5% this year, as more of our mix will be -- more of our worldwide mix will be U.S. related, so that will change the tax mix. So thanks for the opportunity to get those in there.",288,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Mehdi, this is Gary. Maybe just a little bit more color on EPIC. As we've talked about, the whole industry is in a race to be first to market to deliver innovations for energy-efficient computing. So we -- in discussions with our partners, our customers and partners, we really believe that EPIC can enable us to innovate the way we innovate, really innovate in parallel, so accelerating both for our customers and partners and for Applied our ability to bring those energy-efficient innovations to market. So the concept, we're getting tremendous traction and pull with our customers and partners.
And we also think of EPIC as a global platform. So where we make investments is going to be based on incentives, talent, proximity to innovation, ecosystem. So we are moving forward for sure with this EPIC concept. Very good traction with customers. And again, over the last several years, we've built out this innovation engine inside Applied Materials. We have architecture innovation teams that are working on ICAPS. They're working on foundry-logic and DRAM and packaging. We have this unique and connected portfolio of materials innovations that are crucial for all of those major inflections.
So EPIC is a way for us to innovate, the way we innovate, to move all of that in parallel, to accelerate all of these major inflections that are crucial for AI, data center and all those major tectonic shifts in technology that we talked about earlier. But again, where we invest is going to be based on incentives, talent and proximity to local innovation ecosystem.",262,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Thanks, Mike. From my perspective, I'm pleased that the investments we've been making in the technology road map inflections and also in our operational capabilities are showing up in our financial results this quarter on both the revenue and gross margin lines. I believe we've put the company in a great position to grow along with mega-trends like data center AI as a whole host of new technologies come to market across leading-edge, foundry-logic, DRAM, advanced packaging and ICAPS specialty chips.
We have the fuel we need to keep driving the materials engineering road map with our customers, while also distributing profits to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
