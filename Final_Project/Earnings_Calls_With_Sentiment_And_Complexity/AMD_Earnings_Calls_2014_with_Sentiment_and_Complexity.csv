168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2014",2014-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3612.0,612330.0,27618507.0,Presenter Speech,Rory Read,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 28% from the year-ago period. The 12% sequential revenue decline from the previous quarter was better than our expectations due to healthy demand for our newest Radeon GPUs and semi-custom gaming APUs. This is our third consecutive quarter of delivering non-GAAP profitability, and we also saw an improvement in EPS of $0.15 from the year-ago period. 
Our first quarter performance demonstrate the success that we are having transforming AMD's business. We are consistently executing and delivering on our commitments. Our strategy is working, and we are building a foundation for continued profitability and growth as we transform AMD. We are on track to generate approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth markets, including embedded, semi-custom, dense server, professional graphics and ultra low-power clients where we can create differentiated winning solutions by the end of 2015.  
There was strong demand in the first quarter for AMD-powered Microsoft and Sony game consoles. These consoles continued to outpace previous generation ramps and drove continued momentum in the semi-custom business. The success of these 2 products is an excellent example of the power of our strategy. When our unique IP and design expertise is married with the ingenuity and product ideas from our customers, we jointly delivered tailored market-changing solutions that win. We believe that our semi-custom business will continue to realize strong growth as gaming consoles ramp throughout the year. We remain on track to capture 1 to 2 new semi-custom design wins this year as well. 
Now turning to AMD's Embedded business. Revenue increased by double digits from the year-ago period. We continue to win designs with strategic market makers in key verticals such as digital signage, medical and thin client to name a few. Consistent with our strategy to participate in a much broader portion of this market, we see an approximately $9 billion total addressable market for our high-performance embedded SoCs and processors. This margin-accretive business is also characterized by product cycles that last up to 5 years, providing a more predictable and consistent revenue stream. 
In our Professional Graphics business, we delivered sequential growth in the first quarter. We believe we gained share, highlighted by the launch of Apple Mac Pro, which uses 2 of AMD's industry-leading FirePro GPUs. We are expanding our professional GPU products with the announcement of our new flagship FirePro W9100. This GPU is attracting significant interest from video, design and engineering professionals who need to work at the latest 4K resolutions and beyond. We are also continuing to make investments to accelerate our growth by strengthening our relationships with key professional ISVs and customers that dominate market share. 
In our dense server business, revenue also increased sequentially. This was highlighted by Verizon's ongoing deployment of AMD's SeaMicro-based dense servers that are powering the world's largest public cloud solutions. The dense server market is projected to be approximately 25% of the overall server market by 2019, and we intend to lead this transition with our unique fabric technology and 64-bit processors. 
We have also reached a significant milestone in our ambidextrous strategy. We introduced the Atom, our first 64-bit ARM server processor and the industry's first at 28-nanometer technology, positioning AMD as the only SoC provider to bridge the x86 and ARM ecosystems for server applications. We are excited to announce that we have started sampling Seattle this last quarter and plan to ship in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now let's turn to our traditional businesses. In graphics, we see strong demand in the enthusiast portion of the market. Our industry-leading R7 and R9 products drove GPU revenue growth year-over-year and sequentially. And we also started to see the ramp of new mobile discrete design wins. And we believe this momentum will continue, and we expect to gain market share. 
In our personal computing business, our mobile APU unit shipments increased sequentially in the first quarter as our customers prepare to introduce notebooks powered by our newest Beema and Kaveri APUs. In the desktop channel, we continue to build momentum in the upper part of our portfolio as we enrich our product mix. Our high-end A8 and A10 APUs had a second straight quarter of record unit shipments. We continue to build a stronger desktop portfolio, ramping our high-end Kaveri APUs and introducing our first low-power socketed APU for the desktop channel this past quarter. We expect these APUs will drive revenue growth in the coming quarters. 
The PC market continues to remain challenging. We are seeing signs that the market decline is slowing and potentially stabilizing as some of the softness in consumer is being offset by demand for commercial PCs. Based on this, we now expect overall PC shipments will decline approximately 7% to 10% for the year, and we are positioned to take advantage of this based on our strategy to gain share in parts of the market where we are currently underrepresented. For example, in the commercial client market, we expect to more than double the number of designs that will come to market from our key OEM partners compared to last year. As a result, we believe we will deliver sequential PC revenue growth in the coming quarters of 2014. 
Since our last earnings call, we also successfully concluded our 2014 WSA amendment with GLOBALFOUNDRIES and re-profiled our near-term debt, both of which will help us accomplish our financial goals for 2014 and beyond. Devinder will cover both of these topics in detail later in the call. 
So in summary, we continue to hit all of our key milestones and product commitments as part of our long-term strategy to transform AMD. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that we are making significant progress building the strong foundation required to deliver consistent profitability and revenue growth. Our growth businesses continue to gain momentum, and we remain on track to diversify our revenue base, generating approximately 50% of our revenue from our high-growth businesses by the end of the next year. We also see the PC market beginning to stabilize, and we are well positioned to grow revenue throughout the year. Finally, based on the strength of our industry-leading graphics products, we believe we will gain share and grow GPU revenue in 2014. Based on this momentum, we remain firmly committed to delivering profitability and revenue growth for the full year in 2014. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Devinder.",1074,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2014",2014-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3612.0,612330.0,27618508.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. Our first quarter results demonstrated continued financial and operational discipline and execution. Our gross margin and revenue came in at or better than expected despite the seasonally down demand environment, and we achieved non-GAAP net income profitability and earnings per share for the third quarter in a row. Building on the momentum we established in the second half of 2013, 2014 is off to a good start. 
Additionally, we successfully completed a couple of significant transactions by re-profiling our debt and concluding the fourth amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement, or WSA, with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Under the revised WSA agreement, we expect wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES to be approximately $1.2 billion in 2014 on a take-or-pay basis. Our 2014 wafer purchases are in line with our current PC market expectations and also include the manufacturing of certain GPU and semi-custom game console products at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. There are no special payment triggers as part of the fourth amendment of the Wafer Supply Agreement or 2014. In Q1 2014, we spent approximately $250 million on wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 
Let me now provide some specifics on the quarter. Revenue in the first quarter of 2014 was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 12% from the previous quarter and an increase of 28% year-over-year. Typically, the first quarter of the year is a seasonally down quarter, and the sequential decline was driven by decreased sales of both our traditional and semi-custom products. 
Gross margin was 35%, flat sequentially. The first quarter result includes a $4 million benefit from the sale of previously reserved inventory in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to a $7 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $421 million and down from $462 million in Q4 2013. GAAP operating expenses were $438 million and include a $14 million charge for workforce rebalancing severance expenses as part of the ongoing transformation and diversification strategy at AMD as we continue to increasingly focus and deploy appropriate resources to our high-growth opportunities. 
Consistent with our strategy to transform AMD and manage for sustainable profitability, non-GAAP operating income was $66 million and non-GAAP net income was $12 million, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.02, calculated using 761 million diluted shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $139 million, a decrease of $26 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to reduced operating income. 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $663 million, down 8% sequentially, in line with seasonal trends. The decrease was primarily due to lower desktop and chipset unit shipments, partially offset by higher notebook unit shipments. Computing Solutions operating loss was $3 million, an improvement from an operating loss of $7 million in the fourth quarter despite the sequential $8 million (sic) [8%] or $59 million decline in revenue. This was driven primarily by lower operating expenses. 
Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue was $734 million, down $131 million or 15% from the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease in sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $91 million compared to an operating income of $121 million in the prior quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long-term marketable securities, totaled $982 million at the end of the quarter, close to our optimal balance of $1 billion and well above our target minimum of $600 million. During Q1 2014, we also made the final $200 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES related to the reduction of the take-or-pay wafer obligation commitments for 2012. Inventory was $869 million, down $15 million or 2% sequentially, as we reduced graphics inventory. 
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.14 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased $64 million of our 6% convertible notes due in May 2015 in the open market utilizing cash on hand. We also issued $600 million in principal value of 6 3/4% notes due in March 2019, utilizing the proceeds to extinguish most of our 6% convertible notes due in May 2015 and approximately $50 million of our 8 1/8% notes due in December 2017. The remaining net proceeds of approximately $80 million borrowed under the new debt issuance will be used to pay down or repurchase outstanding debt in due course. By executing these transactions, we have pushed out the maturity of a significant portion of our near-term debt and now have no significant term debt maturities pending until December 2017, a period of more than 3.5 years.
Accounts payable at the end of the quarter was $483 million, down slightly from $519 million in the fourth quarter. Lastly, we had negative free cash flow of $225 million in Q1 2014, largely due to the previously mentioned $200 million payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 
Now turning to the outlook. For the second quarter of 2014, AMD expects revenue to increase 3% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $435 million. Inventory is expected to increase slightly from the first quarter. And cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, is expected to be approximately $1 billion. 
In closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results in a seasonally down quarter. We have started 2014 with continued financial and operational discipline and maintained non-GAAP net income profitability for the third quarter in a row. We are making continued progress in our strategic transformation journey with the goal of transitioning approximately 50% of our revenues to high-growth adjacent markets and businesses by the end of 2015. Our focus in 2014 remains on managing for profitability as we work to deliver full year revenue growth and net income profitability.

Yes, absolutely. What we've seen is the commercial market has been a bit stronger, whether that's driven by the XP refresh work that's gone on through April or its continuing refresh across commercial. I do believe commercial is going to be a bit stronger this year than we anticipated based on that XP refresh and the strength of the overall economic environment. And I think that's offsetting a bit of the pressure that we're continuing to see in consumer from tablet. I think the PC market will be down, no question, and I believe that it's down 7% to 10%. And it's really driven on that strength of the commercial space. As it relates to us, though, Betsy, what I like about what we're doing is the diversification strategy is really taking hold. What we're trying to do is to win in the desktop space as well as capture in the underrepresented commercial segment for AMD. And that's why I talked about in the early part of the call that we see the opportunity for us, AMD, to grow our PC revenue in the coming quarters of 2014.",190,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Betsy, this is Lisa. Maybe let me give you a little color on that. So yes, relative to what we saw was very much in line with our strategy that we've been laying out on improving the mix of our product. So in the desktop channel in the first quarter, we launched Kaveri at the high end of the stack. So from that standpoint, it did very well, and that was a big driver for us in terms of the mix improvement. And in the notebook business, we also saw that we're starting to launch some of our new products that will go into market later in the second quarter. So we started shipping Beema in the notebook segment. And both of those helped to keep the ASPs at that flattish range.",133,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Microsoft had a very good launch with the Titanfall game. These are perfect examples of how when we combine our IP and design expertise with their great ideas, we can really breathe life and create a real change in the marketplace. We see that in embedded. We see that in semi-custom. We see that in Pro Graphics. These are all areas, dense server, where we see opportunity for us to continue to build on that momentum.

This is Lisa. Let me give you some guidance there. So in terms of how the game consoles have behaved, I mean, they've actually done quite well. There were some seasonality in the first quarter coming off of a very strong holiday season, but we've been pleased with the results. And relative to inventory, we don't see any significant inventory buildup in the channel.

And then last very quick one on the long term. You guys clearly now stabilized the business. So as we think about your longer-term targets, which is to get 50% of revenues from semi-custom, what does that imply for the business model in terms of gross and operating margins? Because your gross margins have come down to the mid-30s level.

So what we talked about in terms of the strategic view is we want to enter into these growth segments. We used to be a business centered over one stream of revenue, one opportunity, the PC market. Now we've introduced 5 new ones with our traditional space that 6 key markets where we can leverage our core IP. We see this is an opportunity to consistently grow and to consistently expand profitability. We'll look through 2014, '15, '16, '17 as an opportunity for us to lift this revenue consistence -- consistently and deliver profitability. I don't think we're ready yet to say what that growth rate is because we're in the transformation phase.

You mentioned 50% on the semi-custom space. The 50% target at the end of 2015 in addition to semi-custom, which obviously is a big piece, also includes dense server, professional graphics, embedded. All of those 3 are higher than the corporate average from a gross margin standpoint. Semi-custom, you called it right, their gross margin is lower than corporate margin, but it's operating margin accretive. And then we have the ultra low-power business. That's part of the mix that Rory mentioned in terms of the 6 total businesses that we are focused on to get to the 50% by the end of 2015.",107,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So let me take that and give you a little bit of our thinking. So in terms of product and technology selection, yes, certainly, we need to be at the leading edge of the technology roadmap. So what we've said in the past is certainly, this year, all of our products are in 28-nanometer across both graphics, client and our semi-custom business. We are actively in the design phase for 20-nanometer, and that will come to production. And then clearly, we'll go to FinFET. So that will be the progression of it.

So Chris, yes, the graphics market were certainly good for us in the first quarter. We were pleased with the performance. What we did see is we did see strong demand, particularly in the enthusiast and performance segments with our R9 and R7. We did have, let's call it, a supply not quite meeting demand for the first quarter, and that was largely due to just, like I said, high demand. We expect that to catch up in the second quarter. But relative to the Bitcoin or the Litecoin stuff, the way we look at it is we're designing these products to be leadership graphics gaming capability. We have a lot of investment in the ecosystem and all of the other things like our project Mantle that really gets the software ISVs optimizing to AMD. So we think that's driving long-term demand.

So Hans, when we look at sort of what we're doing with our product portfolio, it's really about building a balanced portfolio. Clearly, low-end tablets are very competitive, and we are not going after the very low end of the space. And we're looking at a balanced portfolio around both profitability and share. And so for Mullins and Beema, I mean, I think we have a saw strong set of design wins for those products. We expect those to launch in Q2 and build through the second half of the year. And what we're looking to do with those products is really get a clear portfolio mix. So we'll be very aggressive at the low end where we need to be for the entry-level notebooks, but we want to balance that with enough profitability up the stack.

So Andrew, so on the semi-custom side, as we said, there's a wide range of opportunities. These are usually larger opportunities that drive higher volume and can justify a semi-custom NRE and engineering expense. So things like gaming, of course, mobility, enterprise applications and sort of other consumer, things like living room-type applications, would be kind of semi-custom sort of high-volume stuff. Relative to embedded, we really see embedded as a very interesting long-term growth opportunity because it fits very well with our APUs and our GPUs and we're able to differentiate and call visual embedded-type solutions.

You have the dense server piece of it and then the richer PC market mix on the commercial space. All of those in combination are higher than corporate average gross margin. So that's obviously good. The PC market environment, obviously, is a factor. And we see that, at least from where we were, the 10% down to the 7%, 10% on improving. If we attack the richer mix there, that could benefit the gross margin. And part of the mix here is because the semi-custom business is slightly different -- is a different model. You have lower than corporate average gross margin, but it's accretive, accretive to the operating margin line. And that is where the mix and the interplay happens for the gross margin for the short term and also for longer term as we continue to diversify our product portfolio.",179,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I may not get that specific or granular in terms of the various parts that you mentioned, but if you recall, 2013, we had an original agreement at about $1.2 billion. As we walked into 2013 with the relationship and the partnership, we took $200 million less wafers in 2013 without any special payments or penalties. As we go into 2014, we looked at the demand profile. We have taken about $250 million in Q1 of 2014. And the overall purchases on a take-or-pay basis for 2014 of $1.2 billion, what I can tell you is everything we've talked about the PC business, the purchases of the PC product from GLOBALFOUNDRIES is in line with our business expectations.

Let me try to answer that. So the Pro Graphics business is definitely a growth opportunity for that. You've heard that in our -- it's part of those 5 segments or 5 businesses that we think will drive to that 50%. Without getting into exact numbers, I would say we're quite underrepresented in Pro Graphics right now. And so it's been a key focus item for us to get the right products and drive growth. We saw sequential growth from Q4 to Q1. That was good. We talked about the Apple Mac Pro driving some of the share gains there. And then we just launched a new W9100 product that is exceptional for the high-end professional workstation market. So we think it's a great growth opportunity for us.

We made good progress last year in executing our 3-step strategic turnaround to restructure, accelerate and ultimately transform AMD. We completed our restructuring, creating a more efficient business model with significantly lower operating expenses. We also accelerated our business, generating strong revenue growth and a return to profitability in the second half of the year by successfully ramping our strong and diverse set of new products. As we move forward, we will continue to strategically transform AMD as we diversify our portfolio and drive a larger percentage of our revenue from the semi-custom, ultra-low-power client, embedded dense server and professional graphics high-growth markets.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.59 billion, an increase of 9% sequentially and 38% from the year-ago period while increasing profitability. We exceeded the goal we set for the semi-custom and embedded businesses to generate 20% of our revenue by the fourth quarter of 2013. We believe this validates the strategy we outlined 2 years ago to embrace the trends reshaping the industry. We remain on track for our growth businesses to generate approximately 50% of our revenue by the end of 2015. All of this work is underscored by the improved execution across the AMD company, as we hit our key product, IP development, supply chain and financial milestones in 2013.
Our flawless semi-custom production ramp propelled the business in the fourth quarter and allowed us to meet the strong demand for Sony and Microsoft game consoles. Combined, Sony and Microsoft reported selling more than 7 million units in less than 2 months. This is more than double the number of prior-generation consoles sold in their first quarter of introduction. We expect this momentum will continue as we increase game console SoC shipments for the year and pursue new wins from our semi-custom design pipeline.
Our embedded business achieved sequential revenue growth increases throughout 2013. We have secured design wins to drive further growth and expect continued momentum as we begin offering both x86 and ARM-based solutions in 2014. In dense servers, we remain on track to launch one of the industry's first 64-bit ARM server SoCs in 2014. Our unique position, offering both x86 and ARM solutions, combined with our years of experience in the server market and industry-leading fabric technology differentiates us as we bring an expanded set of solutions to this important market. We remain on track to begin sampling our new ARM-based SoCs later this quarter and we are seeing strong interest from both traditional server OEMs and end customers, like cloud providers.
 
Our Professional Graphics business set a record for the full year revenue in 2013. We believe we can drive additional growth based on incremental focus and investments we are making to further strengthen our product offerings, expand our work with key software developers and secure more design wins. Apple's new Mac Pro desktop with dual AMD FirePro GPUs is a perfect example of our momentum in this margin-accretive market.
Now turning to our traditional businesses. As we said during our last earnings call, we expected GPU revenue to rebound as we accelerate the transition to our new R9 and R7 graphics chips, and that is what happened. Strong demand for our latest graphics chips drove a significant sequential increase in GPU revenue and ASP. Our strategy to attack the desktop add-in-board channel worked well in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue. We believe we are well-positioned to gain graphics market share in 2014 based on continued channel momentum, secured wins for our new R7 and R9 discrete mobile GPUs and strong adoption in the professional graphics space.
We also delivered our third straight quarter of desktop processor revenue in the fourth quarter, largely driven by increased shipments of our higher-end APUs and FX CPUs. We also began shipping the desktop version of our newest APU, Kaveri, in December, and we believe it will fuel future growth by delivering a significant performance advantage versus competitive offerings. Kaveri supports our Mantle API for better gaming experience and is the industry's first product to integrate HSA features that can improve performance and power efficiencies when running modern workloads.
 
The consumer notebook market remains soft in the fourth quarter. We focused on improving mix and reducing downstream inventory with our customers. We have secured a number of premium notebook design wins for Kaveri and also have solid adoption of our next-generation low-power Mullins and Beema SoCs, which deliver twice the performance per watt of our previous offerings. We believe we are taking the right steps to create a more predictable and balanced PC business moving forward by continuing to drive a richer product mix, by focusing on parts of the market where we are underrepresented and have significant growth opportunities. For instance, we have secured a significant number of new commercial client design wins with Tier 1 OEMs, which will launch in the second half of the year.
We continue to believe that the PC market will be down for the year. As we've discussed during the last earnings call, our planning assumptions are based on a 10% decline in the market. Since that call, we are seeing some signs that parts of the market may be stabilizing. Given where we are in the quarter, it is too early to know if these signals will continue or not. We are managing the business to the base assumption, but we are ready and poised to take advantage of any upside as it materializes.
So in summary, for 2013, we hit key milestones in our multiyear strategic turnaround. We completed our restructuring, creating a more efficient operating model. We accelerated our business by ramping a strong set of new and diverse products across both traditional and new growth businesses. Our semi-custom and embedded offerings delivered more than 20% of our revenue in the fourth quarter, and we returned AMD to profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year.
Now, in 2014, our next objective is to achieve revenue growth and profitability at the net income level for the full year, as we leverage our differentiated IP and products to further expand our growth businesses, participate across a broader part of the traditional PC market to create a more balanced and consistent revenue stream, and to continue to pursue efficiencies in our business model that will further reduce operating expenses. We are midway through our multiyear turnaround and feel very good about the progress we have made to date and our ability to continue to meet our commitments. We have built a solid foundation, from which we can continue to transform AMD into a more diverse company, delivering consistent revenue growth and profitability.
 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder. Devinder?",1132,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2014",2014-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2930.0,656599.0,29229003.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. 2013 was a year of many accomplishments for AMD, as we completed the first 2 phases of our 3-phase transformation plan. We completed the corporate reset and restructuring, and had solid execution in the second half of 2013. At the beginning of 2013, we laid out a number of key financial goals as part of that plan, specifically, to return to profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of the year; to reduce our operating expenses by more than 20% from Q1 2012 levels; and to generate more than 20% of our revenues from our semi-custom and embedded products. 
I'm happy to report we achieved and exceeded all of those goals. In addition, we maintained cash balances above our optimal balance of $1.1 billion throughout 2013 and stabilized the business with solid execution and financial discipline. All of this provides a good foundation as we enter 2014 and continue our strategic transformation.
Let me share some specifics for 2013. We achieved revenue of $5.3 billion; gross margin of 37%; non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.9 billion, down 14% year-over-year; non-GAAP operating income of $103 million, up from $45 million in 2012; capital expenditures of $84 million, down significantly from $133 million in 2012. And finally, we exited 2013 with cash balances, including marketable securities, of $1.2 billion and increased available liquidity by $500 million through establishing a secured revolving line of credit.
Now let me turn to the specifics of the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $1.59 billion, an increase of 9% from the third quarter and an increase of 38% from the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase was driven by a very strong performance in our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment, driven by increased revenue from our semi-custom SoCs and our new R7 and R9 series of GPU products, which more than offset the decline in revenue in our Computing Solutions segment. 
Gross margin was 35%, down 1 percentage point sequentially, in line with our expectations, as sales of our semi-custom SoCs grew significantly and formed a larger mix of overall revenue. The fourth quarter financial results include a $7 million benefit from the sale of inventory reserved in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to a similar $19 million benefit in the prior quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $462 million, above our targeted level of $450 million, primarily due to higher expenses in sales and marketing during the holiday period and employee-related performance-related programs. Non-GAAP operating income was $91 million and non-GAAP net income was $45 million, both of which exclude a net benefit of $48 million from legal settlements in the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.06 and adjusted EBITDA of $165 million, excluding a net $48 million benefit from legal settlements.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $722 million, down 9% sequentially, primarily due to decreased chipset and notebook unit shipments. Computing Solutions' operating loss was $7 million, as compared to an operating income of $22 million in the third quarter, primarily due to decreased levels in revenue and higher marketing and employee-related performance plan expenses. Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue was $865 million, up 29% sequentially, driven by increased shipments of game consoles' semi-custom SoCs and our R7 and R9 series of GPU products. Graphics and Visual Solutions segment operating income was $121 million, up from $79 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long-term marketable securities, was $1.2 billion, in line with our expectations and flat from the third quarter. Inventory was $884 million, down $38 million sequentially, primarily due to higher shipments of products in our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment. Our total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 2013 were approximately $960 million, lower than the previously estimated $1.15 billion, due to lower fourth quarter purchases. 
There were no penalties associated with this reduction. We are actively working on our 2014 Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES based on our full year demand expectations, with a goal to manage inventory flat to down year-over-year. Also in the first quarter of 2014, we paid GLOBALFOUNDRIES the final $200 million payment related to the reduction of our take-or-pay wafer obligation commitment in 2012.
Debt, as of the end of the quarter, was $2 billion, flat from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million of our outstanding 6% 2015 convertible senior notes in the open market, and these purchases were funded by utilizing our secured line of credit revolver.
Now turning to the outlook. For the first quarter of 2014, AMD expects revenue to decrease 16% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. We expect Computing Solutions segment revenue to be down in line with seasonality, and we expect Graphics and Visual Solutions' revenue to be down coming off a strong Q4 for our semi-custom SoCs. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $420 million, driven by lower sales and marketing expenses, accelerated IP reuse and rebalancing of resources in some of our businesses. Inventory is expected to be approximately flat from fourth quarter levels, and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are expected to be approximately $1 billion.
On cash, we have had 2 important cash reference points over the past year: one, our optimal cash balance target of $1.1 billion; and the other, our target minimum cash level of $700 million. In light of the progress in the transformation of our business model, with a more predictable revenue stream from our growth businesses and the availability of $500 million of liquidity available under our secured revolving line of credit, we are revising our optimal cash level to be approximately $1 billion and our target minimum cash to $600 million.
For the full year 2014, we expect revenue to increase year-over-year; non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of approximately $420 million to $450 million per quarter, depending on the timing of R&D expenses and the revenue profile; taxes of approximately $3 million per quarter; to be net income profitable for the year; inventory to be flat to down year-over-year; capital expenditures of approximately $120 million; to be free cash flow positive for the year; and, finally, to maintain cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in the optimal zone of $1 billion and above the target minimum of $600 million.
In summary, we achieved critical milestones in the first 2 phases of our strategic transformation during 2013 and delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on maintaining the operational and financial discipline that we demonstrated in 2013 as we embark on the third phase of our strategic transformation with the goal of transitioning 50% of our revenue to high-growth markets by the end of 2015.

If you look at how it's progressed -- I mean, Q4 was a very strong quarter. When you look at the launch quarter and the number of units sold that our customers have reported, double what you've seen in previous launches. When we look into Q1, we do expect a strong quarter as well. And looking into 2014, you would expect that the second half will be stronger than the first half, but I would guide you to look at when the major titles are released for the various game consoles to see when -- what you'll see a little bit of, I wouldn't call it seasonality, but I would call it a little bit of uptick as the -- that happens. So I think strong -- expect strong momentum in 2014 off of the 2013 console launch.",189,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And if you look at PC processors in, let's say, 2012, you guys were down. Last year, you guys were about breakeven on an operating profit basis.

In 2014, our next goal is to drive full year revenue growth and profitability at the net income level for the full year. As we look at that, we think it's a combination of our expansion into the new growth markets, like embedded, professional graphics, semi-custom, low-power client, et cetera, dense server. But also, it's about the opportunities we see in the PC market. We believe the PC market will continue to be down in 2014, but we see an opportunity for us to continue to move in areas where we're underrepresented. Historically, we've dominated that lower entry point of consumer notebook, where we see opportunities to continue to build on the momentum we've seen in the revenue of the desktop channel and then continue to expand into the commercial clients segment. These are 2 key areas where we can provide leadership and we have been underrepresented in the past. These will give us an opportunity to expand and they're also areas that tend to have better growth performance than consumer notebook, because, clearly, consumer notebook in the entry space has been affected by the tablet. But that commercial area and desktop have been stronger and more resilient, we think that, as we mix up the stack, will continue to give us opportunity to produce profitability. In terms of A8s and A10s, it was a record, record year -- record quarter, excuse me, in terms of A8s and A10s, up the stack, which is a perfect example of what we're trying to do and why we saw the expansion on ASPs.",283,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So for this quarter, you were at $1.2 billion, but you didn't take about $190 million in wafers you were due. And you also cut your CapEx versus your guidance, which would have dropped you well below $1 billion, had all that come through. Now you're dropping, I guess, your optimal target and your minimum target and you're sort of attributing that to a better outlook on the business. But -- I mean, how -- like, how can we read that as anything other than cash balances are coming in lower than what you thought, and so you're guiding down your targets in order to adjust to that reality? I mean what's the confidence that we have on the cash balance going forward?",136,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

Stacy, I think if you look at it from the standpoint of where you started, first of all, with the lower wafer purchases in Q4, taking those wafers in Q4, the cash would have been paid in Q1 would not affect the Q4 cash balance. So that's where we ended up, from a Q4 standpoint, of $1.2 billion. And I know you are familiar with the GLOBALFOUNDRIES piece of it. We had $200 million due to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in Q1 2014, and that money has been paid. And our business model has transformed with more predictability of revenue, as I said in my prepared remarks, in particular with the semi-custom game console business. And therefore, I'm very comfortable from a viewpoint of resetting the cash balance to the $1 billion for the optimal range and $600 million minimum. On top of that, as you've probably read, we closed a secured revolver line of credit, what we call the ABL, in Q4, of which we have $500 million available. So when you take our cash balances at the end of Q4 2013, look forward to our profitability, on the full year basis, for 2014, I'm confident we can be free-cash-flow positive for the year, despite having paid the $200 million to GLOBALFOUNDRIES, which we did in the early part of January.",220,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Given we're in this very unpredictable stage of the market and we're also in this transformation, I think it's prudent for us to give the guidance quarter-by-quarter as we move through this transformation.

As you can see, the evidence, if you go look at a GVS segment result for this particular quarter, Q4, and the $865 million revenue, we had about 14% operating margin, and that's really good.

And we see that as really a cloud customer going forward. As we look forward, our dense server business has both chip and system sales. And so I think, on the system side, you'll see more of the cloud customers, and there's certainly a number of trials in progress. On the chip side, we're seeing interest from both traditional OEMs as they expand their dense server focus. As well as cloud customers and others looking to expand into the data center. So I would say on the chip business it's more mixed, on the system business we are very focused on those newer workloads.",141,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Additionally, we'll manage the operating expense to deliver that. And you need to look at this as a body of work over the next 2 years. We've done the first 2 years. Think about where we were just a year ago and where we are today and think about where we can get to this year. Because the next goal is growing the revenue for the full year and that profitability, that net income for the full year.

The second quarter capped off a solid first half of the year for AMD. We have made significant progress in transforming our company. This was highlighted by our second quarter results including revenue of $1.44 billion, an increase of 24% from the year-ago period, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.02, an improvement of $0.11 compared to the same period last year.
We are clearly executing our strategy, building a stronger AMD business model and enhancing our ability to deliver consistent performance. We have diligently managed expense and lowered our cost structure, significantly reducing operating expense while strategically investing in innovations that will fuel our future growth. 
At the same time, we have relentlessly focused on improving and consistently executing, hitting our key product milestones and ensuring we deliver on our commitments to our customers. We have improved our balance sheet by reprofiling debt at lower rates, which we expect will reduce our interest expense with no significant debt coming due until 2019.
We have driven our AMD leadership processing and graphics technology into new markets, and we are currently on track to generate approximately 40% of our revenue from these high-growth markets for the full year 2014. And we also remain on track to deliver 50% of our revenue from these high-growth markets by year-end 2015. As a result, for the first 6 months of 2014, AMD's revenue increased 26%, and our non-GAAP EPS improved by $0.26 compared to the first half of 2013. We have now delivered 4 consecutive quarters of non-GAAP profitability, and we remain on track to deliver on our commitment of non-GAAP profitability and revenue growth for the full year 2014.
Now let's turn our attention to our business achievements in the second quarter. Semi-custom SoC shipments increased from the prior quarter as we continue to see strong demand for AMD-powered game consoles. We had record semi-custom unit shipment in the second quarter, and we expect to continue to ramp shipment into the third quarter, our peak quarter, as Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holiday cycle.
In our Embedded business, revenue increased by double-digit percentage from the previous quarter as new design wins started to ramp in this key growth market. We launched several new products in the quarter and announced wins with HP's thin client as well as Boeing's next-generation advanced cockpit display systems, to name just a few. Most importantly, looking at our Embedded pipeline, our design win momentum accelerated in the first half of this year across our key target markets of thin client, gaming and industrial control.
In our professional graphics business, unit shipments increased significantly from the prior period as we continue to grow our FirePro business with Apple, Dell and HP. We look forward to driving even more share gains in this margin-accretive market.
In our dense server business, first half 2014 revenues more than doubled compared to the year-ago period. And we are actively sampling Seattle, the industry's first 28-nanometer 64-bit ARM server processor and remain on track for launch in the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to the PC market. The overall PC market has shown signs of improvement, largely driven by the commercial refresh cycle. However, the consumer market remains under pressure, and we expect the overall PC market is going to continue to be down by 5% to 7% for the year 2014. 
In the second quarter, AMD's overall microprocessor unit shipments increased sequentially for the first time in 4 quarters, driven by the introduction of new notebooks from Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and others, powered by our latest Beema and Kaveri APUs. We also launched AMD's PRO A-Series APU in the quarter and remain on track to more than double the number of AMD-based commercial offerings available by the end of the year. HP has already announced a full range of elite commercial offerings powered by AMD, and additional OEMs will begin rolling out AMD's power commercial offerings this quarter.
In the desktop space, demand for our desktop APUs was strong from our OEMs. However, the desktop component channel was softer than we expected. We believe that with the expansion of our A-Series APU portfolio and continued ramp of our first low-powered socketed desktop APU, this business will strengthen over the coming quarters. Overall, we saw the first sequential revenue increase for our Computing Solutions segment in 4 quarters. Our PC strategy remains focused on delivering profitability by diversifying into the commercial, stabilizing the overall PC business and leveraging the channel to deliver profitability.
Now let's turn to graphics. In graphics, we saw a strong growth in our notebook GPUs as OEM design wins began to ramp in the quarter. This was offset by a decline for our enthusiast class offerings in the AIB channel as demand from cryptocurrency minors abated. We expect to increase GPU shipments this quarter as market pricing for our R7 and R9 offerings become more consistent and as we head into what is typically the stronger second half of the year for GPUs. Regaining graphics market share remains a priority, and we are confident that our products, go-to-market programs and design wins can drive gains throughout the coming quarters.
Today, we're more than halfway through our 3-step transformational strategy. I am pleased with the progress that we have made, as shown by the significant turnaround in our results and our strong continued momentum. We still have more work to do. In the second half of the year, we are focusing on delivering non-GAAP profitability in 2014 and full year revenue growth by continuing the following: the ongoing ramp of our semi-custom SoCs to meet the strong game console demand; driving sales for the expanded number of design wins we have secured in the commercial space, which is clearly the strongest performing part of the PC market; return to growth in our channel business and gain share in discrete graphics; and continued growth in the embedded and professional graphics markets and securing additional design wins. We also remain on track to secure 1 to 2 additional semi-custom design wins that will help accelerate our transformation throughout the coming years.
So in summary, we're demonstrating that our 3-step transformation is driving solid progress and results at AMD. To help drive continued success in the next phase of our transformation, last month, we realigned several internal functions to create a single market-focused team designed to strengthen our traditional PC business and drive future growth in adjacent markets where our leadership IP provides AMD with a competitive advantage. We appointed Lisa Su as Chief Operating Officer to lead this new organization, and she will oversee daily operations of our product roadmap strategy and execution to help drive long-term growth.
Our 3-step transformation will take us through 2015, at which time a different AMD will have a diversified portfolio, consistent execution and our next-generation technology, which will take us to the next phase. Our strategy is working, and we look forward to updating you on our progress and success as we forge ahead.
With that, let me turn the call over to Devinder. Devinder?",1182,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2014",2014-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3696.0,659337.0,29339392.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory, and good afternoon to all of those listening in today. We had good financial performance in the second quarter, capping off a solid first half of 2014. We grew revenue sequentially and realized our fourth straight quarter of non-GAAP net income. We also continued to make progress on our strategy to transform AMD and saw traction in our growth businesses, as evidenced by the strong performance of our semi-custom professional graphics and embedded products.
Turning to the specifics for the second quarter. Revenue was $1.44 billion, up 3% sequentially, driven primarily by strong sales of our semi-custom SoC and notebook offerings, and up 24% year-over-year, primarily by strong sales of our semi-custom SoC offerings. Gross margin was 35%, flat from the prior quarter despite higher semi-custom SoC sales, which have a lower than corporate average gross margin, offset by a richer mix of notebook products.
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were $431 million, up $10 million from the prior quarter. We continue to manage operating expenses in line with revenue to meet our profitability goals, and for the fourth quarter in a row, the non-GAAP operating expense to revenue ratio was 30% or better.
Non-GAAP operating income was $67 million, and non-GAAP net income was $17 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02, calculated using 764 million diluted shares. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share excludes $49 million of loss from debt redemption in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $137 million, down $2 million from the prior quarter, and for the trailing 4 quarters, adjusted EBITDA was $594 million.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $669 million, up 1% sequentially due to higher notebook and embedded processor sales, offset by lower desktop processor and chipset sales. Computing Solutions operating income was $9 million, an improvement from an operating loss of $3 million in the first quarter. This was driven primarily by improved gross margin from a richer mix of notebook processors.
Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue was $772 million, up $38 million or 5% from the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $82 million compared to an operating income of $91 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by lower GPU revenue.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance totaled $948 million at the end of the quarter, down $34 million sequentially, primarily due to the timing of sales and related collections during the quarter. Inventory was $960 million, up $91 million, primarily driven by increased level of our latest 28-nanometer microprocessor products and lower shipments to channel distributors. We remain focused on maintaining appropriate levels of inventory and plan to manage inventory levels down throughout the rest of the year. 
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion, up $72 million from the prior quarter due to our most recent debt reprofiling activities. In the second quarter, we issued $500 million in principal amount of 7% senior notes due in July 2024, utilizing the proceeds to fully extinguish our 8 1/8% notes due in December 2017. By executing these debt transactions, we have further extended our term debt maturities and have no significant term debt maturities for approximately 5 years. 
Additionally, we expect to reduce interest expense by approximately $3 million per quarter, starting in Q3 2014. One housekeeping note, the remaining $41 million net of our 6% convertible senior notes due in May 2015 have now been reclassified as short-term debt on the balance sheet.
Accounts payable at the end of the quarter was $511 million, up slightly from $483 million in the first quarter. We had negative free cash flow of $51 million in Q2 2014, an improvement from the first quarter of 2014, which included a $200 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES related to the reduction of the take-or-pay wafer obligation commitments for 2012.
Now turning to the outlook. The overall PC market has strengthened, largely driven by the commercial space, although there is continued weakness in the consumer PC market. In our Semi-Custom business, based on our strong first half shipments, we anticipate Semi-Custom revenue to be more evenly spread across the year.
Guidance for the third quarter of 2014 is as follows: AMD expects revenue to increase 2% sequentially, plus or minus 3%; Gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%; Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to approximate $435 million; Interest expense will be approximately $42 million; And the total of interest expense, taxes and other is expected to be approximately $50 million. And inventory is expected to decrease from second quarter levels.
In summary, we are pleased with the performance we delivered in the first half of 2014, in line with our commitments and are singularly focused on continuing to transform the company by executing the plans we have outlined. We remain on track to meeting the financial commitments we set for the year, including continued operating expense discipline while growing revenue year-over-year, achieving non-GAAP net income profitability and positive free cash flow generation for 2014.

One of the things, Mark, we focused on was to create a more balanced business execution throughout the year.

And obviously, that launch was in the second half of last year. This year has gone very well in terms of the semi-custom game console work. It's strong. It's up. It's going to continue to ramp in third quarter. But we're seeing a more balanced kind of role. You'll see a little bit more strength in 3Q.

No. Mark, I would say that since we're still in the first 3 or 4 quarters of the game console ramp, it's really hard to call it seasonality as they're still bringing on new game titles and new regions. So the best way to look at it is as a whole, the Semi-Custom business is going to be a strong business for us. We're going to see great growth year-over-year. You will see more systems shipped in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. There is a bit of a timing phenomenon between when we ship and then when our customers manufacture and sell through.

They have been very nice launches. That's part of the reason we've seen that stabilization in our PC business. As you know, David, the PC market is more positive. I got that. But overall, still down. That positive drive is from the commercial part. We're over-indexed to consumer, obviously. Those new products we're introducing are giving us that stability, and that's something I think all of you have been looking for over the past almost 2 years for us to show that stabilization of that business. And the strategy for us to go after commercial, I think, Lisa can add some nice color in terms of the progress that we're making there. It's a more balanced set of PC solutions that we're delivering.

So in terms of what we're doing in the overall Computing Solutions business, we just, in the second quarter, launched our Beema, Kaveri mobile, Mullins product lines. Those are doing very, very well. Kaveri, in particular, in mobile, is going into our commercial solutions. So we've talked about the AMD PRO A-Series. That has gone nicely. HP announced a set of EliteBooks around that, and you'll see more systems in the second half of the year. You'll see us announce more channel offerings as well in the desktop channel as we fill out our APU product line there.

You would expect us to ship into those key suppliers, Sony and Microsoft, in that late third quarter, kind of very early fourth quarter in terms of the peak. That's why I commented on that. If you look at the business, what we're trying to do and what we've been very focused on is to try and create consistent revenue across each quarter so that we can deliver profitability. That's really important to the strategy to be able to consistently deliver that revenue that matches the cost structure and gives us the base to consistently deliver the bottom line. And I think that's what's nice about the diversification of what we've been doing in terms of getting that nice mix of growth businesses with the traditional. That gives us buffer and support if one part of the business is a little bit different in a particular quarter. But because of the diversity, we get the mix. In terms of seasonality, we wanted to focus on 3Q here. We'll talk about 4Q in the next one. But clearly, we would expect the PC business to continue to traditionally be the same or slightly up.

And then, guys, maybe as my follow-up for either Rory or Lisa, just conceptionally, relative to the repositioning of the company, how important now going forward is kind of the Moore's Law treadmill? And I sort of asked the question because perception is perhaps that you're not moving down nodes as quickly. I know that you've talked about kind of your 20-nanometer roadmap, but you really haven't said much, at least to my knowledge, on FinFET. And I guess given some of the difficulties or puts and takes that we hear out in the investment community here going through with what foundry is doing what and having success at FinFET, I'd be kind of curious, how important going forward to your success is kind of that Moore's Law curve? And how do you guys think about 20 FinFET and beyond?",144,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So let me take a stab at that. I think when you look at what's important to us, I mean, clearly, process technology is an important element. But we have invested quite a bit in architecture, design techniques, new IP, software. So I wouldn't say that process technology is the first and primary determinant for us. It is important that we are on competitive technology. So we've said before and I'll say again that 20-nanometer is an important node for us. We will be shipping products in 20-nanometer next year. And as we move forward, obviously, FinFET is also important. So if you look at our business, it is quite a bit more balanced between the Semi-Custom, Embedded sort of commercial pro graphics portions as well as the more traditional sort of client and graphics pieces of our business. So technology plays in all of those businesses.",149,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And we're going to move down the curve, John. There's a not a question. But there's a lot of legs in 28. You're going to see a nice mix across it because of the nice price points you could get there in terms of the business and the mix that we're driving. But clearly, we know that we're going to move 20. 20 is a nice incremental improvement in terms of its technology, and Fins are obviously going to play a key role in terms of as we move. But we want to make sure that it's not just technology for technology, that we get the balance, the crossover point the team -- the profitability, the cost of the technology and the cost of the product that we can sell so that we're delivering the bottom line and the balanced results that we've talked about.",146,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

So one of the things, Ross, that we talked about is that we'd see the stabilization and actually some improvement in the coming quarters in the compute. We like the technology that we brought to market with Beema, Mullins, the Kaveri solution, the movement into commercial. I think those are positive puts, and you saw that in terms of the notebook space. The area that I saw -- we saw softness in the second quarter and I think continues a little bit in the third quarter is in the graphics segment and particularly in the enthusiast. We saw that cryptocurrency, as we expected, to abate, but it was sharp because of the failure of some of those exchanges. And we also saw then because of its sharpness a follow-up in terms of secondhand cards flooding into the market in that period of time based on that whole crypto event. Now on the PC side, I think there's no question that the PC channel also was softer than we expected. We think with the introduction of the products that we're talking about, Lisa touched on them a second ago on an earlier question, that will position for that to improve. But I think what you're seeing is, for us, it's mostly about consumer. That's still a tough, tight market. With the new parts of the business that we're going in, like commercial, it's early, really nice signs, some really nice marquee wins. We're going to see that continue, but we've got to be realistic in terms of how fast that ramps. And then we've got that channel to start to move in a positive direction again on both parts, both graphics, enthusiasts and on the desktop channel. That's kind of the puts and takes, and that's kind of why you see that kind of move in a positive but muted direction.",311,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

The only thing I want to be careful on that, I don't want to say that there's a major shift in gaming. We've had a very strong gaming business all year long. And we expect it to be strong -- it's going to peak in 3Q, but I wouldn't say major. That's not the right terminology.

Let me start with that, Chris. The way we should think about the different business is let's talk about GPUs themselves and the transitions there. When we look at the GPU market, we have desktop and notebook GPUs. We have the channel market, and then we have the pro graphics business. We've actually made very nice progress in the desktop and notebook GPUs. We saw a ramp of some of the design wins that we told you about earlier in the year happening in the second quarter. We see that continuing as we go into the second half of the year. The AIB or the cryptocurrency mining thing is a very specific phenomenon around that enthusiast segment. We saw some, Rory mentioned earlier, some instability in the market as the quarter progressed because we had a bunch of, let's call it, use cards come into the market, and that added to the inventory in place. We do see that lessening as we go into the second half of the year. And our focus is on really getting the gamers and ensuring that the gamers are very much on sort of our Radeon graphics. And then on pro graphics, we see that as a growth opportunity. We saw some improvement in the second quarter, and we expect to see some improvement in the second half. So the GPU business has a bunch of different components. I think we've made progress in certain areas. The desktop, AIB channel will continue to improve in the second half of the year. Relative to the APUs that you're asking about, I think Beema and Kaveri APUs, we believe that those will do well as those businesses continue to ramp in the second half of the year.",292,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So you've now annualized the start of your console ramp with PCs in your core business worse than they were, and it seems like it's heading south from here. I guess given that set-up, how should we be thinking about growth from here going forward? Does this really have to become a bacchanal on growth in semi-custom, growth in ARM servers, growth in professional graphics and the like? I guess is the business as it stands today, does that form enough of a base? Is it stable enough, I guess, to get the growth off of those new opportunities? How can we get some, I guess, degree of confidence that the business itself, the core business, let's say, actually, is going to provide that sort of stability?",148,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

So Stacy, if you look at the business from year to year, yes, we definitely began that full year in terms of the semi-custom game console as we talked about that. That still historically peaks out in year 2.5, 3.5. So there's still opportunity there. From the standpoint of the PC, what we were looking for, and I think everyone in this call has been looking for, is that stabilization. We've introduced a set of new products. We've seen improvement in notebook. And what we're also doing is diversifying the portfolio going into commercial, and that's a good move. We like to see that in terms of -- we said in the previous call that we'd like to see that improve over the next couple of quarters. But you've got to keep that in a muted kind of way. We'll also continue to build out the Embedded business, the pro graphics business. These are all new businesses, and we're seeing progress on all of those. You're not going to have the huge impact of the gigantic semi-custom that we saw that drove the major turn. What you now want to do is you've gotten the business to a profitability level, a consistent level of performance. We're efficiently managing the expense. We're delivering more consistently both in terms of the roadmap and the supply, and then we augment that over the next several quarters and over the next several years with these new businesses. And then ultimately, as we complete the transformation, we introduce the next-generation technology at the finish of this in 2016. That then positions us for the next phase as we move forward. That's exactly the strategy we've been on, and that's how it's playing out.",289,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I understand that, but I mean, you talked about PC stability. The PC business is not stable. I mean, you were down 20% year-over-year. Your competitor is up 6%.

But what you're looking for -- and we're starting to see -- remember last quarter, we talked about we began to see more seasonality in terms of our PC business quarter-to-quarter. We saw, again, more stability. We saw it improve. That's a significant event. I got it that from a year-to-year, there was still pressure because of the over-indexing to consumer. That's not a new event. It clearly makes it easier as you move through it as that becomes a more stable base to work from. And that, I think, is part of the strategy to introduce the things like commercial where that's a greenfield opportunity and go look, some of the progress that we make over the next 2 quarters in that space. That's a fast-growing segment. But that clearly, having that more stable, that definitely creates a better base to work from.",145,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But if you look at profitability, we've maintained that from a profitability standpoint within that segment. And albeit small, but it's still profitable.

And just a follow-up for me, maybe backing up and looking at things on a bigger picture. From an ambidextrous strategy point of view in the ARM server space, there's now going to need to be, I guess, some investments for doing a custom ARM core for the server market versus licensed cores in the past.

I think what you should look for over the next couple of years is to continue to focus on efficiency there. I think there's still more opportunity while investing in the key focus growth areas to continue to drive efficiency on the cost side. It's not going to be as drastic as we've seen in the past, but I think there's continued opportunity to be efficient there because we're simplifying the number of process technologies. We're reusing the IP base. We're really doubling down on those IP blocks that are truly the ones that differentiate. That's creating the ability to allow us to attack both the ARM core and the x86 core. Those are 2 big blocks. They're important. We're going to lead in that. We're going to lead on the graphics side. Some of the secondary IP, we're going to let that have less investment. And I think that's the right kind of strategy as we move forward.

Let me answer that. So the desktop channel was softer than what we expected in Q2. If you take a look underneath that and some of the dynamics under that, we did see some impacts of the cryptocurrency mining phenomenon in CPUs as well as GPUs because if you think about it, when you put together one of those mining rigs, you need both the processor and the graphics card. It was a softer quarter in terms of the market as well, and so we saw the distributors were a bit more cautious on taking on inventory. As we look forward, look, the desktop channel is an important market for us. It's a place where we traditionally have done well. So I don't see anything fundamental there.

So I think in terms of the market, I don't think there's any question that commercial has been stronger than everyone anticipated. There's no doubt, that's partially driven by the XP refresh. That's for sure. There's also some pent-up commercial demand. We're starting to see and feel a little bit of that as we've now introduced the product. I think it's going to be stronger than expected. But the real debate has to be in our minds is that where is that peaking in terms of that. Was that the XP thing through that April, and it kind of trails off into the second half of the year? Our thoughts are it's still positive and it's going to be good. But we've got to see a little bit more data on where that commercial is going to go in terms of is it going to be as robust as it was in this middle part of the year. On the consumer side, I think the consumer is actually pretty tough. I don't think consumer is just slightly down. I think consumer is a tough spot in terms of traditional consumer notebook space. If you're going to add in some of the new form factor stuff like some of the kind of tablet stuff that mixes in between, you could kind of get to a little higher number. So I really think it matters what you count. If you look at the tablet stuff, people talk about 285. If you look at the PC stuff, somewhere around 300. That's a lot of units compared to where we were even 2, 3 years ago. Tablets were much less, probably under 100 at that time. And PCs were around, what, 365. So I think where you get the differing opinion is, what do you put in there? Do you call those Window tablets and put them in PCs? Do you flip [ph] the tablets and put them in there? We still see the traditional market have pressure in consumer. We think it's significant. That's definitely tough. And then from the standpoint of commercial, that's definitely the stronger one. The real question there is, does that refresh continue through the full year? Makes sense, Jim?",375,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

I do understand, relative to share, your competitor's much higher exposure to corporate and your exposure to consumer being part of this. But I guess one thing that's a little concerning is kind of the progress and the share gain they're making in the low end of the market with Bay Trail. And I wanted to kind of get your comfort specific to that segment of the market that you guys have higher relative exposure that if we have game consoles peaking here in Q3, that, that isn't going to peak also for your year in terms of quarterly revenue.

It tends to be lower ASPs, and given some of the market dynamics, it's not terribly profitable. We're going to go and compete in some of that, but we've talked about a strategy to mix up. And I think Lisa can add some color in terms of the ASP trends that we've seen, the kinds of progress we've made with the A8s and A10. This is one of the strategies. In the past, I think AMD would have chased that down, gone for share for share's sake. We want some of that, but we want it balanced across the portfolio as we mix up so that it makes sense for us. Yes, there's no doubt there's pressure there, but there's still business for us to get there. And then as we mix up, look at the ASP work.

I think the way to think about our PC business and sort of our strategy here, I mean, it is very much around being very deliberate about where we think we're most differentiated and we can get a strong sort of profitable growth in that standpoint. So if you take a look at -- you asked specifically about Bay Trail. We certainly see Bay Trail. No question about it. We see them at the very, very low end sort of entry price points going up into the mainstream of the notebook and desktop market. And there are places where we choose not to compete because it's just not profitable business. We are looking at how to improve our mix. If you to take a look at our ASPs, both sequentially and year-over-year, you see a very nice trend there. And that's very deliberate on ensuring that we are selling our products where they're actually valued. And that's different from sort of our PC business a year ago.

I'm pleased to be here on my first earnings call as CEO. In addition to covering our quarterly results, I also want to use this opportunity to provide some details on my initial priorities and the steps we are taking to continue transforming and strengthening AMD.
Our third quarter results highlight the progress we have made in diversifying our business as we delivered our fifth straight quarter of non-GAAP profitability. While our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment had a strong quarter, we did face some challenges in our Computing and Graphics business due to ongoing weakness in the consumer PC market. We know what we need to do to improve performance going forward and are taking the appropriate actions.
So let me give you some more color on each of the segments. Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment delivered sequential and year-over-year revenue and operating profit improvement. We had strong embedded processor revenue growth and secured multiple new design wins across our priority markets. For instance, Arista, a leader in software-driven cloud networking, began ramping production of new switches powered by our embedded G-Series SoC. Our customers also began ramping a number of new retail and educational digital science wins in the third quarter. We also started sampling our first embedded ARM SoC in the quarter and at ARM's TechCon conference, we demo-ed the industry's first-ever 64-bit ARM-powered network function virtualization solution. The demo won best in show software product and is a great example of how our leadership ARM and x86 offerings are generating increased interest from telecom and networking customers.
Our work to lead the industry's transition to 64-bit ARM servers also gained momentum in the quarter. After seeding Opteron A-series development kits with key ecosystem partners earlier this year, we expanded availability to software developers and system integrators. We continue building out the 64-bit ARM server ecosystem in advance of system launches expected next year. This quarter, we also had public demonstrations of community versions of Red Hat's Fedora and Suse's open Suse 64-bit ARM Linux operating systems running Oracle JDK and Enterprise class Java platform on our upcoming Opteron A-Series SoC.
Based on the widespread availability and silicon status of our Seattle development boards, we are also seeing a number of our partners and customers using the AMD platform as their lead ARM 64-bit development vehicle.
The highlight of our quarter was in our strong Semi-Custom business, where we shipped a record number of units for our game console customers. Q3 will be our peak unit shipment quarter for the year as Microsoft and Sony prepare for the holiday season.
And relative to our new Semi-Custom design win pipeline, I am very pleased to announce that we have secured 2 new wins, accomplishing our goal to close 1 to 2 new Semi-Custom wins this year. These new Semi-Custom SoCs are expected to deliver a combined total lifetime revenue of approximately $1 billion over approximately 3 years. Design work for these opportunities has started, and we anticipate first silicon revenue in 2016.
Although I can't go into details on the customers or the specific products, it is important to note that we are diversifying our Semi-Custom business beyond gaming. These wins also mark another significant milestone for us as one of the wins is our first 64-bit ARM-based Semi-Custom design building on our growing ARM 64 momentum in the embedded and server markets. Our Semi-Custom design win pipeline remains strong, and we continue to have good opportunities to deliver future growth for this important part of our business.
Now turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. The Computing and Graphics business remains very important to us and is an evolving area of the company where we have started a substantial amount of work to transform and strengthen this business.  Earlier this year, we laid out several important objectives to improve the financial performance of this segment. These include expanding in the commercial client market; improving our mix in consumer notebooks; gaining share in professional graphics; and increasing component and AIB channel sales.
We've met our goal to double our commercial client design wins from last year and are pleased with the initial progress we are making to build a richer mix in our PC business. New commercial client offerings from Dell, HP and Lenovo have started ramping, resulting in approximately a 50% increase in our commercial APU shipments from the second quarter.
We also improved our notebook APU mix in the quarter as our Kaveri processors ramped in mobile design wins and our higher-end mobile processor unit shipments increased nearly 50% from the second quarter.
Mobile discrete GPU unit shipments also increased from the second quarter as new design wins entered production. And earlier today, Apple announced a number of new iMacs powered by our Radeon GPUs. Included in the wins is the new 27-inch iMac with 5k Retina resolution, which highlights the ongoing move to higher resolution displays. This trend plays well to our strengths in discrete GPUs.
And in the professional graphics market, we believe this remains an area where we see the opportunity for ongoing growth. In the third quarter, channel sales increased sequentially, and we secured several new design wins with Dell and HP that will reach market early next year.
Now turning to the desktop processor and graphics performance in the quarter. Although we increased overall desktop processor unit shipments from the previous quarter, our performance in the component and graphics channel was weak. We saw sellout momentum slow, particularly in China, and believe there was some downstream inventory build in the quarter, causing our distributors to be more cautious managing their inventories. We are committed to these markets and have started taking actions in conjunction with our channel partners to improve sell-through in the coming quarters.
Now let me turn to some of my initial priorities and our strategic actions. As I said on our call last week, the strategy we outlined 2 years ago remains the right one for AMD. But to strengthen AMD and better position us for success, we must take some targeted restructuring actions to align our investments and resources with our highest priority opportunities. These actions are not about how we manage the business in the short term but about how we reengineer the company for the long term and position both of our Computing and Graphics and Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segments for profitability and growth.
As part of the plan, you will see us continue to invest in the talent and skills required to develop our world-class technologies and products, as well as add new skills in areas like software and application engineering that will help us drive into new markets. While we will protect our engineering investments, we will also take the opportunity to streamline parts of the organization to better align them with our highest priority opportunities. Reducing headcount is never easy, but these actions will enable us to become a stronger and more nimble company.
In summary, as I step into the role as CEO, I firmly believe we are one of the few companies with the market position and capabilities to deliver world-class technologies and great products that will lead the industry forward. My near-term priorities are very clear. First and foremost, we will focus our energy on delivering great products. We will also ensure that we continue to deepen our customer relationships and continue to simplify and streamline our organization. We have a unique opportunity in front of us, and I'm very much looking forward to the future.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance, fourth quarter guidance and details of our transformation plan. Devinder?",1302,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We continue to make progress on our strategic transformation and delivered non-GAAP profitability for the fifth straight quarter despite a weak consumer PC environment. We managed operating expense, reduced inventory and shipped record quarterly semi-custom SoCs.
Now let me cover the specifics of the third quarter. Revenue was $1.43 billion, flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower chipset and GPU sales, partially offset by increased sales of semi-custom SoCs. Third quarter revenue included $27 million related to the licensing of technology.
Gross margin was 35%, flat from the prior quarter and included $27 million or a 2% benefit from revenue related to licensing technology. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $428 million, down $3 million from the prior quarter. For the fifth quarter in a row, non-GAAP operating expense to revenue ratio was 30% or better.
Non-GAAP operating income was $66 million and non-GAAP net income was $20 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.03, calculated using 785 million diluted shares. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets of $3 million.
Interest expense, taxes and other expenses were $46 million in the quarter. During the quarter, AMD entered into interest rate swap transactions. These transactions effectively converted $250 million of AMD's fixed rate 6.75% senior notes due 2019 to a variable interest rate. Based on current interest rates, we anticipate quarterly interest savings from these transactions to be approximately $1 million beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. The remaining $250 million portion of AMD's 6.75%  2019 debt as well as all other term debt on the balance sheet has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 7.1%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $133 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter, and for the trailing 4 quarters, adjusted EBITDA was $574 million.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $781 million, down 6% sequentially, primarily due to lower chipset and GPU sales. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $17 million compared to a $6 million loss in the prior quarter. This was driven primarily by lower revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $648 million, up $35 million or 6% from the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in sales of our semi-custom SoCs.
Operating income was $108 million, up from $97 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of our semi-custom SoCs.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance totaled $938 million at the end of the quarter, essentially flat from the prior quarter. Inventory was $897 million, down $63 million or 7% from the prior quarter. We remain focused on maintaining appropriate levels of inventory and plan to manage inventory levels down again in the fourth quarter.
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. Accounts payable at the end of the third quarter was $498 million, down slightly from $511 million in the second quarter. We had negative free cash flow of $11 million in Q3 2014, an improvement of $40 million from the prior quarter.
As Lisa stated in her opening remarks, we are working to build a stronger and diversified company as we continue our strategic transformation. We are ensuring we have the right resources deployed in concert with the evolution of our business model as we rightsize and strengthen our Computing and Graphics segment resources in line with the market realities of today and further invest in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, focused on our growth opportunities.
To that end, we are taking actions and implementing operational efficiencies while also reducing headcount and further streamlining our global real estate assets. We expect to reduce our workforce by approximately 7%, with the majority of actions completed by the end of the fourth quarter. We anticipate aligning our real estate footprint starting in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first half of 2015.
Associated with these actions, we expect to record restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, consisting primarily of severance-related charges and approximately $13 million in the first half of 2015, primarily related to real estate actions. We expect to make cash payments of approximately $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and approximately $20 million in the first half of 2015 associated with these actions. Based on these actions, we anticipate operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and approximately $85 million in 2015.
Now turning to the outlook and guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014. AMD expects revenue to decrease 13% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, due to lower semi-custom revenue and a weak consumer PC environment. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 35%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $385 million, below our prior 2014 quarterly operating expense guidance range of approximately $420 million to $450 million, in line with expected revenue and savings from our restructuring and transformation initiatives.
Interest expense and other to be approximately $46 million. Inventory is expected to decrease from third quarter levels. And finally, free cash flow is expected to be positive in the fourth quarter and, for the full year 2014, negative in the range of $200 million to $250 million, including the impact of the $200 million special payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES earlier this year.
In summary, while there is more work to be done as we continue our transformation journey, we are positioning AMD to execute our current set of strategic transformation priorities while focusing on sustainable profitability and driving enhanced returns for our shareholders.

So relative to how we're managing the business, I mean, certainly if you look at it, we've been very focused on improving the operational performance of the business. I think we've made strong progress in 2014, and we will continue to do that in the coming years. In terms of the markets that we're in, the Semi-Custom wins are exciting and important for us, that they're part of our long-term growth strategy. We also have growth that we highlighted in embedded and professional graphics and some of our other growth markets. And in the traditional PC market, the key areas for us are really changing the mix of the product and focusing on the places where we're more differentiated. So commercial is an early start for us, and we're starting from a low base, but we have seen progress there. And we expect that into 2015 as well, as well as some of the work that we're doing in the graphics space like you saw with the Apple win today. So again, I think from an overall market standpoint, we know where to focus, and we're going to continue focusing on those areas that play to our differentiation.",215,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I think what you have seen, even over the last couple of years as we had the difficulties in the 2012 timeframe, that we have shown the ability to manage the business in line with revenue, to manage the operating expenses, focus on the areas that Lisa talked about as priorities and continue to diversify our revenue. But at the same time, making sure that we protect our investments in the core IP and technologies, which is really going to fuel the future growth and long-term profitability of the company. Your question on GLOBALFOUNDRIES and whether from an inventory standpoint we are on track, very much on track as we end the third quarter here. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we'll be on track to meet those obligations.

The 13% decline that you expect for next quarter, do you -- you mentioned I think computing and the embedded business both declining. Is that split evenly between the 2? Is it both businesses you expect to decline about that much or will it be weighted one or the other? And when you look at your OpEx savings, you expected $85 million next year. Is that $21 million a quarter? Or does that kind of ramp through the year and you exit the year something higher than that?",102,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

I think if you ask me overall from a viewpoint of the decline of 13%, given the peak quarter that we had in semi-custom is weighted towards the semi-custom. So as you look at our segment reporting, which has changed effective this quarter, Computing and Graphics and the Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom, I would say that the decline quarter-on-quarter is more weighted towards the EESC segment as opposed to Computing and Graphics.
As far as the OpEx is concerned, I can share with you Q4. I'll tell you that in Q4, as you look at Q3 to Q4, the decline in OpEx is about $40 plus million. Some of it comes from the transformation initiative that we've been working on. Lisa talked about simplification of our structures within the company, getting closer to the customer. We also have actions that we took today, and that's going to save about $9 million within the quarter. We had some product tape-outs in Q3 that don't repeat in Q4. That's some savings. And overall, we've been very focused on managing the OpEx in line with our revenue expectations and revenue profile, and that is where the rest of the savings are coming from.  You try to get -- sorry, Mark, you try to get to 2015 and maybe asked a question about that. But I'm not prepared to get into the 2015 discussion at that point.

You're exactly right if you look at the details that we have provided, whereby we have not only provided the new segment information for Q3 of 2014, but also recast the historical data, Computing and Graphics on the one hand and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom on the other. And if you go look at the year-to-date numbers, 2013, 9 months versus 2014, 9 months, the revenue is down, as you observed, from the $900 plus million to the $800 plus million, 13% down. But the losses -- there were losses in the first 3 quarters of 2013, it was close to about $19 [ph] million and if you add up the last 3 quarters of 2014, it's more in the $20 million range.

So I think the way to think about the market, because when we look at the market, there's a certain segmentation. So when we look overall, clearly the strength in the PC market has been around commercial primarily. When we look at consumer, it's still choppy, and we see -- it's weak, and there's a competitive dynamic in there. From our standpoint, we tend to have more exposure to some of the emerging geographies, particularly in the channel. And so we are seeing some weakness in China, in the emerging geographies. Relative to our MNC business or the large OEMs, I think that business is relatively as expected. So I think it's our view -- our segmentation in the PC market is different from our competitors.

The Compute and Graphic segment obviously showing losses for most of the last 8 quarters -- sorry, most of the last 5 quarters, or 6 quarters.

So I'm not going to provide, JoAnne, unfortunately, granularity from a gross margin at the segment level. We do share the revenue and the operating income. The thing that you probably know based on the business part of -- for the Semi-Custom in particular, we have been clear that, that is below the company average from a gross margin standpoint, but that's where you get the benefit from the NRE model of how products are designed together with the customers, how we get the funding for those products. And then when we go to silicon production, there are no sales and marketing dollars. There's a little bit of R&D on an ongoing basis. And the G&A is essentially a fixed cost, so you scale the revenue, the operating margin benefits, and that's why you have seen the result as you observed for the EESC segment, whereby there is profitability at the 15%, 16%, 17% of operating income level. As far as Computing and Graphics, you are right. If you look back the last 5 quarters, 2 of the 5 quarters we made money and 3 quarters we lost money. Revenue is down as the previous question observed.

When we look specifically in the Computing and Graphics business, relative to the overall infrastructure that was built around these 2 businesses, the businesses are smaller than they were before. And so there is significant opportunity to streamline how we operate, how we go to market and just the overall infrastructure that we have.

So really, relative to the AIBs, we work closely -- very closely with all the channel partners. I did mention that there is some -- there was some cautiousness in the distribution channel as we were going through the third quarter. Part of that was just the new products from both ourselves as well as from our competitor.

The strategy is something that I believe very much in. It's something that we put together as a leadership team. And it really is about taking the technology assets that we have as a company and applying them to higher-growth segments. So at a high level, that is absolutely what we're doing. Now relative to what I would like to do, I am really going to focus on the leadership products and differentiation. I mean, that is the core of what I think will make us successful as a company, as well as our deeper customer relationships and the simplification we've talked about. I think there's a lot of opportunity here. This is a multi-year transformation that we're going through. But relative to some of the technology bets that we're making, they will pay off in the next couple of years.

I think the bitcoin or the cryptocurrency thing really started in the second quarter, flowed through the third quarter. There were some used or secondhand cards that were out there in the market. I would say that what we're looking at now is really working through some of the product positioning as we go into the fourth quarter.

So on the technology side, it's certainly important, and we are doing active designs in FinFET for sure. From our product differentiation standpoint, though, if you look at the APUs, it tends to be more of an architectural statement versus a process technology statement. So with our launch of Kaveri and the amount of compute cores that we have on Kaveri, I think that's something that has been attractive to the market. And as we go into our next-generation APUs in 2015, they will have added features and functions, some of our heterogeneous software architecture as well. So I think the net of it is clearly, the technology is important and we're designing in FinFETs and they're going to be an important node for us as we go forward.

So let me try to frame it in this way. It is a little bit early to talk about 2015 revenue in units. What I will say is that from what we see, the game console business looks strong. We just had one of our partners, Microsoft, launch in China. And that looked like it was successful. I think everything that we see is this is shaping up to be a solid holiday season. Relative to 2015 seasonality, it is a consumer business, and so we would expect that the first half would be lower than the second half.
