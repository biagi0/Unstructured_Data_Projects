Wennink,,Executives,1,"Yes. Both were very good to start with Q4, with about EUR 5 billion of sales. That's in the midpoint of our guidance. Our deep UV shipments were a bit light. I think they were basically the result of the effects of the logistics center and supply chain issues that we announced in Q3. But that was compensated, fully compensated by EUV revenue, and by our Installed Base revenue and especially the productivity upgrades, they were able to ship to our customers. Our customer are in bad need of extra capacity. So there was a big demand, and we were able to ship. 
So that was good for the full year. About 35% higher than 2020, ending at EUR 18.6 billion of sales, which was good. Installed Base management was very good, like I said earlier, EUR 1.5 billion of sales, driven by productivity enhancement packages as we call them, Installed Base options to give our customers extra wafer capacity. For the total year, about EUR 5 billion. That's about a 27% increase -- or sorry, 27% of our total sales. On the gross margin, now because of the productivity enhancement packages, which is our software, very good gross margin, just over 54% in Q4. And for the total year, again, a record 52.7%. Net income as a result of that good, EUR 1.8 billion in Q4, EUR 5.9 billion for the total year. 
And I think if you look at the year and you want to reflect on the year, I think you also need to look at the order intake. Now order intake in Q4 was high, EUR 7.1 billion, of, you could say, only EUR 2.6 billion in EUV, but we've had very strong EUV order intake throughout the year, which includes one High-NA tool. And that means that we have EUR 4.6 billion of deep UV orders in Q4. 
And just a reflection of where the market is today, I mean there's a significant demand for our entire product portfolio, both DPV and EUV mature and advanced. Over EUR 26 billion of order intake throughout 2021 with just under half EUV, and the other half is deep UV. And just the reflection, again, of this very widespread demand for our products across all technologies, our entire product portfolio. 
So in summary, both Q4 and 2021, very good year.",392,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Yes, I can understand the question. And as a matter of fact, it's not at all as bad as it appears. It's got to do with revenue recognition. And basically, it's driven by the fact that we want to reduce cycle time. The shorter the cycle time is the more we can ship to our customers. Now what we used to do is to recognize revenue when we accept our systems, the sign-up of the systems in our factory. 
That actually -- that acceptance procedure takes a couple of weeks, sometimes 3 to 4 weeks. We actually skip that and we ship the system to the customer side, and we do the acceptance test there. Projection mean there's only 1 acceptance test, and that's at the customer side. So it means you defer or you delay the revenue. 
Now if you then look at the planned shipments for this quarter, just the sales value of those shipments is anywhere between EUR 5.3 billion and EUR 5.5 billion, which is a very high number. Now, and if you then take into account that we had some fast shipments as we call them in Q4 of last year, so we will recognize about EUR 300 million in Q1 of 2022, but we're also deferring or shifting about EUR 2 billion of revenue into the next quarters of 2022. 
So if you take the combined effect, it's all about revenue recognition. The -- I would say the booked revenue of those shipments in Q1 is then between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion, with about 49% gross margin.",266,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We expect about 20% growth as compared to 2021, which is a good number because you have to take into account that we also plan for fast shipments by the end of this year. So you remember, revenue will shift into 2023. We think we currently think about 6 EUV systems will be fast shipped as we call it. And if you take that into account, if you would add those delayed revenues on to the 20%, then the growth of the shipment value will be about 25%, not 20%, but the recorded revenue, as we call it, will be about 20% growth.",111,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,7,"I think on the EUV, we've said it before, we still have an expectation to ship about 55 EUV systems. But like I said before, about -- we currently also expect to fast ship about 6 systems for which the revenue will move into 2023. So we ship 55, about 6 will be revenue recognized in 2023. Well, with that, the combined effect of that will mean an EUV growth -- revenue growth of about 25%. On deep UV, we've seen -- also when you look at the order intake, deep UV is particularly strong. It's across all industries. Memory, Logic, very strong deep UV demand driven by the chip shortage that everybody knows about. 
We will probably see about a 20% growth of our deep UV business in 2022 as compared to 2021. And on Installed Base, despite the fact that we had a very strong year in 2021 and with many pull-ins of Installed Base options to increase more wafer capacity, we still expect 2022 to grow about 10%.",171,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think both Memory and Logic, given the demand situation, which exceeds our capacity, it's not a surprise that also Logic will be very strong, driven by the underlying secular trend of the increased demand for more mature products for advanced products, Logic will grow about 20%. And also on Memory, DRAM specifically, very high utilization. So there's not much space left in terms of extra wafer capacity because our system utilization is very high. The expectation is that the bit growth in DRAM will be high teens. Well, there's only one way to get those extra bits out and at least to basically ship more systems, so increased wafer capacity. So we expect memory growth as compared to 2021 this year to be about 25%.",127,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think the biggest challenge that we currently see is that the demand significantly exceeds our capacity. I think it's unprecedented. I have never seen this before. And I think it has to do with a couple of things. I think it is the secular growth trend. I think it's the drive for more semiconductors to support Internet of Things. It's the disturbances as a result of COVID, all the reasons why the demand is so much higher than our capacity. And that means if you're at maximum capacity that you have to be very careful and very much monitoring any disturbances because you know if there's a disturbance, you don't have any buffer left because you're at maximum capacity. 
So I think there are 3 things that we are really looking at: #1 is COVID. Clearly, COVID, we cannot predict it, but it's still there. Infection rates around the globe are shooting up, and it will inevitably also lead to some absenteeism that we have. I don't think people get infected in a clean room, but the infections happen at home, but still, it will affect you; secondly, I think it's the supply chain. 
I think there are disturbances. You just open the papers. There are shortages and supply-demand imbalances everywhere. I think we need to manage that very closely; and third, I think it's the workforce. We are ramping our capacity significantly, which also means people. I mean, we hired close to 6,000 people in 2021. But those people need to be trained. They need to get up the learning curve, and that will take time.",269,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

I think 3 things, I think, with our customers. It's all about getting wafers out there, more wafer output. And this is why we've turned into fast shipments, turned to fast shipments to basically say, if you can reduce the cycle time, but not doing acceptance test for weeks in our factory and just basically emptying the production cabin 3, 4 weeks earlier, you can output more systems. So that's what we're doing. So together with our customers, we've taken the decision to do fast shipments. 
And next to that, it's Installed Base improvements, hardware, software options to get more wafers out. That's what you do together with your customers. It leads to delay of revenue, but it's not a problem because that will easily be catched up 1 or 2 quarters later. 
And then with our suppliers. There are supply disturbances, not only in the semiconductor industry, they're everywhere. So what do you do? You stay on top of each other, basically very closely monitoring everything that goes on so any disturbances are recognized soon. And then you take action and corrective measures to do that. So it means a very close collaboration between the supplier base and ASML. 
And the last one, COVID. We have all the protective measures in our factories and in the company. But still, it's a pandemic. And like I said, most infections happen in the private space and will also happen to us. So this is something which we have to monitor very closely, and see how we can basically support our output with flexible working schedules.",265,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

We were able to put the fire out within a couple of hours, but still there was a significant damage. Now I must say kudos to the ASML Berlin people and the people here in Veldhoven and in Wilton. They had a lot of creativity. We are where we are today, which is for deep UV, although there were some initial disturbances, we don't think there's going to be any impact on our output for 2022. 
But in the -- where the fire happened was in the area where we make the EUV wafer clamp, which is a very complex, but a very significant module that goes into our EUV systems. But because of the hard work and the creativity and we currently believe that we can manage the situation and that we will not see a significant impact on our EUV output in the year 2022.",171,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And we will propose to the general meeting of shareholders to increase the dividend to EUR 5.50. 
That's a total dividend for the year 2021, for which, of course, we paid an interim dividend in Q4 of 2021. So that's a significant increase in dividend. And next to that, we keep doing share buybacks. We basically ended to the previous program by buying back EUR 4 billion. This is the last part of the previous program.

The semiconductor industry is planned to double in size to $1 trillion by the end of this decade. And of course, this also will have an effect on our business. So what do we do? And I have to admit, I think we, as an industry, us and our customers and their customers, we've underestimated the long-term growth profile of the company. So we need to catch up.
And how we do that? We build capacity. And that's where we're very much focusing on building capacity at ASML, but also in the supply chain to make sure that we can significantly increase our output, both for deep UV and for EUV and for our metrology and measurement systems, basically across our entire product line.

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone.  I will first review the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the first quarter of 2022.  
Net sales came in within guidance at EUR 5 billion. The effects of the logistics center startup and supply chain issues communicated during our Q3 results is a bit longer than expected to resolve, affecting some deep UV shipments in Q4.
In order to address our customers' need for additional capacity, we completed an increased number of productivity upgrades in Q4 as a way to provide them with incremental productivity enhancement. 
We shipped 12 EUV systems and recognized EUR 1.6 billion of revenue from 11 EUV systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 3.5 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 73% with the remaining 27% from Memory. 
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.5 billion, significantly above guidance, primarily due to the software upgrades. As just mentioned, in this strong demand environment, customers continue to use productivity upgrades to increase output of their installed base.
Gross margin for the quarter was 54.2% and was above guidance, primarily driven by higher software productivity upgrades. 
On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 681 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 203 million, which was slightly above guidance. In Q4, we had other income of EUR 214 million related to the sale of the non-semiconductor businesses of Berliner Glas. Net income in Q4 was EUR 1.8 billion, representing 35.6% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.39.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 7.6 billion. 
Moving to the order book. Q4 net system bookings came in at EUR 7.1 billion, including EUR 2.6 billion for 0.33 NA EUV systems and 1.55 NA EUV systems and EXE:5000 systems.
Order intake was strong from both deep UV and EUV, largely driven by Logic with 77% of the bookings and Memory accounted for the remaining 23%.
For the full year, net sales grew 33% to EUR 18.6 billion. EUV system sales in 2021 was EUR 6.3 billion, which is a 41% increase from last year. We achieved 50% EUV growth margin systems on the systems in 2021 and continued to improve EUV service margin. Non-EUV system sales in 2021 was EUR 7.4 billion, which is a 26% increase from last year.
On the market segments for 2021. Logic system revenue was EUR 9.6 billion, which is a 30% increase from last year. Memory system revenue was EUR 4.1 billion, which is a 39% increase from last year. 
Installed Base Management sales was EUR 5 billion, which is a 35% increase compared to previous year. In 2021, we had total bookings of EUR 26.2 billion, more than 2x increase year-on-year, reflecting customers' strong demand for EUV and deep UV technology.
Our R&D spending increased to EUR 2.5 billion in 2021 as we continue to invest in innovation across our product portfolio. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2021 sales was about 14%. SG&A was about 4% of sales. Net income for the full year was EUR 5.9 billion, 31.6% of net sales, resulting in an EPS of EUR 14.36.  
Improvements in working capital contributed to a free cash flow generation of EUR 9.9 billion for 2021, mainly driven by customer down payments following the very significant order intake this year. We continue to invest in support of our road map and planned capacity ramp. Excess cash will be returned as per our policy.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2022. We expect Q1 total net sales to be between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion. Lower guidance relative to Q4 is primarily due to a number of so-called fast shipments. These are shipments in the quarter for both EUV and deep UV, that will not complete factory acceptance testing. As we've discussed in prior quarters, fast shipments are in support of customers' desire to bring systems into production as quickly as possible. By skipping some of these testing in our factory, we can shorten the cycle time. 
Final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer site at which time we will recognize revenue. The value of the Q1 shipments is expected to be between EUR 5.3 billion and EUR 5.5 billion, which means approximately EUR 3 billion of revenue is expected to be deferred to subsequent quarters.
We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.2 billion. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be around 49%. The lower gross margin quarter-on-quarter is primarily due to the fast shipment impact of delayed revenues and lower upgrade business compared to last quarter. The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around EUR 760 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 210 million.
Our estimated 2022 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. Regarding our capital return, ASML paid total dividends of EUR 1.4 billion in 2021, made up of the 2020 final dividend and the 2021 interim dividend. 
ASML intends to declare a total dividend with respect to 2021 of EUR 5.50 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.80 per ordinary share paid in November 2021. This leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of EUR 3.70 per ordinary share. Total 2021 dividend is a 100% increase compared to the 2020 dividend.  The 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 29, 2022, in Veldhoven.
2021 was a rather exceptional year in terms of share buyback. ASML acquired 14.4 million shares for a total amount of EUR 8.6 billion as part of our current and previous program. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",993,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had another record year of both sales and profit. We're seeing unprecedented customer demand across all market segments from both advanced and mature nodes, driving demand across our entire product portfolio.
Looking to 2022, after a lower Q1 revenue due to Q1 fast shipments, as highlighted by Roger, we expect a significant increase in revenue for the remaining quarters. For the full year, we expect a net sales increase of around 20% compared to 2021. And bear in mind that this 20% sales growth does not include revenue from 6 EUV fast shipments in Q4 2022. And if you would take the full shipments value of the 6 EUV fast shipments into account, the growth percentage would have been 25%.
For our EUV business, we still expect to ship around 55 systems of which we expect revenue from 6 systems to be deferred to 2023 due to fast shipments. This translates to an expected EUV system revenue of around EUR 7.8 billion in 2022.
In our deep UV and applications business, we expect growth in both immersion and dry systems, as well as continued demand for metrology and inspection systems. We're also planning fast shipments for some deep UV systems, but we do not expect this to impact our 2022 revenue due to inherently shorter installation times for deep UV. We expect revenue growth of over 20% to non-EUV system revenue.
For the Installed Base Management business, service revenue will continue to scale with the growing installed base of systems. And customers will continue to look at all methods to add wafer capacity. And although we saw upgrades pulled into 2021 to improve wafer output capability at our customers, we expect those type of installed base options to also stay very much in demand this year. We currently expect 2022 installed base revenue to be up around 10% year-on-year.
Looking at the market segments, given the very strong demand situation and our continued push to increase capacity, we see growth in both Logic and Memory in 2022. 
In Logic, we've talked for some time now about the digital transformation that is underway as we move to a more connected world. The growing application space and secular growth drivers translated very strong demand for both advanced and mature nodes. With this continued strong demand, we expect Logic system revenue to be up more than 20% year-on-year. 
In Memory, we also expect to see continued growth of our business this year. With customer expectations of DRAM bit growth in the high teens this year and lithography tool utilization running at very high levels, customers need to add capacity in addition to planned technology transitions to meet demand. As DRAM customers migrate to more advanced nodes, we also expect to see an interest in EUV demand for Memory. We expect the 2022 Memory system revenue to be up around 25% year-on-year.
With this unprecedented demand exceeding our capacity, we are ramping our output capability to meet the strong demand. Of course, this comes with challenges, and we're even more vulnerable when running at maximum capacity is there is little room for recovery when things don't turn out as planned. And COVID, unfortunately, is now behind us, and it impacts everyone, including the workforce in our industry and in the supply chain. 
We also have to work through supply chain challenges of material and component shortages and COVID-related supply chain disruptions. In our workforce, we have hired a significant number of people throughout last year. And although we are currently at our planned workforce FTE numbers, they still need to be trained and brought up to the learning curve.
All of what I just mentioned needs maximum management retention and monitoring, creativity and flexibility of all our partners and stakeholders. 
We are working closely with our customers to address these challenges. We're doing fast shipments, skipping some of the testing at factory and completing the final acceptance testing at the customer site, which provides more capacity as quickly as possible. This reduces cycle time in our factory and frees up cabin space in our cleanroom so we can ramp up capacity more quickly. In addition, we continue to provide software upgrades, which will give our customers more capacity. 
As I said before, we're doing our utmost to respond as best as we can to external challenges during COVID-related absenteeism and material shortages in our supply chain.
Also, as we reported earlier in January, we had a fire just after the New Year inside a part of our factory in Berlin. The fire was extinguished during the night and fortunately, no persons were injured during this incident. But the fire occurred in a part of one production building on the site in Berlin and the smoke partly impacted an adjacent building. We've been able to resume production in parts of this building already, and the other buildings on the site have not been affected and are fully operational.
The manufacturing of deep UV components have been restarted. And although there was some disruption regarding components for deep UV, we expect to remediate this in such a way that it will not affect our output and revenue plan for deep UV. 
And as to EUV, the fire affected part of the production area of the wafer clamp, which is a module in our EUV systems. Based on our current insights, we believe we can manage the consequences of this fire without significant impact on our EUV system output in 2022.
Overall, while it's also a very unfortunate event, we're optimistic about the current situation and are very grateful for the enormous efforts and creativity of our Berlin staff. 
On High-NA EUV, we're currently building the first High-NA system in our new cleanroom in Veldhoven. We received an order for an EXE:5000 in Q4, the fifth order in total for the EXE:5000 model, which provides order coverage for planned High-NA shipments in 2024.
In addition, at the beginning of this year, we received the first order for the EXE:5200. EXE:5200 is ASML's next model High-NA system, which we intend to launch in 2024 after the introduction of our first High-NA system. The EXE:5200 will provide the next step for lithography performance and productivity. Demand continues to be extremely strong even to the point where we believe we are also this year falling significantly short of the customer demand. 
Looking beyond 2022, global megatrends, we talked about at Investor Day, broadening in the application space and fueling demand for advanced and mature nodes. Growth in semiconductor end markets and increasingly higher lithography intensity, driving demand for our products and services. We, along with our supply chain partners are actively adding and improving significant system build capacity to meet future customer demand. In short, we are even more confident in our long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",1152,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,8,"Yes, Joe, it's a good question. And I think it's important to look at the full picture here, including what happened in the last quarter because you might recall that in the last quarter, we were expecting for the full year of deep UV or the non-EUV business, if you want to call it that way, approximately EUR 8.2 billion, that was the expectation we had going into the quarter. And of course, we landed substantially below that. We landed at EUR 7.4 billion. So there was about a EUR 800 million shortfall that we then made up in Q4 with higher EUV sales and higher installed base sales.
So what we're saying now is that, that EUR 800 million, we're now trying to get that into the plant for this year. And we can do that because, of course, that's the material for that production was, in fact, already produced by the supply chain. So we have the material, so now it's a matter for us within our manufacturing plant here in Veldhoven to get that done. 
And if you then do the math, right? So we told you last year that we believe we were going to be kind of flat year-on-year for deep UV. That was under the expectation that last year was going to be EUR 8.2 billion. So it's EUR 8.2 billion this year plus the EUR 800 million that you kind of transitioned from last year, that gets you to about the EUR 9 billion that you get to when you add the 20% to last year.
So that's the math. So in fact, it's the transition from the shortfall of EUR 800 million that we had in Q4, we have the supply chain for that. And now it's a matter of us trying to squeeze that into the manufacturing capability here in Veldhoven.",310,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Well, at least, what we can say on EUV adoption is that about 20%, a little north of that even of the EUV sales that we're going to see this year, system sales will be in Memory. So if you take about EUR 8 billion, a little under EUR 8 billion, if you look at the revenue number for EUV, 20% of that is related to Memory.

Dassen,,Executives,13,"We didn't, but I'm happy to talk about it and give you a little bit of flavor as to where we see this land. And frankly, I think we're going to see gross margins for this year a little over the gross margin that we had for the last year. So I would say it's around 53%. That would be my expectation for the year.
And I guess your next question -- your next implied question is going to be, so help me understand that. Of course, we start with a -- it's 52.7% for last year, which we have to recognize is already helped by the very significant software upgrade packages revenue that is in there. And that, as we've said before, is very helpful to the gross margin.
So if you neutralize the very high impact that, that had on the gross margin for last year, I would say for the year, you probably take out about 0.7%. So that gets you to a base -- a normalized base of 52%.
And then there's a few things. First off, the NXE pricing, which is primarily driven by the fact that we only have these in this year in comparison to the mix of last year. That would give you about 1.5%. And then we talked a little bit about the High-NA impact on the gross margin. That's a little bit higher this year than it was last year. I would expect about 0.5% there. So if you do -- if you add it all up, then you get a 53%. Then there's a little bit of a swing factor as to the composition of deep UV in terms of dry versus immersion. At this stage, we expect both of them to grow about 20%. So I would say it's about neutral for the gross margin. But that's the buildup to the 53%.
In terms of OpEx, we've only guided the numbers for Q1, as we typically do, only for the quarter. But I think it's safe to say that the 4% on SG&A and 14% on R&D, I think those assumptions are a safe assumptions for the full year. And then obviously, on the basis of the EUR 22.3 billion, that sort of implied in the 20% year-on-year growth for revenue.",384,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Aleksander, I think you see it right. So -- and it's not just for NXE. So we also do this for immersion. So it's the combination of those 2. And at least for this year, this will be the standard practice. 
And then if you look at this year, as we mentioned to you, there's about EUR 2 billion that falls into subsequent quarters as a result of this as it relates to Q1. What we're going to do is try and at least try and limit the installation time, both for NXEs and for immersion tools as a result of which the impact by the end of the year should be a lot lower because we try to  make the delta between the shipment movement and the acceptance by the customer that made [ that more ]. And we think we can squeeze out 2 maybe even 3 weeks in the install time in order to get there. So that's what we're driving.
And as a result of that, it is our expectation that the amount at the end of this year, I mean, we referenced the 6 EUV tools, so that would be about EUR 1 billion. So that's what we're trying to work towards. That the spillover, if you like, from the last quarter into the next quarter is going to be only about EUR 1 billion.
That's what we're driving towards. So that means that during the year, we're going to gain, if you like, about EUR 1 billion in the subsequent quarters and are only going to lose for the full year EUR 1 billion into next year.
Whether this will be the standard practice for years to come? We'll just see how this works, if this works well as we anticipate for ourselves and also for the customers, if we can really prove as we've done in last year that we can do this without a quality impact, if you like, in the field, and we are pretty comfortable that we can do that, then I think this will be appreciated by the customer and also leads to efficiency on our end. So then indeed also for subsequent years, this will be the practice. And then indeed, you won't have any impact anymore in the years to come.",385,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So somewhere in the course of this year, we are going to see an improvement of the gross margin beyond the 53%. But bear with me, it's a little bit too early to already start making predictions on the gross margin for '23.",148,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I guess maybe a bigger picture question for you, regarding visibility. I think this is the highest kind of backlog coverage you've ever had as a company. And I guess, obviously, part of that EUV related and obviously part of it is the supply constraints out there. But just curious, how do you think about that? And I guess, how are you thinking about the capacity you need to add into, I think, you talked about a $1 trillion kind of semiconductor market and the confidence you have today on 2023 revenue growth?",96,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,26,"Yes, I think it's a very good number. It's a very good question. I can't give you the exact number. But one thing is for sure that we will ship more systems, deep UV and EUV in 2020 as compared to 2021. And it's my expectation the same thing will happen in 2023. 
And as a matter of fact, I also expect that in 2023, our EUV shipments will go over 60 systems. And part of it has to do with the cycle time reduction we talked about, could be through fast shipments and through shortening the installation times. Yes, that will happen. 
And also for deep UV, I think we can still squeeze, start squeezing and reducing cycle time in the supply chain, so we can do potentially more systems next year than we do this year.
Having said that, I think we're still in a situation where, and I said it on the video, but also on several occasions today, that the demands for all our technology also specifically deep UVs, so significantly higher than what we can currently make. When we look at our maximum capacity today, I think the demand, which is not, with all respect, the demand which customers would like to give us an order, but they don't because we don't have the capacity, to be around 40% higher than what we can make.
Everything moves out. So what we cannot ship today, we'll move to 2023. So now what we cannot ship in 2023, we'll move to 2024. And that actually means that we need to add capacity beyond what we're currently planning. And that is exactly what we're doing today. I think we had a capacity plan beyond 2023 that we are currently have decided on. But we haven't had this internally, but we haven't gone for that fully yet in the supply chain with our critical suppliers, which we will do this quarter.
So I think we want to be in a situation that, starting 2024, we will be able to meet whatever demand the customers have. I think we are in a situation where on leading-edge immersion and EUV, the customers have nowhere to go. And we don't want to keep pushing excess demand being described as the demand over our maximum capacity to move -- constantly move into the next year. 
So this is what we are doing. I already gave you an indication on the EUV for 2023, that will be above 60 because of all the measures that we have taken. But I think we also -- we are -- we have taken internally the decision that we indeed need to increase our capacity beyond that. And that will be something which we will be discussing with you probably, hopefully, when we get early confirmation from our critical suppliers next quarter.",474,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Well, let's do everything in the right order, yes. And that's first, look at the customer demand and the demand curves and have very in-depth discussion, as you know, with our customers on their CapEx plans and their CapEx plans are driven by what they currently see as being short in customer demand, not only for this year and for next year, but longer term. 
And I can only remind you of the very, let's say, confident messages that our customers have given over the last few days on how they feel about the strength of the demand. And we can also go into the details why we think the longer-term demand will be higher.
And having said that, on top of that, there's going to be a push by the drive for technological sovereignty, there will be incentives around the globe to actually build that capacity. That comes on top, which I don't think will translate into significant fast capacity anywhere before 2024 and it will be 2024 at the earliest, probably more like 2025, 2026.
Having said that and going back to the previous question, I think this is why we are looking at our maximum capacity for us and in the supply chain. And I gave the answer. I think this is the work that we're doing today. And when we have that confirmed that we can actually do that, then that would be the time also to relook at the guidance and to see whether we should indeed adjust some of the numbers that we gave you a quarter ago.
But that -- in that order, we have to get ourselves comfortable with the demand situation vis-a-vis our customers. We are translating that into a capacity number, which we need to get confirmed with our key supplier scenario, the size and [ terms and VDLs ] of this world, that needs to be confirmed, and that will leads to construction activities, where you're likely need to read at square meters. And that means if you have that confirmation, we can say, okay, when we have that, looking at the demand situation, what should we do with the 2025 range that we gave you.

Now you had an order last quarter, you were discussing another one with Intel today. .
And in addition, you changed your disclosure of the net bookings, including High-NA now. So my question is should -- what should we expect going forward in terms of High-NA in terms of activity? Should we see more and more High-NA going forward in the following quarters? 
And coming back to your 2025 guidance, with 5 [indiscernible] of High-NA, you have 65, if I count correctly in your backlog now, so how should we think about this moving part and your forecast out of 2025?",128,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think on the 2025 number, we also said in my introductory comments that the EXE:5000, which is the R&D tool, which is the development tool. So there's 5 of it that will be shipped starting in 2022 through 2024. So in 2025, it's the High-NA tool. It's the one that we that's a 5200, that's the one that we received the first order for this quarter, the first quarter of 2022.
I think yes, so you will expect or you may expect. But given the long lead times of these tools, there is going to be more order activity for the High-NA 5200 going forward. I would expect that. But that's driven by indeed the shipment plan 2025.
Now, I think it was Sandeep that asked the question on the 2025 model. I think that this is not a time to piecemeal and give you that 2025 model, but we'll come back to that. But I think High-NA is not so much connected in 2025 to, let's say, the size of the industry and the demand in the industry. It's really technology transition. 
So the way it looks now, I think we're still pretty solid on the plan. I think we -- and I think we said it in the last quarter, with the big evolutionary step from Low-NA to High-NA was the optics. Basically, bigger optics, very significant challenges in measuring the mirrors, and we succeeded. It was a success. It is a success, so we can execute. And this is what we are doing now. 
I mean if you go to the Veldhoven factory now, you would see this massive tool. I mean we showed during the press conference that kind of a picture of some of our engineers, the production engineers in front of to frame. Now you can just see the size of the thing we're executing. 
And I think receiving the first order for 5200, which is going to have, let's say, new standards, setting new standards for lithographic performance in terms of imaging and overlay, it also sets a new standards for productivity.

The reason we said in all scenario is 5 is because of revenue recognition because this is an entirely new product. And therefore, it's hard to predict at this point in time how the installation is going to happen. How the testing is going to pan out, et cetera, et cetera. So that's why we said very conservatively, just put 5 into any model. So it's not related to volume or shipments.

So basically, it's a fact of life, and it's a daily battle of our sourcing people to make sure that we get guarantees on supply -- in the supply chain because we don't buy those components. Those components are being bought by our suppliers. But what we do, we actually consolidate the shortages, which is especially components, microchips from different layers in the supply chain. .
So we actually consolidated and we bring it into what we call a [ scarcity ] center. And then we classify those components by semiconductor manufacturer. And then we get on the phone with them and then say, ""Can you help us, you really can help us by what's on stock giving it to us or helping us through -- manage that through the broker system or the distributor system or making sure that those particular chips get somewhere"" and it's not many. I mean, it's a few hundred to a few thousand of a certain type because we don't make that many systems.

Dassen,,Executives,42,"Didier, on the -- what we expect for 2023, as Peter pointed out, we are working on a capacity over 60 for next year. So that's on Low-NA. We would get the benefit of the 6 going from '22 into '23. Frankly, we would also, if we continue to do a fast ship have a few systems go from '23 into '24.
So if we're able to continue to drive down installation time, we might gain 1, maybe 2 systems. But net-net, I think for next year, you should expect output in revenue to more and more be at the same level. So I think the over 60 in terms of capacity that Peter referenced, I think, is probably the number to look at. 
In terms of High-NA, it's going to be very, very small, right, into 2023 because we expect to have the first shipment of the key modules in -- at the end of 2023. But I wouldn't hold my breath whether that leads to revenue recognition in '23.",171,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

So that's a pretty good significant conversion rate. But that was exceptional. I think it was exceptional, primarily driven by the huge order intake that we had this year and the huge contingent of EUV, and that's a primary source of down payments in there. .
But I would expect for this year to more and more neutralize that. So we're never guiding free cash flow, but I would say, to have an expectation that in a steady state, we're going to look at somewhere around 100% or a little bit below that because we're still growing, I think it's probably a safe assumption for the free cash flow development in the years to come.",152,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Are you going to pursue the way you have? Are you looking at doing more vertical integration? Is it more regional diversification?

Wennink,,Executives,49,"Yes, I think, if you have been at our supervisory board meeting. I mean, this is, of course, the question that we are addressing not only asking ourselves because we already did that, but we're addressing these questions.
I think vertical integration, to answer that question, I don't think that is something which we -- I would say, we try to avoid it. Sometimes we are forced to it. I mean, based on the Berliner Glas, vertical integration, we actually acquired a supplier. But that had some very clear reasons. I mean they had to do with succession planning at the supply, but also that the technology at that particular supply became more and more critical for the performance of the system. So it's not an active -- it is more, you could say that is more a reactive way of looking at growth.
Geographical, clearly, but it's -- but geographical and especially against the background of the geopolitical discussions that are ongoing, of course, is something which is highly sensitive. So -- but yes, we actually look at if we need to build capacity, what's the best place to go to test? What are the best conditions to add capacity, which is a number of issues that we will look at. It has to do with the availability of suppliers that can help us, workforce talent. 
Are we going somewhere where we know we will be heavily competing for workforce talent with some other major players or you could say, giants, that would, of course, put you into more difficult situation. It is incentives that can be provided by governments. I mean -- and that includes the -- where we currently have our manufacturing locations, but also we are looking at areas where we might not have significant manufacturing, but we could.
So I think these are all things that we are looking at. It's too early to give you a finite answer. And I think when we come to the conclusion that we need to go public, we will go public. But these are all the things that we are discussing right now in the company, in the management board and with the supervisory board, because you are right, we need to add significant capacity.

Of course, you put forth your simulation scenarios at the CMD last year. In terms of trying to manage against the risk of over-ordering, double ordering, what are you doing in terms of the check discussion with your customers? We know the secular trends are positive and the industry will remain cyclical. But what are you doing from your side to minimize, if I may call it, the potential risk of oversupply once this capacity all comes online?",95,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

One major thing is that our build capacity, I mean, still, when you look at our cost of sales, and Roger can comment on that. The vast majority of our cost of sales is what we buy. So I think for ASML to add -- build capacity is the minority of our cost of sales. Because we're basically outsourcing, which is one of the reasons why we are not actively pursuing vertical integration. We actually love the fact that we have suppliers that are better at what they do than what we do.
So having said that, we are not afraid of investing in capacity nor is our supply chain, which is most of our critical suppliers are either like size or exactly the same position as we have and some other supplies are more diversified. So they are able to grow.
But it's -- you are right. There is always this risk of looking at where we are today, listening to the CapEx expansion plans of our major customers in Asia and in the U.S., looking at the geopolitical situation and striving for more technological sovereignty, not complete, but more with incentive programs means that yes, we will add capacity.
Now we can have -- look at our simulation model and looking at industry analysts, we have been blatantly wrong. So we can do this again or we can say, now let's look forward. Let's have a longer-term view. I do believe, and I think we're not the only one also our customers that -- the compound annual growth numbers for the semiconductor industry will lead to $1 trillion business by the end of the decade. We're over $500 billion now, which means that $500 billion was created in 40 years' time. So we have less than 10 years to just double it again. So I think we will need that capacity, yes?
Now, your question is, will this create temporary overcapacity? And it could very well be. These fabs are big, they're humongous. It's all about scale. So yes, when everything is timed in the same couple of years, you probably see overcapacity. But structurally and longer term, we need that capacity. So I'm not that concerned, yes? We should do it.
And my last reason why I think we should do it is. On some of these technologies, we are unfortunately, for the industry, the sole source of supply. I don't want to be in a situation as I said it before, that we have to keep pushing the over demand from one year to the other. We have to create a situation where we pay responsibility together with our customers that we can supply what the market needs. And that could indeed mean that there is potential, a bit of overcapacity. Given the fact that we're very bad at predicting the growth rate of this industry, I'm okay with that. But that's perhaps as an answer of an old man.",495,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

In terms of bookings, we're looking at net bookings for Q1 of EUR 7 billion, of which EUR 2.5 billion for EUV. And in that number, there was also multiple High-NA orders included in there.

And that is the result of the fact that we expect more fast shipments at the end of Q2 than we had at the end of Q1. EUR 1.2 billion, again expected and guided as the Installed Base revenue for Q2. We're expecting a gross margin between 49% and 50%. That's a little higher than we had in Q1. 
On the one hand, it benefits from higher volume, both for DUV and EUV. But on the other hand, we are expecting slightly lower ASPs for EUV. The ASP for EUV was very high in Q1. We expect that to be a little bit lower. And also, we expect a slightly negative mix effect from a gross margin perspective because we expect a bit more dry business relatively speaking, so between 49% and 50%.",157,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,5,"For the full year, I think, demand is very, very strong as evidenced by the order intake that I just talked about and also the order book. So the demand outlook is very strong. So once again, as we said in Q1, this year will be very much supply constrained. And on the supply side, we're working very, very hard to navigate all the supply chain issues that everyone is dealing with our industry to the entire industry. But we're working very, very hard to navigate that. So in light of that, we still expect revenue to be up around 20% for 2022 in comparison to 2021. 
And if you then look at the different products and different businesses. On the EUV side, we expect to ship 55 EUV systems. We won't get revenue for all of those 55 systems because we are expecting quite a few EUV systems to be fast shipped at the end of -- or in Q4 at the end of the year. So not all of the revenue for those 55 systems will be recognized this year. Some of that will be recognized in 2023. But still, also in light of that, we still expect that EUV revenue for the year will go up approximately 25%. 
And if we then look at the non-EUV business, we expect that to go up a bit more than 20% in comparison to 2021, which is driven both by immersion, by dry and also by metrology systems. So yes, that's the outlook, if you like, for the different products. If you then look at the different businesses, it is, again, as we said in the last quarter. So that means that the Installed Base business will be up approximately 10%. The Memory business will be up. We expect around 25% and the Logic business, we expect to be up more than 20%.",313,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,7,"Yes, good question. So maybe to remind people of what we said in the last quarter. So last quarter, we articulated an expectation of around 53% in terms of gross margin, which was a little bit up from last year. And going into the moving parts that we discussed then at that point in time, we said we expect the gross margin on the Installed Base revenue business to be a little bit lower because last year, we had a very, very high level of software business, and there, we expect that to be a bit lower this year. So that's why we expect the gross margin on the Installed Base business to be a bit lower. 
We expect that the gross margin on EUV to be higher. And that is primarily driven by the fact that all of the systems that we're going to ship this year will be 3600s. So last year, we had a mix of 3600 and 3400. So that will be positive. It's a little bit offset by the fact that we expect the High-NA cost to be a little bit higher this year. So that takes the gross margin down a little bit. 
And then on the DUV side, we expected it to be more or less in line with where we were last year because the mix that we're looking at for this year will be more or less comparable to the mix between immersion and dry that we had last year. So that was what we said -- that was what we said in Q1. So those are the moving parts. Then exactly to your point in terms of expectations around cost and around inflation. If you look at the different categories, there are 4 categories there that I think we need to look at. 
On the one hand, of course, there is the labor cost. And there's 2 things happening there. On the one hand, we're going to talk about that a little bit later. We're really adding people. We're adding people because we are looking at an accelerated growth of our capacity, if you like. So we're adding people to get them trained, et cetera, et cetera. So the people are there, but they're not yet productive because they need to be trained and productivity obviously lags out a little bit. So that's one element of cost increase. 
The second element particularly for a company that is taking so many talent out of the market because of our growth, we are experiencing quite some competition in the labor market. And of course, that's a bit regional. It's very, very high, I would say, the competition is very, very strong on the labor market in Asia, in Silicon Valley. But all in all, if you add all of that up, there is some cost increase on the labor cost side. So that's the first element. 
Second element, of course, is on the component side. And there, we do have, with a number of suppliers, we do see some price increases in the components. And we also have some costs, some incremental costs, if you like, from service fees, if you like, to secure parts that are in short supply and very high demand. So that's the second category. 
The third category is freight. Freight costs are going up substantially. That's as a result of the increase in fuel prices. I think everyone will recognize but also pretty specific to us because of so many freight movements going into Asia with all the corridors that are being changed as a result of the situation around the Ukraine. Of course, that means that also there, the freight costs are going up as a result of those changes in corridors. 
And then the fourth element is, in general, increase in energy prices. It doesn't affect us all that much, to be honest, at least not directly because first off, we have, of course, longer-term contracts. And secondly, to a very large extent, we are relying on renewables, on renewable energy. So that part is not affecting us very strongly directly. But those are the 4 elements in terms of cost increase. 
If I were to quantify that, I think, all in all, we might be looking this year at about a 1% incremental impact on the gross margin. So I think it's safe to say that rather than the 53%, I think what we're looking at right now, taking into consideration all these effects, I think it's more moving towards 52% for this year in terms of overall gross margin. 
If you then do the calculation, so I gave you the results for Q1, I gave you the expectation for Q2. That means that you're looking at approximately 54% expectation for gross margin in the second half. And I would say that is primarily driven by volume. So we expect the volume obviously to go up in the second half, and that will drive both on the EUV side and on the DPV side that will drive the gross margin. And also, we believe that the gross margin on Installed Base in the second half is going to be more favorable than what we saw in the first half, just as a result of the composition of the different components within the Installed Base revenue.",891,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

So if you look at the current order situation, we have orders for High-NA from 3 customers in logic and from 2 customers in -- on the memory side.

Dassen,,Executives,11,"To be honest, I think everything we said in the Capital Markets Day and also in the recent call still holds true, right? So I think the overall picture of very, very strong demand that continues to go on. And as we said, that's premised on 2 main drivers: first, it's the secular driver. It's the secular growth that we see around the broader and broader application of semiconductors in many different industries and products. So that's the main driver, I would say. And we continue to see that develop very favorably. 
And then secondly, as we also discussed, it's this whole trend around technological sovereignty. And you really now see that many of our customers are becoming more and more firm, more and more concrete in the plans that they have for building fabs across the globe. And that's really manifesting itself and that is going to lead to incremental demand for our products in the years to come. And lastly, I would say, once again, look at the order book, right? So we're looking at an order book of EUR 29 billion for this -- at the end of Q1. And again, also for this quarter, I expect some pretty healthy order intake yet again. 
And then if you just mirror that EUR 29 billion against EUR 17 billion of system sales that we expect to see for this year, that just gives you an indication of how very, very strong order intake is and how very much covered we already are for 2023. So for us, in spite of the macro challenges that, of course, are all around this, we continue to see very, very strong demand and are very positive about also the period beyond 2022.",290,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

So it's twofold. On the one hand, we're already very actively working both us and with the supply chain to just increase capacity. And you might recall, when we had the Capital Markets Day last year, we talked about increasing capacity towards 2020 with 1.5x for DUV. So that gets you to approximately 375 DUV systems capacity by '25. And we're doubling capacity in comparison to 2020 for EUV. So 2x, and that would get you to more than 70 EUV systems by 2025. So that was what we already told you at the Capital Markets Day last year, and we're executing on that. 
We are, the supply chain is, et cetera. But to be honest, in light of everything that's going on, in light of the very, very strong demand that is out there and also in light of the fact that the data points are becoming clearer and clearer that we're really looking at a semiconductor market that is going to double during this decade by 2030. Just in light of all of those data points, we really said we need to push down the accelerator even further. And that's also what we said on the call last quarter. We said we need to -- we're looking at further increase in that. 
So what we're doing right now is really we're looking at the feasibility of increasing capacity even beyond the points that I just gave you. And to be very concrete, what we're looking at is, is it feasible both for ourselves and for the supply chain to get to a capacity for EUV by 2025, low-NA EUV by 2025 of 90 units, and DUV, 600 units. That's what we're looking at for 2025. And for the medium term, we're also looking at 20 units for High-NA. So that's, in fact, the exam question that we now have, both for ourselves and for the supply chain, can we do this? Can we make that happen by 2025 and for High-NA in the medium term? 
So we're going through the process right now. We had a very extensive dialogue with all the suppliers to just see whether that's happening, and they're very active to see can we pull that off. And we expect the results of that, I would say, in the second half of this year. And once we have that and once they have done their homework to test whether and under what circumstance that can be done. And we've done the same on our end because, of course, that would also mean that we would have to build incremental clean room here for us. 
Once all of that is done, then we're going to translate that into updated scenarios for 2025 and also updated growth projections beyond 2025. Because I gave you the capacity numbers that we're working towards for 2025. Of course, that doesn't automatically translate into sales numbers for 2025. That's pretty obvious. This is the objective. This is the goal that we have for capacity. Once we know that's feasible, we're just going to look at what updated 2025 scenarios and growth expectations beyond 2025 are going hand-in-hand with that new plan. 
Once we have that established in the second half of this year, we would like to give an update, and we would like to, in essence, in Q4, we're targeting a new Investor Day in which we would then give these updated scenarios and share that with the financial community. So yes, all in all, I mean, while on the geopolitical front, of course, these are tough times and challenging times, to be honest, for our industry, given all the dynamics that we talked about, given the strength of the order book that we see, it's actually a pretty exciting time. 
And from that vantage point, just recognizing that growth, recognizing the positive dynamics that we see within our industry. Our confidence in the growth trajectory that we see for ourselves is going from strength to strength.",668,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the first quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2022.  
Net sales came in at EUR 3.5 billion, which is at the high end of guidance. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized EUR 591 million revenue from 3 systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 2.3 billion, which was nicely balanced between Logic at 50% and 50% from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.2 billion, as guided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at the guidance of 49.0%.  
On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 739 million, and SG&A expenses at EUR 208 million. R&D was below guidance as spend rates in the quarter was lower than planned and will move to Q2. We still expect to be around 14% of sales for the year.  
Net income in Q1 was EUR 695 million, representing 19.7% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 1.73.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.7 billion.  
Moving to the order book. Q1 net system bookings came in at EUR 7.0 billion, including EUR 2.5 billion for 0.33 EUV NA systems and multiple EUV 0.55 NA systems, EXE:5200.  
Another very strong DPV order intake of EUR 4.5 billion this quarter, reflecting the continued strong demand for advanced and mature nodes.  
Total net system bookings was driven by Logic with 66% of the bookings and Memory accounting for the remaining 34%.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2022. We expect Q2 total net sales to be between EUR 5.1 billion and EUR 5.3 billion. This excludes around EUR 800 million of net delayed revenue for Q2 as a result of more fast shipments at the end of Q2 than at the end of Q1. We expect our Q2 installed base management sales to be around EUR 1.2 billion.  
Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 49% and 50%. Relative to last quarter, we expect positive margin impact from higher volume for both EUV and DPV, offset by lower EUV ASP, DPV mix and continued cost pressure in the quarter. The expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around EUR 790 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 220 million. In the current environment, it is also appropriate to address how we may be impacted by rising costs this year. We're not immune to rising costs. There is pressure on labor cost as the global job market for engineers is tight, and there is a competition for talent.  
Costs related to components in the supply chain are also increasing due to higher material costs, including additional fees to secure parts.  
Transportation costs have increased due to rising fuel costs and changing flight routes. Energy contracts and renewable energy help limit the increased energy cost impacts. We clearly see pressure on margins due to these cost increases, which we expect to translate roughly to a 1% impact on gross margin for full year 2022.  
We expect the second half of the year will be strong with expected gross margins of around 54%, primarily driven by higher EUV and DPV volume as well as improved margin from installed base business. In summary, we currently expect gross margin to be closer to 52% for the year.  
Our estimated 2022 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. In Q1 2022, ASML acquired 3.6 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 2.1 billion as part of our current program.  
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",635,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, revenue and profitability for the quarter came in as guided with system revenue balanced between Logic and Memory. We expect a step-up in sales in Q2 as revenue from fast shipments in Q1 will be recognized. While supply chain challenges are still present, we will continue to utilize fast shipments as a means to get systems to customers as soon as possible.  
Although the current macroeconomic environment creates uncertainty, we believe the fundamental growth drivers remain intact. We continue to see unprecedented customer demand across all market segments from both advanced and mature nodes, driving demand across our entire product portfolio. We are running at maximum capacity and expect demand to exceed supply well into next year. Our view of the full year revenue, therefore, remains unchanged with year-on-year growth of around 20% over 2021.  
As mentioned last quarter, this 20% sales growth does not include the full shipment value of systems out for this year due to a number of fast shipments, which will result in a delayed revenue into 2023. For our EUV business, we still expect to ship around 55 systems this year. And as we plan to do fast shipments on a number of these systems, including systems in Q4, we expect some revenue to be deferred to 2023. This translates to an expected system revenue of around EUR 7.8 billion this year.  
In our deep UV and applications business, we expect significant growth in both immersion and dry systems, as well as continued demand for metrology and inspection systems. In addition to advanced nodes, we see growing demand for deep UV systems supporting mature market segments such as analog, power and sensors. These market segments are part of the secular growth drivers in support of digital infrastructure, which includes automotive and green energy applications. We expect revenue growth of over 20% for non-EUV system revenue.  
For the Installed Base Management business, service revenue will continue to scale with the growing installed base of systems. Customers continue to look at all methods to add wafer capacity, including productivity upgrades. In these times, a very high fab utilization, some of these upgrades are hardware-intensive and require systems to be taken off-line for installation. Therefore, available system time will dictate their ability to install these types of upgrades. And as we mentioned in previous quarters, the quickest way to add wafer capacity is to install software productivity packages. These upgrades require less system downtime and have now been installed in most of our customer fabs. We currently expect 2022 installed base revenue to be up around 10% year-on-year.  
Looking at the market segments in 2022. Our view on growth is similar to last quarter. We still expect Logic system revenue to be up more than 20% year-on-year and Memory system revenue to be up around 25% year-on-year.  
On High-NA EUV, we're making good progress. And we have currently started the integration of the first High-NA system in our new [indiscernible] in Veldhoven. We received multiple orders for our EXE:5200 system in Q1. We also received additional EXE:5200 orders this month, April. With these bookings, we now have High-NA orders with 3 Logic and 2 Memory customers. The EXE:5200 is ASML's next model High-NA system and will provide the next step for lithography performance and productivity.  
The global market trends that we talked about at our Investor Day last year are broadening the application space and providing secular growth drivers for future demand. The strong demand this year and beyond is reflected in the significant bookings over the past several quarters, resulting in a backlog of around EUR 29 billion is an all-time high. We expect the strong order intake to continue as demand will continue to exceed supply also going well into next year. With multiple countries pursuing technological sovereignty, we are now seeing a number of announcements from customers for new fabs in the coming years in support of this global trend. These announced investments are expected to have a positive impact on the medium-term demand. As this unprecedented demand is exceeding our capacity, ASML and its supply chain partners are planning to actively add capacity to meet future customer demand as communicated during Investor Day last year. But at that time, we talked about the current capacity ramp is expected to deliver an output capability of over 70 EUV 0.33 NA systems and around 375 DPV systems by 2025.  
As mentioned last quarter, we see a need to further increase our output beyond this level in order to meet the stronger and longer market demand to support an industry that is expected to at least double by 2030. With the goal of adding more capacity, we're investigating the feasibility of increasing our annual capacity by 2025 to around 90 EUV 0.33 NA systems and 600 DPV systems.  
For deep UV, we're planning to increase capacity for both immersion and dry, with a heavier weighting towards dry. We're also discussing with our supply chain partners to secure a capacity of around 20 EUV 0.55 High-NA systems in the medium term. Bear in mind that this translates to what we currently feel our maximum capacity goal should be and may therefore not be a final output plan. We discussed our goal recently with our supply chain partners and asked them to come back in the coming quarters with confirmation on the feasibility of our request.  
Once we complete this analysis, we also expect to revisit our 2025 scenarios and growth opportunities beyond 2025. We're planning to provide an update to the capital markets in the Q4 time frame.  
It is clearly a dynamic, challenging but also exciting period in our industry and it only increases our confidence in our long-term growth opportunity.  
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",971,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Joe, that's a good question. Basically, the number of 600 is a result of 2 things. One is, you have to remember, when we did the September Capital Markets Day, we prepared this a couple of months before. So I think you're looking at market intelligence that, as compared to last year, is about a year old. So we have -- has a bit more insights. And I think that's translated into that number. And on the other hand, we are currently looking at the demand for this year and next year, where it comes from. Looking at the customer base, which effectively means that every customer we almost ever sold a machine to is coming to us to ask for a DPV tool, which was just particularly true for dry. 
So it's the current demand level plus our, let's say, insights that have progressed over the last 12 months or so. And those insights are basically across a number of lines. I would say one is the mature market upside is higher because the visibility has increased, especially from Asia. And when we look at the type of semiconductors that are in demand now and the capacity that's been installed and especially if you look at the lower end, when you talk about power ICs, you talk about sensors, optical and non-optical sensors, analog. You talk about microcontrollers. There is a demand for those type of semiconductors almost in every industrial area, which when we look at it and we look at the growth numbers and the demand, talking to our customers, it's a very wide range, just the mature market upside is really driven by a significant increase of IoT-type opportunities. Now that's one.  
Number two is we also see the need for more silicon for the PC and high-power compute applications. It has to do with the fact that you actually see that in order to be more energy efficient, the device's clock speed, the clock frequency is decreased but actually has a significant impact on the energy usage. However, it also has an impact on the performance. So how do you compensate that by adding more transistors. Where you have more transistors, you add more silicon square millimeters. So die sizes are growing. That's what we very clearly see has also been confirmed with many customers.  
Then we see also in non-semi litho applications, for instance, goggles and waveguides. We see an increase in the demand for lithography equipment. And then on top of that, we see the demand medium term for technological sovereignty demand, which is basically an incentive program that actually helps our leading-edge customers to build out fab capacity quicker. So I think all in all, the -- and also the -- I would say, the market visibility has increased. A very important issue, of course, that our customers are finding out, that our order lead time is one thing but the most important lead time is the capacity lead time. So our customers now sharing with us much longer capacity improvement plans, which actually extend way into, let's say, the 2024, 2025 time frame. So all that together gives the confidence that the numbers that we're talking about, which are 90 EUV numbers and the 600 deep UV numbers have actually a basis. Now a lot of the detail we would like to share with you once we get the confirmation from our supply chain partners that, that feasibility request is -- can actually be executed on. And we think that will happen in the next couple of quarters. So in Q4, it's the reason why we want to update you to a Capital Market Day, where we can give you some more details on what I just said, which basically -- I think I want to give you some details, but that then we can spend a bit more time on it.",652,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And if you took our market share in the worldwide demand, then, of course, that was lower than the 375. So that's the buffer that you're referring to. 
There, I would say that's typically something that we will discuss in the Investor Day that Peter was referring to because Peter is talking about what we're looking into in terms of capacity. At the Investor Day, at the Capital Markets Day, we're obviously also going to articulate our expectations on demand. And there, I think you will see how that capacity will relate to the demand that we see for 2025.

If I just do some sort of probably simple math, it looks like your backlog for DUV only is sitting at around 500 tools or so, while you're shipping around 60 tools per quarter in DUV only. So does that mean that the waiting time for DUV tool today is more than 2 years?  
And related to that, as you think about how you -- your increase of DUV capacity, where would you like that sort of waiting time to go back to? Would it go back to 9 months in a perfect world? Or is there a kind of new reality where backlog will be extended for quite a while?",121,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

Two good questions, Rob. One, yes, the DPV backlog is quite significant. You mentioned 500, it actually is a little bit more. But -- yes, we're shipping around 60 units. But you have to realize that while we're doing that, we are increasing our shipment capability. I mean, although we are not at the 600 units as we mentioned, we will be able to increase more deep UV shipments throughout this year and next year for the simple reason that we're basically pulling out all the stops in cycle time reduction, in process efficiency. So I think that number will go up. So it will not be stable.
Having said that, you are right. If you would come in and you want a deep UV tool now, it's going to be second half of next year because for the simple reason that the PO, the purchase order lead time is completely irrelevant now. It's the capacity lead time. 
So you need to build capacity in order to be able to get more, which ultimately means that, yes, by we think 2025, let's take another 2 years at least to build out that capacity. Then we will go back to, let's say, 9 months and less PO lead time. Yes. So this is indeed the case. 
This is also why the demand that we currently see in deep UV, but we can probably only ship at this moment in time this year, only 60% of the deep UV demand. So anything that comes on that, that's driven by our maximum capacity. And anything beyond that, indeed, is a matter of capacity lead time, not the only time.",277,1.0,6.0,0.5555555555555556,0.6

Just a quick follow-up to that. I'm assuming suppliers will want prepayments, guarantees in order to build more capacity for you guys. And they may look for higher pricing. But so should we think about pricing of individual tools going up on top of the inflation that we're seeing from the various different cost drivers just from the fact that suppliers will want some kind of guarantee from you guys that you'll take delivery?",76,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

I think this is -- it's always been the case when you go to the supply base, hey, we need to add capacity. I think we have a pretty convincing story for them that this industry will grow. Like I said in the prepared remarks, we think there's a very good chance that this -- that the industry of our customers will more than double before the end of the decade. And if that's the case, we're just going to need more capacity, which they all agree with. 
Now if we're going to help suppliers, and I'm not excluding that at all, it's just a matter of sometimes the financial means that a supplier might have or run into a certain financial ceiling that we might help and step in like we've done in the past, that's not a major issue. 
That is not to take away the risk but just to make sure that people execute faster. And I think that, that might happen. But generally, our suppliers are big enough to pay for their own CapEx. So I don't think that's going to be a major issue. 
And on pricing, I think the cost increase that we've seen are really short-term cost increases. We do value pricing. So it is not cost plus, what we are doing. Having said that, the value of the wafers coming out of our customers over time will also go up, which were just going to be a function of that cost increase. So it also means that going forward, value pricing will also lead to different prices that we will charge to our customers. I mean that's all connected, not short term, but definitely over the next 12 to 24 months when the volume purchase agreements run out, we have new volume purchase agreements that will be reflected.",307,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

First of all, maybe a question just to understand a bit better the '25 capacity plan. I know you don't like to talk about WFE, but I would like to understand what's baked in your numbers because when I just sort of reverse engineer what you've guided for, I get to WFE roughly in the $140 million to $150 million range. I just wanted to understand if that's what you're thinking about. 
And related to that, when we make WFE intensity numbers, assumptions, et cetera, you get to a global semiconductor demand in 2025 in the range of EUR 800 billion-plus to EUR 940 billion-plus, which I'm a believer, but that's an aggressive growth rate, especially in the context of the current macro environment and worries about researching, et cetera. So I just wanted to understand if that's the right way to think about it? And if not, why not? And I've got a quick follow-up on High-NA.",164,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,33,"Well, I think there's -- a lot of what you said is the right way to think about it. But I think the only comment I would make is that you pin everything on 2025. When we basically say we want to build our debt capacity by 2025, we do this also with the intent and with the focus on what we believe is going to be a very strong secular growth for our customers. So even if you look at the latest Gartner data, actually, they are above EUR 1 billion for 2030. 
And so it -- so it is capacity that is there for the second half of the decade. It doesn't mean that if we would have that capacity by 2025 that the -- we're not saying that the semiconductor industry will gobble up all our capacity by 2025, but it will definitely do that in the second half. And this is why it's important because you add capacity, you need lead time. You need to start now because it takes a couple of years. And that might be that we don't need it in 2025. We might definitely need it in '26 or '27 or '28 to your point. 
Now -- and if you then say if you would look at the latest Gartner data, which is just above, I think it's EUR 1.1 trillion. If you look at that and you apply your historical WFE numbers, you're coming pretty close to what you just said. So it is needed. This is an investment in the growth of the company and the growth of the industry of our customers. That's what it is. And I'm not telling you what the 2025 revenue number for the semiconductor industry is going to be, but it's going to be higher. That's absolutely certain. But this is the reason why.

Perfect. So my second question is on High-NA. So at the time of the CMD, you were sort of cautiously telling us about 5 units, give or take, 2025. Now you're saying that you're thinking about building capacity for 20 units midterm. So I take it beyond 2025. I just wondered if you could, a, give us a sense of how many units have you booked so far given the support you get from your 5 customers in the quarter? And give or take, I mean are you thinking about more than 5 units already for 2025? Or sort of what's the linearity of that 20, what's the trajectory? I mean is it really taking off in '25? Or is it taking off a little bit after?",129,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,35,"Good question, Didier. I think at the Capital Markets Day, what we said is the 5 is just the 5 that we take into revenue. And the reason -- and you might also recall that the 5 was in there for the high market scenario, but also for the low market scenario. And the reason we did that is that we said we're a bit unclear at this stage as to how revenue recognition is going to look like for those systems. Also take into consideration that we don't know exactly how in '24, how in '25, how the installation process, how exactly that will work because we have different models how to do that. 
So that's why we said we're going to be pretty conservative. The 5 is a pretty conservative estimate of what we might be able to -- what we might ship in '24, and then we take that revenue. Clearly, we're looking for '25, we're looking at a number north of those 5 in terms of shipments that we expect for 2025. That's the reason why we were so conservative, if you like, on the number of 5 in 2025. So more shipments expected in '25. 
And that's also why we said for the 20, we set medium term. Medium term is a little bit after '25, so that could be in the '26, '27 time frame. That's where we think the number of 20 will be necessary to cater the demand that we have there. 
I mean the buildup of the order book is progressing very nicely, not just on the 5000 tool, which will initially be used for research purposes. But as we mentioned to you, now we also have clear orders for the 5200 coming in last quarter and also coming in, in this quarter.

Wennink,,Executives,38,"Well, I'm with the company 23 years and I've always tried to read the minds of the investors, and I always got it wrong. So don't ask me that question. So no, it's a place that can only read the minds, not only read the minds, but talk with our customers and see where we are today. And the issue is, and I tried to mention this before is that the demand that we're currently seeing comes from so many places in the industry. Technology-wise, market-wise, geography-wise, it's so widespread that we have significantly underestimated the -- let's say, the width of the demand. And I think that I don't think is going to -- is going to go away.
And it just -- it's an anecdote, but I met a very large -- the executive of a very large industrial company, a conglomerate, last week. And actually, they told me that they're buying washing machines and to rip out the semiconductors to put them in industrial modules. I mean, that's happening these days. 
Now we could say that's an anecdote. But to be honest, it happens everywhere. It is -- like I said, it is -- it is 15-, 20-, 25-year-old semiconductor technology that is now being used everywhere. It's got -- it's all driven by IoT-type applications. I don't think that is a fluke. I don't think that is real. And I think our customers are currently demanding, and I said it before, 600 deep UV systems this year. Now if we can do 60% of that, I'm pretty happy this year. 
Now that will also grow next year. We will ship more than 375 deep UV systems next year because we're pulling in that 2025 target that we actually had and then putting out all the stops to ship more systems. 
Now the demand could go down from 600, yes, another 25%, which is still above our maximum capacity. So you tell me whether we're too optimistic. I'm just looking at the data points and the data points just point into a market that is significantly short of semiconductor manufacturing capacity this year and next year. And what macroeconomics will do, I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see. But currently, we see no signs of any weakening in our customer base, 0.

Also for China this year, we're expecting about 20% growth, which is similar to what we see for the rest of the company. So I think China is in line. The fact that you saw such a high percentage for China in the Q1 sales in particular is because, as you know, we only had 3 EV systems in the total mix. So as a result of that, the China sales as a percentage of the total was so high. But I think that's an anomaly that will rectify itself in the course of the year. So we're still expecting domestic China to grow 20% just as the rest of the customer base.
And an answer to your question, yes, we do believe that what they're adding in terms of capacity is being used. It's being used for manufacturing. So it's not like they're piling up lithography tools, they're really using these as well.",176,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So it's -- they're being used and that's what we see. As a matter of fact, one of our Chinese customers, big customer told us, ""Hey, I'm sold out.

If we would do next year, let's say, I think it's going to be over 375 because we're pulling out all the stops, like I said, which will -- that basically be our absolute maximum capacity. I mean, we're doing overtime, hiring people, whatever. There's not only us, it's particularly in the supply chain. So that's where we want to go, yes.
Now what needs to happen for that demand to go down, the demand for next year is 600 units. So you need to lose 35% to 40% of your demand. And then you hit our capacity, our maximum capacity. 
Now of course, we can all dream up horror scenarios whereby the world collapses and all kinds of crazy things happen, it's -- we'll deal with it when we are there, when it's such a disaster. But for, let's say, a macroeconomic slowdown, well, needs to be significant to take 35% to 40% out of the demand curve. And then we're still shipping more than what we shipped this year. 
So yes, no. And on horror scenarios, I don't know, I'm not the kind of guy that you should ask the question, but probably all the people better suited to do that, but that's the way that I look at the world.",217,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

I think High-NA, sooner. Generally, that's not the case because it's -- like you pointed out, I mean, it's a supply chain issue. I mean it's a different machine. It's sort of different modules that needs to be built. So this is really focused on executing according to plan, which doesn't give us a lot of room to do more and sooner. So it is really our shipment plan. 
And Roger just talked about the difference between revenue recognition and shipment. But the shipment plan hasn't changed that much because it's all very much linked to the capability of the supply chain to actually forward that. But I think in HVM insertion, we always have 25, 26. I think that's very likely what it's still going to be the case. 
Now having said that, it could very well be that you see the first 2-nanometer chips being produced in 2025 as a kind of a first set of devices that show the capability. But I think HVM is probably the '25, '26 time frame.",175,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

Is that what the industry needs and you need to guess to an equilibrium between offer and demand or something a bit more reasonable terms of lead times?

Wennink,,Executives,57,"I'm probably going to answer that question for the third time. But I think it's basically what we feel the capacity is needed to actually be available in 2025 for the rest of the decade. Now if for whatever reason, the demand that we could see today and for next year would still be the same demand as we see -- that we would see in 2025, we would need it in 2025 to actually ship, but that we don't know that. I mean this is really driven by how the market is by 2025. It could be -- it's the same as it is today. It could be higher, it could be lower. We don't know that yet, but this is definitely something which we are going to discuss in Q4 where we show you a couple of scenarios where we can show that this could happen. If this happens, then you would see that result. If that happens, you would see a different result. 
But it's really about the capacity buildup. So it's not that we are saying, well, the unconstrained demand for 2025 on us is 600 DPV and 90 EUV. We will have the capacity there that if that would be the case, we could do it, but we don't know whether it's going to be the case, but we definitely need it. We definitely need it for the second half of this decade given the growth of our customers. And let's keep our fingers crossed and see what 2025 brings us.",257,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,59,"Well, I think we've made a point a couple of times. 3D DRAM is an option. We think it's not going to be 2025. It is an option. It could hit somewhere in the second half of this decade. But we also know, and we know that because our customers are telling us this, and actually, our customers are telling this in a public way, that whatever their road map is, what is clear is that EUV and High-NA has a particularly important role to play in that road map. And the latest, very clear and public data point, and that was Samsung at their conference in November of last year, where they clearly demonstrated that EUV was there, was on their road map for the next 10 to 15 years. That's what they indicated. They said even to go to DRAM, I think it was 8 nanometers or 5 nanometer that I talked about, less than 5 nanometers. They need EUV and High-NA in order to get there.
So that's what's important to us. That's what's driving our road map also on the -- on Memory. Could that go in conjunction with 3D DRAM? It's possible, but it will be always a combination. That's what our customers are telling us and that's what we stick by.",217,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I think it's largely these capacity additions in Memory are for current capacity demand. I mean, like I said earlier, the utilization of our machines in the memory space is very, very high. So we even say it's the highest point ever. So if there's a high-teens, 20% bit growth number expected for this year, you just need to add capacity. So I think the bulk of what you're seeing there is just to add capacity. 
And yes, there will some of it will be higher, so you will -- that's not translated into an immediately bit capacity. But with EUV, it is, because don't forget, EUV is now HVM technology also in DRAM.

Wennink,,Executives,67,"No, I think we just had our, let's say, supplier day a couple of weeks ago and was very clear that all our suppliers confirmed that they said this is the target that we should go for. It's really a matter of them creating the executable plans to actually get to that capacity number by the time frame that we asked. 
And that has to do with the plans that they need to make to build square meters, to build factories to hire people, to order specialized machinery. That needs all confirmation in their supply chain. So it's a supply chain of the supply chain. They need to find the builders. They need to get the square meters. They need to get the permits. 
So just a very practical stuff that if you want to expand capacity, how quickly can you do that? And what are the normal, let's say, business hurdles that you would have to pass in order to make sure that, that happens. This is the type of discussion that we're having. And this is -- that's basically -- all these things are gating the conformation. 
So they work on this and they will get -- as we go along over the next couple of months, quarters, they will get all the confirmations and say, yes, we can do it.

One is on the -- basically, you work out dealing with your suppliers. You mentioned, Peter, that you don't bear a lot of cost to add capacity, but these suppliers will probably have a lot of risk or more risk to you than you in terms of balance sheet and under [indiscernible] charges and you want to build this capacity well ahead of time for the second decade. 
So my question is, do you expect to share somewhat the risk of the investment with your suppliers somehow, I mean, with maybe a payment or anything like that we should expect to help your suppliers to get to this kind of level and bear the risk of overcapacity? 
And the second one is you talk about suppliers, but what about the peers, your peers as well? It seems that your capacity expansion is quite big, at least since last year. Do you expect the peers for other parts of the supply chain to increase as much? Is there a risk here that you build too much and the others don't, and therefore, you can't unlock this value?",193,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

On the first question, yes, I mean, we've done that in the past also. I mean if a supplier, let's take ZEISS, for instance, it comes to us and says, hey, can you do some shared risk investment and it goes beyond what you would say, the let's say, average or normal financial capabilities of that supply. We have done that in the past and we will do it again. 
Having said that, over the last 10 years, our supply base has actually grown quite significantly also in terms of size and in terms of financial capability. So I think it's going to be limited, but if it's needed, it's needed and we'll do it. So I don't think it's going to be a major issue. So risk sharing is in our genes. So that's not the point. On the peers, we're coming out because our capacity lead times are probably the longest in the industry. So we go first. And I would expect our peers, if we do that, then the market is there and we believe the market is going to be there, they will follow. It's that simple.",192,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We had gross margin coming in at 49.1%, which is a bit of a lower end of the guidance, just to do with the increased inflationary effects that we've seen. Net income, EUR 1.4 billion. And very good order intake, EUR 8.5 billion of orders, which is a quarterly record. 
Now all in all, I think a solid quarter. However, it was not without challenges and mainly because of supply chain challenges, supply chain constraints, parts not coming in on time, but we managed the quarter.",112,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Well, like I said, what we saw in the second quarter, which is basically an acceleration of supply chain constraints, is actually also happening in Q3. And I think it will happen throughout the remainder of the year, which will mean that in the third quarter, we will see more fast shipments than we planned, and this shall also be true throughout the remainder of the year. 
Now we have to remind what the fast shipment is, and the fast shipment is, in fact, a way to reduce the cycle time by cutting or not doing certain tests in our factory, which could lead up to 1 month of cycle time reduction, very important when the customers are waiting for those machines. So we only do those tests at the customer site, and which means the revenue recognition will, as we move to that moment in time, which means, yes, we will have more fast shipments, so we'll have more deferred revenue than we anticipated. 
So when we look at Q3 and look at the guidance of Q3, I would say that it's more or less in line with the guidance that we gave for Q2. So it's between EUR 5.1 billion, EUR 5.4 billion of sales, between 49% and 50% margin and about EUR 1.4 billion of Installed Base Management.",221,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,5,"Well, first of all, 2022, we have to put this into context. 2022, the demand is still significantly higher than what we can make. So this is the situation that the last quarter and is still the same, and we don't see any demand reduction. But what we do see is what I said earlier is that shipments will be indeed later, so we have more fast shipments. So we have revenue recognition delayed. 
Now we said a quarter ago that the impact of those fast shipments, this revenue recognition delay, was going to be about EUR 1 billion for this year. Now where we are today, we think it's going to be EUR 2.8 billion. So we have about EUR 1.8 billion of more revenue recognition delays. And those delays, of course, translate into our 2022 sales number. So currently, we think sales will grow a bit about 10%, which if you do the math, would come around EUR 20.5 billion for 2022. 
Now in summary, if you then look at what we said a quarter ago and where we are today, a quarter ago, we said sales going to grow with 20%, grow which brings you to EUR 22.3 billion, but with EUR 1 billion of deferred revenue recognition because of fast shipments. 
Where we are now, we say, well, it's 10%, let's will bring you to EUR 20.5 billion with EUR 2.8 billion of deferred revenue because of fast shipments. So when you look at the business volume or the shipment value, it's effectively these quarters are basically the same. So our guidance from that point of view has not changed.",274,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

However, because of those fast shipments and the revenue recognition delay, the deferred revenue, we are now looking at -- which, by the way, are 15 EUV systems. We are now looking at a revenue, a booked revenue for EUV for 40 systems, so which is about EUR 6.4 billion in sales.  
Now on deep UV, we see a significant number of deep UV shipments, a significant increase as compared to last year. But also there, we are seeing the impact of these fast shipments. So we think we'll end up around EUR 8.6 billion in sales for deep UV, which is just over 15% increase as compared to last year, which, by the way, previous quarter, we thought it was going to be 20%. 
And on Installed Base Management, 10% growth as compared to last year, EUR 5.5 billion in total. So add up to EUR 6.4 million for EUV, 8.6% for deep UV, 5.5 for Installed Base management, 20.5 billion for 2022, which is about a 10% increase.",184,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We started the year with a gross margin expectation of about 53%, and we corrected that in Q1 to -- with 1 percentage point to about 52%, largely because of the unexpected increased inflationary effects. Where we are today, we see the following. Of course, most importantly, we are deferring EUR 1.8 billion more of revenue to 2023. It happens to be our higher-margin immersion and EUV systems. 
Now next to that, we're starting our systems late because of the late delivery of parts, which means that we have fewer systems this year that can cover the fixed cost. So it's fixed cost coverage. And you have to remember the fixed costs are also going up because we are planning, and we will ship more systems next year as we see it today. So we need to invest. 
And last but not least, we see inflationary effects. I mean, we've seen an acceleration of inflationary pressure on labor, on freight, specifically on parts. And all in all, if you then look at it, we expect that, the gross margin for 2022 will end up between 49% and 50%. 
Now having said that, of course, we're in discussion today with our ecosystem partners, our suppliers and our customers to see how we can basically fairly share the burden of all these cost increases. And now looking at it, I think it's really when you look at 2022 and look at the lower guidance on gross margin, it's driven by these short-term effects. It's inflationary effects that we didn't plan for. It's the supply chain challenges that led to deferred revenue, is all shorter term. 
And of course, we're in discussion with our customers to see how we can fairly share this. But I think longer term, there is no reason whatsoever we see currently to change our ambition for our gross margin targets around 2025, which is between 54% and 56%.",321,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

A good question. I think near term, clearly, we see a very mixed messages coming out of the customer base. With respect to consumer-related products, we clearly see a slowdown, particularly in PCs and in smartphones. On the other hand, in the industrial space, when you talk about high-performance compute, you talk about automotive, the demand is still very, very strong. 
And I think it's also evidenced by the utilization rates of our machines that are in the Installed Base, which are at a historical high. and it's still the case today. But we were also seeing across different semiconductor nodes inventories going up towards, let's say, pre-COVID-type levels. And that's pretty broad based. So all in all, yes, it's a bit of a mixed picture shorter term. 
Longer term, I think there is no denying that the digital transition that's taking place will continue. We see it very clearly in automotive. Talking to customers and customers' customers, we see a quadrupling or quintupling of the semiconductor content. 
Lately, our customers are talking about the energy transition. The renewable energy transition, which is very topical these days, will require semiconductors for wind and for solar and for the smart grid. On top of that, we see the Internet of Everything, everything that we've seeing in terms of sensors and actuators needing semiconductors, it's happening, will not go away. 
On top of that, more energy-efficient, high-performance compute, need more transistors. So the die are getting larger. We're needing more extra wafers. The geopolitical situation, the technological sovereignty that countries are after is driving these big investment and subsidy programs. And we also think that if we look at the announcements, the competition in the foundry space will also go up. So all in all, longer term, very healthy and abated views, a good and very healthy growth. Shorter-term mixed signals.",310,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,13,"Well, let me, first of all, say that when we look at 2022 and 2023, you look at the order intake, EUR 8.5 billion of order intake, which is a quarterly historical high, very engaged order discussions with our customers this quarter. We see a backlog of over EUR 33 billion. So I think that looks very healthy. 
Now having said that, I think for 2022, we are, of course, not blind for anything that we hear with respect to inflationary pressures, probably recessionary concerns. So for 2022, I don't think it will have any real effect in terms of our shipments. 
For 2023, you really have to ask the question, what kind of recession are you looking at? If it's a moderate recession, I think the impact will be very limited for a simple reason that we have such a big backlog that our customers are coming to us and saying, listen, if we see a slowdown, sure, well, one thing is certain, we want your machines. And it's logical. Those machines are very critical, long lead time. 
And you have to remember that, of our backlog, 85% is for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, high-end immersion and EUV. And of the remaining 15%, mature technology also needed for advanced production. So I think all in all, pretty healthy. 
And for 2023, if we see the supply chain constraints going away by the end of the year, which we're planning for or even if it's the first part of 2023, we will definitely need our capacity that we are planning, which is over 60 EUV systems and over 375 deep UV systems; with this potential risk of a moderate recession, we will need that capacity because our customers tell us.

And it's also obvious that big societal challenges need big solutions, and semiconductors go to the heart of those. 
So as is yes, semiconductors will grow, semiconductor industry will grow, litho intensity will increase. And as a matter of fact, if we look at that, we just -- are going to just repeat what we said a quarter ago that we do need structurally more capacity. 
And as we said, by 2025, we want to have a build capacity for EUV of 90 systems and deep UV of 600 systems. And beyond 2025, we want to build at least 20 High-NA systems. I think that is still very much intact, and we're working with our suppliers to get it done.

Short term, there's no denial that there are concerns. There are inflationary concerns, recessionary concerns. As at the [indiscernible] it is now, we have supply chain constraints that leads to fast shipments and deferral of revenue recognition, we'll deal with that. 
But also short term, we look at an order backlog, which is very strong. We look at a customer demand for 2022 and 2023, that is unabated, which can withstand any moderate recession in our opinion. And then, of course, we have the longer-term trends. 
I think the longer-term trends are, like I said earlier, unabated. I mean, it's obvious that the digital transformation will continue and will provide a very, very healthy growth profile for the company going forward with us and with our customers. 
And of course, we'll go into more detail.

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2022. Net sales came in at EUR 5.4 billion, slightly above our guidance. 
We shipped 14 EUV systems and recognized EUR 2 billion revenue from 12 EUV systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 4.1 billion, which was driven by Logic at 71% and remaining 29% from Memory. 
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.3 billion above guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 49.1%, which is at the lower end of our guidance, primarily due to increasing inflationary costs. 
On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 789 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 222 million, as guided. Net income in Q2 was EUR 1.4 billion, representing 26.0% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 3.54. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.4 billion. Moving to the order book. Q2 net system bookings came in at a record EUR 8.5 billion, reflecting the continued strong customer demand for both the advanced and mature nodes. 
Strong order intake of EUR 5.4 billion for EUV 0.33 NA and EUV 0.55 NA system and EUR 3.1 billion for non-EUV systems. 
Total net system bookings was driven by Logic, 60% of the bookings, and Memory accounting for the remaining 40%. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2022. We are experiencing increasing supply chain constraints, which resulted in delayed system starts and requires us to increase the number of fast shipments in Q3, in order to supply our customers with systems in production as quickly as possible. 
With more fast shipments planned in the quarter, it will increase the amount of revenues delayed to subsequent quarters.
We expect Q3 total net sales to be between EUR 5.1 billion and EUR 5.4 billion. This excludes around EUR 1.1 billion of net delay revenue for Q3 as a result of more fast shipments at the end of Q3 than at the end of Q2. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.4 billion. 
Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 49% and 50%, similar to prior quarter. The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR 810 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 235 million. Our estimated 2022 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. 
In Q2, ASML paid a final dividend of EUR 3.17 per ordinary share. Together with the interim dividend paid in 2021, this results in a total dividend for 2021 of EUR [ 5.15 ] per ordinary share. We plan to grow our dividend and will move from a biannual to a quarterly dividend payout, starting in Q3 this year. 
This will provide more timely return of cash to our investors and more evenly balance our cash across the year. First quarterly interim dividend over 2022 will be EUR 1.37 per ordinary share and will be made payable on August 12, 2022. 
In Q2 2022, we repurchased around 2.3 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 1.2 billion. Total shares bought underneath 2021-23 program until end of Q2 is around 12.4 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 7.9 billion. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",593,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, revenue and profitability for the quarter basically came within guidance. The expected sales in Q3 are to be at similar guided range as Q2 as increasing supply constraints drive more [ fast ] shipments and delay revenue [ addition ] to subsequent quarters. 
Looking at the more near-term market dynamics, we see a couple of mixed messages. Some customers are indicating they are seeing signs of slowing down -- or slowing demand in certain consumer-driven market segments, primarily PCs and smartphones. Other market segments like high-performance computing and automotive are still seeing strong demand. 
Litho tool utilization in our customers is still at very high levels, while we're also seeing chip inventory levels trending towards pre-COVID levels. The demand for our systems still significantly exceeds supply this year, and we see no change to this demand picture. 
We are planning to ship a record number of systems, but we are faced with an increasing number of supply constraints, which, as it seems today, are likely to continue throughout the year. In an effort to recover from these delays, we're increasing the number of fast shipments to get systems to customers as quickly as possible.
And as a reminder, a fast shipment process skips some of the testing in our factory and final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer side. This leads to a deferral of revenue recognition for those shipments until formal customer acceptance but does provide our customers with early access to wafer output capacity. 
As far as shipments delays the revenue recognition to subsequent quarters, we are seeing more delayed revenue that will move into next year. 
The value of fast shipments in 2022 leading to revenue recognition in 2023 is expected to increase from around EUR 1 billion, as previously communicated, to about EUR 2.8 billion, an increase of EUR 1.8 billion. This then also leads to EUR 1.8 billion lower revenue recognition in 2022, and we therefore now expect year-on-year revenue growth of around 10%.
As a reminder, we began the year expecting a revenue growth of around 20% or approximately EUR 22.3 billion and EUR 1 billion value of fast shipments at the end of this year. We are now expecting a revenue growth of around 10%, which is approximately EUR 20.5 billion and EUR 2.8 billion value of fast shipments at the end of the year. 
So the total business value -- the total business volume for 2022 is essentially unchanged. 
For our EUV business, we still expect to ship 55 systems this year. As a result of the higher number of far shipments, we now expect recognized EUV revenue this year on 40 systems to be around EUR 6.4 billion, which is similar to the revenue last year. 
Compared to last quarter's view, the number of EUV fast shipments in 2022 that will now be recognized as revenue in 2023 has increased by 9 systems to a total of 15 systems, with a sales value of around EUR 2.4 billion.
In our DPV and application business, we still expect significant growth both in immersion and dry systems as well as continued strong demand for metrology and inspection systems. Due to a higher number of fast shipments on DPV systems, we now expect a revenue of around EUR 8.6 billion or an increase of over 15%. 
For the Installed Base Management business, service revenue will continue to scale with the growing installed base of systems. Customers will continue to look for upgrade opportunities to improve the performance of systems in their fabs that will be limited by high utilization levels, which will dictate their ability to install upgrades. We still expect 2022 Installed Base revenue to grow around 10% year-on-year. 
Regarding the market segments, there has been no change in customer demand as the majority of the additional EUR 1.8 billion of delayed revenue was with EUV, and therefore, it relates to our Logic segments. We now expect Logic system revenue to be up around 5% year-on-year and Memory system revenue to be up around 20% year-over-year. 
On gross margin, we started the year with an expectation of a gross margin for 2022 of around 53%, and we adjusted this to 52% last quarter due to increased inflationary costs. There are a few developments that have a further impact on our expected gross margin for the year. 
First, the higher delayed revenue, an increase of EUR 1.8 billion, relates to our higher-margin EUV and emerging systems. Secondly, the supply chain issues, we do delayed system starts, and therefore, we will have lower fixed cost coverage on a lower number of system starts this year compared to what we had planned last quarter. 
Fixed cost also increased due to our plans to ramp capacity faster in preparation for what still seems to be a good growth year in 2023. And finally, strong inflationary effects related to material cost of freight and labor continue to impact our cost of sales.
Combination of these effects resulted in an expected '22 gross margin between 49% and 50%. We're currently in discussion with our customers and suppliers to find a fair way to share in these inflationary cost increases. 
It is important to emphasize that the reasons for the lower margin guidance are a result of short-term shocks in our ecosystem and can be adjusted over time in collaboration with our ecosystem partners. Therefore, our longer-term gross margin ambition of 54% to 56% in 2025, as communicated during Investor Day last year, is still [ valid ]. 
Longer term, if we look at the secular drivers, the global megatrends driving our industry are still in place at fueling demand for both advanced and mature nodes. 
Expanding application space for semiconductors and secular trends are driving long-term structural demand. Growth in the automotive market is very strong as semiconductor content scales with increasing automation and electrification. 
Customers are also indicating increasing demand for semiconductors as part of the green energy transition and the build-out of the smart grid. 
The demand for more mature technology nodes is furthermore driven by Internet of Things, fueling the demand for sensors, power ICs and actuators. Customers are seeing very strong growth due to demand from high-performance computing applications. 
As applications require higher performance and lower power, we see the energy-efficient path to transistor growth driving the need for larger die sizes. Finally, there are a number of fabs being planned or are already in progress, driven primarily by technological sovereignty investments and subsidy schemes next to increased foundry competition. 
Growth in semiconductor end markets and increasing lithography intensity are pushing the demand for our products and services. This is evident in our quarterly order flow of over EUR 6 billion for the past 5 quarters and a record order intake of EUR 8.5 billion this past quarter. 
Our backlog has grown to over EUR 33 billion, and we expect continued high order intake this quarter. Almost 85% of this backlog is for EUV and immersion, which is planned for advanced nodes. The [ market outlook ] this year and next continues to exceed supply.
There is a clear concern in the market regarding recessionary fears and the impact this could have on the map. Of course, if we were to go into a significant recession, we would not be immune to this, but we don't expect our '22 business to be impacted. And also for 2023, given our backlog, we believe we are well covered.
[ Investors ] keep stressing that we will not cut CapEx for litho despite current market conditions and uncertainties. 
So assuming that we have the supply chain issues addressed by the end of the year or early next year, we're still positive that we should be able to turn the envisaged capacity for 2023 of more than 60 EUV systems and more than 375 DPV systems into another healthy growth year for ASML.
And as mentioned in April, we're actively engaging with our supply chain to add capacity so that we will be able to have the shipment capacity in 2025 of around 90 EUV 0.33 NA systems and around 600 DPV systems. 
We're also discussing with our supply chain partners to secure a shipment capacity of around 20 EUV 0.55 High-NA systems in the medium term. Our 2025 capacity targets as well as updates to our longer-term scenarios will be addressed at our Investor Day later this year.
So in summary, although we are currently experiencing obvious supply chain challenges, we're still working to maximize output to meet the strong customer demand for [ Mesa ] fast shipments. We still expect demand to exceed supply this year and next. 
And even though there are currently clear macroeconomic concerns, we expect strong continued demand for semiconductors in support of the ongoing digital transformation. We're working to increase our capacity next year with a plan to further increase this by 2025, as communicated last quarter. 
We remain confident in the opportunity this provides for our future growth, which we plan to update you during our Investor Day on November 11. I really hope to see you there.

I think the delays in delivery times, we're trying to -- we're not trying, we're actually doing. We are helping our customers with the fast shipments, which actually means that if you look at our production value, so the value of the system coming out of our factory with and without fast shipments, that's actually, as I said, not as fast as we planned, but it's definitely growing. It is ramping.
So the delay in the delivery time is really a delay in the revenue recognition. I mean we are delivering. This is why we include -- this is why we go to fast shipments. So -- and as we can point out and just looking at our production value coming out of the factory, the second half is higher than the first half. 
And this is also exactly why we are still working on getting a production capacity in our factory that helps us to ship over 60 EUV systems next year and over 375 DPV systems because as you pointed out, the backlog is there. And the customers say, ""Whatever you do, please ship those systems,"" because we are under shipment -- we are undershipping the demand.
So we are shipping. It's unfortunately not as fast as we would like to. So our output ramp coming out of the factory could have been higher. That's because of the supply chain constraints that we currently see. 
But we are executing according to the backlog and according to plan and according to customer demand. And that's where we are today. And then this issue of revenue recognition delay, but that is an accounting thing.",275,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I could take it. Mehdi, the fast shipment -- of course, at some stage, you would expect that the effect of fast shipment is somehow going to reverse itself. And there are multiple ways how fast shipments can reverse itself. 
One way how it could reverse itself is that we simply start to slow down fast shipments and are going back to the way we've done it before. And in that way, you would then indeed get revenue -- get more revenue recognition out of the previous quarter than what you push into the next quarter. So that's one way.
Another way, quite frankly, is if indeed, at a certain point in time, fast shipment becomes the standard and it turns out that the installation at the customer, frankly, we're currently experiencing, is not experiencing any issues. 
And that's what we're seeing right now. Right now, we see that by -- even though there is a number of tests that we're not doing at the factory, we see that we're not exporting problems into the field. 
So to the extent that, that has corroborated, in essence, that means that those tests that we used to do in the factory do not have a lot of value or might not have any value at all.
So when it then becomes the standard, then we're also going to turn to the question, might we actually then get factory acceptance even with a few of these tests eliminated. And as a result of that, we could go back to the model of having revenue recognition upon shipment rather than upon installation.
Of course, we need to have a fact pattern to back that up, right? So there's still work to be done there. So those are two potential outcomes. Because at a certain stage, I think it is logical that you would expect some of these fast shipments effectively reversed and as a result of that, to get benefit from previous quarters rather than see it go into the next quarter. 
Timing is difficult to project, when exactly that is and when you might see the reversal. But it's not lost, right? And anything that we push out of the year at some point, we'll be able to deliver.",377,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And then a follow-up question for both Peter and Roger. I'm just trying to understand how you're planning. And in case there is more risk, how are you planning to mitigate the risk? [ Two ], you highlighted the weaker end-market demand from PCs and smartphones. That effectively accounts for half of the semiconductor industry. 
You talked about -- your customers' customer have inventories that are at all-time high. And there are uncertain factors. Yes, hyperscalers are doing well, but that was expected to be seasonally strong in the second half. 
So as I look into the first half of next year, given on [ nonfactor ], what is ASML thinking or doing to mitigate the downside risk if, in fact, there is some pushout in the equivalent delivery scheduled for the first half of [ '23 ]?",139,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,20,"Well, what we are doing, if that would happen, which we don't think is going to happen, I'll explain you later why, then we -- as you know from our cost of goods, 80% to 85% of our cost of goods is in the supply chain. 
So actually, it means that we would have to spread that pressure like we did in any other downcycle in the past. We will spread that in a now larger supply chain. So what? So we will just adjust our output. That's what we normally would do.
And the reason why I think 2023 is still going to be good and is going to be a growth year is -- and you refer to EUV, has to do with the fact that when we look at the EUV shipments, so where are we shipping to? Till the end of next year, we will ship to 8 new EUV fabs, 8, yes, which are largely, you could say, fabs on an average at least 40,000 per month capacity. 
Those fabs needs [ are -- is ] way over 300,000 wafer starts per month capacity that's being built, that actually needs EUV tools. And not only EUV tools, they need immersion tools and they need dry tools, yes? And those are all fabs which are in the advanced nodes, which are the leading-edge fabs for our customers.
And yes, there may be a slowdown, but the innovation won't stop. And I'm pretty sure that our customers, if you ask all of them -- just refer to TSMC's comments a couple of days ago. They have a strong belief in the digital transformation.
So any short-term shocks in the demand cycle -- and you have to compare with the long-term view that our customers have on the whole digital transformation, and that's why they are building fabs. 8 EUV fabs till the end of next year need tools, and they need immersion and they need dry. And so this is why we have a big backlog.
So you have to -- clearly, customers are going to adjust some of their CapEx and are going to make choices when there is a recessionary environment or when there's a slowdown in the demand. 
But a longer-term view, yes -- or what is needed, going forward, bearing in mind that they're dealing with a supplier which has, by far, the longest lead time, which has, to be honest, traumatized them over the last 2 years with respect to their capacity, yes, they come to take tools.

So I think the likelihood, particularly in combination with the points that Peter made, I think, is low.
And yes, the way we are organized, we have quite a bit of flexibility. We're still hiring many, many people. We have flexibility in our supply chain. We have a strong balance sheet.

Having said that, there's a lot of talk -- and I said it in my introductory comments. There's a lot of talk about recessionary fears. And nobody can really give a good insight or foresight into how deep a recession would be.

Now since last quarter, we experienced a slowdown that you flagged as well and especially maybe on the Memory side, which is a bit more aggressive since last quarter. 
So in light of this change and maybe that the Memory represents a meaningful part of deep UV revenues, do you still expect to reach 375 tools next year?",97,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

I think -- like I said also in my introductory comments, we don't see -- yes, we are not -- of course, not there. So we listen and we also read what customers have actually said and -- especially to specific Memory customers that listen, we see a slowdown, especially in the consumer segment, on PCs and on smartphones. 
But they hasten to pick up the phone and said one thing, ""I don't think you can give our machines to other people because of this. We want those machines."" for the reasons I just gave as an answer to the question that Mehdi just asked a few minutes ago.
So yes, I mean we see it, we hear it, but we also listen to what customers say. And they said, ""We have these strategic investment projects, and we need those machines."" And whether they're are Memory customers in Korea or in the U.S. or in China, for that matter, they want those machines because they still aren't getting what they planned.
Now could that demand go down? Yes, it could go down. But there's still a significant gap, as you pointed out, between what we can make and what they ask from us. 
Now -- and that can come down, but before it hits that 375 and before it hits the real strategic investment that we are doing in all these fabs, we need to have a real slowdown. And that's anybody's guess at this moment in time.",249,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So in fact, we don't have any formal agreement in contracts that would allow us to just jack up the price.
However, we are in discussions with customers and already, we have some indications that customer, ""Yes, we understand your predicaments and your issues."" So we're in discussion with those customers and then to see what's fair. 
But clearly, for everything that's [ nondeal ], going forward, that's clear that we will adjust our pricing to just cover the inflationary pressures wherever they will go. I think that's also clear.

And of course, to the extent that you catch up on that, of course, you get a bit more fixed cost coverage on that. So that is true. 
That's -- on an EUV system, that's a couple of million that you're looking at EUR 4 million or EUR 5 million approximately of the amount there for a system that you look at in terms of the fixed cost coverage. So that is part of it.
Of course, it goes back to an earlier question that we had, which is at what [ stage ] do you expect that the effect of fast shipment is going to reverse itself, right?

The clarification would be, when I listen to your comments, Roger, it seems to me that you imply that a couple of years out, we'll either see the delayed revenue recognition going away naturally as you no longer have to fast ship or you think that there will be a change in revenue recognition so that, that final tests will no longer be required because it is proven largely as redundant.

And as it becomes standard practice, then I think we've also been able to persuade customers that this works and that we're not exporting problems from the factory into the field. 
And then I think we should be in a position to also get customer sign-off when the tests are done here in the factory. And then we should also be able to get revenue recognition there.
Or we determine that we're no longer going to do fast shipments and that we're going to go back to what we did before. I think it's pretty likely that it will be either one of those two outcomes. And therefore, I think, at a certain point in time, you will see the fast shipment reverse itself. 
To be honest, I don't hope that that's going to last another 3 years because the communication with you guys will be significantly enhanced if we no longer have to go through all the adjustments around fast shipment.

That's the only goal. 
And the only reason why customers say, ""Ship me the tool."" is because we now have evidence, because we're doing this for 9 months now, that, as Roger said earlier, the installation time between a fast shipment and a non-fast shipment is exactly the same. 
So what we've effectively done, we have reduced the cycle time from the start of the system to the installation at the customer side with about a month.
Well, if this is something that we can make standard practice and perhaps we need another year or so or a couple of quarters to come to the conclusion that, that is the predictable outcome. Then we could also go to the customers and say, ""Hey, then we should act -- basically change the acceptance term in our factory by just doing less test."" And I think we're just building the approved data, but that would effectively mean a reduction of cycle time, and that's to the benefit of both ASML and the customer.

So that's around the EUR 160 million that we say, that we advise you to take. 
As you know, last quarter, we had a very limited number of tools that we had in revenue recognition. And there was a one-off effect, which drove up the ASP very, very high, but that was a one-off effect that we explained in the first quarter.

Can you run us through the drivers of that uptake in demand? How much of that is driven by effectively lagging edge capacity, capital intensively going up? 
So we see the like of Texas Instruments and others talking about capital intensity that is more than double their historical levels, in part because they can no longer buy bankrupt DRAM fabs for $0.10 on a dollar, in part because I suspect there is no or limited secondhand equipment available on the market.

Wennink,,Executives,42,"I wish I had something like a time warp machine bringing us to November 11 of this year because it's exactly what we're going to talk about. So -- but -- so I won't give you the data because we're working on the data -- actually we have some data here that we are actually looking at our -- using in our own models. 
But I think, generally, deep UV, what we've significantly underestimated is the demand for DPV-type nodes, whether it's 28-nanometer, 45, 65, 90, 0.18 micron, and the application space it's being used for. We actually have evidence that the number of products that our foundry customers are running on these nodes is significantly higher than 2 or 3 years ago. 
So the number of products and is driven by the need for -- and that's data, yes, which I'm not going to share with you, and we need to find a way how we want to show that to you on November 11.
But the fact of the matter is that the number of products that are used in this 28-nanometer up to 0.18 micron even higher, yes, that a number of projects run are significantly higher over the last 2 or 3 years. And that's driven by the end markets. 
And we talked about this, and I gave you that in my introductory remarks, whether it's automotive or whether it's Internet of Things, whether it's anything in a company with sensors, power IC, non-optical sensors, microcontrollers. 
That space has grown significantly because the nodes that I just mentioned, that -- exactly the nodes that are working for those applications. And this is what we are seeing today. And that's not going down.
And yes, I think, as Mehdi said, we are at record-high inventories. Well, not for everything, yes, and especially in that space. Yes, everywhere, I think, we see, inventory is growing, but they're growing at a moderate pace. So that's what we are seeing. And that's also where the demand from our customers come. It's anecdotal. 
But as a Chinese customer says, ""I want to build a 12-inch [ pattern ],"" won't do their planning. And they are going to do it at 12-inch wafer fab for 90-nanometer products. I said, ""What are you going to use it for?, ""Well, it's for automotive, yes? And it's for the energy transition, yes?"" And that's a 12-inch fab. And that's 90, 9 and 0.
And we cannot get those tools out in the market because you are right. I mean the -- all DRAM fabs are not for sale anymore. Everything that we used to do to take systems out of the Memory fabs, and we use them in Logic and the IDM fabs. Those systems are not there anymore. They're all gone. So you'll have to buy new. 
These are all the trends that we will discuss in more detail at November 11. But for us, the trend is also clear. There are many, many more applications and products coming out of these nodes used for these applications, which are not leading-edge, yes, but which are basically everywhere.

Wennink,,Executives,45,"Well, let me answer the China growth question. I think we said it last quarter. I think China grows with the same percentage as the rest of the world. And we grow -- or let's say, we grow 10%, which means, yes, all in all, every geographical ship to region grows with 10%, which includes China. They grow at 10%, just like rest of the world.
I think on the U.S. banning, there are a lot of speculations that are also on media coverage on this, which I know we said, is not new. I mean it's been on the table from time to time. It pops up and which is just a political position. We just have to wait what the politicians come up with. 
But having said that, I think we need to realize that China is an important player in the semiconductor industry and especially in the more, let's say, not mature nodes but in the more mainstream semiconductors. 
It's everything that has to do with deep UV, yes? And it ranges from 20 nanometer up to 28, 45, 65. It's immersion, it is dry. And they're a very significant supplier of the global markets.

And this goes to the earlier point that Peter made. I mean, indeed, we do find out that we can omit a number of testing steps in the factory that ultimately do not, in any way, lead to the erosion of the quality of the product that we ship and therefore, doesn't lead to any problem upon installation. 
We might actually like it so much because it gives us more [ capital time ], gives us more capacity. So that's why it's hard to answer that hypothetical question.

I think when you -- and I said it before, we don't have any formal agreement that could give us the, let's say, the supplier power to just have raised supplies to any level that we want. That's not the case. And you also need to look at the 150 basis points that we talked about this year, which really relates to short-term shocks and -- of which for instance, freight is a significant one. 
Freight cost, that got quick dip. What I mean is it's just gone through the roof, which, of course, we're in being close negotiation with the customer. ""Hey, why don't you pick up the cost because it's the cost for -- we -- it's normally in the contract."" 
But this is something which is so extraordinary, where, say, ""This does not make sense,"" which would be a relatively short-term fix, yes?
Now there's another main reason for the 150 basis points is labor, especially in the service space. When you go to Asia and you go to Korea and to Taiwan, we've seen labor cost inflation of up to 20% this year. 
And it's not planned. It's just 20 [ exempt ] because we are losing people hand over fist if we don't do it. So these are the short-term shocks that, of course, will also be corrected, yes, in the service contracts.
So having said that, those are really the short-term inflation shocks and the short-term fixes that I think we can get through with our customers. The bigger things are, of course, inflation for the longer term. And that largely is material because the material for our EUV systems has already been sourced. It's [ over a year ]. 
So it's the inflationary pressure that we might see next year. So this is why the negotiations with the customers are about next year and the year beyond.
So this is where I think it has to come to a fairness where we are looking at the unavoidable pressures above what I would call as a normal inflation percentage of 2%, 3% that we always take into consideration. 
Anything above that, we just have to get compensated with our customers. And we're right in the middle of the negotiations on this issue. So you have to really split between short-term effects, short-term fixes, longer-term effects, longer-term fixes.",394,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

So can you please discuss your thoughts around that as well as how you are kind of dealing with some of the gas and energy issues in Germany? Any implications to your key supplier, Carl Zeiss?",69,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

I think the supply chain headwind -- I mean it is an assumption, and the assumption is based on the fact when we look at the material escalations that are really delaying the output, we saw a peak, I think, at last month, but it's coming down a bit. 
And we're just trying to extrapolate that trend, which, of course, is dangerous because it's just -- you just look at the graph. And then if we follow that trend, then there could be a possibility by the end of the year, early next year, there could be a situation where we are more in control of those supply constraints.
Having said that, there are still guarantees because if you look at the supply chain, it comes down to the first-tier suppliers. 
But if you really look through it, they -- often the issue is not in the first-tier supplier but in the second, the third and fourth tier, even further because of the base materials, yes? And that transparency is limited. 
We're pretty transparent, I think, in the first and the second tier. But beyond that, it becomes more difficult.
So we're just following the trend. And it's a [ question ] of trends extrapolation that we're doing that might give us, end of the year, beginning of next year, some more relief. But like I said, it's based on limited transparency that we currently have.
Now on the energy situation in Germany and especially on Carl Zeiss. I mean, of course, we are taking measures and have taken measures. I think the dependence of Carl Zeiss on gas is going to be limited. I mean they're switching to oil. They are not a big gas user either. 
But what is true in -- for the transparency, what I mentioned on our own supply chain is also probably true for the energy supply chain. How transparent is our insight into potential energy risk or gas risk in Germany? We don't know. I mean it could be far down in the third- or fourth- or fifth-layer suppliers.
Having said that, I think government and also companies are on top of this issue. And there will be gas, whether gas comes from different sources, it is a matter of price, which is going to be an inflation issue. 
But I think every supplier that we know of and that we have some insight into how it's working on securing their energy resource. And also, here some of our suppliers are actually claiming a very strategic status in getting preference.
So overall, work in process. I think we don't have the full transparency yet to give you a definite answer. But I think I'm more confident than I was a couple of months ago that our suppliers are doing the right thing.",470,3.0,8.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8

Wennink,,Executives,61,"So basically weakness that our customers are talking about and to build capacity. It also goes back to what I said earlier. I mean, yes, EUV plays a significant role. The EUV transition in Memory, especially, is happening, and it's essential. 
When we talk about 8 new EUV fabs, some of them are Memory fabs, which is an essential part of the [ ROP ] transition. And EUV is critical, in that sense.
Well, building these big EUR 15 billion-plus fabs, you need to fill those fabs with the latest and greatest technology, which is EUV -- is EUV-driven. But of course, you cannot make this device without immersion and without dry DPV. So -- and this is what our customers also told us. 
Yes, they are acknowledging the weakness. Yes, they are concerned about the inventories that are going up, but they're not backing off, which they didn't do in the past either. They're not backing off of their innovation roadmaps, which are essential for their future competitiveness, yes?
So this is why they say, they pick up the phone and if they tell us, ""Listen, we talk about weakness, but don't you guys dare to just change your shipment pattern to us?"" So this is what I'm holding on to. That is why we have this big order back -- this order backlog, and we know where to ship to. 
So yes, of course, there is a longer-term correlation between structural longer-term weakness and our -- or the ability of ASML to ship to those customers. But shorter term and longer term are currently two different things, yes?",270,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,1,"Absolutely. Net sales came in at EUR 5.8 billion, which was above guidance included in that EUR 5.8 billion number, EUR 1.5 billion of installed base revenue. 
Why was it higher than guided? A number of reasons. First off, the installation time in the field is -- actually, it's faster than we anticipated, and that means that we get revenue faster as a result of that. So that was one big reason. 
Secondly, we already mentioned the installed base business. So that was more than we anticipated because of some field upgrades. 
And thirdly, we put -- also in the past quarters, we put options at factory -- a specific factory option on the machines. And that factory option led to delayed revenue because, first, the factory option needed to demonstrate its value to the customers. A number of key customers have now accepted that value, and as a result of that, the deferred revenue that we booked in previous quarters has now been released. So it's in that combination really that the revenue was higher than we guided. 
Also from a gross margin perspective, higher than we anticipated, 51.8%, primarily driven by, I would say, the last 2 things that I've just mentioned. So the deferred revenue release of the factory option and also the fact that we were into -- able to pull in some installed base business. Also, the factory option was a pull-in, right, because that meant that the value was actually demonstrated earlier than we originally anticipated. 
So those are the main reasons why both the revenue and gross margin are higher than guided last quarter. 
The net income for the quarter came in at EUR 1.7 billion. And also very noteworthy, I think, is the net BOs -- net bookings came in at a record EUR 8.9 billion for this quarter. Included in there, EUR 3.8 billion for EUV, including a number of High-NA orders. 
So all in all, I would say, a strong quarter both in terms of revenue, in terms of gross margin and also in terms of order intake.",348,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,5,"Yes, I think it's good in that context, just to look at the facts. And I think one factor is just to look at if you adjust the quarter revenue for the fast ship effect, I think that gives you -- if you normalize that, then I think you get a good proxy for what the -- how the output capacity for ASML and its supply chain really has developed itself. And if you take that perspective, so you normalize the revenue for the fast ship effect, and you would see that for Q1, we were at EUR 4.9 billion in normalized revenue. In Q2, we were at EUR 5.7 billion. In Q3, the quarter we just completed, at EUR 6 billion. And at the midpoint that we're now guiding for Q4, we would be around EUR 6.4 billion. So there you see a gradual uptick of the normalized revenue, again, as a good proxy of the output capability that ASML and its supply chain demonstrate. 
And I think that's a good indication and a good evidence, I think, of the fact that we are getting a better handle on the supply chain situation. And the better handle means that we actually see the move rates in the supply chain go up and we also see the predictability of those move rates going up. So we put a lot of effort into this, working very closely with the supply chain and particularly with those suppliers that were struggling a little bit. But I think all in all, I think the situation is definitely progressing. I think the capacity that we now see, both for ourselves and also the supply chain, I think, position us very nicely for what we've communicated before as the output target and the shipment targets that we would have for next year, which is more than 60 EUV tools and more than 375 DUV.",318,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,7,"So we definitely looked into that. We looked into that for our own operations. We're a very mild consumer of natural gas. So for us, we've established that the risk profile is very low. We also looked at our Tier 1 suppliers -- our key Tier 1 suppliers. And also there, we have determined that either it's -- the risk is low or they are very well prepared to deal with the situation and have developed alternatives. We looked beyond that point, and we really looked into a number of subsuppliers and if there are subsuppliers that are confronted with a high-risk situation around this. In those instances, we're working very hard with them to look at -- to work on the alternatives and just make sure that everyone is very well prepared. So clearly something we're looking into, but I think we're making really good progress on making sure that the entire supply chain is well prepared for that -- for any eventualities in that regard.",167,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Dassen,,Executives,9,"Yes, it's a very valid point. I mean it's very clear that the world is changing very rapidly, and this combination of inflation on the one hand and also consumer confidence taking ahead, it's -- these are serious developments and create a lot of uncertainty and uncertainty that is really at a very different level -- I would say, at the macro uncertainty, I think, is at a very different level than it was even a couple of months or quarters ago. So that's clearly the case. 
And of course, in such a climate of uncertainty of consumers, inflation risks, recession risks clearly there, I think that obviously also has an impact on our customers. And you see some customers actually running our tools at a utilization level which is below the record levels that we've seen before. We also see a number of our customers reducing the CapEx that they are forecasting. And we also see now for the first time since quite a while that actually some customers are actually delaying the preferred time that they would like to get our tools. So we see those dynamics. 
But I have to say the lion's share of our customers really keeps on pushing us in terms of getting the tools and getting them sooner rather than later. So there's a few customers that are indicating a preference for some delay, but the lion's share of the customers are really pushing, and they're raising their hand to say if there is a delay someplace else, then please get the tools to us even earlier. 
And I think that's also evidenced by the strength of the order book. Again, we just mentioned record order intake of EUR 8.9 billion. That gets to an order book at the end of Q3 of over EUR 38 billion, which is a number that we've never seen before at ASML. And in there, 85% of that order book really is for EUV and for immersion, so really caters to the more advanced and strategic part of semiconductor manufacturing. 
And I think that's really also what's going on. I think, clearly, the secular trends, as we always call them, are very much intact. I mean customers really want to make those technology transitions. They really are building capacity also beyond 2023. And also, there is still this element of tech sovereignty that we've been talking about, right, the fact that governments want to be more self-sufficient in their semiconductor manufacturing. So those secular trends are still very much intact. And I think that creates a situation that we're seeing, where the lion's share of the customers are really still pushing us to get the tools sooner rather than later. 
So your question on '23, obviously, it's a bit early to be too granular and too specific. But we mentioned before the over 60 EUV tools, the more than 375 DUV tools. And I would say if indeed we're able to sustain the good momentum that we just talked about in the supply chain and provided we're not going to be confronted with some very unexpected developments on the demand side, I think that's still a good indication for what we're looking at in terms of shipment. So clearly, uncertainty at a very different level than what we've seen before. But I think we still have some very strong dynamics going in favor of us.",568,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And that's also something that we're working on as ASML, so to make sure that both on the supply chain as it relates to our own manufacturing capability and also in our workforce that we have sufficient flexibility available, both flexibility that in terms of an unanticipated sudden decline in demand that we're able to collectively respond to that in the right fashion but also making sure that we're also -- when things start to pick up again, that we're able to respond to that in a very flexible way as well. 
So that's what we're doing. I think it's part and parcel of the capacity expansion that we're doing to do that and to execute that in a flexible way. Anything in that way, we do whatever it takes to be well prepared for any eventualities in that regard.",150,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,13,"So I mean we talked about it last time. Obviously, the inflationary effects are there, both on labor cost, on freight, on parts. So that's clearly going on. We also mentioned we're having good discussions with our customers on that front to kind of share the burden within the ecosystem. And I think generally, there is a good depreciation of customers that they understand what we're being confronted with. And there's also a good appreciation that there needs to be a mechanism to indeed share that burden. So I would expect to get a benefit from that in the course of -- in 2023 and to start seeing that compensation. 
In terms of the impact that it will have on 2023, so we should get some positive impact on the gross margin from that element. Also for '23, I would expect to recover, if you like, from the gross margin impact from the fast shipments. Of course, the gross margin of this year was impacted by the fact that we had these fast shipments. That impact should be significantly less in 2023 from a gross margin perspective. So those, I would say, would be benefits. 
I mean the flip side of that is, clearly, inflation might continue. So there is still quite some uncertainty around the level of inflation. So it's also very hard to predict what exactly the inflation rate for next year is going to be. And also, we should bear in mind, we continue to ramp. We continue to build capacity. And obviously, that means that you're having costs ahead of really utilizing that capacity, and that will continue to have a burden on the gross margin for next year. 
So if you add it all up, I think all in all, as I mentioned, we have the gross margin approaching 50% in this year. That's what we expect. You also know that we indicated -- for 2025, we articulated an expectation of a gross margin between 54% and 56%. And I think we should also, next year, see the gradual development from the gross margin of this year towards that objective of 54% to 56% that we articulated before. We should see that gradual progress actually happening.",371,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So as I just mentioned, I think the secular trends are there, right? So clearly, there is uncertainty in the short term, but the secular trends are there for all the good reasons that we just mentioned. 
So from that vantage point, clearly, we believe expanding our capacity is the right thing to do. And we are in very close collaboration with our supply chain to get that done. We recently had a Supplier Day here at ASML to really talk with the suppliers about these expansion plans, about the progress that they're making, also making sure that people learn from one another. So there's a lot of positive dynamic around that theme and a lot of alignment within the supply chain to really get to those levels that we mentioned before, which is 90 EUV systems, 600 DUV systems around the '25 time frame and then, medium term, 20 High-NA systems.",153,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,17,"So I would say the direct impact on ASML is fairly limited. I should say, of course, we're still in the process of evaluating it. It's a very extensive document, as you know. So we're still in the process of really digesting it and looking at it. But our initial appreciation is that the direct implication for us is fairly limited. 
So why is that? Well, first off, as you know, we are a -- we're a European company, right? So there is not a lot of U.S. technology in our tools. So that's the first reason. Of course, we will always adhere to the rule of law, right? So also the U.S. export laws as they pertain to us, of course, we will do whatever it takes to follow those. There's no doubt about it. But the fact that we are a European company with limited U.S. technology in it, of course, it creates this situation where the direct impact on us is fairly limited. We can continue to ship non-EUV lithography tools out of Europe into China. 
So the direct impact on us, I would say, is fairly limited. Of course, there could be indirect effects. And those indirect effects could be that the Chinese manufacturers, to the extent that they do not get other equipment that they need in their fabs, for instance, from the United States, of course, there could be an indirect effect on the demand for our tools. But there, I would say it's important to recognize that we're clearly still in a situation where the supply is below what the demand is. So to the extent that at a certain point in time, we would be in a position that we can no longer supply certain tools to certain customers in China. The demand outside of China is still such that we would get compensation for that in the current environment from other customers.",321,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So I would say, in principle, nothing changes, right? So as you all know, the primary utilization of cash is, within the business, to make sure that from an R&D perspective, CapEx perspective, the cash that is needed to pursue our road map is there. So that's still the primary purpose. 
Then we've also said we're looking at a dividend that we want to grow over time. And the proposal for next quarter, so for Q4, we will have an interim dividend of EUR 1.37. 
And you also know that what is available above that, so what is available in terms of cash over and above what we need for the business to pursue our road map and what is needed for this growing dividend will be returned to shareholders by means of a share buyback -- by share buybacks. The share buyback program -- the existing share buyback program, we just completed. So quite well ahead of time. 
We will have -- as you know, we will have our Capital Markets Day on November 11. There, of course, we're going to talk about how we see the 2025 and the 2030 scenarios developing. So how do we see demand developing, the supply situation? So what's our expectation also financially for those years 2025 and 2030. We're also -- in that Capital Markets Day, we'll talk about our plans for a new share buyback program. So there, we will have a concrete program available and ready to discuss and present to the shareholders. 
So I'm very much looking forward to that. It's going to be an interesting day, November 11, where -- amidst the uncertainty that we also talked about, to talk about the medium and the longer term and the really good prospects that we continue to see for ASML and its business.

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the third quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the fourth quarter of 2022. Net sales came in at EUR 5.8 billion, above our guidance due to faster completion of installations triggering earlier revenue recognition, a release of deferred income on a factory option which has now been accepted at customer sites as well as higher installed base business. We shipped 13 EUV systems and recognized EUR 2.2 billion revenue from 12 systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 4.3 billion, which was again driven by Logic at 68% and the remaining 32% from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.5 billion, above guidance due to higher upgrade revenue.  
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.8%, which is above our guidance, primarily due to the pull-in of revenue from both the release of deferred income on a factory option as well as additional upgrade business. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 819 million and SG&A expenses of EUR 236 million, as guided.  
Net income in Q3 was EUR 1.7 billion, representing 29.4% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.29.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.4 billion.  
Moving to the order book. Q3 net systems bookings came in at a record EUR 8.9 billion, reflecting the continued strong customer demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Strong order intake of EUR 3.8 billion for EUV systems, including NA as well as EUR 5.1 billion for non-EUV systems, which is DTV and metrology and inspection system. Total net systems bookings was driven by Logic with 77% of the bookings and memory accounting for the remaining 23%.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of '22. We expect Q4 total net sales to be between EUR 6.1 billion and EUR 6.6 billion. This excludes around EUR 100 million of net delay revenue for Q4 as a result of more expected fast shipments at the end of Q4 and at the end of Q3. We expect our Q4 installed base management sales to be around EUR 1.6 billion. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be around 49%. The improved margin effect of higher volume relative to Q3 is more than offset by negative margin effects primarily from DTV mix pulling of revenue recognition on higher-margin factory options from Q4 into Q3, and inflation costs hitting us this quarter. This translates to an expected gross margin approaching 50% for the full year.  
The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around EUR 880 million and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 265 million. The higher R&D guidance is primarily due to additional headcount and labor cost increases. Higher SG&A is mainly due to additional headcount and IT spending. There are also some small negative foreign exchange effects on both R&D and SG&A. Our estimated 2022 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be around 15%.  
In Q3, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of EUR 1.37 per ordinary share. The second quarterly interim dividend will be EUR 1.37 per ordinary share and will be made payable on November 14, 2022.  
In Q3 2022, we repurchased around 2.1 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 1 billion. We have now completed our 2021-2023 share buyback program. On November 11, 2022, we will hold our Investor Day where we will provide an update on our long-term business plan, including a new share buyback program.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",623,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, revenue and profitability for the quarter came in above guidance. We expect sales in the fourth quarter to be higher as we continue to work through supply chain issues and reduce cycle times. Relative to last quarter, we now expect stronger revenue growth for the year with a full year 2022 sales of EUR 21.1 billion that are using the midpoint of the Q4 guidance. This includes a higher EUV system revenue of around EUR 6.8 billion as well as higher rates of base revenue. And due to fast shipments, we also expect delayed revenue of around EUR 2.2 billion into 2023. 
The total business volume for 2022 is basically unchanged from the start of the year.  
Looking at the current market environment, there's clearly a lot of uncertainty due to a number of global macro concerns regarding inflation, consumer confidence and real chance of a recession. As we have shown in the past, in such an environment, we need to maintain flexibility in our supply chain, in our workforce and in our manufacturing capability. You would also expect an impact on customer confidence around their CapEx spending. And in fact, we do see some customers running at lower tool utilization levels and revising their CapEx plans for next year.  
Now while some customers are now adjusting the desired timing of their demand, the vast majority of our customers is still requesting shipments of the litho systems as soon as possible. This is clearly driven by the strategic nature of these little investments in support of technology transitions, capacity additions, which require time for wafer output to materialize as well as government's global investments in pursuit of technology sovereignty. And as a matter of fact, our 2023 shipment demand is still significantly above our build and shipment capacity for next year. And this is supported by the record bookings this quarter of EUR 8.9 billion and our largest backlog ever of over EUR 38 billion. Almost 85% of this backlog is for EUV and immersion, which is used for advanced nodes and related wafer capacity expansions.  
With regard to our supply chain, we need to continue to manage risks. But over the past quarter, we see the predictability of the move rates in the supply chain improving. As a result, we now foresee a further improvement in our output capability in Q4. Looking at the net sales in the quarter, plus deferred revenue from fast shipments, you see increase in shipment value over the year, starting with EUR 4.9 billion in Q1 to EUR 5.7 billion in Q2, then EUR 6 billion in Q3, and we expect around EUR 6.4 billion in Q4. So building on this progress, we feel we are well positioned to further increase our capacity next year.  
Now looking to next year and bearing in mind the current environment, it's too early to provide specific guidance. With demand expected to remain significantly above supply and based on discussions with our customers, we're planning to increase our system output next year. So assuming we will have addressed the supply chain issues in the coming quarter, we're planning to ship over 60 EUV systems and over 375 [indiscernible] systems in 2023 with around 25% of the DPV systems being emerging.  
Regarding gross margin, as Roger mentioned, we expect to approach 50% this year. And as discussed last quarter, we are in discussions with customers to share the extraordinary inflationary costs from freight, labor as well as system components. These discussions are progressing. And in general, customers understand our request to share this extraordinary cost increase. And as such, we expect to receive a reasonable level of inflation compensation over the course of next year.  Assuming successful progress on this item based on current macroeconomic conditions and inflation levels and considering that next year, we will likely have less gross margin impact from fast shipments than in 2022. We expect gross margin to improve next year. We will continue to make the required investments as we need to ramp our capacity in anticipation of leading to long-term growth of our industry. And clearly, these investments might put some pressure on the gross margin next year, but are inevitable if we want to maintain the longer-term growth profile of the company.  
And that said, we do see a clear gradual progress from today towards our longer-term gross margin ambition of 54% to 56% by 2025. As I said before, longer term, expanding application space for semiconductor and secular trends are driving structural demand, and this is why we're actively adding capacity and are planning to further increase our EUV and DPV shipments in future years to meet customer demand. 
As announced earlier today, we have come over a way all to the Board of Management as our strategic sourcing and procurement officer underscores the significance of working with our supply chain to further drive future capacity growth. And regarding our capacity for 2025 and beyond, we're actively working with our supply chain to achieve the earlier communicated targets of 90 units for 0.33 of low NA EUV and 600 units for DPV along with a medium-term target of Brent units for 0.55 High-NA EUV. 
Next month, at our Investor Day on November 11, we will provide updates on how we see the changes in the end market growth, driving increased demand for our litho systems with -- what this means for our capacity plans as well as the impact on our longer-term financial scenarios for 2025 and 2030. 
Finally, with regards to the announcement earlier this month from the U.S. government around export control restrictions, we have performed our initial assessment and expect a direct impact on ASML's overall shipment plan for 2023 to be limited. However, there could be an indirect impact due to the inability of other equipment suppliers to shift their systems. Our current expectation of such an indirect impact will be around 5% of our backlog. This percentage is based on the share in our backlog of purchase orders from Chinese fabs that in our current assessment, are seen as meeting the technology criteria as indicated in the updated U.S. export control restrictions. We will continue to refine our assessments as the situation evolves. While ASML is, of course, fully committed to comply with all applicable regulations, the new regulations do not directly change U.S. export controls on the property equipment. 
As a European-based company with limited U.S. technology in our systems, ASML can continue to ship all non-EUV lithography shipments to China out of the Netherlands. Additionally, we can ship most U.S. origin spare parts to most customers in China that are working on mature nodes without the U.S. export license. The new export control rules are directed at advanced nodes. While our business in China is predominantly directed at mature nodes.
Lastly, if for export control related reasons, we cannot ship to more advanced fabs in China, we have more than sufficient demand for these systems elsewhere globally as demand continues to exceed supply. 
In summary, while in the current environment, there's a lot of uncertainty due to macro concerns, our customers' demand for our products continues to exceed supply. We're working to increase our capacity next year with a plan to further increase this by 2025. As communicated earlier this year, since we remain fully confident in the opportunity this provides for our future growth. We plan to update you all on this during our Investor Day on November 11, and we certainly hope to see you there. 
And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",1272,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Xavier, thank you. When you look at the backlog of EUR 38 billion, I mean, about 1/4 of this is Memory and about 75% is for our Logic customers. That backlog is based on what our customers are currently thinking about what they need in terms of lithography investments for their 2023 capacity additions, which you need to remember is not only -- mainstream capacity is also for advanced technology nodes. 
Now having said that, some of our customers and that would not exclude Memory customers that indeed look at their CapEx guidance for next year and have taken it down. But those same customers and the same breadth tell us, listen, we need those machines, and these are the machines that we need for 2023 because they are strategic, the long-term nature. And if you ship me in 2023, it will only be 2024 output, has to do with a long lead time and6 character of our systems. So these are strategic tools. And we've never -- and we've said it before, I think I said it over the last more than 20 years, must have been over 100 times, we never look at WFE as an indicator because it is a lagging indicator. Customers will do what they need to do. And what we really focus on is a discussion with our customers on their strategic road map and the strategic expansion of capacity. And that drives currently the order intake. So this is where we are. I fully understand that, that could mean that in a particular year because of these particular reasons, we are in quite a particular environment that the litho intensity numbers might spike up like if we're coming out of a downturn, that it will come down when we go into a upturn. These things are just relative percentages that yes, in any given year might be different. But we look at the long-term investment profile of our customers where we have very close contact. So this is what they tell us. And when they come with an order, we're in a business where we actually accept orders. So I think it is -- it could be for 2023, a bit of an anomaly, if you look at that life percentage. Indeed, at the end of 2023, it turned out that WFE came down as much as you currently think.",398,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And I do have a quick follow-up is on installed base management. I mean that has been a bit stronger. I mean, this quarter, you mentioned some upgrades.

But also, again, in the -- normally, what you see in an upturn is that, to your point, there is no available time to do upgrades. And in the downturn, there is available time. But then the upgrades that have to do with productivity enhancements of course, are not that needed, but others which basically have to do with the lithography requirements, the patterning requirements might be. So yes, that could be, but I think it's too early to tell right now. As you have probably seen over the last quarters and the last couple of years, the in-store base management business is a relatively short-term business. So customers can take those decisions on relatively short term, and we can actually implement those subjects also relatively short term. So we'll have to see.

On the demand side, we are more or less protected, you could say, because there's still such a big gap between the demand side and what we can make. So there's still a significant gap between our demand profile for 2023, which, as we said, really has come down somewhat. But it's all minor as compared to the gap that still exists between the current demand and our outlook capability. So I don't know about the demand profile for 2024.

So could you help us understand who is placing these orders? What are their considerations? Is this the case of demand being pulled forward?

That's a good question. I think you may remember that in our 2016 Capital Markets Day, and even I think in 2018, we anticipated that our deep UV shipments will go down as a result of the cannibalization of EUV. Actually, the opposite happened. It didn't go down. It grew significantly across our entire customer base. So it's a customer base that is focusing on consumer products because you're looking at the EUR 70 million that you just quoted is the historical order intake. It's consumer, it's industrial, it's automotive, it's energy transition, just the sheer application space has grown so much. And the problem that we have, unless you have that discussion with our supervisory board yesterday that nobody connected all the dots. There is not one firm on the planet that actually has the full insight into where all these chips are going and where they are being designed into. 
But what I do know is that the number of mask sets that are being run in Logic from, let's say, 20-nanometer upward to 28, 45, 65, 90, 0.13 micron, the number of mask sets over the last 12 years has been relatively stable running through our tools, except for the last 2 years. We see a significant increase in the number of mask sets, up to 30% to 40% being used in that technology category, which actually means that the number of applications that are using deep UV technology grow significantly double digit every year. And if you ask me, Peter, tell me exactly where it is, we don't know. The CEO of one of our largest customers said when I asked the question because you have a very significant market share, you should know. 
Yet I have no clue. And this captures nobody connected to all the dots. When you look at the facts, the facts are that it is in the deep UV space, and it's the application space. And if you ask me exactly where it goes, I have to also say, I'm not -- we don't have that full clarity. But what we do know is that the number of designs in the deep UV space above 20-nanometer is significantly increasing. And that's where it goes. And this is why we do see the order intake across a broad spectrum. 
Our customers that have not asked any significant CapEx for the last 10 years are in our order book now quite significantly as a group. And those are the ones that write me very mad letters that they still don't have their tools all time, as of 2 weeks ago, still get those letters. So I think that this is where blame on us, blame as the industry that we don't have that visibility, but we don't. But what we do know, there is a shortage and a significant increase in the number of designs.",483,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So the 25%, 75% in terms of memory versus Logic that we just talked about for the full backlog as I just mentioned, that's also what you would see in the composition of the non-EUV part of the backlog. So that's pretty consistent. So no huge inconsistency there as it being skewed towards one or the other. It's just the typical 25%, 75%. 
And in terms of China, China, and if you look at the last couple of years, China typically was around 16% to 18% of our system sales. And that's also about the percentage that you would see in the backlog. So there's no real anomaly in the backlog where we say how can that be. And I think that's to support the comment that Peter makes. This goes in many, many different directions.

And secondly, as a quick follow-up, finally, and it might be probably one for Roger. The net deferred revenue run rate in Q4 is down to just EUR 0.1 billion. Wouldn't it be logical to assume that as we look towards 2023, there should be no reason why this steps up again, but above EUR 0.1 billion? In other words, the EUR 2.2 billion that's getting deferred into 2023, would it be fair to assume a significantly smaller portion might go out from 2023 and potentially the 6.4% that you're doing in Q4 is a good basis for quarterly run rate as we look towards 2023?",111,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I think, Amit, clearly, the first quarter where the quarters were most of the fast shipment effect was there. That's clearly the case. And now indeed, you see that it starts to normalize and you already saw it in Q3, now you see it in Q4. And our expectation for Q4, you see that the normalization effect of fast shipments starts to trend down. And in essence, if you stabilize your output at a certain stage, you would expect that what you get into the quarter is also about what you see go out of the quarter. So that's the normalization at a certain point you will see. So -- you know that we're having discussions on -- is there another way to recognize revenue here. I mean we've been having those discussions. And we told you as soon as we have that and as soon as we see potential to start recognizing revenue, again, upon shipment, of course, we will let you know. So we're looking into that. But assuming that nothing is going to change, then in all likelihood, '23 should be more or less neutralized for the effect of a shipment.

Well, the bad thing about the great backlog is that you have science yield and deliver purchase orders with prices in there. So that means that you have to go back to the customer and listen there are extraordinary circumstances with inflation percentages in some regions of the world that are significant over double digit that that's such an extraordinary circumstance where you really need to sit together and say, ""Hey, what's fair.

I think the export control rules because of the relatively low percentage of U.S. content, the rules actually are such that because of that percentage, we can ship the lithography tools. So that's that is -- you could -- that's a predominantly European product. However, those tools need to be maintained so that there are spare parts that are at our U.S. Origin parts, and they fall under the export control rules. So for the spare parts, you need to apply export control rules and that's what we do. And that also is true for the people. So the people, U.S. citizen working on technology that is mentioned in the export control rules that's not allowed. So -- it's not so much the system shipments. It's the part chip, what those parts need when those systems need service.

Listen, like I said, the 5% is based on our assessment that our peer colleagues, our deposition and etch and metrology qualities will come to the same conclusion as we came. So that is the assumption. But they have to do their own assessment. So this is basically what we currently think. And I think if you just go back to what we said earlier, I mean, the -- our China sales is about between 15% and 20%, let's say, average, 17%, 18% of our sales. That's the same in the backlog. Now, so -- and then if the 5% of the backlog may be impacted based on our assessment of the advanced fabs, then you can -- yes, that's about the ratio. So -- and that is, of course, DPV because we cannot ship EUV and we will not ship EUV into China. So this is what you need to look at. So limited on installed base, it's the pipe in the late 17%, 18% that we mentioned earlier.

If you take that into consideration, you take that into consideration also that you will have a higher capacity of deep UV next year. I mean the revenue that you can generate if all that is going to be recognized next year much higher than where the consensus is looking for you for '23. So maybe you can help us understand the puts and takes. Did you mean that the EUR 2.2 billion that we enter '23 will still be remaining in the so-called pre-shipments or that need is pushing again into '24?

Dassen,,Executives,53,"Yes, Sandeep, it all very much depends on what's going to happen in terms of revenue recognition. But that's -- if you operate on the assumption that nothing is going to change in revenue recognition, i.e., also for 2023, we will continue to recognize revenue upon installation first and foremost, particularly then for EUV. The thing that's prudent to assume that the amount that you're going to get into 2023, you're also going to lose out of '23 into 2024. It's only at the point in time where we're going to recognize revenue again upon shipments. That's the point in time we're going to realize this additional value. So when we talk about the 60 -- over 60 and the over 375, that's really related to the output capacity that we see for next year. So that should then, in that circumstance, be translated into revenue. And then you would get EUR 2.2 billion in and you would get sort of a similar amount out. If the revenue recognition is going to change in 2023, then you're going to get -- during 2023, then you're going to get to EUR 2.2 billion in addition to that.

But in the Memory space, clearly, we have seen some replanning of. But like I said earlier, it's not significant, but we are seeing some readjustment of the shipment planning. And that has been gobbled up very quickly by other customers, of which, by the way, those customers that are gobbling this up are in the Logic space, but also here and there, we have many customers said, fine.

And I think it's good to remember that it's difficult to figure out what's going to happen next. And with that in mind, I have 2 like very, very specific clarification questions on things we've discussed a lot on the call today. The first one is in the way you've commented about 2023, where do you stand on Memory? Do you take into account the fact that your main clients on that front have announced like [WACC] spending or like CapEx reduced significantly? And so is that already part of your plan? Or is that something that you still need to see coming through because it takes time for the whole supply chain to process? 
And then my second question is more on your sales impressive $38 billion of backlog. Can you explain to us in a scenario in which things slow down fairly significantly, how do conversations about this backlog go? Can your clients like ask you to reschedule shipments to cancel orders what are they tied to, what's your common business factors to manage a situation where your clients are giving you a lot of orders. And as you say, if you take orders, that's what we would expect you to do. But then if the work changes a bit and slows down, then things have to be revisited?",241,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

That a great question. First of all, for 2023, if there has been a replanning of their CapEx spend, it's already in. But like I said, if you have a significant reduction in the demand from our customers, which by the way, is not significant, but it is a reduction. But that gap between the demand and the capacity to ship is still so big then the impact on our total shipments is basically 0. But what you do see is a shift, thers is a bit of a shift between Memory and Logic for 2023. So it's in there, but it doesn't change the absolute numbers, let's say, the over 60 and over 375. It's just a different allocation. 
And on the EUR 38 billion, how to deal with that if we really get into a deep recession. What is -- what we've always seen in deep recession that I've seen in the last 25 years or downturn, customers never cancel. They ask for a rescheduling of the shipment. And that's basically depending on their CapEx plans and on the depth of the recession, about their ability to finance it depends whether it's a few months out or to a few quarters out. that's what normally happens. So we just get at the time in which we now plan to shift the back up in a situation where you have a deep recession, then the time to shift the backlog is just going to extend, that's what's happening, yes -- that goes away.",257,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

So Adi, good question. And indeed, that's the case. So the installation time is going more and more rapid, also in comparison to the beginning of the year. And to give you a bit of flavor for that. I think at the beginning of the year, we were somewhere around 14 to 15 weeks, and I think we were able to shave off around 10 days to 14 days of that number. So that's the -- that's what we've been able to do. 
Of course, there are differences. Some customers, it works more rapidly than at other there are quite some differences there. But on average, I think that's about what you're looking at. There's 2 things. One thing that it does, this is an important element also in the discussion that we had earlier on. This is an important element also in demonstrating that fast shipments are not more difficult to install than normal of the shipments, which is an important element in the revenue recognition exercise that we talked about. So there's an important factor element in ultimately trying to get to a situation where we can once again recognize revenue upon shipment. That's one thing that it does, so that's helpful. 
Secondly, you're right. I mean this could lead to the situation where maybe what you push out of the year is less than what you get into the year, that is in a stable situation. If you grow, of course, than under normal circumstances, you would push out more. So when I said in an earlier response that I would expect about the same to go out of the year as what would come into the year. Of course, that would also assume growth. So that's the reason why, I think, net-net, with a growth situation, but then the benefit of being more economical and efficient on the [install] that kind of gets you to an expectation of a stable situation.",326,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And my follow-up is on your China-based customers. Can you talk a bit about your ability and the ability of your peers to track and control which node a particular tool is used in? And is it relatively easy for you to be able to say which -- what node a particular customer is using the tools you've supplied in? The reason I ask is, they're tracking is not that easy any sort of risk that you have to stop shipping to wider nodes than you may be thinking at the moment? .",94,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

I think it's a very relevant question. I mean when you talk about nodes, as wording of the technology node, which could be an 18-nanometer node or whatever node, take 18-nanometer as an example, and that is a half pitch node which basically has many half pitches. So the definition of what is exactly meant is extremely important. And I think this is exactly why the industry and the industry equipment makers are, of course, in contact with the U.S. government interpretation of this. And -- because you are right. I mean the difference. You have the nomenclature, which is used for marketing, and you have the nomenclature that is used for the real physical size. And then just to give you an indication, if you talk about the pitch, which is a line in a space and half pitch basically assumes that the width of the physical structure of the line is as big as the space. Well, trust me, there are spaces that are smaller than the physical line. And it actually means that then in marketing terms, they refer to the space and not to the physical structure. So is that all things need to be worked out. I need to be clarified with the U.S. government and with the agency that's actually doing this particular assessment. And it's going to take some time. This is why we continuously refer to our initial assessment and this need for the work and interpretation clarification.",247,5.0,8.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8
