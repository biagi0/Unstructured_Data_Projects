Our participants today are Dirk Meyer, our President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, our Chief Financial Officer.This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The replay number is (888) 266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703) 925-2533. The access code for both is 1422675. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening.I'd like to take this opportunity to announce that AMD will hold its 2010 Financial Analyst Day on November 11. We'll provide you with more details, including the location of the event over coming months. I'd also like to call your attention that our first quarter 2010 earnings quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, March 12. References to AMD on this earnings call, refer to AMD Product Company, which refers to the operating results of AMD excluding our Foundry Segment and Intersegment Eliminations. We'll provide a reconciliation of AMD Product Company to AMD consolidated operating results, which are reported for GAAP purposes in today's earnings press release. Before we begin today's call, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current days and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast, especially in light of the current state of the economy. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our most recent SEC filing, AMD's quarterly earnings report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 26th, 2009. Now with that, I'd like turn the call over to Dirk Meyer, our CEO. Dirk?",349,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

A year ago, in a very cloudy economic environment, we outlined a bold game plan that transformed this company into one design to generate consistent profitability, while exploiting the unique combination of x86 and graphics processing technology that only AMD possesses. We're pleased with our progress on this transformation, both in the quarter and throughout the past year. We promised to lower our breakeven point, and we did. We promised to increase our focus on our core businesses, x86 microprocessors and graphics, and we have. We promised to execute on our roadmaps, on-time and on budget, and we did. We promised to expose the truth about the monopolistic environment in which we are operating, and we did. We promised to execute our Asset Smart strategy and transform ourselves into a fabulous company, and we did. And we made significant progress in improving our balance sheet, reducing our overall debt by more than $2.2 billion through the creation of GLOBALFOUNDRIES and other debt transactions. In short, we delivered on every major milestone to which we committed in the past year, placing ourselves in a much stronger position to succeed in the quarters ahead.In the meantime, our fourth quarter operating performance was solid. In an improving global economy, we saw a growing customer and end user response to AMD platforms, products and marketing offerings, with particularly strong performance in our server and discrete graphics businesses. In servers, customer adoption of the six-core AMD Opteron processor has been impressive, accounting for nearly 60% of our server revenue and half of our units. We saw particularly strong adoption in HPC [High Performance Computing] and cloud computing cluster environments. In fact, AMD now powers the number one supercomputer in the world, the number one GPU-powered supercomputer in the world and four of the top five supercomputers on the semi-annual Top500 Supercomputer list. In discrete graphics, we expanded our leadership position on the strength of the Radeon HD 5000 series, expanding our portfolio of the industry's only DirectX 11 capable graphics processors, and we shipped more than 2 million DirectX 11-capable GPUs in the first three months after launch.AMD's world-class sales and marketing engine is increasing its pace. Our innovative VISION marketing campaign is gaining support across the industry, and we were thrilled to expand the program in the commercial notebooks with the first commercial Lenovo ThinkPad based on AMD VISION Pro technology. Meanwhile, our Fusion Partner Program is exceeding expectations in the component channel, securing over 100 new Premier partners in its first full quarter of operation. In summary, our fourth quarter was a good balance of achieving strategic milestones and solid operating performance in an improving market. It also represents a springboard for the year ahead.  In the market, the center of gravity for innovation in our industry is in the consumer space and historical AMD's strength. Consumers demand a vivid digital experience, immersive, media rich with the natural user interface, and these play well to AMD's design technology and marketing strengths. Our customer list continues to grow with customers attracted to AMD's differentiated technology portfolio and growing recognition that good enough computing is simply isn't good enough. And we have a winning business model. We have access to leading-edge capacity from what has already become one of the most impressive semiconductor foundry companies in the world, GLOBALFOUNDRIES. We have a new operating footprint and a strong emerging discipline of staying inside that operating envelope.But, what is most difficult to see from outside the company is the changes that is occurring within our culture. There's a renewed spark within our employees as we see growing validation of our innovative platform strategy and a rapidly approaching future, based on the strength of AMD Fusion technology. I think it's important for you to know what this culture is all about. It's about winning. It's about changing the game. And it's about consistent profitable growth, making money for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.",680,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-21-2010",2010-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3540.0,46781.0,3568966.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Seifert,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Dirk. We're pleased to report that in 2009, we reached and maintained the target financial model we defined at the beginning of the year, and made significant progress in decreasing our operating loss. As Dirk mentioned, AMD delivered a solid quarter. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.646 billion, up 18% compared to the third quarter of 2009, and at 42% compared to the same period a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter was held by a number of factors including, healthy holiday sell-through, increased enterprise spending, particularly in service and strong demand following industry-leading Radeon 5000 series, driving faster sell-through by our Add-In-Board partners. AMD reported non-GAAP net income of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, which excludes a net favorable impact of $1.235 billion, primarily from the legal settlement with Intel. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $169 million, which excludes the impact of the legal settlement and ARC charges. We continue to make good progress on gross margin as a result of diluted shared unit growth in both the Computing and Graphic businesses, completion of our transition to 45nm CPUs and higher ASPs. Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin improved to 41% compared to 38% in the prior quarter. We managed operating expenses within our target model. R&D was $301 million and SG&A was $209 million for the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $282 million, up from $169 million in the third quarter. Before I turn to our business segments, I would like to point out that AMD's fourth quarter share count is 791 million on a fully diluted basis. The diluted share count is high due to the inclusion of the 5.75 convertible common shares, which were dilutive to the fourth quarter EPS.Now switching to the business segments. Strong demand for our products and platforms drove several all-time records in the fourth quarter. We shipped a record number of notebook processors and record number of chipsets. In our Graphic Products business, we saw record discrete mobile unit shipments. And finally, we also recorded record gaming revenues in the quarter. In our Computing Solutions segment, fourth quarter revenue was $1.214 billion, up 14% sequentially, driven primarily by double-digit unit growth. Notebook processor unit sales were up 19% quarter-over-quarter, while server processor unit sales grew 21% sequentially. And operating income for the Computing Solutions segment was $158 million, up significantly from the third quarter operating income of $76 million.In the Graphic segment, revenue for the quarter was $427 million, up 40% sequentially. AMD's sweet spot strategy continues to pay dividends as evidenced by another fast ramp of our new generation of graphic products. Growth in the Graphics segment was driven by strong sales in G [ph] at import channel, with double-digit increases in both mobile discrete graphics and workstation graphics. The Graphic segment reported an operating income of $53 million, a substantial improvement from the prior quarter.Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $1.8 billion. In addition to the Intel settlement proceeds of $1.25 billion, and the reclassification of $58 million of our auction-rate securities to long term assets, we executed several debt transactions in the quarter. We redeemed the remaining amount outstanding of the 7 3/4% senior notes due in 2012, which was approximately $390 million. We reduced the aggregate amount outstanding of the 5 3/4% convertible senior notes due in 2012 by approximately $1 billion. And we issued $500 million of 8.125% senior notes due in 2017. As a result of these efforts, we were able to decrease our debt due in 2012 by nearly $1.4 billion to $485 million.Let me now spend some minutes talking about the deconsolidation of GLOBALFOUNDRIES. As I mentioned in December, our goal was to deconsolidate GLOBALFOUNDRIES as soon as possible in 2010. A number of events have occurred in the past quarter that allowed us to accelerate this process: First, AMD and Intel agreed to a new cross-license agreement under which we have brought half-made rights; second, ATIC acquired Chartered Semiconductor, which will now be jointly operated with GLOBALFOUNDRIES; and third, AMD agreed to waive some rights that previously required unanimous GLOBALFOUNDRIES board approval. Given these developments and new accounting regulation becoming effective in 2010, AMD is able to deconsolidate GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Starting in the first quarter of 2010, AMD's investment in GLOBALFOUNDRIES will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result of the deconsolidation, we are in the midst of valuation analysis of our GLOBALFOUNDRIES investment, which may result in a one-time non-cash impact to our Q1 2010 financials.Let's turn to the outlook now. The following statements concerning AMD are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially from current expectations. For the first quarter of 2010, AMD expects revenue to be down seasonally. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $550 million, due to salary reinstatement, performance-related accruals and some R&D project expenses, and tax is expected to be approximately $3 million. As a reminder, our 2010 guidance for AMD is as follows: Gross margin to be in the range of 40% to 45%; SG&A to be in the range of 14% to 17% of sales; depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $340 million to $370 million; capital expenditures to come in at approximately $120 million; profitability on an operating income levels throughout the year and free cash flow to be positive. In conclusion, we did what we said we would do in 2009 and we entered 2010 with a clear vision, executing to a lean business model. At this point, I would like to turn it back to Ruth for Q&A.",942,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

In general, consistent with past policies, we price with the mind towards maximizing gross margin dollar volume versus specific share targets or specific gross margin percent thoughts. Now having said that, there's a lot of moving parts in the marketplace. Emerging markets represent a big growth opportunity on the one hand. On the other hand, we feel pretty good about our opportunities to drive a richer product assortment with our OEMs. As you know, if you look at the distribution of our products across the system price points in the market, we tend to be, I'll say disproportionately represented in the value in mainstream segments. So we think on the strength of new products, combined with a very good and well-received marketing campaign in the form of VISION, we got an opportunity to drive a richer mix.

And we're doing very well, as evidenced by the recent announcement on Lenovo, introducing for the first time notebook products based on AMD technology, both for the commercial segment under the ThinkPad brand, as well as later on in this year, the consumer in SMB transactional segment under IdeaPad. I would say that our strategy of positioning our offering around what is increasingly a consumer-driven usage model in the PC market is really resonating with our customers. The importance of graphics is clear and is becoming more so including, downstream from our customers into their channels and in the end user community. We've noted year-to-year that increasing percentage of our notebook platforms are being designed with discrete graphics attach capability, which is good.

And before I answer, I'll remind you that with segment in the market, the big volume opportunity is consumer, a little bit smaller is commercial. When in the commercial space, Enterprise is actually the smallest of the segments, SMB being bigger. The SMB subsegment or commercial is really our focus area. As an example, the ThinkPad products from Lenovo are really targeted at the SMB segment. Though having said that, I do expect and we do see our SMB focused offerings from OEMs bleed over into Enterprise because they represent a very good value.

What's that say about the market versus AMD's performance in the market? Well number one, a lot of our quarter-to-quarter growth was driven by notebooks. And I think clearly, there's a shared gain implication there. I mean, we'll see when the numbers come out. In addition, we got nearly a full quarter of shipment of some of our new DX11 products. We clearly have a distinctive product there, and that drove business generally in a positive way.

So I didn't mean to see a large fraction of GPU revenue was cards, and I don't want to get more granular than that. With respect to GPU attach rates, we'll wait to see the numbers come out.

We still have a relatively small share in professional graphics. Although in our design win momentum is pretty good and I expect that to be an opportunity for us over the next one to two years. With respect to your question about the competition, it's hard to know in detail to answer to that question since they haven't launched anything yet. What I can tell you is we've got very enthusiastic response to our products that are in the market today. We see a very good pipeline of OEM design wins down the road, which our OEMs, of course, to both company's road maps. And our strategy is to continue to stick to the sweet spot method we have had, and deliver leadership products as measured by performance per watt, per dollar as well as features.

The server units did outgrow our units on average by a little bit. I wouldn't call it a significant contribution to the gross margin improvement quarter-to-quarter. Rather, I just reflect back in the three things that we talked about on prior calls, as being potential drivers for gross margin. Number one was improving capacity utilization in GLOBALFOUNDRIES Dresden facility which we're still on the hook on a fixed cost basis, that was number one. Number two, the completion of our transition to 45nm MPUs. And number three, ASP improvement and the improvement we saw quarter to quarter in gross margins, I'd say, was split relatively evenly across those three subcategories. The next part of your -- your next question was about how we feel about the Magny-Cours Maranello will launch next quarter and on the transfers we feel very good. We are on track for that launch next quarter and it represents the biggest improvement in performance that we'll be driving into our Opteron lineup since we introduced that product line in 2003.

First, as we said in the prepared remarks, our unit growth quarter-to-quarter was a little bit north of 20%. And our ASPs were actually up a bit on servers. It's hard to forecast with a lot of granularity, how the market's going to move next year. First, we did see kind of the second half for the year characterized by increasing strength in the server market, particularly as we left the year and we're hopeful that, that momentum will continue at least to the first half. And clearly, middle of the first half, we're introducing a top to bottom new lineup, Intel is introducing new technologies as well, so a lot of moving parts. I think on a relative basis, we're going to have an even stronger competitive position in the two-socket space, which as you know, Doug, is 75% to 80% of the opportunity there. And really that's where the game is played so to the extent were successful in getting traction, getting those machines in the market and gaining share, that will be a good news story for AMD.",182,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

First, we're looking into next year feeling pretty good about the opportunity for the PC market being a growth year in 2010, low double digits 10%, 11%, 12% something like that, more or less consistent with what we said in the Analyst Day call in November. I would say our experience with Q4 confirms that thesis about the way 2010 will look, end user demand was strong, certainly the holiday sales out were strong. And that's true really in all regions, even in Eastern Europe, which was pretty weak through the whole of 2009. We started to see a recovery there. In addition, based in our conversations with our customers, as well as with our distributors, inventories look to be in good shape. So we don't see any dangerous pileup of inventories across the areas of the downstream supply-chain that we can see.

Our participants today are Derrick Meyer, our President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number is (888) 266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703) 925-2533. The access code for both is 1446133. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening. Before we start, I'd like to highlight that AMD will attend UBS's Investment Conference on June 9 in New York, and that our second quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, June 11. Last January, we announced that we deconsolidated GLOBALFOUNDRIES as of the first quarter of 2010 and began accounting for our ownership interest under the equity method of accounting. AMD has an ownership stake in GLOBALFOUNDRIES, which is reflected in the equity in net loss of investee line of our statement of operations. For your information, our Class A preferred share ownership decreased from 83% to 82%, as a result of the capital call that took place on the 1st of April. ATIC participated in the cash call and AMD did not. As a result, AMD's ownership on a fully diluted basis also decreased to approximately 30% as of the second quarter of 2010. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures are included in our financial tables that accompany our earnings release, available on the Investor Relations section of amd.com. Before we begin today's call, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current belief, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and involved risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast, especially in light of the current state of the economy. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risks factors in our most recent SEC filing, AMD's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2009.

As I said at our Analyst Event back in November, our priorities this year are to deliver compelling platforms, increase access to customer demand and transform our business model. In the first quarter of this year, we made good progress on each of these priorities. And in an improving global economic environment, we delivered record first quarter revenue, coupled with good operating performance. Our platform execution continued to be solid across the board, with key new product transitions initiated in each of our main businesses. In Graphics, we shipped a total of over 6 million DX11-enabled units to date and expanded the family into the Mainstream and Value segments. In addition, we unveiled the industry's first DX11 products for notebooks where we continue to grow share. Demand for all of our DX11 product is very healthy and continues to outpace supply. We are seeing strong support for our AMD VISION program, an innovative campaign designed to simplify the consumer buying experience at retail, showcase the benefits of an all-AMD solution and increase upsell. Today, over 50% of AMD-based notebook systems in the market are VISION-branded, enabling us to participate more thoroughly in higher price bands. Meanwhile in servers, demand for the new AMD Opteron 6000 Series has been strong, with HP, Dell and Acer all announcing new platforms at launch. These are the world's first eight- and 12-core x86 processors, delivering on customer needs for more cores and more memory for less money. OEM interest in our AMD Opteron 4000 Series has been strong as well. That 4000 Series is on track for launch this quarter. AMD momentum in notebooks is growing, as we expand our platform footprint and our list of top tier customers. We were very pleased to add Lenovo to the list of customers attracted to our unique value proposition in notebooks. And we continue to see strong end-customer demand for a vivid digital experience, coupled with strong battery life and real world application scenarios. To that end, the customer interest in our Danube and Nile platforms is very promising. On the business model, the deconsolidation of GLOBALFOUNDRIES is complete. Our operating performance is improving. The cash generation potential of the business is beginning to be realized and we are improving our balance sheet. In summary, our first quarter was another in a series of solid quarters. A good balance of achieving strategic milestones and solid operating performance in an improving market. And with that, I'll turn it over to Thomas.",427,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We are pleased to report another quarter of good product and financial execution as we further demonstrated the strengths of all our business model by growing ASPs, margins and improving cash flow. First quarter revenue was $1.57 billion, down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of '09 and up 34% compared to the same period a year ago. AMD reported non-GAAP net income of $63 million in the first quarter of 2010. To calculate the non-GAAP net income, we excluded the $17 million amortization of intangible assets and three items related to the deconsolidation of GLOBALFOUNDRIES: First, a non-cash one-time gain of $325 million based on the fair value assessment of our investment in GLOBALFOUNDRIES; second, a gross margin benefit of $69 million related to inventory; and third, a non-cash loss of $183 million, which includes our share of GLOBALFOUNDRIES' operating results and other equity accounting-related adjustments. We continue to reference non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are more indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.09 in the first quarter was calculated using 730 million shares, which excludes the impact of the 5 3/4% 2012 convertible debt dilution, because the diluted EPS inflection point of $0.29 for the quarter was not triggered. For modeling purposes, if this inflection point is triggered, you'll need to add back about $7 million in interest charges, applicable to the debt and approximately 24 million common shares issuable upon conversion to calculate the diluted EPS. First quarter non-GAAP operating income was $130 million, excluding the gross margin benefits related to inventory and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 43%, up two percentage points from last quarter, mainly due to improved product mix that drove higher ASPs. Operating expenses in the quarter were $542 million, within the guided range. R&D was at $323 million, and SG&A was at $219 million for the period. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $302 million, up from $282 million in the fourth quarter. And adjusted free cash flow was $177 million. Now switching to the business segments. First quarter revenue decreased sequentially in both our Computing Solutions and Graphics segments. In the Computing Solutions segment, first quarter revenue was $1.16 billion, down 5% sequentially. For historical comparison, please note that starting in Q1 of this year, we are accounting for the Embedded Graphic business under the Computing Solutions segment. Previously, it was part of the Graphics Product group, prior periods also have been recast.The sequential revenue decrease in Computing Solutions was primarily driven by a decrease in microprocessor unit shipments, partially offset by increased microprocessor ASPs, particularly in notebooks. Our Server, Notebook and Desktop businesses saw double-digit revenue growth compared to this period last year. Server revenue and units demonstrated the strongest year-over-year growth, reflecting the continuing strength in enterprise IT spending. We are encouraged by the ongoing success of our Six-Core AMD Opteron platform, as well as the broad acceptance of the recently launched eight- and 12-core offerings. Combined, the two platforms drove higher server overall ASPs in the quarter and made up more than 2/3 of Server revenue. Computing Solutions segment operating income was $146 million compared with $161 million in Q4 '09. In the Graphics segment, revenue for the quarter was $409 million, down 3% sequentially in a constrained capacity environment. Record mobile GPU shipments were more than offset by a combination of seasonally lower game console royalties and desktop discrete graphics sales. Graphics processor ASPs increased sequentially on continued demand for ATI's 5000 Series [ATI Radeon™ HD 5800 Series] graphics cards. Graphics segment operating income was $47 million, compared with $50 million in the fourth quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet. Starting in the first quarter, there's an additional line item in our balance sheet to reflect our investment in GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The ending investment balance for the first quarter of 2010 was $270 million. This balance will be adjusted on a quarterly basis, primarily based on our equity gain or loss under the equity method of accounting. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. Long-term debt as of the end of the first quarter of 2010 was $2.6 billion. Now let me turn to the outlook. The following statements concerning AMD are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially from current expectations. For the second quarter of 2010, AMD expects revenue to be seasonally down. As a result of deconsolidation, we expect an additional gross margin benefit of approximately $15 million in Q2 related to inventory. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $560 million because of quarter-to-quarter timing of expenses. We continue to expect capital expenditures to come in at approximately $160 million in 2010. In conclusion, AMD's first quarter was a solid demonstration of the earnings potential of our business model. We are pleased with the market's response to our new products and platforms. And we remain optimistic about our capacity to scale our business, as we offer increasingly compelling platforms with greater access to customer demand. At this point, I would like to turn it back to Ruth for the Q&A.",861,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We see some opportunity in the second quarter because of better product mix, because of the product launches we will perform, especially in the Notebook segment.

You'll see platforms become available starting really early in Q2, and being staged out of the course of Q2 from the three OEMs I outlined. The response to the product has been pretty enthusiastic. Our OEMs have got some good design wins behind the product. And as well, we're starting to get pretty encouraging feedback from, some of the, I'll say big enterprises that have seen seed samples. And in fact, we've got some interesting wins so far. So I think that's a good precursor to the competitive position of the product and how it will do in the market.

One is, as we've said before, we see the notebook market as a big opportunity for us, because we're relatively under-represented there. As you know, our unit share in desktop is in the high 20s. Our notebook unit share is much lower than that. And increasingly, we've closed whatever technological issues there might have been, such as battery life, perception gaps or other on the notebook platform. So we feel technologically, our platforms are awesome. Of course, the importance of graphics is becoming more clear to end-users. And finally, we feel really good about where we've got our triple- and quad-core positioned in the market, in terms of the power of those products and the sort of thin-and-light form factors that OEMs will be able to build around those products. And all of that in combination with the VISION campaign, we think it's going to result in not only the opportunity for some share growth looking forward, but also a richer mix of AMD-based platforms in the marketplace. Then your question on Servers was, in effect, how do we think about the opportunity in 2P and how does that affect ASPs overall? So first, the Magny-Cours product really gets us back in a great competitive position, and by far, the biggest volume part of the Server market 2P, probably 80% of the unit opportunity. And we're in the best competitive position that we've been since probably the middle of 2006. So clearly, an opportunity and as I said, in response to the earlier question, to the extent we disproportionately grow our Server business, it's good for our ASPs and good for our margins.",277,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And importantly, a lot of the buying criteria now include not just absolute maximum performance but performance per watt, per dollar. And there, Magny-Cours really shines both on a performance-per-watt basis and a performance-per-dollar basis. The final thing that we've done is in the Opteron 6000 Series, changed the pricing strategy and removed what had been a pretty big step-up in price, when you go from a two-socket-capable processor to a four-socket-capable processor. And we think what we're going to do there is, in some ways, disrupt the market and encourage a lot of OEMs and end-users to look at four-socket implementations, where previously they didn't.

One is, the pricing environment as a result of price competition between players in the market; and the other is, pricing influenced by what people choose to purchase in the way of systems and system prices, which drives the system mix and hence, component mix. On the former point, we really haven't seen much change for several quarters now. That is the competitive element. I mean, it's, generally speaking, a competitive market. I think the wild card is the mix. Clearly, '08 to '09, you saw quite a mix shift down market and we're seeing some evidence that, that historical trend will not be as dramatic '09 to '10 as it was in the past year, not surprising given economic crisis last year.

Our participants today are Derrick Meyer, our President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number is (888)266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703)925-2533. The access code for both is 1465123. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening. 
Before we start, I'd like to highlight that AMD will attend the Citi Technology Conference on September 7 in New York. And also, AMD will host its Financial Analyst Day on November 9 at the company's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, and not November 11 as previously communicated. Lastly, our third quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, September 10. 
Last January, when announced the weakened deconsolidated GLOBALFOUNDRIES as of the first quarter of 2010 and began accounting for ownership interest under the equity method of accounting.   AMD has an ownership stake in GLOBALFOUNDRIES, which is reflected in the equity and net loss of investee line on our statement of operations. AMD's Class A preferred share ownership of GLOBALFOUNDRIES decreased from approximately 82% to approximately 79% as a result of additional capital called that took place in the second quarter. ATIC [Advanced Technology Investment Company] participated in the cash called and AMD did not. As a result, AMD's ownership on a fully diluted basis also decreased to approximately 28%. 
Reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures disclosed today are in included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, which are also available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com. 
Before we begin today's call, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. 
The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast, especially in light of the current state of the economy. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discussed the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions of such risk factors in our most recent SEC filing, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 27, 2010. 
Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Dirk.",436,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

In an environment of healthy demand for IT products, AMD delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth and operating performance. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we can generate profits while continuing to transform the business to achieve our short- and long-term goals. 
Demand for our GPU offerings in the quarter was very strong and shipments were tempered only by supply constraints. This was the second straight quarter of record GPU shipments led by an 18% sequential increase in notebook discrete units. More than half of our GPU shipments in the quarter were DX11 capable, and we have shipped nearly 16 million DX11 GPUs to date. 
In the second half of the year, we expect GPU demand to remain healthy and supply constraints to ease. We remain on track to bolster our GPU leadership with the introduction of our second generation DX11 graphics products later this year. 
We completed the rollout of our Hi-Lo server products. We are targeting power- and value-conscious markets with the Opteron 4000 series we introduced late in June. The Opteron 4100 series processor is the world's lowest power per core server processor and the first CPU designed specifically for cloud data centers. 
We are targeting performance oriented markets with our Opteron 6000 series. Shipments of our 6000 series nearly quadrupled sequentially, ramping late in the quarter as our largest customers transition the bulk of their AMD-based offerings to the new platform. We expect to see the substantial impact of our new generation server products to fully materialize in the third quarter. 
Turning to our Client PC business. Customer response to our newest AMD VISION client offerings is outstanding. We more than tripled the number of VISION-branded platforms in the market compared to just nine months ago. The launch of our latest VISION offerings was the most successful platform introduction in our history, driving record mobile CPU unit shipments for the quarter. We secured more than 130 design wins, spanning multiple price points across both the consumer and commercial markets. 
Customer adoption of our Danube Mainstream Notebook platform in higher price bands is a testament to the competitiveness of our platform offerings. The broad assortment of VISION offerings positions us well for the key back-to-school and holiday buying cycles. We're very pleased that Sony is now offering notebooks based on AMD CPUs as part of its VISION-enabled VAIO notebooks. And we welcome Sony back to the ranks of AMD CPU customers. 
We're excited about building on our market momentum with the introduction of the world's first Fusion accelerated processing units or APUs, and the two new x86 processor cores that will be the foundation for our next generation platforms. One of our forthcoming APUs, code named Ontario, combines our new low-power Bobcat CPU core and the DX11 GPU. The Bobcat CPU core featured on Ontario delivers mainstream CPU performance in less than half the area and a fraction of the power consumption. Ontario offers the ideal solution to meet the growing demand for low power, small form factor computers that deliver a visual computing experience previously available only on high-end PCs. We're excited about the opportunities Ontario offers. It's a game changer that significantly expands our addressable market. 
Based on strong customer demand and an accelerated engineering cycle, we now expect Ontario to be the first Fusion APU we bring to market. We plan to ship Ontario APUs in the fourth quarter of this year, ahead of schedule. Customer systems based on Ontario are planned to be available early next year. 
Llano, our Fusion APU offering aimed at the higher end of the client market, is also generating positive customer response. However, in reaction to Ontario's market opportunities and a slower than anticipated progress of the 32-nanometer yield curve, we are switching the timing of the Ontario and Llano production ramps. Llano production shipments are still expected to occur in the first half of next year. 
In the second quarter this year, we also taped out the first 32-nanometer product based on our new high-performance Bulldozer CPU core. We plan to be in sampling our Bulldozer-based server and desktop processors in the second half of this year and remain on track for 2011 launches. These new processors will deliver significant performance improvements to the AMD platform. 
Customers are increasingly excited about our portfolio of technologies and the product roadmap. The growing importance of graphics is clear. The revolutionary potential of vivid, GPU-accelerated applications is becoming a reality, and the performance, value and power efficiency of AMD Fusion platforms, starting with Ontario, will be compelling. 
In closing, we are pleased with our overall performance in the quarter. We see strong opportunities for continued improvement in our operating performance and an exciting future for AMD built on the power of our Fusion and VISION platform strategies. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Thomas.",810,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Robust demand for our latest mobile platforms and solid execution of our business model drove record second quarter revenues and increased profitability. Second quarter revenue was $1.65 billion, up 5% compared to the first quarter of 2010 and up 40% compared to the same period a year ago. 
AMD reported non-GAAP net income of $83 million in the second quarter of 2010. To calculate the non-GAAP net income, we excluded our share of financial results and other equity accounting adjustments related to GLOBALFOUNDRIES, a non-cash loss of $120 million. As usual, we also excluded the $17 million amortization of acquired intangible assets and other nonrecurring charges and credits as outlined in our earnings release tables. 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.11 in the second quarter is calculated using 733 million shares. Second quarter non-GAAP operating income was $138 million, excluding the charges and credits as outlined in our earnings release. Gross margin for the quarter was 45%, up two percentage points compared to the non-GAAP gross margin last quarter. The increase was mainly due to improved product mix and GLOBALFOUNDRIES' fab utilization rates. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $600 million. R&D was $371 million and SG&A was $229 million for the period. Operating expenses came in higher than guidance, largely due to revenue and operating income, variable expenses coming in higher than planned. We also incurred some additional R&D costs associated with accelerating the time to market for Ontario. As you heard Derrick mentioned, Ontario will be our first APU and will ship ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $244 million, down from $302 million. However, excluding the first quarter one-time gross margin benefit of $69 million related to GLOBALFOUNDRIES' deconsolidation, the adjusted EBITDA was up $11 million sequentially.  Adjusted free cash flow was $76 million, resulting in $253 million in adjusted free cash flow for the first half of 2010. 
Now switching to the business segments. Second quarter revenue increased sequentially in both our Computing Solutions and Graphics segments. In the Computing Solutions segment, second quarter revenue was $1.21 billion, up 4% sequentially. The sequential revenue increase in Computing Solutions was primarily driven by record notebook processor and chipset unit shipments. Both of these product lines saw double-digit revenue and unit percentage growth sequentially and year-over-year. 
Server ASP improved for the fourth consecutive quarter as we nearly quadrupled shipments on the AMD Opteron 6000 series platform, also known as Magny-Cours. We look forward to extending the success of our latest server offerings into the two socket volume space with the Opteron EE 4000 series platform recently launched in June.  Overall, Microprocessor ASP was flat sequentially and increased year-over-year. 
Computing Solutions segment operating income was $128 million, compared with $146 million in the first quarter of 2010. In the Graphics segment, revenue for the quarter was $440 million, up 8% sequentially. The sequential increase was driven by record GPU shipments, as mobile discrete GPU shipments achieved a fourth record quarter in a row. 
GPU ASP decreased sequentially due to an increased mix of notebook discrete unit shipments coupled with supply constraints for the AIB [Add-in-Board] channel. Operating income was $33 million compared with $47 million in the first quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable security balance at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. Long-term debt as of the end of the second quarter of 2010 was $2.4 billion. We retired $206 million of our 6% convertible senior notes due in 2015 during the quarter via open market repurchases. That reduction continues to be a focus for us for the remainder of the year. 
Now let me turn to the outlook. The following statements concerning AMD are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially from current expectations. For the third quarter of 2010, AMD expects revenue to be up seasonally. Operating expenses are expected to be $630 million for Q3, the $30 million sequential increase is due to a change in our marketing programs. We will now accrue marketing expenses earlier and closer in line with revenue development. The transition to the new marketing program is expected to take two quarters. 
In conclusion, we continue to execute well to our business strategy and our success is reflected in our financial performance. We remain focused on our financial targets as we prepare to deliver the first APUs to our customers in the fourth quarter of this year. 
At this point, I would like to turn it back to Ruth for Q&A.",759,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

What's the framework for that? And I was also wondering, if I may, if you could give some color on -- with the higher revenue that you saw in the quarter, why was the operating margin slightly lower for both the Computing segment and the Graphics segment? If you could give some color on that. And then lastly, just for Dirk, can you just tell us how your comments on the time line for 32-nanometer -- I think you said that it would begin shipping perhaps in the fourth quarter with Ontario.

We said seasonally up. We'd like to see the midpoint 7%, 7.5%, 8%. We would like to paint a box of 5% to 10% around it. And if you come to the operating performance, and you have to keep in mind that we had some special events in the first quarter that impacted our operating income. So especially if you look at the operating income for the Computing Solutions segment and the $146 million of operating income in the first quarter, we had a one-time positive effect of $39 million, If you take that out and look at development of then 107 to 128, very good development in our opinion. The Graphics segment is a bit more difficult. You heard me say that we saw a quarter-over-quarter price decrease that affected our operating income, mainly because our product mix being shifted and not having -- because of the supply constraints, enough material available to participate in our higher price performing AIB channel.",170,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We're starting to begin shipments to our customers in Q4 for revenue, which is a substantial pull-in from our prior plans. Meanwhile, we have seen the rate of yield learning below our plans on 32-nanometer, and as a result of the opportunity, frankly, that Ontario gives us and the reaction to yield situation, we put our engineering resources into creating samples for Ontario, supporting ODMs and OEM system designs, while we take a bit more time to work the 32-nanometer yields up the curve.

So if you look at the upside opportunities is, of course, selling of the stack or product mix in our product platforms are improving. And we also see some further potential in increasing global foundry utilization.  There will be some headwinds to that and the exchange rate development over the last weeks reversed.

I would say our big opportunity is less variation around what happens with enterprise consumption versus just ramping our new platforms. As I've said often, we've become, what I think it's pretty terribly and underrepresented in the server category, our shares being in relative all-time lows. We feel very good about positioning the Magny-Cours, those products for our big customers really just became available in June. So I think the big story for us and the big swing story, swing factor for us is more about successfully positioning and selling those platforms in the market versus minor swings in overall enterprise market size. On the Client PC side of our business, frankly, that's our lowest priority in terms of focus.

So as a high level statement, that's still showing a fair amount of bullishness on the year end, also the back half. I will say that all of our customers and partners read the general business press the same way we all do and they're nervous about things like the debt crisis in Europe, worried about the potential of a slowdown in China as a result of the changes around housing and so on. And therefore, everybody is very reluctant to put cash into inventory. In many ways, I consider that good news because as we look to the process of supply chain, we don't see any inventory build ups anywhere. And as far as end-user demand goes, which is, really, what, in the end of the day, drives the business, we still see a pretty good story. All of our regions that were healthy going into Q2.

One thing I will correct you on is TSMC is not at the 32-nanometer node either. At the highest level, we're simply a little bit behind our progress up the yield curve. Your question is why? I'm not going to go into details. I will say that we all anticipated that GLOBALFOUNDRIES would have an awful lot of work on their plate in terms of supporting a very difficult transition for us in the form of 32 nanometers, while at the same time, expanding their technology portfolio to include support for other customers. This is a risk that we all knew about. I think we're managing it very well, and I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made over the past couple of weeks in GLOBALFOUNDRIES. And pretty confident that we'll climb up the yield curve consistent with the new expectations we painted in my opening comments. The final point is I feel very good about the technology roadmap that GLOBALFOUNDRIES has put in place for AMD in the sense that it represents a workload that I think is very practical and achievable for them and really good for our products, and we're looking forward to talking about both of those in the upcoming analyst conference in November.",221,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

It's hard to know what's going to happen. I can tell you what the mood amongst the partners is. Number one, as I said, due to the caution driven by macroeconomic concerns, there is a hesitance to put a lot of cash in the inventory. Therefore, the supply chain is being managed very tightly, which all in all is not a bad thing. The other thing that you'll obviously see in Europe in response to the degradation of the euro is OEMs in some sense mixing down the solutions that they assorted to various price points. So as an example, at 599 euro, they might buy a lower-end CPU so they can still assort graphics, that's just an example. In China, on the other hand, first we had a good quarter in China. We had a good quarter in every region pretty consistently. There again, our partners are wondering whether the back half of the year is going to hold up. But we're not seeing any evidence that would suggest we change the guidance that Thomas gave at this point, and we're still pretty optimistic that China is going to be a growth engine for us both in the back half of this year and, frankly, for many years to come.

I mean clearly, the tablet market is still in its relative infancy. There isn't really only one supplier out there, namely Apple, which ship in substantial volume. I guess speaking broadly, we view tablets as yet another form factor that allow people to access media and the Internet, and therefore, view it as market expansion. I think clearly in the same way that on the margin between mainstream notebooks and netbooks, there's some cannibalization or overlap, you'll see the same thing between netbooks and tablets. But on whole, I think tablets are a market expansion. Can we clarify one other thing? Ontario is not purely positioned in netbooks, it will cover netbooks and allow us a no-excuses means of doing so.

So we were capacity-constrained and therefore, had to make choices about which customers to serve to the utmost. And we generate a lot of notebook design wins over the past couple of quarters for major OEMs. And once those design wins are done, the designs actually have the GPUs designed down on the motherboard, and therefore, for our OEMs to ship, they need supply from AMD. Therefore, we leaned more towards the more OEM notebooks in terms of supply delivery. What that means is we shipped a lower mix than what the demand was because the notebook OEMs tend to use the lower two products in our for-products stat. And therefore, in effect, we didn't supply the AIB channel with all the volume we could have and, hence, didn't supply the upper two products in the stack to the degree we could have, which brought our mix lower in effect.",155,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

You asked about the strategy and I'll say that out strategy and every market has really been to bring to market-differentiated features and great value at every price point and that's certainly what we do with both the Opteron 6000 and 4000 series, whether it's more cores for the money, more memory support for the money, lower power or better performance-per-watt.

Our participants today are Derrick Meyer, our President and CEO; and Thomas Seifert, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number is (888)266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703)925-2533. The access code for both is 1485779. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening.
Before we start, I would like to highlight a few dates for you. Firstly, AMD will host its Financial Analyst Day on November 9 in its company's Sunnyvale offices in California. Also, Thomas Seifert, our CFO, will present at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on the 1st of December in Arizona. And lastly, our Fourth Quarter Earnings quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, the 10th of December.
Our Class A preferred share ownership in global foundries decreased from 79% as of the end of the second quarter to approximately 77% at the end of the third quarter as a result of additional capital calls that ATIC participated in and AMD did not. As a result, AMD's ownership on a fully diluted basis also decreased to approximately 26%.
Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures is included in our financial tables that accompany our earnings release, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com. Before we begin today's call, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation.
The semiconductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast, especially in light of the current state of the economy. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discussed the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in our most recent SEC filing, AMD's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 26, 2010.
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dirk.",392,-6.0,7.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7

AMD's third quarter performance was a good demonstration of our capacity to execute profitably in the context of our Fabless business model. Despite an environment of weaker than expected consumer demand, we improved operating income and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow sequentially by continuing to focus on growth in the largest margin pools in our industry.
In our Client business, we set an all-time record for notebook MPU shipments in the quarter. We saw sequential revenue gains in both our desktop and notebook processor product lines and an improved mix in our notebook offerings. Our VISION campaign continues to pay dividends across our Client business. As you may remember, VISION is designed to both differentiate AMD-based platforms and encourage sell up to more robust systems and mainstream retail. During the back-to-school period, our higher end VISION Premium and Ultimate platforms accounted for roughly half of VISION branded sales.
In our Server business, we were pleased to add IBM to the list of customers offering AMD Opteron 6000-based systems in the third quarter. AMD OEM server partners, led by HP and Dell, now offer more than 40 6000 series platforms and over 20 4000 series platforms as of the end of this past quarter.
In Graphics, we are about to complete our first full year of top to bottom DX11-enabled products. We're very pleased that Apple refreshed their Mac and Mac Pro desktop computers with our new Radeon GPU line, making Radeon GPUs the only graphics solution for all configurations for these products. 
To date, we have shipped over 25 million DX11 GPUs and we will be launching our second generation DX11 graphics offerings next week. Customer and partner enthusiasm continues to grow for the industry's first accelerated processing units, or what we call AMD Fusion family of APUs. Our first APU platforms, code name Brazos, and based on our Zacate and Ontario processors, are expected to bring many of the vivid, digital computing experience once reserved for high-end PCs to value and mainstream notebooks and desktops early next year. Brazos is ahead of schedule with customers' shipments on track for the fourth quarter and customers' systems available early next year. The AMD Fusion family is a game changer that will significantly expand our addressable market and is already changing the way the industry harnesses the power of the GPU. Production shipments of Llano, our 32-nanometer APUs, are planned to occurred in the first half of next year as well.
Meanwhile, industry anticipation of our new Bulldozer core is high and growing. We remain on track to ship Bulldozer-based server and desktop processors next year.
So to summarize, AMD's third quarter demonstrated a number of important and positive aspects of our plans for future success. Our new business model is solid as we showed improving margins and free cash flow in a softer than anticipated consumer PC environment.
Our VISION program is working as we emphasize graphics and end-user experience to differentiate our offerings and sell up to stack. And our AMD Fusion strategy is changing the industry as the revolutionary potential of vivid GPU accelerated applications is becoming a reality and the performance, value and power efficiency of AMD Fusion platforms, starting with Brazos, will be compelling.
We remain focused on growth inside the largest margin pools in our industry and our combination of intellectual property, customer relationships and design and marketing expertise gives us increasing confidence in our capacity to thrive, while developing that opportunity in the years ahead.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.",602,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2010",2010-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3259.0,79920.0,5738065.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Seifert,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Dirk. Third quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2010 and up 16% compared to the same period a year ago. We reported non-GAAP net income of $108 million in the third quarter of 2010. To calculate the non-GAAP net income, we excluded our share financial results and other equity accounting adjustments related to global foundries, a non-cash loss of $186 million. As usual, we also excluded the $16 million amortization of acquired intangible assets and a $24 million charge related to our repurchase of $800 million of our 6% notes in August.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.15 in the third quarter is calculated using 731 million shares. Third quarter non-GAAP operating income was $144 million, excluding the amortization charge I mentioned already. Gross margin for the quarter was 46%, up one percentage point compared to last quarter. The increase was mainly due to ongoing improvements in cost management and product mix.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $595 million. R&D was $359 million and SG&A was $236 million, which includes the marketing expense accrual impact of approximately $30 million as guided. Spending came in lower than our OpEx guidance of $630 million as we managed cost and expenses to align with the lower revenue in the quarter.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $245 million, up $1 million from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $91 million, resulting in $344 million of non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow year-to-date.
Now switching to the business segments. In the Computing Solutions segment, third quarter revenue was $1.23 billion. We recorded our second straight record quarter of mobile processor unit shipments, notebook processor ASPU was up sequential as AMD-based multi-core notebook platforms continue to penetrate higher-priced market segments. We saw a single-digit sequential gain in desktop processor revenue, primarily driven by general sales in China, the Americas and Europe. Opteron 6000 and 4000 series processors continue to gain traction, representing nearly half of server processor revenue in the quarter. Overall, Microprocessor ASP declined slightly compared to last quarter, but increased year-over-year.  Computing Solutions segment operating income was $164 million compared with $128 million in the second quarter of 2010.
In the Graphics segment, revenue for the quarter was $390 million, down 11% sequentially. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by lower mobile GPU shipments in the quarter, offset slightly by higher desktop graphics shipments in the AIB channel and double-digit revenue growth in workstation graphics. GPU ASP decreased sequentially due to greater mix of value segment products, but increased year-over-year. We reserve next generation GPUs in the quarter while in development, which we expect to sell in the fourth quarter. Operating income was $1 million compared with $33 million in the second quarter.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $1.73 billion. The decrease from the second quarter was primarily due to the repurchase of $800 million of our 6% convertible senior notes, offset by non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow and proceeds from our issuance of $500 million of 7.75% senior notes, which are due in 2020.
Long-term debt as of the end of the third quarter was down to $2.2 billion. This quarter, there's a new line item on the balance sheet related to our investment balance in global foundries called accumulated loss in excess of investment in global foundries. As of the third quarter, this balance turned negative and is therefore reflected on the liability side of the balance sheet. Based on the current structure of our wafer supply agreement and our ownership and government relationship, we are required to report our share of the equity losses in excess of the carrying amount of our investment balance. We will continue to assess the appropriateness of the current accounting treatment and make changes as needed based on circumstances.
Now let me turn to the outlook. The following statements concerning AMD are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially from current expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect revenue to be approximately flat as compared to the third quarter. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $610 million, which includes the remaining impact of marketing program expenses accrual we introduced in the second quarter. Recall that we now accrue marketing expenses earlier and closer in line with revenue development. The transition to the new marketing program is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.
Interest expenses are expected to be lower moving forward due to the re-profiling of our debt maturities, which reduced our approximate quarterly interest expense to $48 million. This results in a quarterly savings of about $8 million. We expect tax provision in the fourth quarter to be zero.
In conclusion, we continue to drive profitability and free cash flow generation as we execute our business model, focusing on growth and more profitable market opportunities, which we will look forward to discussing at our Financial Analyst Day in November 9.

I'm just trying to understand if the U.S. was weak and Western Europe was weak when you pre-announced. What kind of this drove the strength in notebook? And also if you can talk about how much of the mix is multi-core, quad-core notebooks and what sort of applications are compelling people to buy this kind of quad-core notebooks?",68,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

First of all, as we said in our pre-announcement, we saw, as compared to our beginning of quarter plans, relative weakness in North America and Western Europe consumer markets for notebooks. That's not to say the markets were experiencing negative growth on a PC consumption basis; simply PC consumption was weaker than the plans that we had and that our customers had. That said, emerging markets still represented a pretty good source of growth, in particular, China was still a strongly growing market in Q3, although the growth rate there was, again, lower than what we saw in the first half.
Your second question was pertaining to the mix of the AMD notebook platform and the fraction of our shipments that were triple and quad core. And we don't go into specifics on that other than to say, as I said in my opening remarks, we did see a relatively richer mix of triple and quad core Phenom VISION branded notebooks, which contributed to an increase in ASP. And our message there and motivation to get consumers to buy is really around the multimedia experience for these machines, particularly around video processing, the codex or threaded applications run better on a multi-core platform. So that's an example.",209,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

Last quarter, you mentioned that the uptick was a little disappointing. I just want to understand what progress you've made there? And then also, switching to graphics, if you can talk about how you see yourself with Fusion against Sandy Bridge and the key concern we have with the Graphics business is that the value added by products like Sandy Bridge could produce attach rate for graphics.

From my perspective, to the extent that the industry conversation is increasingly a conversation around Graphics, I think that's just awesome news for AMD since we've got the world's best graphics. And clearly, Graphics capability is increasingly important to consumers given what they do with these machines. The chat in the industry is, of course, that Sandy Bridge has improved graphics capability as compared to Intel's previous integrated graphics platforms. And while we expect that to be true, we also expect that, that capability is not going to be at the leading edge of capability that consumers demand. Example, the modern graphic standard these days is the Windows 7 DX11 standard, which is our understanding that the Sandy Bridge doesn't support. So the information that we have from our OEMs suggest that the OEMs are still interested in having a discrete graphics step up for their SKUs so that they can, in the market, sell a richer mix of systems.

I think as you look out over time and speculate as to how we and Intel use increasing effective silicon area from technology node to technology node, you might assume that more and more of that die area gets devoted to graphics which could, over time, eat into the low end of the discrete GPU market.

So the Magny-Cours core technology was launched, in effect, by us in March. The Opteron 6000 platforms from our OEMs really only came online at the end of Q2 and, of course, the Opteron 4000 platforms started showing up from our OEM partners, really, in the end of Q3. So in a lot of ways, we're a quarter in to seeing OEM platforms in the market. As Thomas said, we did see a pretty good ramp of Opteron 6000 platforms within our product line and that platform represents about half of our unit shipments in the current quarter so I think Opteron 6000 is ramping pretty well. The next opportunity, of course, is for us to ramp the Opteron 4000 platform, which is really only just becoming available and represented hardly any of our shipments in the current quarter. So now that we walk into Q4 with what I'll call the full arsenal, I think will be in a position to benefit from some share growth. That said, I would characterize the ramp so far as good, but not as good as we think we can do given the great value proposition of these platforms.",207,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

First, I think it's very clear that PC OEMs worldwide were really and the entire supply chain leaving Q2, was really thinking and planning for continued, I'll call it explosive growth of consumer PCs. And as the consumption -- the consumer level started to dampen a little bit into Q3, I think we saw a reaction across the supply chain and in bringing down a preventing inventory build. We don't think that process is complete as of the end of Q3, and in fact, will continue going into Q4. And that's why we're guiding flat on a sales in basis; though we still do see a positive sequential growth for PC consumption.

And I think there's probably three factors. And it's really hard to assign a number to the three. But first of all, with the benefit of hindsight, we probably saw on Q2 some customers double ordering from us. It was chatter in the industry that our foundry supplier for GPUs was short, our supplies were short, and therefore we probably saw OEMs trying to ensure that enough inventory to cover whatever demand scenario unfolded. And therefore, as demand weakened a little bit, we probably saw OEMs want to start to drain their notebook GPU inventory. So that's factor number one.
Factor number two, I think there's probably no question that some of our customers, in response to our real or perceived GPU shortages, created NVIDIA-capable notebook platforms just to protect their position and ability to ship. So it's possible we suffered a little bit of share loss in the quarter.
And finally, we saw at least anecdotally anecdotal evidence of OEMs de-featuring the discrete graphics option in response to the dramatic weakening of the euro that occurred 90 days ago. So the OEMs have price points committed in the market and therefore want to reduce their costs to protect their margins. So I think we saw a little bit of that in Europe for sure. Hard to assign percentages to each of those, but those are the three factors, I would say.",237,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Although low-cost mainstream notebooks, 14- to 15-inch display. It turns out a lot of our Brazos designed wins are really in the low end of the mainstream category so there, what we see is really a substitution of new technology in form factors and price points where we participate today. Though probably with components that are better suited to those price points, that is lower cost.
Netbooks represent the other big chunk of the design wins we see. Clearly, that's a category that we barely participating in. So that's all I'll say, some expansion for us. Last question was, what's the tablet factor? And I think clearly, the last quarter or two, the tablet has represented a disruption in the notebook market. If you ask five people in the industry, you'll get five different answers as to what degree. There's been cannibalization by tablets of either netbooks or notebooks. I personally think the answer is both given the pretty high price points of the iPad, there's probably some cannibalization even of mainstream notebooks. We still believe in the long term that tablet form factor is accretive to the market opportunity for companies like AMD. So hopefully, that answers your question.",236,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

We'll talk about this in greater length, Doug, in Financial Analyst Day. But in a nutshell, we expect the APUs to provide an opportunity for us to get more platform design wins and get a greater percentage of sellout based on the differentiated value proposition which comes, really, in two forms: Number one, superior graphics performance at better price points and better power points than is available from the competition, and as well as a little bit initially, increasingly over time, the ability of the APU when the GPU within the APU to pick up more of the workload for these media-centric user interface-centric applications, and therefore, be able to deliver a more vivid experience to the user. And we'll talk about some of the applications that we have in mind at the Financial Analyst Day.

From everything we understand today, which is this is still a pretty new market, a tablet would optimally have a maximum power dissipation of two to three watts, which is a little more than half of what I'll call it a panelist's netbook, would tolerate. Though I expect that customers will take components that were really designed with the netbook in mind and put them in tablets. And I think you'll even see AMD-based solutions in tablets in the next couple of years for that reason. In our overall strategy with respect to tablets is to first observe that that's a form factor that we think is going to grow over time and be important over time, and as I said, be accretive; and one which we'll devote specific R&D towards when the market is big enough to justify that investment. Frankly, we're still so small in the notebook market that given all the opportunities in front of us, it doesn't make sense for us to start taking turning R&D dollar spending towards the tablet market yet.

On the other side, we have been rather successful over the last two quarters, putting significant effort on increasing productivity and getting manufacturing costs down and we'll continue in that direction also this quarter.

So we're just a week or so away from launching our second generation of DX11 products. Those two effects, I think you have to keep in mind when you look at the profitability of their Graphic segment.
