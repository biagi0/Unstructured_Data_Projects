So in our fiscal Q1 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $7.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue grew 20% year-on-year to $5.9 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. 
Now enterprise demand grew very robustly from the trough we saw in Q1 last year as the recovery in enterprise IT spending continued to accelerate. Meanwhile, hyper clouds are upgrading their data centers, and service providers, telcos continue to deploy next-generation fiber-to-the-home. As expected, against the peak of a year ago, wireless grew single digits, and our core software business remains very stable and steady. On the supply front, lead times remain extended and unchanged as inventory of our products in the channel and in our customers remains lean. Our semiconductor backlog at the close of Q1 continue to grow double digits from that of the prior quarter. 
Let me now provide more color by end markets, starting with networking. Networking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 33% year-on-year and represented 32% of our semiconductor revenue. This strong growth was driven by deployment at scale of Tomahawk 4 and compute offload across several hyperscale customers. Hence, they upgrade and scale out their data centers. In enterprises, campus switching upgrades continue to accelerate. 
Let me talk about routing in this space. Investments in 5G backhaul by telco operators worldwide continue to drive strong growth in our Qumran family of products. More than this, the opportunity in our routing silicon has expanded into hyperscale in a very significant way, moving Ethernet into the back-end network of large-scale AI/ML clusters. 
In particular, I'm referring to the Arista 7800 AI platform, which scales Ethernet to connect many tens of thousands of CPUs and GPUs in hyperscale. This platform is built on our Jericho router. Our devices provide the most cost-effective fabric for AI/ML scaler with an end-to-end congestion-managed lossless network and highest efficiency load balancing across the link. 
Now in contrast to proprietary protocols such as Infiniband used typically in high-performance computing, we see low-latency Ethernet as the way forward for large-scale AI/ML networks as a widely adopted open architecture. Our unique ability to network these complex AI workloads in hyperscale is extending our customized training and inference SoC footprint at several cloud guys. In Q2, we expect networking to continue to be strong across the board and revenue growth to be in excess of 30% year-over-year. 
Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $801 million, and growth accelerated to 32% year-on-year, representing 14% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven in large part by the continuing recovery of enterprise IT spending, much of which was deployed towards upgrading compute servers. And most of these compute servers use either our MegaRAID or SAN for server storage connectivity. We are also benefiting from increased content as enterprises upgrade to next-generation storage connectivity solutions to support deployment of leading-edge servers. 
Beyond enterprise, with proliferation of video content in social media, we see our cloud customers increasingly adopting nearline hard disk drives as the primary storage of choice. And to manage these large arrays of hard disk drives, they deploy storage service and expanders, which utilize very much our next-generation storage connectivity, silicon and software, creating another driver for revenue growth. Interestingly, we are also a critical supplier of preamplifiers and rechannels in nearline hard disk drives, with our revenue growing at over 20% CAGR over the last 5 years. Our nearline revenue represented over 2/3 of our hard drive business this quarter. 
With the adoption of next-generation technology here, we're selling more boards than just silicon, resulting in much higher dollar content. This dynamic, coupled with continuing strong demand from both enterprise and hyperscale, is expected to accelerate Q2 server storage connectivity revenue to over 55% year-on-year. 
Now moving on to broadband. Revenue of $911 million grew 23% year-on-year and represented 16% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven largely by increased deployment of next-generation PON and DOCSIS, our cable modem, with high attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6E in home gateways. Examples of this abound. Last quarter, Charter announced trials of DOCSIS 4.0 running at speeds of 8.5 gigabit downstream and 6 gigabit upstream, both in CPE and remote node. Comcast started deployment of their WiFi 6E DOCSIS 3.1 gateway. And AT&T announced a multi-gig PON service on their gateways. All of this are using Broadcom SoCs. 
We remain the market leader in delivering WiFi 6 and 6E chips to leading phones as well as routers, enterprise access points and carrier gateways. Through the first quarter of 2022, we have cumulatively shipped over 1 billion WiFi 6 and 6E radios in just around 3 years since our launch. Our OEM customers and carrier partners are now ramping WiFi 6E, the current generation of WiFi making use of the 6 gigahertz band, which has increasingly been made available for unlicensed access across the globe. 
And as we look ahead, we are the industry leader heavily investing in WiFi 7 as the strategic complement to 10G PON and cable modem. We see -- both broadband. We see this as the next step in broadband development and deployment globally. In the U.S. alone, the pending infrastructure access to site $65 billion over the next 5 years to connect more homes to high-speed broadband. Across the world, the same is happening as next-generation wide broadband is seen as the better alternative to 5G for home connectivity. As far as Q2 is concerned, we expect our broadband business to continue to grow 20% year-on-year. 
Moving on to wireless. Q1 revenue of $2 billion represented 34% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from our North American customer for our products continued to be strong during the quarter, driving wireless revenue up 10% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year from the peak quarter in fiscal '21. As expected in Q2, wireless revenue will be seasonally down, about mid-teens quarter-on-quarter, but will still be up mid-single digits from a year ago. 
Finally, industrial revenue of $243 million represented approximately 4% of Q1 semiconductor revenue. Q1 resales of $239 million grew 37% year-over-year driven by robust demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, factory automation and health care. Reflecting such strong resales, our inventory in the channel remain around 1 month, and we expect resales to continue to be strong in Q2. 
Accordingly, in summary, Q1 semiconductor solution revenue was up 20% year-on-year. Q2, we expect semiconductor revenue to accelerate to 25% year-on-year. 
Turning to software. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 24% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 6% year-on-year. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 121% over expiring contracts, while in our strategic accounts, we averaged 136%. Within these strategic accounts, $656 million represented renewals on expiring contracts, of which $164 million represented cross-selling, including PLAs, of our portfolio products to the same customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. 
Okay. ARR, annual recurring revenue, at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. In Q2, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-upon-year. In summary, in Q1, semiconductor revenue grew a strong 20%. In fact, excluding wireless, it grew -- actually grew over 30%. Combined with our stable software business, consolidated revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $7.7 billion. 
Now turning to Q2 guidance. We expect semiconductor revenue growth will accelerate to 25% year-upon-year. And excluding wireless, it will be 35% year-on-year. Layering on our stable software business, we expect Q2 consolidated revenue growth of 20% year-on-year to $7.9 billion. 
And before I turn this call over to Kirsten, I just want to add, Broadcom recently published its second annual ESG report available on the company's corporate citizenship site, which discusses the company's ESG initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognize the company's responsibility to have a positive impact on our communities. Through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, we remain very committed to this mission. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",1356,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Revenue was $7.7 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 227 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, driven by investment in research and development. Operating income for the quarter was $4.7 billion and was up 23% from a year ago. Operating margin was 60% of revenue, up approximately 362 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $136 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $5.9 billion and represented 76% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 20% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 347 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. 
Operating expenses were $817 million in Q1, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $725 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins increased to 57%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 20%, operating profit grew 31%. 
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 24% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 71 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 71% in Q1, and operating profit grew 7%. 
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.4 billion, representing 44% of revenue. We spent $101 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 35 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.5 billion, up 17% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs. Our hardware backlog at the end of the quarter was over $25 billion compared to $22 billion the preceding quarter. And our lead times remain steady at 50 weeks. Our software backlog continued to grow as well and ended the quarter at over $15 billion. As a point of reference, software backlog was $13 billion a year ago. 
We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $300 million is short term. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.8 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.7 billion in common stock and eliminated $375 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 5 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was 446 million. 
Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $7.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 62.5% of projected revenue. Note that we expect Q2 non-GAAP diluted share count to be 442 million. This excludes the potential impact of any share repurchases completed in the second quarter.

Hock, given your backlog and extended lead times, you've got pretty good visibility into this year. Your end markets are strong, right? Cloud and hyperscale. CapEx spending is looking to grow about 30%. You're driving the 200 and 400 gig networking upgrade cycle. Enterprise spending is still expanding. As you mentioned, Broadcom continues strong, whether it's DOCSIS, WiFi, fiber upgrades. 
And then on your compute acceleration, ASIC pipeline, you've got Google, Facebook, Microsoft, all of these guys ramping. So it seems like the demand, your product leadership, seasonality can sustain a sort of low to mid-20% plus-type year-over-year revenue growth profile through this year. 
So I guess the question for you is do you have line of sight and confidence on sustaining this type of growth through the year? And then more importantly, do you have the supply commitments to support this type of growth?",152,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then the more important question is that there is a perception that semiconductor companies are benefiting abnormally because of a pricing lever because of the tight supply conditions. And as the foundry capacity eases, that your costs will go down and the pricing advantage will disappear. 
And I was hoping you could give us some more color, how much of a role is pricing playing in the expected sales growth this year on a like-to-like basis versus what you saw last year?",98,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

And I mean -- and true, the rail demand that we're seeing underlying -- if you talk about underlying trend that is sustainable, at least in this upcycle, you're right, it's -- while we're showing 30% in networking, in server storage, a part of it is driven by ASP increases simply because we are passing on our material cost increases, wafer, substrates, assembly to our customers, inevitably. But it's much less than you probably think it is. What is really sustainable is what Harlan said in the previous question. We think the trend demand increase is more like closer to 20% year-on-year than what perhaps in dollar terms you're represented. 
And how long would it last? Who knows? It's hard for me to figure out because I've been wrong so many times. And this is now going on into the almost -- '22 is done and is strong. We're now booking, given our lead times I indicated, in '23. And '23, I think, will be -- at least the first half of '23, we'll still be pretty close to the same. And it's the latter part of '23 and '24 that we have to figure out whether there's enough supply that will start coming in to basically address what is today and what we're seeing an extremely strong demand environment, whether it's from enterprise, telcos and service providers and hyperscale.

And this is amid cost increases and everything else. So I mean how do we think about like the limited -- I know you always talked about margins kind of going up 100 basis points a year, and they seem to be doing even better than that. 
Do we just keep modeling them going up from here? Or do you think they take a pause? Are there are any other drivers like into the back of this year, mix or anything else, that would sit on that? Just how do we think about it just given the levels that they're sitting at right now?",150,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

You get that. Now Kirsten just indicated, we did better than that in semiconductor. And I guess -- and the reason why we did better than that this season, so to speak, if you come back to my remarks, there's a lot of deployment -- launch and deployment of new-generation products that I mentioned. 
We're talking about, in networking, Tomahawk 4, and much more. Trident 4, which is more towards some data centers that use in enterprises. Tomahawk 4, used in hyper cloud, that new generation. Then we talk about Jericho being deployed -- the latest Jericho being deployed in the backside networks of machine learning, AI, GPU interconnectivity. That's a whole new application. Then we talk -- in service storage, I've talked about a whole slew of new-generation solutions, which we put in place towards -- basically, for new generation, leading-edge servers out there from the guys who do those servers. And with those new generation, we get that better margin. 
So in all, I guess additional input I put in is a lot more new-generation products coming out now, happen to be in '22. We're seeing happen. And of course, we are, in this environment, thankfully, able to pass on our cost increases to supply -- to customers. And that all adds up to a fairly decent gross margin set of results.

And I know you're less consumer focused than most. And so maybe inventory builds are less relevant in some of these infrastructure markets. 
But I'm wondering if you could give us your perspective on -- or at least what you guys try to do to scrub the backlog to make sure it's good demand. And if you think it's good demand, I'm kind of curious, you've always had a very realistic view of what the long-term growth rate for your semi should be -- semi business should be. Is that beginning to change? And like many of your peers who have put up a higher kind of new CAGR, are you willing to go there right now?",163,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7
25016048.0,"Broadcom Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2022",2022-03-03,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3358.0,2516505.0,95375819.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,24,"Let's answer the first question first, and let me go to the last one and the best at the end. 
But on the first part, yes, as I've stated in previous earnings calls, and I'm more than happy to reiterate it here, which is we are very, very concerned, obviously, that you could -- we could easily build up inventory in various parts of our demand environment, just because we ship according to what customer sending in orders as their customer requested. So we don't -- we actually spend a huge amount of bandwidth of our operations and salespeople in this environment to make sure we get products to any particular customer just when they need it. Not any earlier and hopefully not too late either because we like to address customer -- real need in that regard. 
But what's very, very important to us is not to ship excessively. And the last part -- inventory, whether it's in the customer inventory, in distribution, the nice thing about our business in semiconductor is this. 75% of our revenue comes from just about 100 customers, and they're direct. The last 25% go through distribution. 75% direct to 100 customers. We have enough salespeople. We have enough visibility on these customers to know exactly, pretty closely, we'd like to think, what they need and ship to what exactly they need. And when we do all that, I said it before in last earnings call, true end demand growth -- true growth as we have been seeing in '21 was about 2% year-on-year improvement. 
Now we now take on the fact that material costs have gone up in '22. So there's an addition beyond 20%. I still believe it's about 20%, in response to earlier -- in this environment because the last upcycle we saw in 2017, it was 20% year-on-year improvement. It wasn't stronger than that. And by the way, we sell mostly those big core system on a chip into any platform that our customer builds and sells out. We do -- and generally, we get very good visibility. If we were to sell more of the peripheral chips, the secondary chips, that adds up to the total platform. And that cause a fraction of what our system on a chip cost. Then perhaps you will not have that visibility, and we believe there are a lot of pockets of those inventory in the wrong places because of unbalanced chipsets sitting out there. 
But if you -- for example, if you're building a data center and you need 1,000 Tomahawk 4s, believe me, you will not buy more than 1,050 Tomahawk 4s. But if you're buying voltage regulator, you'll probably buy 2,000, 3,000 of those voltage regulators just in case. And that's the difference in what we're seeing. So we think we get a good sense of what's out there. And the kicker here is the price increase that was passed on because of wafer cost and substrate cost increases, which makes it go over perhaps what we think is a sustainable level. 
Now to answer your longer-term question, no. I don't think on a long term, say, next 10 years, would the CAGR change? I think people say that CAGR change, frankly, are probably dreaming because there's no evidence on our side to show why this industry, which is relatively mature semiconductor industry, should suddenly spiral into a different trend growth rate. We have seen in the last 10 years compounded roughly 5% annual growth rate. And there's nothing to indicate, frankly, why you would not be that way for the next long term, 10 years. Now it won't be 5% every year. Obviously, we're not at 5% this year. But on the long term, I still think that trend has not changed.",634,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Well, really, in last quarter, we are very clear about our capital allocation plan, at least for 2022, and which is, frankly, at -- we're still looking for acquisitions. We've just been very, very -- as we usually do, being very thoughtful and selective about the assets we would acquire. But very much so, we're still in the market to look for good -- great assets to acquire, and we have the capacity to handle it. 
And in the meantime, given 2 years, '20 and '22, when we haven't done anything on acquisitions and have been earning and generating lots of cash, we have taken on -- other than paying dividends and maintaining the policy on dividends that we have outlined for the long term, we have decided for fiscal '22 -- or actually, calendar '22 to put out that buyback program of $10 billion. We spent $2.7 billion of it so far, and we have probably most of the year to go. And we'll probably use -- we will likely use all of it up evenly over the next 9 months of the remaining year.

Let me paraphrase your question the way I would probably be able to answer it and see if it's the right thing. What you're saying is, see, we have a product division that does ASIC custom chips, essentially, for usually large customers. And that's a good-sized business for us. And a big part of that business, to address what you're saying here, is address has been used is now currently -- though not in the past, but more recently in the last few years, it was the hyperscale players who are starting to develop -- wanting to develop their customized and dedicated accelerators for specific functions and workloads mostly related to, for instance, machine learning, AI. 
Also to do with video transcoding and also gradually increasing virtualization and orchestration of data centers. All those have customized silicon accelerators to enable these hyper cloud guys to run their workloads better and more effectively. I believe that was your question.

And we are not only selling one product but selling multiple products, which are very strategic to us and I believe also very important and strategic to them, which will -- which is what makes a partnership very sustaining. 
I see this as a very long-term sustaining partnership in the sense of the products we do develop, we collectively call wireless, because it goes into mobile -- a lot of mobile devices. Though not entirely, but most of it goes into phones. It goes into wearables. It goes into pads or tablets. And it goes into -- not so mobile, but many of them are, into even notebooks. 
It goes into all these stuff, and we sell -- we develop and provide something like 1/2 -- about 5 different critical engine technology products to this same customer. So it is -- it has, over 10 years now, developed into an extremely sustainable and strategic relationship. Clearly, from our side, yes.

Thanks for that answer, Hock, but I want to step back and maybe look at the longer term on this. 
You -- when you bought Brocade, it kind of shifted the narrative from we don't really need revenue growth. We're mostly looking for cash flow and high margins, which worked out very well. In wireless, you get a little bit different animal with Samsung on the way out because they shifted their phone strategy to more cost-centric and less performance-wise. It made sense for Broadcom nor to participate there. And your large customer is doing fine. It looks like they will be for years. 
But as we've already seen on the high end, 5G, the growth in revenue -- growth in content is slowing. And by all measures, it will likely stagnate in the next 3 to 4 years. In that kind of environment, and especially if you're not doing any custom designs anymore, given -- it's just a given that revenue may not grow. 
If margins are affected, what do you do with it? I mean you've not ever embraced the business where both revenue is flat to down and margins are in decline. I think the question a lot of folks have is, what could you possibly do? It's so large and there are so few suitors for it. It's kind of puzzling in 3 years or 4 years what the strategy would be with wireless. Maybe you could help shed a light on that.",261,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

Here, it is. All our businesses -- I just want to remind you, in our view -- as I said, in the view of all semiconductor segments itself, it's not a high-growth business. You guys like to think -- because probably there are a few companies out there who are trying to grow in a business that doesn't grow. 5% is what it is. 
And so it's a business that does grow, but in dollar terms, overall, mid-single digits. I call it a slow-growth industry. Within it, however, it still evolves new generation of products constantly. That's the unusual, unique thing about semiconductors. It keeps evolving. Not disruptive, much as people like to say they are disruptive. My view is evolutionary. But that evolutionary creates new opportunities for basically selling a better product, a more valuable product to the same customer for the similar application, which the customer can then monetize back on their own. And that's really all it is. And what we are doing here in wireless is no different. 
And there is something also very interesting. Every product we sell in wireless is, in fact, a nonstandard product. It is customized. It is customized for the needs -- for the unique needs and particular requirements of that particular customer. That's what makes us so successful, and that's what makes the partnership so sustainable. 
We develop technology in the form of products that we do, whether it's an RF, with FBAR, front-end module or whether it's pure silicon with some SDK -- a lot of SDK software, where some unique performance mixed signal, analog product. All of which we do to this customer, we do it to meet their particular requirements which allow their products to be at a level that's very differentiated from their own space -- in the competitive space they are in. And that's what makes it very unique, and that's what makes this thing keep going. 
But we're not looking for -- in any end market we are in, in any product line we are in, for high growth. High growth in semiconductor comes in spurts and do not last. If anybody tells you otherwise, please don't believe it because it has never happened.",376,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

We feel somewhat surreal here with what I'm about to report and go through in my screen. Let me start by saying while consumer IT hardware spending has been reported to be weak, very weak, from our vantage point infrastructure spend is still very much holding. In our fiscal Q3 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.5 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 32% year-on-year to $6.6 billion. And infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to be $1.8 billion.
In Q3, our semiconductor business was robust, with solid contributions from all our end markets. Cloud and service provider growth remained strong and, in Q4, is actually expected to accelerate year-on-year driven by data center build-outs and infrastructure upgrades. Year-on-year, enterprise continued to grow for the sixth consecutive quarter on campus deployments and data center refreshes. 
Looking at Q4, we expect enterprise to continue to grow double-digit percent year-over-year. 
Meanwhile, in wireless, which is very much tied to our large North American handphone OEM, it was solid in Q3 and is expected to grow in Q4 as we ramp the new platform. 
Now let me provide more color by end market. Starting with networking. Networking revenue was a record $2.3 billion and was up 30% year-on-year, representing 35% of our semiconductor revenue. As both cloud and enterprise data centers refresh, they continue to increase adoption of our Tomahawk, Trident and Jericho switching silicon platforms. Importantly, we expect this trend to continue. 
In mid-August, Broadcom announced the Tomahawk 5 switch series, providing 51.2 terabit per second of Ethernet switching capacity in the single monolithic device, double the bandwidth of any other switch silicon available in the market today. We also announced the industry first silicon photonics co-package with the Tomahawk, which will enable a new benchmark for low power and extend our leadership and innovation in hyperscale data centers. Networking remains strong given these drivers. And in Q4, we expect this segment to be up 30% year-over-year. 
Next, server storage connectivity revenue was a record $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor sales as growth of 70% year-on-year exceeded our expectations. A primary driver remains the growth of our next-generation server storage connectivity where we benefited from high content and continued deployment of servers and storage in both cloud and enterprises. We anticipate this strong trend to actually continue. And in Q4, we expect server storage connectivity revenue to grow about 45% year-on-year. 
Moving on to broadband. Revenue of $1.1 billion grew 20% year-on-year, in line with our expectations and represented 17% of semiconductor sales. This steady growth was driven by major service provider continuing to deploy next-generation broadband fiber-to-the-home globally with high attach rates of WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E. 
We are the industry leader in investing in the next-generation WiFi 7 and unlocking amazing wireless experiences across home gateways, enterprise access points and smartphones. And we expect first deployments to occur in the second half 2023. In Q4, we expect our broadband business to grow above 20% year-on-year. 
Finally -- next, moving to wireless. Q3 revenue of $1.6 billion represented 25% of our revenue in semiconductors. Sustained demand from our North American customer drove wireless revenue up 14% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. In Q4, we expect wireless revenues to be seasonally up 20% sequentially and grow 10% year-on-year. 
Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $244 million declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting weakness in China, partially offset by continued strength in the U.S. and Europe. Nonetheless, for Q4, we forecast industrial resales to rebound to high single-digit growth year-on-year. 
In summary, Q3 semiconductor solution revenues was up 32% year-on-year. In Q4, we expect semiconductor revenue to remain strong at 25% year-on-year. Now putting this in perspective and if we look at it on a sequential basis, Q3 grew 6% as did Q2, and Q4 will grow another 6% largely driven by the seasonality of wireless. 
Turning to software. In Q3, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 128% over expiring contracts. And for strategic accounts, we averaged 140%. Within these strategic accounts, annual bookings of $461 million include $136 million of cross-selling of our portfolio products to these call customers. Now 95% of our renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. 
And just to put all this in context, over the past 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 122% over expiring contracts. And within strategic accounts, we average -- we actually average 137%. Because of these trends, our ARR and the indicator of forward software revenue at the end of Q3 was $5.5 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. And in Q4, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-over-year. 
In summary, therefore, we're guiding consolidated Q4 revenue of $8.9 billion, up 20% year-on-year or 5% sequentially. 
Now, before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We're making good progress with our various regulatory filings around the world. We have an excellent team focused on these efforts, and we are moving forward as very much as expected in this regard. We continue to expect the transaction to be completed in Broadcom's fiscal year 2023. 
We remain excited about our acquisition of VMware and continue to be impressed by the world-class engineering talent as well as strong customer and channel partnerships. We have tremendous respect for what VMware has built. And together, we will enable enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing the most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",963,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $8.5 billion for the quarter, up 25% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year, driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $5.2 billion and was 32% from a year ago -- was up 32% from a year ago. Operating margin was 61% of revenue, up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.4 billion or 63.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $129 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $6.6 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 32% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 72%, up 220 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $853 million in Q3, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $765 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q3 semiconductor operating margins increased to 59%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 32%, operating profit grew 44%. 
Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 22% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter and were stable year-over-year. Operating expenses were $375 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 70% in Q3, and operating profit grew 5%. 
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.3 billion, representing 51% of revenue. We spent $116 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 29 days in the third quarter compared to 30 days a year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, up 10% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs and the expected sequential revenue ramp. We ended the third quarter with $10 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $304 million is short term. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.7 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock and eliminated $292 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 3.2 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q3 was 436 million. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 435 million, which excludes the potential impact of any share repurchases completed in the fourth quarter. We have not repurchased any of our shares since we announced the pending acquisition of VMware as repurchases are subject to regulatory rules. We maintain our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, including buybacks, as soon as we can under SEC rules. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $8.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63% of projected revenue.

Obviously, you have a limited exposure on the consumer side of things. But in the networking broadband server, the enterprise and cloud businesses in general, are you seeing any changes?

The short answer is no. And by that -- this is what I mean and this is something I've been talking about -- we've been talking about in the earnings call and in sell-side analyst calls about true demand. What we are measuring, what we are reporting revenues is in our minds, and we've been looking at it that way the past 8 quarters, particularly, as we told you. We scrap to our backlog thoughtfully, carefully before we deliver products to customers, end users, is that, that's true end demand. 
And what we reported to you today, and you see the numbers that we're presenting and the strength of the numbers, if I could say so myself, it's true end demand what we're seeing with respect to the various end markets and the infrastructure products we sell to -- into those end markets. That's as far as we can scrap through true end demand. 
Now we also have a ton of backlog, and our lead time continues unchanged at 50 weeks. Now whether bookings that are placed today are running at somewhat different thoughts, different rates, it's more a function of perception, psychology of customers trying to think 1 year out. But as far as what we reported in Q3 and expect to see in Q4, we believe to be true end -- we believe and we're pretty clear about that to be true end demand and consumption by our customers.",243,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Hock, I just wanted to clarify if any of your products are directly or indirectly exposed to any China restrictions that have been in the press over the last handful of days.

Is that still a good framework to use as we are looking out at the next year or so? Or if you could give us maybe by end market, hyperscaler versus enterprise versus telco or consumer, which markets just conceptually you would expect to kind of grow better or slower than that kind of broad growth rate for the company?",132,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

No, we have not been notified. None of our products are affected by any action that have occurred over the last week or a few days regarding restriction on shipments of China. We have not been affected, period. And we do not expect to be. Okay. 
Now in terms of what you're saying, now that calls for some degree of speculation, but it's more than that. I've always said the long-term sustainable demand in the semiconductor space is a mid-single-digit compounded growth rate, 5%, thereabout maybe 6%, 5%, 6%. And I still believe that no matter what all the -- I mean [ rumors ] that marketing [ rumors ] that has occurred over the past 12 months. It always has been. And I think we will revert to that norm, eventually. 
Now obviously, it's very interesting what we're seeing because it depends on when you start that compounded growth because 5% is what I said to be a long-term growth rate. In the short term in this industry, and we've all experienced these cycles, you could have higher than 5% at the up cycle and clearly much lower in the down cycles to average that 5%. 
And -- but your point is at some point, we'll have to get back to the norm. And I believe we will, not in this year, '22. The rate '22 is growing. Now we -- assuming our forecast Q4 comes to play. We're talking about semiconductor growth rate for us of around 25% year-on-year. And that's way above the 5% norm. So at some point, yes, things will turn around and revert back to that norm.

I'd like to believe it's emerging, and it's a very emerging business.

I said that before in the previous earnings -- a couple of earnings calls. It is worthwhile for me to repeat. We have been able to raise prices, obviously, over the last past 12 months, but only because our material cost has gone up. And so we're talking -- if we're talking percentages, not absolute dollars, if our cost -- material cost -- cost of goods sold, so expect increase 10% in order to keep our margin in percentage terms from being diluted with the raise of price no less than 10%. And just doing that, it's just staying -- it's just keeping the gross margin in percentage term staying neutral. So I would say price increases has very little impact on our margin improvement. 
What is -- what has enabled our margins to accelerate or improve, as I said in the last earnings call, is in this environment of -- in some degree in the last couple of years -- last 12 months, in particular, of basically a pent-up level of spending, particularly in enterprise, somewhat in cloud as well and broadband as well, is the adoption of new next-generation products and technology. And that always enhances, as I've said that before, our gross margin. And it's just -- it's the basic fundamental of this semiconductor cycle. New generation of products improves, expands our gross margin. And the accelerated adoption is what expands this gross margin.

It's -- on the wireless business, if I could try to clarify, when we take any particular 3-month period like Q3 and going to be Q4 now and take a snapshot of it and compare it to the same period of time a year ago, it never quite replicate itself in all matters. In other words, it's not -- there's no normalization. So it could be 20%. It could be 25%. It could even be 30% changes. And I consider that all kind of in the same ballpark, simply because all it takes is a slippage of a couple of weeks in shipments, in products being taken to make that particular difference. So I would not put too much thinking behind that it's 20% whereas it might have been closer to 30% 2 years ago or a year ago in the same period, if you don't mind, simply because nothing comes up so as to be sold planned year-over-year. It changes. 
But in terms of overall volume, we do not see that much units dramatically different from a year ago. It's really the content increase that might give us the lift year upon year. And even on a lift year-on-year -- quarter -- when you compare to any 3-month period, take it with a grain of salt that some volume might have shifted forward and not be within the these 3 months.

Hock, I wanted to ask a quick one and then a main question. There's been a lot of concerning sort of news coming out of China reported by company. So I was curious, first of all, how much exposure do you have to China? 
And then for my main question, it's a question of sustainability. Somebody asked about revenues, but I wanted to ask about gross margins. You've got 90% odd margins in software that I think is the norm, but then you've got 72% gross margins in semis, which are sort of honestly abnormal compared to other companies. So when you think of sustainability of that semi business up in the 70s, what do you think are some of the drivers that keep it up there for you guys longer term?",149,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Let me answer the second question first since it's a little more complex. But it isn't. Our semiconductor gross margin, by the way, we talk about sustainability, I would say it keeps expanding. It doesn't stay still, as you probably know. If you look back to 5 years ago, we were more like 60% -- in the mid-60s or low 60s gross margin. Today, it's now over 70%. And it's simply the case that -- and that's the beauty of the semiconductor technology business. You always have new generation of products, whether it's wireless, running -- creating a generation every 12 to 24 months, whether it's switching, that's every 2, 3 years, all storage, every for 5 years. And every time you put in a new generation, you expand your margin because you're delivering more value, you're delivering much more value usually, and you are able to extract from the higher value a higher price and profitability. And that's the beauty of this industry. 
So as we keep coming out with new generations, the margins of our portfolio keeps expanding. So we're now at the 70s. And you ask where will we be 5 years from now in this phenomena of constantly updating to next-generation products, I will see this gross margin expansion continuing. And empirically -- don't ask me for any mathematical formula behind -- physics behind it. But empirically, given our portfolio of about 16 semiconductor franchises, we have averaged close to 50 to 100 basis points expansion year after year. And that's pretty good, and we see that trend continuing. 
And as I responded to an earlier question, over the last 2 years, we've -- the rebound you might almost say -- feel by perhaps changes in IT spending based on, I guess, lockdowns, based on behavioral changes with COVID-19, we've seen accelerated adoption of next-generation products in many of our franchises. So we have seen some level of accelerated expansion of our semiconductor gross margin. But things will revert back, I believe, to a more normalized 50 to 100 basis point expansion once all this excitement starts cooling off a bit, but we still see the sustainable expansion of our semiconductor gross margin. 
Software, you're right, we cannot stick there at 90%, and we're not going anywhere with it. But this -- but semiconductor will continue to expand. 
And last -- your first question, China, that's about 13% of our semiconductor revenue. That's our exposure to China.",412,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Well, in terms of a breakdown, you're basically asking me -- asking us on our semiconductor revenues, what's our breakdown of our revenues? We would classify in 3 ways, 3 groups, non-end markets, but groups. It cuts across all our end markets, except probably wireless. Wireless is all consumer. And so no surprise, our consumer business within semiconductor represents about 23% -- just less than 25% of our revenues, just over -- between 20% to 25% is the best description. And on the balance, which could be anywhere from 75% to almost 80% is almost split evenly between enterprise, traditional enterprise, as we call it, and the final grouping we call as service providers, which is really to the hyperscale guys and telcos, which we consider to be service provider. And that's -- and so between traditional enterprise and telcos, hyperscale, that's evenly split. Consumer, 20% to 25%. 
As far as the regulator process through VMware, -- right now, I would say, when you think of it, and we're thinking of it across several -- a few -- a couple of jurisdictions. And we're moving -- it's making good progress. And just to reiterate, we fully expect to close on this within fiscal '23.",205,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Hock, just based on the sequential revenue growth that you've been marking over the past couple of quarters, your guidance for the October quarter, it's pretty clear that supply continues to be kind of the key determinant of your revenue growth. Based on indications from your foundry supplier and key substrate suppliers, from a modeling perspective, should we expect mid-single-digit growth to be kind of the normal cadence over the next few or several quarters? Or could there be a point in time where your rate of growth starts to accelerate given easing in some of the other end markets?",113,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So let me try to answer that and which is this. We've always said, and we continue to say, it's not really supply that constrains our revenue. We look at -- as we said, we scrub through and trying to really get as closely as we can to what our customers truly need to consume. And we ship according to that. And that's as basic as all that. So if you look at it that way, supply is not a true constraint. It's demand, a real demand and -- getting to the real demand. 
Just like October quarter Q4, you see us bump up to 8.9 from 8.4, 8.5. Believe me, this is all largely driven by the seasonal ramp of our North American handset manufacturer. That's really what drives that last increase. So it's -- we're very, very tied to end consumption of products, and it's not really all about -- much about supply. 
And I've said that for the last 4, 5 quarters, and we're still in that same behavior mode.",181,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So are you going to have, like, in-parallel products with co-packaged optics and traditional products that are meant to be used with regular optics in parallel in the next few years? And then in terms of market adoption, can you give us a sense of how material co-package optics is going to become maybe in the next 3, 4, 5 years?

Let me try to again talk through this. Basically, your question is about how is -- I mean we constantly come out across all our product franchises in -- especially in semis new generation of products. And they're pretty cool, even though I say it myself. And adoption is never as quickly as we all like it to be. It tends to be much slower than we think. So for instance, take switching Tomahawks, data -- top of the rank data center switching. I'm still selling Tomahawk 1, 2, Tomahawk 3, which was the generation before the current generation. And now we are selling Tomahawk 4. And just to give you a sense, Tomahawk 4 as a percent of my total Tomahawk volume, as I would estimate to be less than 30% in total. So you can see they coexist, and that tends to happen. 
So by the time we launch Tomahawk 5 2 years from now, we're probably maybe be getting our Tomahawk 1 to the point where it becomes de minimis. So there is this constant coexistence of multiple generations and applies, by the way, to every product we have, server storage where we have 2, 3 -- we have 3 generations running simultaneously because it's the way the world adopts new technology. And we will keep having a mix, which is probably why when you boil down to it at the end of the day, it's -- we have -- there's no hockey stick in any product adoption. 
There's no such thing as winners take all, whether it's part of a new product, or for that matter, a new player. There is always coexistence, a shared volume and a shared mix of technologies. And we see that very clearly across. 
Now consumer perhaps is less -- is more of a hockey stick. And even then, we see month 2 or 3 generations of our North American OEM running simultaneously. But of course, it's more of a hockey stick, I believe, than our infrastructure products. 
Infrastructure takes a while and we would have -- not very uncommon to have 3 generation running simultaneously. And that means any expansion of gross margin coming back where it drains down to because it's a reflection of product mix of -- in terms of product generation. That's why our gross margin grows much more steadily, but more -- not as rapidly as we would like to, but it's okay because it gets more sustainable. And as each year passes and the newer generation products get adopted more in a measured manner, our gross margin grows that 50 to 100 basis points each particular year that passes. I hope that answers your question.",451,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Before I provide color on our Q4 results, let me put in perspective what we achieved in fiscal year '22. For the year, I'm pleased to report that consolidated revenue hit a record of $33.2 billion, growing 21% year-on-year, yet another year of double-digit organic growth. This growth was driven by our strong partnerships with customers and increased R&D investments, which enable accelerated adoption of our next-generation technologies. With our robust business model, we grew our fiscal 2022 operating profit by 28% year-on-year and our free cash flow per share by 25% year-upon-year. 
Now to discuss details of our fiscal Q4. In our fiscal Q4 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.9 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 26% year-on-year to $7.1 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 4% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. 
In Q4, our semiconductor business continued to perform well across hyperscale, service providers and enterprise. On top of this, wireless grew sequentially as we ramp up the new platform and our North American customer. 
In reporting these results, I'd like to emphasize, we demonstrate our continued discipline in shipping our strong backlog only as and when needed by our end customers. So in contrast to weak consumer electronics spending today and despite concerns of a global recession, we believe overall infrastructure spending remains strong, and we continue to experience sustained demand in most of our end markets, and this is what we continue to see in Q1. So let me expand on this. 
Starting with networking. Networking revenue was a record $2.5 billion and was up 30% year-on-year, representing 35% of our semiconductor revenue. We see strong growth from deployment of [ cama 4 ] for data center switching at hyperscale customers. And we see upgrades of edge and core routing networks with our next-generation Jericho portfolio at cloud and service providers. And at multiple cloud customers, we continue to lead in delivering custom solutions for compute offload accelerators and actually surpassed the $2 billion month in revenues in fiscal '22. Looking into Q1, we do expect networking revenue to be strong and grow about 20% year-over-year. 
Next, our storage connectivity revenue was a record $1.2 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and up 50% year-on-year. As we have mentioned in previous earnings call, we are benefiting here from substantial content increases as both cloud and enterprise customers adopt our next-generation migrate and storage adapters. This trend will continue in Q1, and we expect server storage connectivity revenue to grow above 50% year-on-year. 
Moving on to broadband. Revenue of $1 billion grew 20% year-on-year and represented 15% of semiconductor revenue. Our broadband business is benefiting from ongoing multiyear deployments by North American and European service providers of 10-gigabit PON and DOCSIS 3.1 We've embedded WiFi 6 and 6E. In Q1, we expect the secular drivers behind broadband to continue and our business to be strong at about 30% year-on-year growth. 
Moving on to wireless. Q4 revenue of $2.1 billion represented 29% of semiconductor revenue with the 13% year-on-year increase coming largely from higher content. And in Q1, we expect wireless revenue to be sequentially flat and up low single digits year-on-year. 
Finally, Q4 industrial resale of $234 million grew 1% year-over-year as softness in China mostly offset the strength in North American and European automotive. In Q1, we forecast industrial resales to continue the trend of low single-digit percent growth year-on-year. 
And so in summary, Q4 Semiconductor solutions revenue was up 26% year-on-year. And in Q1, we expect semiconductor revenue growth to sustain at approximately 20% year-on-year. 
Moving on to software. In Q4, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 4% year-on-year and represented 21% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 5% year-on-year. In spite of adverse ForEx impact in dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 128%. 
Within our strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $357 million included $101 million of cross-selling of our portfolio of products to these customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscriptions and maintenance. 
Over the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 120% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 135%. Because of this, our ARR, which is annual recurring revenue, the indicator of forward revenue, at the end of Q4 was $5.4 billion which was up 4% from a year ago. And in Q1, we expect our infrastructure software segment revenue to be flat year-on-year, reflecting core software revenue growth of mid-single-digit percent year-over-year, offset by a year-on-year decline in the Brocade enterprise and business. 
In summary, we're guiding consolidated Q1 revenue of $8.9 billion, up 16% year-on-year. While we are fully booked for fiscal 2023, in this environment, we are not providing you guidance for the year. 
Before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We are making progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, as we very much expect having received merger clearance in Brazil, Canada and South Africa. We anticipate that time line for the review process would be more extended in other key regions, especially given the size of this transaction. Having said that, we're still confident that this transaction will close and be completed in our fiscal 2023. 
The combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era, and we are confident that regulators will see this when they conclude their review.

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 21% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75% of revenue in the quarter and up 10 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 3% year-on-year driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $5.5 billion and was up 25% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 240 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 64% of revenue. This figure excludes $129 million of depreciation. 
Now a review of the P&L for our 2 reportable segments. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $7.1 billion and represented 79% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 26% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 70 basis points year-on-year driven by product mix and adoption of next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $825 million in Q4, up 4% year-on-year. R&D was $731 million in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year. Q4 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 26%, operating profit grew 33% year-on-year. 
Moving to the P&L for Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $1.8 billion, up 4% year-on-year and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 91% in the quarter; and operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software operating margin was 72% in Q4, and operating profit grew 6%. 
Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.5 billion, representing 50% of revenue. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the fourth quarter compared to 29 days in the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 5% from the end of the prior quarter because we expect the mix of revenue in Q1 to have a higher cost of materials. We ended the fourth quarter with $12.4 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $440 million is short term. 
Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63% of projected revenue. 
In forecasting such operating profitability, we would like to point out that because of product mix changes, our non-GAAP gross margin could be down roughly 100 basis points from Q4 and R&D spending could be up sequentially as we step up hiring of engineers for multiple critical projects. 
Let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2022. Our revenue hit a record $33.2 billion, growing 21% year-on-year. Semiconductor Solutions revenue was $25.8 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software revenue was $7.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 76%, up 110 basis points from a year ago. Our operating expenses were $4.8 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Fiscal '22 operating income was $20.3 billion, up 28% year-over-year and represented 61% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $21 billion, up 27% year-over-year and represented 63% of net revenue. This figure excludes $529 million of depreciation. We spent $424 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 22% year-on-year to $16.3 billion or 49% of fiscal '22 revenue. 
Turning to capital allocation. For fiscal '22, we spent $15.5 billion, consisting of $7 billion in the form of cash dividends and $8.5 billion in repurchases and eliminations. We ended the year with $13 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining and expect to resume our repurchase of common stock as soon as we can under SEC rules. 
Excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q1, we expect a non-GAAP diluted share count to be $435 million. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2023 to $4.60 per share, an increase of 12% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '23, subject to quarterly Board approval. This implies our fiscal 2023 annual common stock dividend to be a record $18.40 per share. I would like to highlight that this represents the 12th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",746,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I guess I was hoping you could speak more to why infrastructure to date has been so immune from the weakness we've seen elsewhere in semis. Specifically, can you speak to trends you're seeing perhaps in hyperscale versus enterprise? Any differences there? And also, can you speak to how you see these trends throughout all of fiscal '23?",68,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

What we see now, last quarter and this current quarter as we progress is hyperscale spending continues strong. Enterprise consumption continues strong. And broadband deployment across North America, Europe and even parts of Asia continues their multiyear trend of growth simply because out of COVID 19, there was a lot of invest -- there was a lot of plans to invest, and these are multiyear. So exactly, as I said, all these areas currently continue to be very much on track as we've seen it. 
Now keep in mind, as I said in previous earnings calls and I just reemphasize here today, again, it's -- I just want to assure you, we don't believe we are shipping beyond true demand. We continue to scrub, to basically judge orders, the backlog we have, and we also take pains to only ship to customers who can consume it pretty much within the same quarter before we do it. And so as far as we can tell, based on what we see as a willingness of our customers to exempt and consume the products we ship, that's what we see right now. 
Asking me for the rest of '23, no, I tend to be more careful in being able to answer that. I don't know the answer to that is my opinion. I do not know whether the strength in acquisition and consumption of our products will continue to sustain for the rest of '23. What we do see is over the next several months, we see those orders still in place. We see customers willing to take the products. 
We have talking to multiple, multiple CIOs among the largest enterprise customers we have out there. We have not seen them talk about a reduction in their IT spending. We've seen many said it will grow and others saying it will at least remain flat. So I guess I'm cautiously positive about trends looking forward.",326,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Last quarter, you talked about actively scrubbing your backlog. And clearly, that's helped to avoid some of the inventory pitfalls that some of your peers have seen. But have you noticed since last quarter's call a change in either the rate of your backlog growth? I think it was up about 7% sequentially last quarter, the composition of your backlog or how actively and aggressively you need to scrub it. Any sort of changes in those forward-looking metrics that would alter your view on kind of the sustainability of demand and the duration of it, et cetera?",114,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We haven't changed our focus on ensuring that we do not ship products to the wrong people who just put it on the shelves. That is still very much, very, very intact in our view. 
Our backlog continues to be way up there. And you're right, makes us change. As you can see, one quarter, it would be broadband growing 20% year-on-year and networking growing 30% year-on-year, and the following quarter is broadband growing 30% year-on-year and networking growing 20%. And it impacts not just from hyperscale, bearing their purchases in, for lack of a better word, seasonal manner. It's also the particular end markets it goes to. 
So there's a mix of backlog and products we ship in any particular quarter will vary, and they all change. But it doesn't change the fact that we have still a very, very strong backlog. And what we're shipping, which is most important in the current quarter, we believe, is what we are reflecting as end demand for our products.",199,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And more importantly, that business continues to sustain based on the January quarter outlook. We typically tend to think about HDD controllers and preamps, but your business is much more diverse than this. So can you just, first of all, walk us through like what percentage is MegaRAID, PCIe or what I call overall storage connectivity versus your storage controller business, which is primarily HDD controller and pre-ops? And maybe what's driving the near-term growth in the storage franchise when many of your storage competitors and customers are seeing major weakness in this segment?",110,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

It's our server storage connectivity and you're right, which includes nearline hard rise, which includes some, what we call, on-prem server storage connectivity, [indiscernible] included is broad. And I don't have the numbers on my mind exactly what it is. 
Just broad-based particularly from the MegaRAID business, as I said, a big part of the growth, the big dollar -- the big percentage growth, as I indicated before, is due to the fact that the new generation of products are all subsystems, our boards. We're not just shipping chips. So that counts for a big part of the growth. 
Notwithstanding, the unit growth is out, but not as much as the 50% we announced, obviously. It's -- a big part of 50% is content growth as we ship subsystems and bots versus chips. But even then unit growth is up, and it's across the bot, and it's not everything that grows. But announcement that overall, it grows.",162,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

Our customer requests days in this particular quarter, for instance, our last particular last quarter was much, much higher than what we actually shipped, and it was the same way 6 months ago.

First, Hock, have you seen the impact or you expect to see any impact of China lockdowns in your wireless business in Q2? I know there's nothing -- doesn't seem to be anything in Q1. I was just wondering if there's something we should be prepared for in Q2. And then on the gross margin, I thought I heard gross margin goes down sequentially in your semiconductor business in Q1.

Let's take your first question first and then go to a more interesting second question, which is interesting because I can make a few dots here. On the first one, as you know, our wireless is one single customer, and the COVID shutdown and all that does slow down inter-quarter shipments. But nothing -- we don't see -- Q2 is too far away for me to really give you any sense on our accuracy of what is like, but that's obviously movements between Q4 and Q1 as our numbers does kind of reflect. But -- which is why year-on-year is a pretty good measure. As you see there, Q4 year-on-year was just 13% -- and I shouldn't say just -- was 13%, and Q1 was actually still 1% up, but there's obviously some movements in between. But -- and I'm sure that has something to do with COVID logistics -- impact on logistics chain of our largest customer, but I can't really tell in the bigger picture. 
Now switching and certainly on Q2, I'm no position to give you any indication. We don't have visibility. 
Now turning to the second part of your question on gross margin. It's all product mix, and it's all product mix because there are some -- depending on the particular products we ship, as I've said many times before, the margin product margin, gross margin does vary simply because it's the nature of the market conditions, the ecosystem that we have in each of those markets, those niche markets we participate in. 
But broadly, to give you a sense, perhaps that gives you more color, networking tends to have some of the highest margins collectively of our products and much higher than broadband. And of course, wireless has the lowest. And when you look at Q4 to Q1, the mix shifts away from networking somewhat and more to broadband, and wireless still remains a big chunk of it even though it hasn't received as a percent. So that's why we see that impact on gross margin sequentially. 
Nothing more than just the mix of products we ship and the natural gross margin on those products vary one from the other. And you can actually see it with the way our inventory grew, too. As we -- as Kirsten reported, our inventory ending Q4 grew about 5% from that ending Q3, the quarter before. And obviously, the Q4 inventory is positioned to ship in Q1, and you see that increase even as our guidance on revenue remains pretty flat.",424,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

We have the paper and when we say we are fully booked, it means we have the backlog sitting there. 
Now the second question you asked is a more interesting question. What if we all hit a massive recession depression or recession late next year, in the next 6 months, 9 months and customers and things really collapse around years? What would we do?

Hock, I think in some of the prepared script that you guys disclosed that you're now sort of in the compute offload ASIC franchise, the fiscal year was $2 billion, and I think that's maybe 1/3 higher than it was last year. It looks like some of the -- you guys did an event on that business earlier in the year, and things really jumped up in fiscal '18 and then kind of leveled off a bit in terms of revenue. And this is a pretty big, I guess, acceleration in that compute offload business. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the trends there. And are you seeing a broadening of the customer base or maybe higher volumes per tape-out as you go down the node stack? I'd just be interested in seeing some of the trends there.

And they own -- have the -- do their own. So that's in one way that's very positive and very opportunistic for our technologies to be deployed. 
On an ongoing basis, the tricky thing in all this is more will come on. The rate of ramp is harder for us to predict. These are very lumpy programs, fairly large and lumpy, which is why we can get to $2 billion and a raise -- an increase of like, as you correctly say, 1/3 from a year ago. But it's lumpy, and the trend is very hard for me to chart out unless you ask for it over the next 5 years. 
And even then, if you look at 5 years, it becomes a question of would these hyperscalers revert to merchant silicon versus continuing to use customer ASIC, and that poses another issue for me to figure it out. But if you ask for me over the next year or 2, where it will go, I'd be honest and say I'm not positioned to give you really a good forecast.",207,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

It has slowed down, and we see that. They're still not totally collapsed, but they have slowed down compared to what they were taking a year ago. But that's -- and we see that particularly in our industrial business, which as we -- I indicated in my prepared remarks, strength in Europe, strength in North America especially in automotive, but weakness in China, which is a big part of our industrial business slowed down. 
But beyond that, in the IT side, yes, we have seen a slowdown. But keep in mind, China represents just less than 10% of our total revenues today.

Let me try and address that. First, I assume you imply when you say orders or forecast on shipments, we only guide Q1, so I can only give you Q1. And it's all -- we have been all on paper, orders. These are real orders, noncancelable. So we're giving you numbers that we intend to ship that we think the customer needs as far as we can scrub. And we have it, these are committed orders. These are not forecast at all, especially when you talk about Q1, which ends, by the way, end of January. We have orders beyond end of January as it is. 
So these are very committed others. And in that -- by that same token, pretty committed revenue forecast. Just to make it clear, Vietnam. You're right. And by the way, we have pretty good visibility for -- from that particular customer, too. 
Now beyond that, to the second part of your question, yes, we're very pleased with content increase that we have experienced, not every year necessarily, as you know. But over a period of years, we always see this content increase. And we're still very, very well positioned in our product line -- in those few product lines that are, I call it, almost franchise in our North American customers. And this is WiFi, Bluetooth. This is RF front end. And this is touchscreen controllers, high performance, mixed single. And that's -- we can only -- and that's all we focus on because these are areas where we are the best, we believe we have the best technology and delivering value to our customers. There's no reason to find something else where you're not the best and hope to gain share from someone else.
