Last month, NVIDIA and TSMC shipped our 1 billionth GeForce GPU. This milestone is less than 12 years in the making, and over that period of time, the complexity of the GPU has increased more than 1,000x. Having advanced from being a fixed-function graphics accelerator to one of the most powerful programmable computing devices in the world, the GPU is enabling enormous progress in computers ranging from smartphones and tablets to PCs and game consoles to work stations and supercomputers. And in that time, the GPU has become the defining technology for every platform that uses it. Our new $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel underscores the growing importance of the GPU to the future of personal computing as well as to the expanding markets for mobile and cloud computing.
Heading into the year, we have one of the best lineups of GPUs in the company's history. The GTX 580 remains in the top spot as the fastest DX11 GPU for enthusiast gamers. We extended our DX11 technology leadership with the launch of the GTX 570 and the GTX 560 Ti, heralded by reviewers as category leaders for the $349 and $249 core gamer price segments. Our GTX product stack is the gamers' choice and the results show. For the second consecutive quarter, our desktop standalone GPU share grew, increasing from 59% in Q3 to 61% in Q4, with higher share gains in the performance and enthusiasts segments. 
And aside from our expectation to continue to gain share, there are several big events this year that can be catalysts for growth. First, Intel's Sandy Bridge is the best gamer CPU in a long time. And with the SLI motherboards from Intel, ASUS, Gigabyte and others, along with the new GTX 560 Ti, it offers gamers a perfect opportunity to upgrade their PC.  Second, great games drive GeForce GTX sales. And this year, we expect to see a number highly anticipated games such as Crysis 2, Battlefield 3, Duke Nukem Forever, Portal 2 and Diablo III. And third, 3D Vision is all about enjoying games at a whole new level. Driven by great new 3D Vision licensed products such as Acer's new 27-inch 3D Vision panel and Dell's XPS 17-inch 3D Vision notebook, we expect the 3D Vision to grow 200% this year. NVIDIA's 3D Vision content ecosystem is the largest in the industry, with support for over 500 video games, Blu-ray movies and our new 3D Web portal, 3dvisionlive.com, which offers a wealth of streaming video and photographs.
In notebooks, we announced a record number of design wins for the Intel Sandy Bridge platform. More than 200 new notebook models will feature our new GeForce 500M Series GPUs. Adding GeForce is one of the best ways for OEMs to differentiate PCs with premium capabilities versus the basic platforms based on Intel's graphics. Unlike basic graphics integrated into Sandy Bridge CPUs, GeForce GPUs provide advanced features and increased compatibility for latest PC games, including those based on DX11.
Tesla achieved over $100 million in revenue in fiscal 2011. It’s becoming conventional wisdom in technical computing that parallel processing delivers the highest performance as well as being the most energy efficient and cost-effective. The world's greatest petaflops and supercomputers are built with Tesla GPUs. The Green500 list for the world's most energy-efficient supercomputers revealed that Tsubame 2.0 from the Tokyo Institute of Technology was ranked number two and was the only petaflop system in the top 10. Three other Tesla-based systems made the top 10 along with the systems in 11th, 12th and 13th spots. During the quarter, HP, Dell and IBM all entered into production with their Tesla-powered servers. With the sales and market of the world's largest enterprise sales force engaged, we look forward to accelerating the adoption of Tesla. Technical computing servers enterprised in the cloud represents a multibillion dollar growth opportunity for Tesla.
CES was the coming-out party for our Tegra 2 customers. Motorola, LG, Acer, ASUS and Toshiba all announced their flagship smartphones and tablets with tremendous industry acclaim at CES. The MOTOROLA XOOM with Android 3.0 won overall Best of Show. And the ATRIX won Best of Show in the smartphone category. And LG began shipment of the Optimus 2X in Korea in January. At CES, we also unveiled our long-term processor initiative, codenamed Project Denver, to develop custom CPU cores based on the ARM architecture. This initiative is focused on NVIDIA's CPU running the ARM instruction set, which will be fully integrated in the same chip as the NVIDIA GPU. It will target personal computers, servers and supercomputers.
In addition to Audi, which we have enjoyed a deep partnership since 2004, we announced two new partnerships at CES with BMW North America and Tesla Motors that will put NVIDIA processors in navigation and vehicle information systems across all next-generation BMW cars worldwide and the Tesla Roadster and Model S, respectively.
In this week at the Mobile World Congress, Samsung joined our marquee list of customers announcing their Galaxy Tab 10.1 and their plans for a next-generation Tegra 2 superphone. LG also officially announced the new Optimus pad, which will be the G-Slate for T-Mobile. A highlight at MWC was the demonstration of Kal-El, the world's first mobile quad core processor. Kal-El, our next-generation Tegra SOC, which features a new 12-core NVIDIA GPU, provides 5x the performance of Tegra 2. We're beginning to sample Kal-El to strategic partners. And based on our competition announcements, we believe we are at least a year ahead of them. We are targeting to deliver Kal-El in tablets and smartphones later this year.
Our strategy with Tegra is to utilize our deep expertise in IP and computing to create processors for the mobile computing revolution. We designed Tegra to be the most advanced processor for mobile applications and to target the tablet segment, which is expected to be approximately 208 million units by 2014 and the smartphone segment, which is growing at a compounded 19% annual growth rate to approximately 600 million units in five years as estimated by the Gartner Group. And now with Microsoft's announcements, Tegra can directly access the Windows PC market.
Heading into Q1, our primary focus is to continue to ramp both our GeForce on Sandy Bridge and Tegra 2 customers into production. More importantly, our results are beginning to tell the bigger story about NVIDIA's transformation. Even as we are expanding our leadership in digital computing, our investments in Tegra, Tesla and Project Denver put us at the center of the two most disruptive revolutions happening with mobile and cloud computing. We have never been more optimistic about our growth opportunities.
With that, let me turn the call over to David.",1454,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3494.0,113245.0,7584034.0,Presenter Speech,David White,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $886.4 million, up 5% sequentially. Gross margin of 48.1% was a record for the second consecutive quarter. It was at the high end of our range, primarily as a result of richer GPU product mix than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. GAAP OpEx was $247 million. This includes the Intel settlement of $57 million. Without it, our R&D and SG&A costs would have been a combined $304 million, in line with our estimates. Combined, these results generated a GAAP net income of $171.4 million (sic) [$171.7 million] or $0.29 per diluted share. 
Revenue by business segment was as follows: our GPU business was up 5.5%; our MCP revenue was down significantly as we entered into the final phase of that business, but this was more than offset by strong growth in desktop and notebook discrete. Our Professional business was down slightly. Quadro was down, but this was almost completely offset by strong growth in Tesla. And our Consumer business was up despite a seasonally down console business thanks to a strong Tegra customer ramps.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our focus on inventory reduction continue to make progress as we were able to reduce it by another 8.5% to $345.5 million. Channel inventory was at or below expectations. These results, together with receipt of our first payment from Intel, allowed us to report cash balances of approximately $2.5 billion. 
Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows: revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8% from the fourth quarter; GAAP gross margin is expected to be 48.5% to 49.5%; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $327 million; GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 18%.

One more question I wanted to ask you, at Mobile World Congress, it seems like everyone is racing -- and this is for Mike, there's a race to launch quad core. And first of all, congratulations on the success you've had with Tegra 2. But the question I have on quad core is, first of all, is there enough application now to take advantage of this level of power that you are bringing in at the end of this year? And then secondly, do you need 28 nanometers to make this profitably? Can you talk about the economics of that? That's my second question.",106,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

It is the case that several of our competitors announced quad core products that will be sampled next year and potentially go into production the year after. At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated Kal-El, and there were quite a few systems on-hand for demonstrating all aspects of  Kal-El, whether it was extreme high-definition video, it has the ability to support very high definition displays. The overall horsepower and computational capability of Kal-El is about 5x the performance of Tegra 2 and has some really exciting new technologies for extremely low-power operations even though we have four CPUs inside our Kal-El processor. These are all the breakthroughs that we have demonstrated at Mobile World Congress. Whereas some of the competitors seemed panicked to announce something on their PowerPoint slides, we tend to announce the product when we're actually sampling to customers. And in the case of Kal-El, we're now sampling to our strategic partners and our intention is to go to production this year. With respect to the importance of quad core, obviously, quad core is incredibly important otherwise it wouldn't be on all of the suppliers' road maps. We were the first in the world to announce and ship dual core. During that time, a lot of people asked us about that, and now it's quad core. If you think about the tablet or mobile device applications, you'll realize that very quickly it's multitasking. You're multitasking whether you're streaming music, while you're reading a book or you're playing game and you're being connected to other players in a multiplayer environment or you do physics processing while you're playing a game. One of the most delightful parts of the game that people like these days, whether it's Angry Bird or others, it's just the realistic physics that it does. And the way that the bricks and the buildings fall apart are physically real, and you're going to see more and more of that type of capability over time. And so whether it's multitasking, whether it's image processing for very high-quality camera effects, browsing, multitasking, those type of applications are all very, very intensive users of multi GPU cores. And the last thing is it's actually logical and completely intuitive if you think about it, but four CPU cores working less hard consumes less energy than one CPU core or two CPU cores working their butt off. And that's the reason why if you look at the PC industry, what people have said about the PC hitting the brick wall and hitting the power wall. Remember when CPUs were cranking at extreme high frequencies, those are just bad ideas. Brute forcing CPU design and overclocking it and causing it to run extremely fast is just not a very good idea. It makes a lot more sense to run at the natural frequencies of the semiconductor process and utilize all kinds of parallels and ideas. In the case of CPUs, we have four cores. In the case of a GPU, we have 12 cores. Using parallelism is the most efficient and also the highest performance approach to computing that we know.",523,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

On the other hand, 40-nanometer is actually more economical than 28 nanometers this year and we’ll likely expect it to be so until about first half, maybe even the midpoint of next year. So 40 nanometers is absolutely the right approach. It is the most mature, and we can go into very, very high production very, very quickly because the yields are so great.",77,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And so it's really, really hard to tell. I mean, one of the things that we all have to recognize is the market for tablets is much, much larger than we all expected. And every single time an analyst comes out with another projection for the size of the tablet market it gets bigger, and I think there's a couple of reasons for that. They're just wonderfully delightful to use. They're easy to carry around and you see more and more people now carrying around tablets surely instead of -- I've never seen anybody carry a netbook around. But you’re seeing more and more people carry tablets around than notebooks. And also, even if you have a PC, you don't mind buying a tablet to supplement it. If you already have a PC, it's not likely you'd buy another PC. But you surely would buy a tablet to supplement it. So I think it's an easy purchase. It's easy to use and delightful to use. And so I think people are surprised by the size of the tablet market. My sense is that we're going to continue to be surprised by the size of the tablet market, certainly as more and more capabilities come out. One of the things that we're really excited about is that these tablets are now completely Flash accelerated. And so you can go to any website, you could run any application off the web that you’d expect to. And so those kinds of new usage capabilities and this freedom to explore capability is something that we're quite excited about. And so it's hard for us to tell right now. The thing that I can tell you is that our design wins are all Tier 1s. These are the marquee names of the mobile industry and computing industry and have a great deal of faith in their ability to create exciting products and taking them to market. And so we'll just have to wait and see and see how it turns out.",353,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3494.0,113245.0,7584048.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,16,"Our ASPs, it depends on two factors. On the one hand, most of the notebook ASPs are going to be lower than the GTX 580 and 570 to 560 we just recently rolled out. On the other hand, the GTX 570 and 560 are still ramping. And so it's hard to say exactly how it's going to play out. We're just going to have to report on the progress as we go. We're excited about the gamers market. The gamers market has three catalysts this year. One, there's some really, really big titles for PC gaming coming out. Crysis 2 is just really, really exciting. And so I think the enthusiasts come out when there is a great new breakthrough games like Crysis. The second thing is, it's been a long time since the PC gamers had a basic platform of great opportunity. Sandy Bridge is the best CPU that's been built for PC gamers in a long, long time. And so we have SLI motherboards with Intel. We have SLI motherboards with ASUSTeK, with Gigabyte, with many others, so that gamers can upgrade their PCs with affordable, very low power and very high-performance systems. And so when Sandy Bridge starts to ramp and the SLI motherboards start to ship here in the near future, we're going to have to see how many people come up for the upgrade. And then the lastly is 3D Vision. When you can enjoy everything in 3D, it's just much more exciting. And 3D Vision basically doubles the resolution one for each eye, doubles the resolution that is needed to enjoy a game. And so that tends to drive higher-end ASPs. And so we're just going to have to wait and see before we can tell for sure.",294,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And the reason for that is because we're such a large position in the marketplace. Tegra is a brand new product for us, and we have almost zero exposure in the mobile industry and this is really our first major push into it. And the devices that we're in are not fringe or exotic devices. They're not Transformer-type devices or new 3D displays where people aren't sure yet whether those adoption are going to be quite high or not. These are straight-down-the-middle, high-end and where-the-demand-is-the-greatest superphone devices right now. And as you see from the devices, they're beautiful and they're the primary platforms for the marquee customers that we're working with. It is core to their business. These aren't fringe products. And so I think that from that perspective, I have a relative amount of confidence that our partners are going to do a great job marketing them. And the enthusiasm in the marketplace is already really, really high and the reviews have been great. So my sense is that we're going to do quite well. As we get to be a much larger player in the mobile space, we're going to have to develop those kind of systems that we use for the PC industry where we monitor sell-throughs and sell-outs. And so we'll have to have to continue to do a better job with that. But at the moment, I think that we're going into, I guess, what people will consider blue ocean [ph].",274,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We will -- some of those investments that we're making and are coming in Q1, precede revenue that we hope to realize later on in the year as we see Tesla and Tegra and our other pieces of our business ramping. As it relates to $327 million, that which I think was what we guided for Q1 and how that's going to behave going forward, we won't have, for example, payroll tax for the full year and so forth.

There's just a lot of system software to do. And developing multimedia and system software technology is one of the areas where we just have an enormous amount of expertise because of building sophisticated computers over the years. And if you look at the PC, the amount of systems software we had to do for it is every bit now the same in the mobile industry, if not more. And that's one of the reasons why we believe that mobile computing was going to be such a great opportunity for us. That on one hand, the modem will continue to be important. On the other hand, for certain classes of devices, whether it's the superphones or tablets, its computing capability is one of the most important things. And in order to deliver on a great computing experience, the ability to create all of the system software from video to graphic to multitasking to all of the Flash accelerations and just the enormous amount of OpenGL or whatever it is and computer vision and imaging software, all of that kind of software working together in a just a really wonderful experience is hard to pull together. And this is something that we believe we have a great deal of expertise and a great deal of capacity to do. So we do quite a large amount of it. We know our architecture best. This is an area that in terms of system software, few companies in the world has a very large capacity to do. The three companies that probably have the largest capacity in the world of system software, it's probably us, Intel and AMD because of all the computers that we built over the years. We just have more people in system software with this expertise than just about anywhere else in the world. And so I think that this is something that is of great importance and is becoming more and more important and a greater and greater bottleneck. And we talked about early reviews of Tegra 2 phones, some of the comments that people are making are its stability and the performance of these phones right off the chute. Most of the smartphones that you may have bought, with the exception of Apple's products frankly, you've had to debug into existence. And you know, we think that that's not inherent to a phone. It's just because it’s inherent to building great computers. And so I think this is an area of great differentiation for us.",424,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

As we move forward, what are the key differentiators other than what you just talked about in the tablet market and handset market from your perspective? And over time, given the integration trends, at least in the handset market, is the lack of baseband and conductivity a material constraint or not for you in your view?",84,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And although these mobile devices are starting to do more and more computing, the computing capability that we're looking at is still rather nascent. The benefit that we have is, and we described it at Mobile World Congress, the benefit that we have is that the rich and deep pipeline of intellectual property that we can bring to bear as mobile devices become more and more computing capable. We went from a company that was working on basically one and a half to two mobile chips to a company that now has five chips on the road map. And we're concurrently working on projects that go all the way out to 20 nanometers and beyond. We don't have to wait for anyone to create the computing technology for us to license. We have all the technology here for us to bring to bear and execute a really aggressive road map. And that's how we're able to year-in, year-out crank out leading edge products that as the rest of the industry is just putting it and talking about it on paper. With respect to modems, there are quite a few modem players in the world. I mean, you'd be surprised how many of them there are. I mean, Qualcomm is obviously a supplier. Infineon is a supplier. ST-Ericsson is a supplier. There are many others. And where our focus is on the segments of the marketplace where computing is really important. And we believe that there's a great deal of work that we could do here before we need to consider increasing levels of integration. And then lastly, both the computing side and the modem side are going through very rapid innovation at the moment. On the one hand, computing is going from dual core to quad core and more and more GPU performance and better and better video capability and such. And on the other hand, modems are going from 2.5G to 3G to 4G. And so all of these are moving parts. Integration is the enemy of innovation. And so it's hard to move as fast when you have to integrate everything into one chip.",362,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So Tegra 2 has just barely gone into production. In terms of thinking about these things, the growth and the growth opportunities, really the only thing you can really keep in mind is the size of the opportunity and the partners that you have to address those opportunities. The size of the tablet opportunity’s obviously larger than anybody expected. And I think people are getting a firmer grip on why the tablet is such a wonderful computing device. Secondly, I think the partners that we are going to market with it are undoubtedly the best in the world. If we have to choose the best Android partners in the world to go to the market with, I think we couldn't have chosen a better list. So I think we're going to be able to address a very large market and address it with partners who could give us a global reach. With respect to future Tegras, I'm not sure if there was an exact question. But I haven't used the word Tegra 3 yet, but we demonstrated recently a processor called Kal-El, it's an internal code name for a next generation processor.

You got two step functions that kind of impacted Q1. One was the restart of payroll taxes, which is pretty binary.

And so we'll have to wait and see what happens to stock price, but certainly the FICA won't be going and getting reset again.

And I think for us to ship production out in Q3, we have to start wafers in early Q2, right? And so 28 nanometers is not an option. Secondarily, 40 nanometers is now in the third year of its production, and the yields are fabulous. And so that's a wonderful reason to do it. And so I think on the one hand, 28 nanometers is available, on the other hand 40 nanometers yielding fabulously. So I think it's just naturally the right answer. But going forward, the way to think about it is the general rhythm that you will see in the industry for companies that come up with new processors every year, you should expect to see two processors in the same node or so. You’ve noticed other companies that have used different ways of explaining the rhythm and some use a one process node change, one is a architecture change, the next one is a process node change. So basically, it's every other year for a new process node. And I think that rhythm is not a bad rhythm. I mean, that's basically how quickly the industry is changing process. So it stands to reason that Tegra 2 and Tegra Next or Kal-El would use the same process, and then the following ones would be a 28-nanometer deal.",239,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So as quickly as Tegra is growing, more of our company's overall R&D is driving into the Tegra road map. And it's because it's great for mobile devices, smartphones, tablets and because of Microsoft's announcement with Windows.Next running on ARM, all of a sudden Tegra has the ability to address front and center dead-on the core notebook PC market. And I think that the opportunity to take future generation Tegra processors directly into the notebook market is really exciting to me. And it's also a way for the PC industry to really be revolutionized, if you will, with industrial designs that are exquisite in battery life and usage models that are very, very different than today's notebook. I mean, I think it's pretty clear at this point that in the future, Windows notebooks will make today's notebooks look a little bit like refrigerators. And I think that we have the ability to completely revolutionize how people see notebook computers again, and I'm excited about that. And so how much of our engineering should really go into Tegra and related, Denver plus Tesla? The answer is a lot. And so the breakeven point could eventually become all of NVIDIA.",226,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then in the second half of the year, it should be a pretty minor piece of our business. We've not really broken it out beyond that other than to say at least at this point, we know that Tegra will exceed it in Q1. And as far as units are concerned, our units were up in the fourth quarter, primarily on the strength of our mainstream business. But more importantly, the revenue per unit, or the ASP as someone asked earlier, was driven primarily by our mix changes. And we're happy to see that. It drives a lot of earnings potential for the company and opportunity for the company, and we don't right now see that changing materially going forward.",153,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Our ASP is for tablets because the package is larger and the bin tends to be a little higher. Tablet margins or ASPs are higher than that of smartphones. Smartphones are also designed into depending on which tier of the customers we engage with, extremely high-volume engagements or moderate volume engagements, those ASPs tend to be lower than tablets. And Kal-El, as the world's first quad core, would command a premium when the product comes out.

If Intel gets aggressive with Sandy River (sic) [Sandy Bridge], of course our share on Sandy River is much, much higher than that of Huron River. As you recall, our market -- we lost market share on Huron River with the first Fermi generation. But the GTX 5, the GTX 4 to 5 family, the second generation Fermi, has been a huge success for us. From desktop to notebook, we have the best stack of GPUs in the world today. And so the more aggressively Intel transitions from Sandy River to Huron River, the more quickly we will gain share.

When you think about a number that big, what do you think is a realistic target for NVIDIA's market share in that business?",34,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3494.0,113245.0,7584105.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,73,"Well, who knows? 2014 is a long time from now. I think there's a couple things that we believe in. We believe that computers are going to become thinner and thinner and easier and easier to use. And touch is going to become an increasing important part of computing. And so it stands to reason that tablets or notebooks that can become tablets or tablets that can become notebooks, that these are going to become, if you will, kind of part of computing. It will become the PC. And what we consider a tablet today, but if you look at some of the way people are thinking about it, I think about it as just personal computers. This is the new personal computer, and they are just different form factors. There're smaller versions of tablets, we call them smartphones or superphones. There are larger versions of tablets, we call them notebooks. There are even super-large versions of tablets, if you will, all-in-one PCs. And so I think that you're going to find the industrial design of personal computers has become disrupted, if you will, as a result of mobile computing components being used and mobile computing processors being used. And so I think that the space of personal computers, tablets, smartphones are going to become a little bit fuzzy over time. Even the OEMs that provide them will become fuzzy over time. And it stands to reason that at this point, I think we all believe it's a very large market. Now to be successful within that large market, it's important that you have a very low power design. It's important that you have the ARM processor. The ARM ISA has now become the de facto standard of this segment of the market and it's become very disruptive. It is the only ISA now that can support all of the major operating systems necessary for the mobile computing space. From iOS to QNX to Android to now next generation Windows. So it's clear that you need to have ARM. And then after that, you need to have expertise in building computers. An SoC is basically a computer on a chip. And when you are a provider of a computer-on-a-chip and there are this many operating systems to support, you better have deep, deep expertise and not to mention capacity of system software expertise in building sophisticated computers like this. And so I think that at the very high level, it's really exactly how we think about our strategy. That this is a very large market. It is disruptive. It is disrupting the computer industry as we see it and know it right now. And this is an area where we believe we can play at a great deal -- make a great contribution and drive our growth. So aside from that, it's kind of hard to predict exactly whether Gartner is going to be right or not. My guess is based on where the analysts' predictions have been going lately, it seems like every month they've been raising their estimates. And so we don't know where it stops.",518,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

They paused but I think Intel is doing quite a good job of helping everyone recover. With respect to share, I think our share is about 40% today. My guess is that when it's all said and done, our share should be north of 60%. And then with respect to attach rate, the PC industry still has basically to two tiers: the basic PC and the premium PC. If every PC uses basic Intel integrated graphics then everything would be the same and everything would become a VCR. But obviously, no consumer would like that because they still believe that there's an opportunity to buy a better PC and one that has higher performance or higher resolution or just more interactivity or the fact that our GPU’s just far, far, far more compatible with games and all the multimedia applications. So it depends on how you want it -- what you use it for. If you're a person looking for a basic PC, then integrated graphics makes sense for you. And you're looking for a premium PC and buy something a little bit better with the money you have, adding a GPU to it is really a fabulous thing. And so that basic dynamic hasn't really changed with the introduction of Sandy Bridge. So I'm not expecting a much GPU attach differences.",242,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2012. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up. 
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's investor website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until May 19, 2011, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our second quarter fiscal 2012. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended January 30, 2011, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All of our statements are made as of today, May 12, 2011, based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.
With that, let's begin. Our desktop and notebook GPU product lines exceeded internal expectations for Q1. In our Desktop business, we continue to be well-positioned in the Performance and Enthusiast categories and continue to see good momentum in China. We added to both ends of our product lineup with the additions of the GeForce GTX 550 Ti and the GeForce GTX 590. The GTX 550 Ti is the best entry-level gaming GPU for the next generation Intel systems and the GTX 590 is simply the fastest dual GPU add-in card for enthusiasts. Jon Peddie stated in Tech Watch, ""The GeForce GTX 590 is the best Overall add-in board in every parameter we measure. Compared to other dual GPU add-in boards and dual add-in GPU boards, it has the highest performance per watt, the highest performance per dollar, the lowest power consumption, the lowest noise, the biggest gain from over-clocking and the best Pmark, regular or over-clocked.""
The X11 GPUs continues to experience good growth, driven by a wave of great new games, such as the recent release of Crysis 2, and we still have many highly-anticipated titles yet to be released this year. In the 3D notebook GPUs, we expect to increase share on the Sandy Bridge platform. We felt this growth as Sandy Bridge started to ramp in April. The Sandy Bridge transition is expected to reach the 75% crossover point exiting in the second quarter and should drive another increase in both our revenue and share in the notebook GPU segment as a result.
Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra processors and embedded products achieved record revenue of over $122 million. The record performance is due to our first group of Tegra 2-based Android products hitting the market. Among them are the MOTOROLA ATRIX and LG Optimus 2X super phone, as well as tablets like the MOTOROLA XOOM, LG Optimus Pad and G-Slate, the ASUS Eee Transformer, Dell Streak and the Acer Iconia A500. The second wave of super phones and tablets from Acer, Motorola, Toshiba and Samsung, are expected to ship in Q2.
In addition, Sony announced that their S1 and S2 tablet projects will be used in Tegra 2. Based on market research from In-Stat, tablets represents the fastest-growing segment for mobile processors, with a compound annual growth rate of 124% from 2009 to 2014. We continue to drive the lead role in the Android tablet market, and expect to further solidify that position with our next generation project Kal-El base tablets hitting consumer shelves later this year.
We announced this week that we will acquire Icera, a baseband and RF Technology leader. We believe this move will further accelerate our Tegra momentum and enhance our position in mobile computing, while providing another major growth target for our company. Icera is the pioneer in next generation wireless modem technologies called software-defined radio or SDR technology. They have created an ultra-low power, high-performance processors, specifically, specially designed for processing multiple modem protocols. Icera's deep execution processor known as DXP is a programmable processor designed to execute communications algorithms in extremely low power and is super elegant and is much smaller than conventional basebands. In a way, DXP is the technical equivalent of the programmable shares we invented for GPUs, which revolutionized the graphics industry.
Icera has more than 550 patents granted or pending worldwide, and those products have been approved by more than 50 carriers across the globe. By combining the company's products and technology, including our Tegra processor, we expect to enhance our position as the leading player in the growing phone and tablet markets. The market for baseband processors is one of the fastest-growing segments of the technology industry, with an estimated $15 billion a year. Our immediate plans are to accelerate Icera's entry in the voice basebands, followed by the introduction of 4G, LTE-based bands. Together, we will offer the 2 most important processors that make up the modern mobile computer. Not only is this combination strategically powerful in the market, we expect it will also drive growth for both Tegra processors and Icera-based bands.  Icera will leverage Tegra's momentum and deep customer engagements globally. We are very excited to welcome the Icera team to NVIDIA. They possess a great entrepreneurial spirit and inner focus with great people and great technology. They make a perfect fit with the NVIDIA team. This is a key step in our plan to be a major player in the mobile computer revolution.

Revenue for the first quarter was $962 million, up 8.5% sequentially. GAAP gross margin of 50.4% was a record for the third consecutive quarter. Gross margin exceeded our expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter, primarily as a result of richer product mix within our GPU systems. GAAP OpEx was $329.6 million, in line with our estimates. Combined, these results generated a GAAP net income of $135.2 million or $0.22 per diluted share.
Revenue by business segment was as follows. Our GPU business was up 3.8%. Our MCP revenue was down significantly as we entered the final phase of that business, but this was more than offset by a strong growth in notebook [indiscernible]. Demand for notebook GPUs increased significantly, as OEMs ramped production of Sandy Bridge notebooks. 
Our Professional business was relatively flat, gradually increased sequentially. However, our Tesla business was down relative to the prior quarter, as the fourth quarter benefited from a particular large transaction. And our Consumer business achieved record revenue, driven by our Tegra customers bringing their first Android products to the market.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our inventory levels continued to be at target levels. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $381 million. Our view of the channel shows inventory within our target. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.73 billion, up $236 million over the prior quarter. 
Excluding the Icera acquisition, our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6% from the first quarter; GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 50.5% and 51.5%. We believe this is the right level for gross margins for now. This level allows us to maintain a healthy balance between growth and profitability.

The first generation of tablets initially came out from our carriers and with 3G, and I think that is recognized that the vast majority of tablet users are actually buying it from retail and Wi-Fi only. And without 3G, obviously, the tablets would be much more affordable. So I think that, that's one of the factors that affected the initial reviews of the early waves of tablets, but those concerns have been largely addressed at this point. And now, you can buy tablets from retail stores all over America. And the new wave of tablets are now ramping up that are even more affordable and available in retail channels with Wi-Fi configurations all over the world. And you're also starting to see a lot of differentiated platforms from devices that are likely ASUSTeK transformer, where it's a tablet in one configuration, it has a detachable keyboard in another configuration. And so those kind of devices are getting a lot of interest and available at computer channels all over the world. We're going to expect another wave of tablets that are coming out to the marketplace now. Ones that are even thinner and even lighter than the best offerings from any place, any supplier in the world and those devices are just in the process of ramping. Then there's the really exciting new build of Honeycomb called Honeycomb 3.1 that Google just demonstrated the other day at Google I/O. We are basically switching that up now, it's available, it will be available to end-users as over-the-air download in the very near future. And so you'll get music services, cloud music services, cloud video services, cloud book services, and there will be cloud magazine services and all kinds of really interesting offerings to be used on these tablets in the very near future. And so I think that the -- another wave of these tablets are now starting to show up around the world, but the first-generation of tablets with the over-the-air Honeycomb 3.1 that's coming out eminently are really, really fabulous and they're doing -- they're selling really well.",358,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

The GPU business, about flattish. The Professional business, about flattish. And the Consumer business, uppish. And so and as a result of that, we're able to overcome the Q2, which tends to be seasonally down. And if you look at other people's guidances in the computer industry, Q2 was seasonally down. And so you're starting to see an expansion in our core businesses, core GPU businesses, and you're also seeing growth in our Consumer business, or Consumer Mobile business, and that's making up for the decline, the expected decline of our MCP business that we talked about now for quite some time. If you looked at our MCP business, year-over-year, it declined about $150 million, and we made up for that through the growth of our core GPU business and Tegra business this quarter.

With respect to revenue contributions, we obviously haven't completed the acquisition yet. And so we should probably comment on that when we're done with that. With respect to the integration, we have no current plans to integrate their modem. We think that the ability to offer both processors and either the 2 most important processors for mobile computing gives us the opportunity to leverage the momentum of Tegra and also the quite broad penetration they've already achieved with carriers all over the world to increase the momentum of both processors. We also see that in the vast majority of the projects that we're working on, whether it's tablets or super phones, the ability to keep the 2 processors separate allows us to mix and match the best processors for the devices that we're in. And so if you look at most of the super phones in the world today and most of the tablets in the world today, the application processor and the baseband processors are in fact, separate. And so the ability -- and then finally, the ability to integrate the 2, we surely have that capability. And we'll look at the market and look at when the technology makes sense to integrate to offer either the smallest footprint or the lowest cost. And we'll do so when the timing is right, and we surely have the capability to that now.",255,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And we talked about, talked to the incumbents that's in the traditional PC market, they make an argument that it would be very difficult for NVIDIA in ARM because this move in traditional PCs because of the standardization, the lack of standardization, the fragmented nature of the market and the ARM ecosystem.

And so there's still plenty of, a lot of time between now and the time that Project Denver will enter the market. But obviously, it has to be competitive. And the things that we do that we're really good have to matter -- and so computer graphics have to matter, parallel computing has to matter, GPU computing has to matter. And we have to build a product that really makes a difference in the marketplace. There are still a lot of ideas that we haven't introduced in Project Denver. It's probably a little bit too early. But suffice to say, that we will build a MID 2 product. You've known our company a long time, and when we introduce a product, there's usually something pretty special about it. And we expect Project Denver to carry on that tradition of delivering something innovative and special. With respect to standardization, standardization comes from compatibility with software. And the thing to keep in mind today is that the vast majority of the software developers around the world for consumer computing are increasingly evolving on ARM processors. And if you take a look at the number of devices that are being shipped today, there are far, far, far more ARM computers being shipped than there are x86 computers being shipped. And if that attracts more software developers, then there's more rich software being developed for ARM that over time, you would think that ARM becomes the most valuable platform for enjoying the software. And so that's how standardization happens, and you know how fast mobile computing and the Internet in these application stores is causing new platforms to make a difference. I mean, it was only a few years ago that these ARM-based, either iPhones or Android phones, came to the marketplace and just look at how many applications have been downloaded and how many gigabytes have been downloaded of applications. And this is just the first few years. The next few years is about to happen to us, and it's growing at exponential rates. And so I think that's what standardization is all about, and I think it's a pretty much foregone conclusion that ARM is just going to be probably the most important standard for application, for consumers, anyhow.",392,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

I mean, that's what's really special about the Icera architecture. This is one of the worlds, if not, the world's first unified software defined radio-based baseband. I mean, in a way, they've designed baseband processors, this multi-protocol baseband processors the same way we've designed our GPUs that allows for multiple effect shading. And as a result of that, through software upgrades, they're able to provide voice capabilities. They have the full TPPCom stacked for voice -- I mean, this isn't being done from scratch. The Icera team, based in France, is one of the reputed teams in voice, and this is -- these guys have done it for years and years. And they're starting from the baseband -- of the software stack of TPPCom which is the starting point for a lot of basebands today for voice. And so -- and also, they're making, they've made incredible progress already. We haven't introduced the product yet but we expect that the path to getting there is pretty well known at this point. There's still a lot of development to be done, Arnab, and surely this is -- there's a lot of execution to do. But it's not easy, but that's kind of the exciting stuff. Icera has invested nearly $300 million between in all of their, in all their different realms of financing and have created a pretty terrific starting point for us.

And we're spending a lot of time on that particular topic ourselves. There are several reasons for that. One, the workstation industry needs to be reinvigorated with new capabilities, and that's one of the reasons why we built Fermi. Fermi, the Fermi GPU brings a level of capability and functionality to the workstation industry it never had before. And we're in the process of rolling out those capabilities into the marketplace. We call it internally the Fermi transition. By making computer graphics, not just about OpenGL, but about CUDA and computational capabilities, we could bring things like -- capabilities like photorealistic rendering, the ability to do simulation and visualization at the same time, the ability to do image processing at a much, much higher rate. And so a large group of industries from design to styling, to broadcast, to seismic analysis, whether you're in oil and gas, to imaging for medical, there's all kinds of applications where Fermi is really transformative. And so we're in the process of introducing these capabilities into the Professional markets, and that is what we call the Fermi transition. Until we do that, I think that the worst station marketplace is growing basically at the rate of GEPs. And so we need to reinvigorate that growth to new capability. So that's one. The second is the Tesla business needs to continue to get application adoption and to continue to get those applications accelerated through CUDA. And we're making excellent progress there. And the OEMs are now engaging customers all over the world with what we call proof of concepts. And there's a large number of projects in the pipeline. And so HP, Dell, IBM, SuperMicro and many others are working with large companies to get these projects certified, qualified and then ramped up. And so I think part of that has simply -- has to do with the time that it takes a large enterprise to understand the capabilities of the supercomputing workstations and supercomputers servers and then also to get it certified and rolled out into their companies. But I certainly expect that to happen.",361,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And so that's -- the NVIDIA Professional Solutions group is completely aware of this, and everybody is working hard to get growth happening. This is something that the growth is not, nothing, no competition is in the path of our growth. This is innovation that will be necessary to grow this business for us and grow this business for all of the OEMs around the world. The Workstation business is frankly waiting for us to bring the innovations that have been designed into Fermi, in CAT tools from [indiscernible] and Autodesk, medical imaging companies all over the world. And they're waiting for us to roll this out into the world. And when that -- when we do that, growth will happen for us and will happen for the OEMs. And the same thing for Tesla. When the proof-of-concept is complete and all of these projects in the pipeline are rolled out into production, it will happen, it will generate growth for us and it will generate growth for the OEMs. And so both us and all of our OEM partners and all of our software partners are all intensely focused on bringing this level of innovation to the marketplace so we can all grow.",222,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And this has been one of the next steps in the advancement of semiconductors. There were talks of [indiscernible] technology;  Is now, I guess, yesterday in the metal gate and all of those things are needed to advance semiconductor technology and many others. And so this is just one of the next-generation technologies and semiconductor companies around the world, from TSMC, to GLOBALFOUNDRIES to others, Samsung to others, obviously, has to continue to innovate in order to make semiconductor technology continue to advance, and I fully expect it to. Now in the terms of -- in case of -- your question actually has a larger question, which is how important is semiconductor technology to Mobile Advance? And the answer is a great deal. I mean, without semiconductor technology, how could we have any advance? Whether it's desktop computers or workstations or servers or cell phones, the answer is, of course, very important. But for mobile processors, by far the greatest contributor to low power and efficient performance is architecture. It is the encore. It is the SoC. It is everything that is not the CPU core as well as the CPU core and the process technology and the software technology and the operating system and everything above that. All of it has to come together to deliver on an extraordinary experience, not just the transistor. It's important, but it's just one part of the overall equation.",269,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And the answer is, first of all, yes. And the reason why it's yes is, as you guys may remember, we were not as fast to the DX11 generation as our competition. We lost that step there. And we paid for it early on a couple of years ago, if you recall. And so it took us a while to recover from that position with Fermi. And the first implementation of Fermi, as you recall, wasn't as graceful as we all wanted it to be. And so we had a lot of catching up to do, and we reevaluated the way that we design our chips. We reorganized our engineering, so that we could be more efficient. And we came back really, really strong with the second generation of Fermi and started to gain share again. In the notebook space, the DX11 notebook space, we've been gaining share from our low a couple of quarters ago. And we should improve this quarter, we can improve next quarter and improve even more in the quarter after that. And so I think that our GPU business has every opportunity for growth, and we're expecting it to grow and we have to in the digital computer.",219,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The GeForce consumer side has attached -- the GPU attach, has stabilized and the fastest growing part of GPU attach is China. It also happens to be the fastest growing segment of PCs. And so that's a positive factor. In the Workstation space, we want to reinvent and redefine the workstation and bring digital computing to a new level there with CUDA and computational computer graphics. And of course, in the servers, where we invented a technology called CUDA and used in servers for accelerating applications, numerically intensive applications. And so the server market becomes a large business opportunity for us. And we have several ideas yet that we're going to introduce to the world to increase the adoption of GPUs.

And those 3 million prosumers, probably a whole lot of them already use GeForce. And we just have to keep evangelizing so that they understand how to get the best possible performance from it. But the million, some of them use Final Cut Pro, and that hasn't been optimized for CUDA. And a lot of them use Adobe. And some of them use Sony. And some of them use ABIT. And so GPU acceleration is being incorporated into almost all of them in the near future. And so as more and more of the different suite become GPU accelerated, my expectation, or our expectation, is that the consumers will -- the creative professionals, will incorporate. And so I think it's just a matter of time, and that I just gave you the scope of the overall market opportunity. But over time, I expect those 4 million video users, video editing users, professionals, are all going to be GPU accelerators. And that's one of the reasons why we expect Quadro and GeForce to continue to grow because it's just such a compelling benefit to use GPU acceleration and video editing.",219,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We are still in the still early adoption phase with a foundation of industry by industry by industry by industry that is being built up. There's an overlay, if you will, of baseline business in Tesla that is just strong. It's not huge yet, but it's building. We feel it every single month, there's sell-through every single month, it's in every single geography and there's pick up every single month, just steady pick up every single month. Overlay it with some very large deals every now and then, as data centers gets built out for a high-performance computer. And today, we just really can't build out a supercomputer without GPU acceleration. Because otherwise, the computational capability is just so low relative to anything else that's been built. It's really not possible to have something like that built. And so I think that the supercomputing centers, the store, if you will, the basic baseline run rate of the business. But that's still says that the baseline run rate business from each industry still needs to be developed and we still need to continue to support applications, which we're actively doing and the industry is working with us very, very hard to make sure that their applications are accelerated by our GPUs because the benefits are just so overwhelming. And then when you see 5x to 10x acceleration of an application by porting a small part of the code, you port 10% of the code and you get to 5x, 10x acceleration, that's just really, really too compelling to ignore, especially for people who use their workstations to advance research or for advanced time to market as a positive only, and so one industry after another, we're porting those applications. And then there's the idea of -- and more and more people are seeing their workstations becoming really not just for visualization, but for simulation as well. And I think that that's going to be a large opportunity for us. There's several million workstations sold per year. When those workstations become supercomputing workstations and are used for simulation as well as visualization, I think we're going to see a really significant market opportunity for us, and that's what we're driving towards.",379,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And they have carrier relationships with AT&T and Vodafone and Orange, and so the list is pretty broad.

And we think that we are in positions in the marketplace that allows us to grow quite rapidly. And so we want to get there as quickly as we can. And so this is -- there's always a fine balance, but this is a good balance for now. Some of the areas that could accelerate our gross margins further are Professional Solutions businesses, both Quadro and Tesla. If we can get those 2 businesses growing as we expect to, when it does at a much more significant rate, it will contribute to gross margin improvement in a much more significant way. And so those are 2 of the businesses that we're counting on for growth and we're working incredibly hard to get the new technologies that we've created into the marketplace and so that the market can embrace it and drive our next generation of growth for PSG.

And just as a follow-up, and it sounded like with regard to the Tegra business, the majority of that revenue, I guess, for the first half of the year is coming from the cell phone space.

And so the exact percentages are hard to say. And they will change from quarter-to-quarter, depending on whether it's a phone cycle or a computing cycle. And so I think that, it's suffice to say, that tablets is one of the fastest growing segments of the computer industry. And whether a tablet is a notebook or a notebook is a detachable tablet or transformable tablet, it's really increasingly hard to say. And so I think the growth opportunities for tablets, obviously, is still quite significant ahead of it, and this is an area where we can make a large contribution. On the other hand, the smart phone marketplace is really just begun. There's only -- it only represents the top tier of the overall phone marketplace today. And yet, we all know that someday, every single phone will be a smart phone. Instead of just a couple of hundred million smart phones a year, it would rather represent the full billion units of phones around the world that are sold every year. Every phone in the world in the near future will have the ability to access the Internet and enjoy content and otherwise. So that's an enormous growth opportunity for us and one of the reasons why Icera's so important to us. Okay?",226,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

After our prepared marks, we'll open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up question. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website, and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 18, 2011, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2012. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. 
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-K, for the fiscal period ended January 30, 2011, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All of our statements are made as of today, August 11, 2011. Based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.
With that, let's begin. Our GPU business was strong in Q2, driven by our record quarter for notebook products. Despite typical seasonal weakness in the PC market, we recorded record notebook GPU revenue, increasing our notebook GPU market share by 9% to 50.6% according to Mercury Research.
We launched the GeForce GTX 560M into the heart of the notebook gaming markets, delivering DirectX 11, 1080p gaming, and Optimus technology to notebooks for the first time ever. Optimus Technology optimizes your notebook performance by intelligently delivering power when you need it and conserving it when you don't, completely automatically.
In addition, we launched the world's fastest notebook GPU, the GeForce GTX 580M. The GeForce GTX 580M, along with NVIDIA and Optimus technology, delivers 5 hours of browsing battery life and 100 frames per second performance in Call of Duty: Black Ops.
While our desktop GPU business decreased within typical seasonality, overall desktop GPU attach rate of consumer PCs remained strong at 55%.  We added 2 new desktop products targeted at the sweet spot of the gamer market. First, the GeForce GTX 560 into the extremely popular $199 segment of the desktop gamer market. And secondly, launching new 3D Vision wired glasses, delivering the best 3D PC experience at a new affordable price of $99.
The Sandy Bridge transition continues to drive growth for our discrete GPU business. According to Mercury Research, integrated CPU eroded integrated graphics chipset market share, while discrete GPU attach rates remained constant overall. GPU attach rates actually increased in notebook, from 33% to 36%. Notebook discrete GPU shipments were up 6.7%. Industry press is confirming what we had expected, that while Sandy Bridge graphics still won't come anywhere near the performance of a discrete GPU, according to Tom's Hardware, the combination of a Sandy Bridge CPU with NVIDIA discrete GPU, delivers the best price performance solution for the PC market.
Our enterprise workstation GPU business grew 4%, as the adoption of the Fermi generation continues to ramp. During the quarter, we also launched an extremely important product into the compute market, the Tesla M 2090 GPU, the world's fastest parallel processor for high-performance computing. In the latest version of AMBER 11, one of the most widely used applications for stimulating behaviors of biomolecules, 4 Tesla M 2090 GPUs, coupled with 4 CPUs, delivered the fastest results ever reported, according to Ross Walker, Assistant Research Professor at the San Diego Computer Center, and principal contributor to the AMBER code.
Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra processors and embedded products, increased 37% to $167.7 million, with much of the increase revenues coming from embedded products. We delivered another strong quarter for Tegra, with new Tegra 2 based android products hitting the market. Among them are the Motorola Photon 4G and DROID X2; the world's thinnest, lightest tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1; the Toshiba Tribe; Lenovo IdeaPad K1 and ThinkPad Dell Streak 10 Pro in China.
In addition to new products, Tegra 2 continues to have legs, with new products launching into new regions and with new partners. Consumers can now buy Tegra super phones on all major carriers in the U.S., including T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. In addition, we announced with Alibaba and Tianyu, the first smartphone designed by a China OEM, and the first phone offered by Alibaba.
In May, at Computex 2011 in Taipei, our Tegra 2 processor was selected from more than 400 products, and awarded the prestigious Computex Best Choice Award for smart handheld devices innovation from the Taipei Computer Association.
Our next generation Kal-El processor had a very strong quarter of design wins, with new products launching in time for the holiday season. In addition, our acquisition of Icera lets us expand beyond the super phone and tablet segment, and address mainstream smartphones. With these moves, we believe we are well-positioned to continue our strong momentum with Tegra.
With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.",916,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Revenue for the second quarter was $1.02 billion, up 5.7% sequentially. GAAP gross margin of 51.7% was a record for the fourth consecutive quarter. Gross margin exceeded our expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter, primarily as a result of a more favorable product mix and our GPU and TFB businesses.
GAAP OpEx was $351.3 million, in line with our estimates, as it includes $17.3 million of costs related to Icera, including costs of its ongoing operations and those related to its acquisition.
Combined, these results generated a GAAP net income of $151.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. The dilutive effect of the Icera acquisition, including its results of operations and all acquisition-related costs, was $0.02 per diluted share. Consequently, net of the Icera acquisition, we achieved the high end of our outlook range for the quarter.
Revenue by business segment was as follows. Our GPU business was relatively flat compared to the previous quarter, despite the continued quarter-over-quarter decline in our MCP revenue, as we end-of-life these products. Desktop was seasonally down, while notebook grew strongly, as we continued to gain share through the Sandy Bridge transition.
We also benefited from the first full quarter of licensing revenue from Intel. Our professional business was up 4.2% from the prior quarter. Our Quadro professional graphics business increased sequentially, as we saw a pickup in enterprise IT spending, and as we continued our transition to Fermi generation products. Our Consumer business was up 36.8% over the prior quarter. Much of the increase was driven by game console royalties, which were seasonally up over the prior quarter, and customer refreshes and embedded entertainment products.
Tegra revenue was steady, as the product ramps of our first quarter reached consumer. Icera's revenue contribution was not significant. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.47 billion, down $252 million over the prior quarter, due primarily to the purchase of Icera for approximately $352.2 million. This was partially offset by our cash flow from operations of $82 million. 
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $419.9 million, up $76.7 million sequentially. Although our DSO increased 5 days from 33 to 38, our demand was relatively linear for a fiscal second quarter, and remained under our corporate average.
Our inventories at the end of the quarter were $361.9 million, down 5% from $381 million in the prior quarter, as we actively managed production builds throughout the quarter. 
Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows. We see strengths in our business coming into the third quarter, and expect revenue growth of 4% to 6%. This is despite the ongoing decline from our discontinued MCP business. We expect gross margin in the third quarter to stabilize at the record levels achieved in Q2, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Of course, we will work hard to continue to improve our gross margin.
For operating expenses, we expect GAAP OpEx to be between $361 million and $366 million, with non-GAAP OpEx between $319 million and $321 million.
The increase is primarily related to engineering costs for new product tape outs, verifications and qualification, and to account for a full quarter of Icera's ongoing cost from operations, as well as critical hires in key growth areas. 
While we will continue to control expenses very tightly, we believe continued strategic investment in our business is critical to our company's future growth. In particular, within the mobile space, we will invest in supporting the next generation Windows on Tegra, ramping our baseband processor business and executing on design wins. We believe the tax rate will track near 16% for the rest of the year, resulting in an annual effective tax rate of about 15%. This outlook includes Icera. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.",649,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Because we took it so much more seriously. We were successful on so many different nodes for so long that we all collectively, as an industry, forgot how hard it is. And so one of the things that we did this time around was to set up an entire organization that is dedicated to advanced nodes. And we've had many, many tests chips run on 28-nanometer. We have working silicon and, momentarily, about to go to production with 28-nanometer. And it's looking really good, it's looking much, much better than our experience with 40-nanometer.

The Samsung Galaxy R just went to production. And so those 2 phones are really wonderful phones and the Motorola phones in China just went to production. And so Q2 -- those devices didn't contribute very much to Q2's business. And now, as we look forward to Q3, all of these phones that are ramping up, we now have something like 53 SKUs around the world. And we cover some 16 of the world's top 20 carriers. And so these devices are now just going into production. And so we look forward to seeing how they do. And our results will reflect that. But I think that the indicator that probably makes the most sense for me to watch and for all of us to keep an eye on is just the number of phones that go to production each quarter and the number of countries and carriers that we increasingly expose ourselves to.

The Icera modem technology was just recently approved by a very large carrier for a product acceptance this year. And they were approved for LTE multimode. Some companies have LTE modems and some company have 3G modems. Very few companies have LTE 3G, 4G multimode modems. And they passed 100% of the LTE testing. And in fact, the Icera modem is used in a very large number of the 3GPP industry standards body's testing. And it is the reference by which many modems are tested. And so I think that business will surely be very important to us in the LTE segment. And then a little longer term, our intention is to integrate the modem into our Integra application processors so that we can address this segment that is very fast growing and also very large, the mainstream segment of the smartphone market.",147,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

We're trying to figure it out ourselves, to be honest. Because it's still a relatively small business, as you know. It's on its way to be a couple of $100 million business. And more and more OEMs are adopting it and are bringing it to market. Just this last quarter, we introduced the M 2090 module that goes into data center configurations from HP and Dell. And so we're ramping that business up. But it's still very much, at the moment, an application-driven business. The more applications we have ported, the greater the opportunity we will see. And so I don't know that in the near term right now, that it's tied to GDP or anything like that. I just think it's just way too small of a business to be affected by the global economy. People who are early adopters have very severe computation needs, and those severe needs exist whether the economy is doing well or not. Probably, more than anything right now, the lumpiness of the business comes from, occasionally, very large deals because they go into large data centers. And those design wins and installations don't happen on a regular basis yet. And so every now and then you'll see some lumpiness.

Just because there's just so many phones. And we now have 53 SKUs of phones that are shipping. There'll be more phones shipping next quarter, and then there will be more phones shipping the quarter after that, new phones. And so that -- those are really the only indicators that I know because we're pretty new to this business, CJ, and we ramped it up pretty hard, and we have a whole lot of new design wins on Tegra 2, and we have a whole lot of new design wins on Kal-El. And so the only thing that I can watch is how many design wins do we have? And are they high-quality design wins from high-quality customers and OEMs? And when the phones and the devices come out, are they well-positioned? Are they really well-designed? And are they well-positioned as a product? And then, after that, we really don't know how to judge at the moment how well these devices will do. In terms of is the business on track, I would say that the business is doing better than on track in a sense that our design win momentum is better than ever. And Kal-El, it's going to be world's first quad-core processor. And it's so much higher performance than Tegra 2 and at so much lower power. And very few people have internalized that Kal-El is lower power in every use case compared to Tegra 2. And so this is, it's really a great breakthrough based on the technology we call variable SMP, variable symmetric multiprocessing, that makes it possible for us to achieve much higher performance where performance is needed and much lower power in almost everything that you do.",304,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We're at 150 million run rate. My expectation is that the overall GPU business, if you include the 2 pieces that we have a very large position on, that we by and large drive in the industry, the enterprise GPU business of Quadro and Tesla. If you combine those 2 with the consumer GPU business, the overall GPU business to us should grow faster than that. And so my sense is that the GPU business is going to continue to grow. And how big is it going to be in the coming years is kind of hard to say. But it's grown 100 million to 150 million over the last 5 years. And there was integrated graphics all the way along, there was competition from Intel and AMD all the way along. And so I think that is probably an early -- a good indicator. And on top of that, we've added Quadro and Tesla as growth vehicles for us in the overall GPU business.

And it's nice to -- we have a full platform that is with a great operating system on top of it that embedded customers could use. The embedded business will also grow into auto.

For now, we -- our expectation is that we will gain share in the second half. How much, we don't know yet. And what was the other question? The notebook market, We're seeing all the same commentary that you see in notebooks. And my sense to what's happening is that the netbook part of the market, and the entry-level part of the notebook market is probably under a lot of pressure from tablets. And so in that part of the market, our computing strategy, our strategy is to build tablets, processor for tablets. The segment market that seems to be still relatively robust is the high-end part of the notebook market. As you know, our tablet is really wonderful, but it's no comparison to a high-end notebook. And if you're a high-end notebook customer, you probably have greater computing needs and greater digital content creation needs than a netbook customer. And so I think that tablets are not really a solution for that, but much better a solution for media consumption than media creation. So that segment of the marketplace we see are relatively, relatively, relatively strong. In terms of GPU attach rate, the GPU attach rate around the world is higher than the United States by far. For example, in China, the attach rate is about 80%. And in Europe, the attach rate of GPUs in consumer PCs is about 60 some-odd percent, 60% to 70%. Here, in the United States, the attach rate is only in the 20s. And I don't know exactly why. Maybe it's because people have a greater sense of value outside the United States, maybe people have -- use their PCs for more additional content. But nonetheless, the attach rate is much, much higher outside the United States. And as you know, the growth rate of PCs outside of the United States is higher than United States. And so I think that our GPU position for consumers and high-end notebook segments are doing quite well.",348,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I shall take that offline with you. Second question, Jen-Hsun, if I look at the Tegra business -- or look at the Quadro business, we finally started to see some growth there. I mean, after a few lethargic quarters. How sustainable do you think the improvement we're seeing now is? How much of it is driven by the movement to Fermi? And how much of it is just a large reaction from enterprise in terms of spending, and should we expect this to continue for a few more quarters? I'm not asking you to guide specifically. I'm just trying to understand when you have conversations with your customers, what they're telling you about [indiscernible] Quadro?",116,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

One, you mentioned Fermi. The Fermi GPU is just so much better than the last generation and can do so much more, and so that's one. The other is that people are using workstations for more and more applications. Digital video editing is a very large market and growing. And there's just so much more digital video content being created all over the world. And the third is global expansion, whereas the developing countries used to be a manufacturing-oriented culture and economy, it's increasingly a design-oriented economy. And so in order for movies and advertisement and products to be designed in China, they need workstations to do that. And so that's a really fabulous growth opportunity for us. And so we're seeing usage of workstations in more industries than ever. We're seeing that our GPUs can do more things. At Scene Graphs [ph] this week, we demonstrated a workstation that has the ability to not only visualize, but also simulate and visualize in realtime. It's technology we call Maximus, Quadro Maximus. And so all of these vectors are growth opportunities for workstations. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised to see our workstation business continue to grow for many years to come. And just as the world continues to become more and more of a design environment, design economy, you're going to see other countries develop their capabilities and therefore they need the tools such as workstations.",242,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And in terms of what we should expect from Icera, I apologize if someone has asked this earlier, I dialed in a little late. But in terms of what we should expect from Icera going forward, obviously, I know you said that the contribution this last quarter wasn't material.

The real growth of Icera is going to come from 2 things. One, as we launch our LTE MultiMode modems, their MultiMode modem is fabulous. And it's been fully tested and approved. And we're looking forward to shipping them in tablets early next year. So that's one. That's one growth. Just discrete, high-end, high-speed modems, where they have a really great expertise and something that they've been quite famous for, for a long time. The second area requires us to build a unified chip. And we're in a process of doing that. And that allows us to address the low-end part of the smartphone market with an integrated application processor and baseband. And that part of the marketplace is going to become quite large over the next several years. Analysts estimate that the mainstream smartphone market is going to grow to about 1 billion units by 2015, from a couple of 100 million units today. And so that part of the marketplace is really not well served today by anybody. And we had to go and build a highly integrated versions of application processor and modem that will address that.

Good afternoon and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2012. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website, and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until November 18, 2011, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.

All our statements are made as of today, November 10, 2011. Based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.

With that, let's begin. We're pleased to report a strong third quarter. Our results reflect solid growth in desktop and professional GPUs, as well as our mobile processers, while we executed on key growth drivers for next year. Desktop consumer graphics revenue rose beyond usual seasonal increases, due to strong global demand from PC gamers, driven by highly anticipated blockbuster PC games just starting to hit the shelves.
Electronic Arts Battlefield 3, which launched on October 25, sold 5 million units in the first week, amid critical acclaim in the press, particularly for the highly advanced PC version. The latest installment of the highly successful Call of Duty franchise from Activision, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, launched on November 8. Electronic Arts says pre-orders for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a PC-only online game scheduled for release on December 20, are the highest they have ever seen. We believe this surge of PC gaming demand will drive increased demand for NVIDIA's GeForce products despite the soft consumer PC market.
We expect a multiyear PC gaming cycle, as the PC becomes increasingly more powerful than 5 to 6-year-old gaming consoles. We also kicked off the next generation of 3D gaming with the NVIDIA 3D Vision 2 glasses, with LightBoost technology. The new glasses deliver a superior gaming experience, while NVIDIA's patented LightBoost technology delivers twice the brightness of our last generation solution. 
While sellout attach rates remain stable, NVIDIA discrete graphics notebook revenues were lower in Q3, reflecting a market share drop of 4%. We believe this is due primarily to some Intel loss of shares in CPUs and our absence from Apple notebooks in this design cycle. With the tax rate stable, we believe we are well-positioned with design wins in both Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge notebooks to regain market share in upcoming quarters. 
Sandy Bridge continues to drive growth for our discrete GPU business. According to the latest data from both Mercury Research and John Peddie Research, average discrete GPU attach rates remained constant overall at 36%, while integrated CPU continues to erode integrated graphics chipset market share.
According to Mercury data, average discrete GPU attach rates have now remained flat, within a 2% variation quarter-to-quarter for the last 8 quarters. According to recent press reviews from Forbes to Hardware Canucks, discrete GPUs remain the PC market's first choice for a PC upgrade, while integrated CPU graphics continue to lag far behind the performance of discrete GPUs for the demanding gamer and enthusiast markets. While Sandy Bridge graphics are far below the minimum requirements for today's modern games and application, the combination of a Sandy Bridge CPU, with a GeForce discrete GPU, continues to deliver the best price performance solution for today's PCs.
Our professional GPU had a record revenue quarter on strong professional graphics market demand and continued adoption of the Fermi generation Quadros. During the quarter, we also announced that Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which operates the world's premiere open science computing facilities for the U.S. Department of Energy, will deploy a revolutionary new supercomputer, Titan, based on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.
Its 18,000 Tesla GPUs will deliver roughly 85% of the peak compute performance of Titan. With the potential to deliver over 20 petaflops of key performance, Titan, a Cray XK6 supercomputer, would be more than 2x faster and 3x more energy-efficient than today's fastest supercomputer, Japan's K computer.
Our consumer products business, which includes Tegra processors, delivered solid growth in the quarter. NVIDIA and its partners added 3 more Tegra-based superphones to the 8 already available, the LG Optimus EX, LG Optimus Q2, and Motorola ELECTRIFY. We also added 13 new tablets for a total of 23 currently available, including the ASUS Slider, Sony Tablet S, Sony Tablet P, Toshiba Tribe 7-Inch, the Acer ICONIA A100, Sharp Galapagos eReader, Dell Streak 10, Lenovo ThinkPads, and Samsung's Galaxy Tab 8.9.
We are pleased to see exciting new Tegra 2 devices ramped into production. And we are particularly excited to have introduced 2 days ago, the Tegra 3 processor, and the first Tegra 3 tablet, the groundbreaking ASUS Eee Pad Transformer Prime. It will be on shelves in the U.S. within a few weeks, in time for the holiday season.
Tegra 3 ushers in the next generation of mobile smartphones and tablets. It is the world's first quad core mobile processor, delivering PC-like performance to mobile devices, while enabling ultralow power consumption. The Tegra 3 processor provides up to 3x the graphics performance of Tegra 2, and up to 61% lower power consumption.
This translates into an industry-leading 12 hours of battery life for HD video playback. The Tegra 3 processor implements a new patent pending technology known as Variable Symmetric Multiprocessing, or VSMP. VSMP includes a fifth CPU companion specifically designed for work requiring little power. The four main cores are designed for work requiring high performance and generally consume less power than dual core processors.
With Tegra 3, we begin the next phase of growth for our mobile business. While we are adding more tablet customers with Tegra 3, we are particularly excited to have more and higher volume smartphone design wins with Tegra 3 than we did at Tegra 2's production launch.
We are pleased to officially be in production with Tegra 3, a fundamental growth driver for our mobile business next year.

Revenue for the third quarter was $1.07 billion, up 4.9% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin of 52.5% was a record for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Gross margin exceeded our expectations for the quarter, primarily as a result of strong demand and the high-end segments of our desktop GPU products and record sales in our Quadro professional graphics products. Non-GAAP OpEx was $317.6 million, slightly below our estimate. Combined, these results generated a non-GAAP net income of $217 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, up 12.1% over the prior quarter.
Revenue by business segment was as follows. Our GPU business was up 1% compared with the prior quarter. Desktop GPU revenue was up strongly by 23% in the quarter. This gain was despite a $47.3 million decline in our chipset revenue, as we end-of-life these products and exit the chipset business. Notebook GPU revenue decreased as compared with the prior quarter for the reasons Rob has mentioned.
Our professional business had record revenue in the third quarter, up 9.5%, at $230.3 million. This was largely driven by our record sales in our Quadro professional graphics products. Our Consumer business was up 14% over the prior quarter, primarily through growth in Tegra sales, together with seasonal strength in game console revenue. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were at $2.75 billion, up 11%, or $273.9 million sequentially. Cash flow from operating activities was $244.4 million. Both accounts receivables and inventories were down at the end of the quarter, with DSO improving by 6 days, down to 32 days, and DSI by 10 days, down to 57. Our strong balance sheet position at the end of the quarter reflects the overall strength in our businesses, strong demand and shipment linearity, strong collections and management of inventory. 
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows. Closing on a strong third quarter, we expect revenue to be relatively flat, plus or minus 2%. We expect gross margins to be flat to up 0.5 percentage points from our record levels achieved in Q3 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
For operating expenses, we expect GAAP to be approximately $372 million and non-GAAP at approximately $330 million. The increase is primarily related to planned hiring in our strategic investment areas, as well as engineering costs related to new products as we bring them into production. We expect the tax rate to be between 14% and 16% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, excluding any discrete tax events that may occur during the quarter.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.",443,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We're expecting GeForce desktop to be up, and we're expecting that to be up nicely, driven by the hit games that Rob talked about. This is likely a multiyear cycle of growth for PC gaming. This happens every major game console cycle towards the second half of its product life, because PC technology advances on a regular basis instead of once every 7 to 10 years. And so you could imagine how PC technology is dramatically better than a game console today, and you're starting to see that now with a new generation of games that are coming out, such as Battlefield 3. We're expecting Notebook to be flat to slightly down. We're expecting Quadro to be up. We already had a record quarter this quarter. Quadro is benefiting from the Fermi adoption. It's also benefiting from the fact that China and India and the other developing countries are increasingly moving to a design economy rather than just a manufacturing or a second sourcing economy. And so when China and India, particularly, move to design economies, the single most important tool of modern design is a workstation. And our market share in workstations is very good. So we're going to benefit from that for quite some time. Tesla is expected to be flat, and mobile is expected to be flat. And we'll see how the devices that have gone into production this quarter do in the marketplace. I think we had something along the lines of about 17, or 16, or 17 new devices that went into production, many new tablets, as Rob mentioned, and new phones.",270,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

In fact, for most of our high-end products, the ones that PC gamers buy are particularly low at the moment. And so it reflects the demand that we're seeing. With respect to Thailand, the projection that we gave reflects how we view the marketplace as of now. If you look at the dynamics of the shortage, for some of our markets, it's really a nonfactor, for example, mobile, obviously, because we don't use hard disk drive in mobile, and you could argue that the money isn't spent in mobile is -- in PCs, could be spent in mobile. You could also see that in some of our other segments, where workstations, Tesla, and the high-end PCs, because the value in the margins are so good for our PC OEMs. In times of shortage, those particular platforms and segments are prioritized.

And this is an area where we could add a lot of value. And so Tegra 2 came in to the segment that now people recognize to be quite an exciting segment, and we called it the super phone segment. The super phone segment is not insignificant. And as the segment -- as mobile devices become increasingly important to people's lives, and they recognize in the second and the third smartphone that they bought, that how wonderful they are, they tend to buy up. The characteristic is very consistent with that of people who buy cars, to people who buy PCs. That the first PC they buy, because they're not exactly sure how they would use it, they tend to buy in the mainstream segment. And over time, they buy a better and better one because realize how much their lives has been involved in it. We see the same thing in the superphones segment. And this is likely to be quite a good growth segment for us. We have more design wins in Tegra 3 today than we had at Tegra 2. We have more design wins, more devices, more OEMs. We didn't win them all. There are some that we lost. Motorola was one that I'm personally disappointed in not winning this cycle around. But the net, we have more designs and more OEMs going into next year. As a result related to the long-term plan, our goal is to continue to do a variety in the superphones segment, with amazing features for this segment. But in addition to that, with the Icera acquisition, we're now able to integrate the application processor and LT component into a single processor. This is a very large focus for a company at the moment. Part of our increase in OpEx is related to our efforts in this area. We think we can have a lot of value in bringing this capability into the mainstream segment.

I think we've seen Texas Instruments be quite aggressive in some of the lower end tablets and some of the lower end smartphones, I think you just alluded to that in your answer to the previous question. Can you talk about your plans for Tegra 2 versus Tegra 3? Do you intend to continue with Tegra 2 production at a lower price to kind of capture that low end of the market with Tegra 3 attacking in the high end? Or do you just continue to want to attack the superphone market with Tegra 3 only?",112,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

There were a couple of tablets this year, if I look at overall the year, obviously, our tablet design wins are numerous and beyond count at the moment. There are many segments of the marketplace that we serve now, all the way from very high design content tablets in 10-inch to now increasingly many 7-inch tablets that are coming out to the marketplace. There were a couple of design wins that I wish we had this year that we didn't have. I already mentioned Motorola. We were surprised by the Amazon Fire. But frankly, we're not going to be surprised again. And so we're obviously very excited about Amazon and want to do our best to be a partner of theirs someday. And so I think those were the 2 main ones that I can really, really highlight. With respect to Tegra 2 versus Tegra 3, Tegra 2 will continue to ship into the marketplace. 3 new phones were introduced just this week -- or just this last quarter, and we're expecting to see those phones continue to ship. Tegra 3 is going to come into the marketplace in tablets ranging from 7-inch all the way to 10-inch. And the reason why Tegra 3 is such a both very high-performance as well as super affordable, it's because the battery life that was made possible by the technologies that are inside Tegra 3 that we talked about -- Rob talked about variable SMP as fifth core, which is essentially like an electric hybrid engine for Tegra 3. It consumes so little energy that the battery life could be much, much longer for Tegra 3 tablets. As a result, you could -- when battery life is long and the power is, and the processor is very energy-efficient, you can save enormous amount of cost around the system. There's a second great technology in the Tegra 3, it's called DIAdem, and it's the ability to per pixel, per frame, per scene to modulate the backlight so quickly that we over a long period of time, reduce the amount of backlight intensity and backlight energy by nearly half. We save as much power in the backlight without changing the visual fidelity at all to save, essentially, the entire power used by our chip. And so saving power, energy efficiency translates to reduced system bill of material. And as a result of the things, people are finding that they could take a Tegra 3 tablets both into very high segments because of its performance, as well as into very affordable devices, like 7-inch and such. And then, of course, Tegra 3 is going to revolutionize the smartphone market again by bringing quad core and a new level of capability this year. And it's going to be pretty exciting year for us on superphones.",471,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

And then as a follow-up, on the OpEx trajectory, you're guiding that up partly on the strategic new programs and partly, I assume, just on 28-nanometer new products and the sort of normal course of things on GPUs. Can you talk about how much is coming from each of those areas? And whether we should expect OpEx to continue to go up the similar rate in future quarters?",71,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We have more notebook design wins for the Ivy Bridge cyle than we ever had in notebooks. And this is likely the most successful notebook cycle we've ever experienced. And so we've got a lot of engineers dedicated to getting those notebooks into production. The reason for our success, I believe, is because our Kepler generation of GPU was designed for intense energy efficiency. And with energy efficiency, we were able to translate that to simultaneously higher performance, as well as longer battery life. And so that's the first part. The second thing is we have more smartphones in design as a result of Tegra 3. We have more tablets in design as a result of Tegra 3. And on top of that, we have Windows 8 tablets and devices that we're building all over the world. And so those, all of those design wins translate to quite a bit of customer engineering, customer-facing engineering, to build these exquisite devices.

Partly, you're going to have to ask Motorola. I think that, one, our rhythm is once every year. And Tegra 2 came into production a year ago, Tegra 3 is in production now. And for Motorola, they had their own internal rhythm and OMAP 4 was right in between Tegra 2 and Tegra 3. And they felt that OMAP 4 was a better processor than Tegra 2. Obviously, I feel different. And but Motorola made their choice. Second thing is, Tegra 3 is obviously more -- surely more value than OMAP 4 by a lot. At this point, I think it's very, very clear that OMAP -- or Tegra 3 is in a completely different class than OMAP 4. And so it was difficult for us to be price competitive relative to OMAP 4. And so I think that those 2 things play a role. We all have different perspectives on when new technology could be adopted in the marketplace. And we felt that last year was the year of the dual core processor. And dual core processors are dual core processors. It's been done. And now Tegra 3 is really bringing a new level of capability with variable S&P, 5 processors on a chip, as well as energy efficiency that's really never been seen before in the mobile world. And the combination of a much higher capability in performance, as well as much, much higher efficiency, and therefore battery life, we felt that we could bring a new capability to the mobile area. And so that was our perspective. And I think it's becoming increasingly clear that by the early part of next year, that superphones will have quad core. And I think we'll see how it plays out from here. But we'll work super hard to get back into Motorola. And obviously, very important partner, and they build amazing phones. And it would be a privilege and a pleasure to be part of them again.",335,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

But there are no -- if we're still talking about Tegra 3, there is no Tegra 3 that's $15. It's higher than that. And -- but Tegra 3 and OMAP 4 aren't targeting the same generation of devices and we're not targeting the same market. And so Tegra 3 is really designed for superphones. Tegra 3 is really designed for next-generation tablets. The thing that is -- so when you compare on a device per device level, processor to processor level, it's really hard to make that comparison. However, when you compare it at the system level, Tegra 3 is about cost equivalent. It's sometimes cost advantaged relative to last generation devices, including Tegra 2. And the reason for that is because Tegra 3 is so energy efficient, that it actually reduces your bomb cost, the system bomb cost, and by a fair amount. And so variable SMP and DIAdem, our image processing technology, makes it possible for us to reduce quite a -- some $10 worth of system reduction relative to last generation, and still be higher performance, and still be longer battery life. And so I think those things, when taken into consideration, is explaining why now that people understand what Tegra 3 can do and they realize it's really the right platform to invest in going forward. The advantage of investing in Tegra 3 now is even more important when you consider the processor we have beyond it, which is the integration of Tegra and an LTE modem. All of the software effort that is invested into Tegra 3 translates directly into the mainstream products and entry-level products towards the end of next year.",285,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We are working very, very hard right now on all of these devices, and I'll answer it backwards. The reason why we expect Tegra 3 to be more successful than Tegra 2 is, one, we have much, much more experience in building these mobile devices than we did before. And there's not a single mobile -- there's not a single cell phone company that I know who looks at us and say, do you know anything about building phones? Everybody is well past that. They think not only are we -- do we know how to build phones, we're fabulous at building phones with them. And so I think that the velocity of engagement is much greater than it used to be, both on our side, as well as on their side. We have more phones in development now than we did in Tegra 2. We have more tablets in development. And we have more OEMs than we had in Tegra 2. And then not to mention on top of that, Windows 8. But even in the absence of Windows 8, we have far more OEMs and devices in development today than we did with Tegra 2.",198,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And then also, with regard to your comments earlier around OMAP, how do you get the industry taking advantage of all quad cores, the quad core architecture, especially when the mainstream is going to be dual core?

And so my expectation is that Q1 is an appropriate time for most of these -- for many of these devices to come to market. But we'll get there as quickly as we can. Quad core is already utilized by a lot of applications. And whether it's imaging applications, which, as you know, is a very large reason why you would like to have snappiness and processing capability on a mobile device, whether it's computational photography or augmented reality, or many of these type of new capabilities really need to have a lot more processing. The way that you load a website, it's multi-threaded. When you play a game, most of these games are ported from, most of these high-end games, are ported from engines that are developed already for game consoles and PCs, and both of those platforms are already heavily multi-threaded. I think there's 6 processors inside the Xbox, 6 threads. And I think inside the PlayStation 3, there's, well, geez, countless threads. I think something like 8 or 16 threads. And so 4 threads is very usable by many of these, that will be consumed by many of these applications.",210,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

When you think about China and India, I think that most people would say that these are economies that have been driven by outsourcing from the United States and also manufacturing revenues from opportunities from the West. But increasingly, as the economy develops and their local consumption increases, the local economy will move and will transition to design economies as well. And so whereas you need factories to outsource, and you need PCs to outsource our IT jobs in order to move into the design economy, whether it's Tata or just recently, one of the most ambitious digital projects in the history of India, Ra.One, was done with NVIDIA's technology. And as you know, Bollywood is many times larger than Hollywood in terms of the number of movies and the number of fans that support that industry. And that industry is moving completely to digital, as we have done here in the United States and in the West. Tata, the car company. In China, the focus of their economy has moved towards much more indigenous IP design and indigenous industrial design, and that requires workstations. Over time, I would expect that the size of the Quadro business will reflect the size of the economy. If China becomes as large as the United States in terms of the size of their economy, I would expect the Quadro opportunity in China would be as large as it is here in the United States.

But we recognize that -- and the reason for that success was a technology called Optimus that invisibly and automatically makes it so that GPU can be in high-performance state or in extremely low power state without intervention from the user, that it just figures it out by itself. And as a result, you have very high performance when you need it, and you have extremely long battery life when you need it. The thing that kept us from being even more successful is that our processor could've been more energy-efficient in itself. And so one of the things that we dedicated ourselves to do with Kepler was to focus an enormous amount of our energy on creating an architecture that was energy efficient. And the result is just really, really fabulous. And so our customers see that, they understand the benefit of it. And in combination, between Kepler and Optimus, we just have a great solution. And we just have a great, great, great solution. And this is probably as competitive as we've ever been in the Notebook segment. Project Denver, our focus there is to supplement, add to arms capabilities by extending the arms architecture to segments in a marketplace that they're not, themselves, focused on. And there are some segments in the marketplace where single-threaded performance is still very important and 64 bit is vital. And so we dedicated ourselves to create a new architecture that extends the ARM instruction set, which is inherently very energy-efficient already, and extend it to high-performance segments that we need for our company to grow our market. And we're busily working on Denver. It is on track. And our expectation is that we'll talk about it more, hopefully, towards the end of next year.

I think the -- Tegra 2 is the only device, it's a sole source device in the devices that we're in. And so we have a relatively close relationship with our OEMs. And it really is not second source. I think that with respect to other components in the system, oftentimes, they're second sourced, and oftentimes, they're cost reduced in the middle of the cycle. And we put a lot of our energy working with our OEMs, improving the overall bill material cost of the system even throughout the entire product cycle.

And as a follow-up, can you give us a sense of what the unit or sales mix have been between smart phones and tablets this year? And what do you think it's sort of shaping up to be for next year?

So any sense of how much of your growth prospects depend more on tablets rather than smartphones, I think are a useful indication for us.",96,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

I think the overall mix is higher units in phones, but about equal mix, relatively equal mix in terms of overall revenues. In terms of tablets, Android tablets, I think that the early response was premature. It is the case that there are many things that we could've done better. But it is also the case that the OEMs, ourselves, Google, really rolled up our sleeves and addressed many of the challenges that kept it from being more successful right out the gate. You see now that these tablets are much more affordable. They're available in multiple sizes, from 5-inch, to 7-inch, to 8-inch, to 9-inch, to 10-inch. Some of them are foldable. Some of them are transformable. And so there's all kinds of different types of manifestations and realizations of the Android tablet. My understanding is that the Android tablet has now grown from approximately 0% in the March timeframe to now about 1/3 of the overall tablet market. And we represent about 2/3 of that. And my sense is that, that's going to continue to grow. One of the things that I really love about Honeycomb 3.2 and then even more so with Ice Cream Sandwich, is that the applications that are -- that you have on your smartphone will work wonderfully on your tablet and vice versa. That the marketplace can now take advantage of the incredibly large install base of Android phones to support applications that would benefit the tablet. So I think that, that strategy is ingenious. And I think that the Android team has done a fabulous job implementing that strategy. So I think that starting with Honeycomb 3.2, and surely all these various form factors and price points and device sizes, and then also Ice Cream Sandwich, will surely accelerate that. So I have a lot of -- I'm very enthusiastic about the Android tablets. But having said that, the Android phone, the market is just enormous and growing quickly. It is, I think in the United States, it's already the highest market share. I think the last month or last quarter, it reached something like 64% market share, in United States. Pretty extraordinary growth. And in China, Android, or the base of Android, surely is growing very, very quickly as well. So I think that the smartphone market is going to continue to be very vibrant on Android. And that will only fuel, and that will only feed the Android tablet market, as well, over time. And I think we're seeing all of those dynamics now. So I'm much more enthusiastic about the tablet today than I was when it first launched. And I think the results would suggest that, that's right.",451,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And the lower your power and the more energy-efficient you are, the more you could reduce some system costs, and/or use external devices that are much more affordable, but consumes a little bit more energy because the core processor, which is where most of the energy is consumed, is so efficient. And so when you're looking at a tablet and then you think about an application processor that's about $20, it doesn't represent a very large percentage of the overall cost actually. And so the application processor is often not the issue. The issue is everything else. And what we've done is we've taken a holistic system approach, and we thought about the energy consumed by the backlight. We thought about the energy consumed by the memory and the rest of the system. And we were able to dramatically reduce that through architecture, and that's implemented in Tegra 3. And so that's kind of the highest level on what we've done, and I think our customers are really, really excited by the system cost reduction we were able to bring them.",215,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Just another question, please, to follow up from that. In terms of the handsets design wins you're getting, I mean, Tegra 2 started off with quite a few handsets and, obviously, the revenue kind of started out strong and flatlined for a while. As we look at the design wins for Tegra 3, I have 2 questions. One is, how much more confident are you that one of these design wins will suddenly translate to big revenue? Obviously, this is not something within your control. But I'm just trying to gauge your level of confidence. And then 2, with more design wins, do you have to spend more OpEx to support it? And if the revenue doesn't come through, is there any flexibility as to being able to make your model a little bit less saddled with higher fixed costs while the design wins are not necessarily shipping as aggressively? I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to say. But I'm just trying to understand that, if I look at the experience of Tegra 2 into Tegra 3, how shall I believe the revenue will come through?",190,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

We have more design wins. We're better at it. We surely are much, much better at it today than we were a year ago. We have a lot more engineers. We are engaging with a lot more customers, working on a lot more devices that will enter into the marketplace earlier than we entered into this year. By the time that we started shipping, it was really dribbles and drabs in April. And I think we're going to go into this coming year with a pretty good running start. And so if you're asking me about my confidence, I'm surely more confident now with a year of building mobile devices behind me and the level of expertise that we've been able to develop over the years. And I think the reputation of our company, the trust that our OEMs now have in us, and the leadership position we have with our processor, Tegra 3, is pretty unambiguous. And so I think I surely feel more confident today than I did on the Tegra 2 cycle. With respect to investment, we're investing in both our Notebook PC growth, we're investing in our PC growth, as well as our mobile devices growth. And we believe that we're addressing very large TAMs, and irrespective of whatever experience, albeit I'm more confident right now in your scenario, even if in that scenario that you hypothesized about, I'm fully committed to this marketplace. I believe that the future is visual. I believe that the future is mobile. And we're going to invest into it. We're looking at a $25 billion TAM in some 4, 5 years, and we're going to after it.

You should actually go see Ra.One, it's a great movie. I was surprised to see, your marketing guys did a great job with the product placement, it was right front and center. My question, a little bit longer-term. What does -- you talked about it a little bit, what does V8 give you? You talked about high-performance computing. Are you also hoping to take that into low-power servers? And then just around that, how did the dynamics change? Because there's a lot of ARM licensees, but you guys are the lead licensees for ARM V8?",101,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

I guess -- let's see, where do I start? I think the Denver -- I wanted to make sure that I don't repeat myself. But the Denver architecture is intended to extend the ARM instruction set into segments where ARM is not naturally likely to go themselves. And it's designed to be -- to bring a new level of performance and efficiency to the ARM instruction set beyond where they currently are. And it's not because ARM is not able to design these things. It's because our market focus is perfectly aligned with ARM in some areas, like mobile, and tablets, and clamshells. But in some areas that are very important to us, they're rather non-markets for them today. And we, in partnering with them, could add value by bringing the ARM instruction set into segments of the marketplace that are very important to us. There are also segments in the marketplace, and you mentioned high-performance computing, there are segments in the marketplace that desperately would like to see an energy-efficient instruction set architecture, like massively parallel processing in supercomputing. Or in a very energy-efficient high throughput servers. And so these are opportunities that are very interesting to us as well. And as we get closer to the release of Denver, we'll reveal more and more of the strategies that are related to Denver. And I think you're going to be as blown away and as excited as I am.",243,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
