Each of our businesses grew significantly and set new annual revenue record, highlighted by data center revenue more than doubling year-over-year.  
Annual revenue grew 68% to a record $16.4 billion, and we expanded gross margin for the sixth straight year. We also delivered record net income and EPS, both of which more than doubled year-over-year.  
Looking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year exceptionally strong with our sixth straight quarter of greater than 45% year-over-year revenue growth. Fourth quarter revenue grew 49% from a year ago to a record $4.8 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 5 percentage points and doubled operating income year-over-year.  
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, driven by growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. Record client computing revenue grew by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, led by record notebook sales. We saw strong demand for premium AMD notebooks and our higher-end desktop CPUs in the quarter as Ryzen 5000 processor unit shipments grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share for the seventh straight quarter.  
We launched our Ryzen 6000 series notebook CPUs at CES last month, featuring our new Zen 3+ core that further extends the leadership compute, gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors. We increased the number of premium gaming and commercial design wins from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other major PC providers to more than 200, including more than 20 AMD Advantage notebooks that combine Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs and Radeon Software to deliver the ultimate gaming experience.  
We also provided the first public demonstration of our upcoming Ryzen 7000 desktop processors at CES. Ryzen 7000 series desktop GPUs provide a significant performance increase compared to our current Ryzen processors by combining our high-performance 5-nanometer Zen 4 core with our next-generation memory and I/O technologies in the new AM5 socket.  There's a lot of excitement in the market for our next-gen Ryzen desktop processors and we're on track to launch in the second half of 2022.  
In Graphics, revenue more than doubled year-over-year for the third straight quarter. Radeon 6000 series GPU unit shipments and revenue both grew by double-digit percentages sequentially, led by strong demand across our RDNA 2 desktop family. At CES, we announced that we expanded our Radeon 6000 series GPU portfolio with our first mainstream RDNA 2 desktop GPU priced at $199.  
We also introduced new mobile GPUs that deliver up to 20% more performance than our prior generation and our first mobile graphics chips for thin and light gaming notebooks. Data center graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year, driven largely by HPC wins for our latest Instinct MI200 accelerators. We are seeing growing customer engagements for our data center GPUs based on the leadership AI and HPC performance of our new MI200 accelerators, highlighted by multiple supercomputing wins and an expanded set of platforms on track to launch from Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Supermicro and others starting later this quarter.  
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 75% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, driven by record EPYC processor and semi-custom sales. Semi-custom sales increased year-over-year as the current game console cycle continues outpacing all prior generations. We expect revenue to grow this year driven by continued strong demand for the latest Microsoft and Sony consoles.  
Turning to Server. We had another outstanding quarter. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by demand across both cloud and enterprise customers. In cloud, revenue more than doubled year-over-year as the largest providers expanded internal deployments and more than 130 new AMD-powered instances launched from Amazon Web Services, Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure and others.  
Microsoft Azure previewed a new HPC instance, powered by our third-gen EPYC processors with 3D stack memory that delivers up to 80% more performance than currently available instances. Our differentiated 3D stacking technology further extends the leadership performance of EPYC processors and technical computing workloads like EDA, fluid dynamics and complex simulations. We started volume production of EPYC processors with 3D stacked memory earlier this quarter in advance of OEM platform launches with all our major server partners.  
In Enterprise, revenue doubled year-over-year, driven by the ongoing ramp of more than 100 third-gen EPYC platforms available from Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco and others. In HPC, EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the November TOP500 fastest supercomputers list, tripling year-over-year to 73. EPYC processors also dominated the Green500 list and are now powering 8 of the top 10 most efficient supercomputers in the world.  
Turning to our overall data center business. We made outstanding progress in the last year. We exited 2021 with data center revenue contributing a mid-20 percentage of overall revenue, and we expect 2022 to be another year of significant growth based on the strong customer demand signals for our current and next-generation products.  
In November, we provided first details of our next-generation EPYC processor, codenamed Genoa, that will feature up to 96 Zen 4 cores and next-generation memory and I/O technologies including breakthrough memory expansion capabilities. Customer excitement for Genoa is extremely high as it extends our performance leadership across a broad range of workloads.  
We also announced the addition of Bergamo to our server road map, featuring a version of our Zen 4 core called Zen 4c that has been specifically optimized for cloud-native computing. Bergamo is a high-core count, power-efficient CPU that can be used in the same platforms as Genoa. It will feature up to 128 CPU cores and deliver significant performance and power efficiency advantages for cloud workloads. We are sampling Genoa processors to customers now and are on track to launch later this year, with Bergamo shipments planned to follow in the first half of 2023. 
Turning to our Xilinx acquisition. We were pleased to announce that China's State Administration for Market Regulation approved the transaction on January 27. The only remaining regulatory approval required is FTC approval of our HSR refiling, and we expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2022. I am more excited than ever about the benefits of the acquisition for both AMD and Xilinx stakeholders. Customer excitement is also high as they look forward to the opportunity to deepen their strategic engagements with AMD based on our expanded technology and solutions portfolio.  
In summary, I am incredibly proud of our performance in 2021. Our record annual results highlight our strong execution over multiple years to establish the technical, operational and strategic foundation to position AMD as a high-performance computing leader. Each of our businesses performed extremely well in 2021 with growth significantly ahead of the long-term financial model we outlined at our Financial Analyst Day in 2020. 
I want to take a moment to recognize and thank the AMD employees whose passion, dedication and execution have enabled this success.  
Turning to 2022. Demand for our product is very strong, and we look forward to another year of significant growth and share gains as we ramp our current products and launch our next wave of Zen core CPUs and RDNA 3 GPUs. We have also made significant investments to secure the capacity needed to support our growth in 2022 and beyond.  
Looking out over the long term, we are confident in our ability to continue growing significantly faster than the market based on our expanded road map investments and the deep relationships we have established with a broad set of customers who view AMD as a strategic enabler of their success.  
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder?",1330,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2022",2022-02-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3301.0,2483841.0,94204941.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong 2021 with increased demand for our products. Excellent execution resulted in record annual revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability and significant cash flow generation.  
For fourth quarter 2021, revenue of $4.8 billion was our sixth consecutive quarterly record, up 49% from a year ago driven by strong revenue increases across all businesses. Gross margin was 50%, up 560 basis points from a year ago, driven by a richer mix of products and data center revenue growth. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion compared to $789 million a year ago as we increased investments in our long-term product road maps to support the significant growth trajectory of our business. Operating income doubled from a year ago to a record $1.3 billion, up $665 million primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 27%, up from 20% a year ago.  
Net income was a record $1.1 billion, up $486 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.92 compared to $0.52 per share a year ago. This includes a 15% effective tax rate compared to a 3% rate a year ago.  
Now turning to fourth quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by higher graphics and client processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $566 million or 22% of revenue compared to $420 million a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 75% from $1.3 billion the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by significantly higher EPYC processor and Semi-Custom sales. EESC segment operating income grew significantly to $762 million or 34% of revenue compared to $243 million or 19% a year ago. Operating income growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and richer product mix, partially offset by higher R&D and go-to-market expenses. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at year-end. As we continue returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased $756 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and closed out the year with $1.8 billion of repurchases. Additionally, we have repurchased $1 billion to date in the first quarter of 2022 and have $1.2 billion remaining under the authorized $4 billion share repurchase plan. Quarterly free cash flow was $736 million compared to $480 million in the same quarter last year and $764 million in the prior quarter. Inventory was $2 billion, up $53 million from the prior quarter. 
Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2021 revenue was $16.4 billion, up 68% year-on-year, driven by strong growth across all businesses. Gross margin was 48%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, driven by the strength and competitiveness of our EPYC, Radeon and Ryzen processors. Operating expenses were 24% of revenue compared to 28% in 2020. 2021 operating income was up 146% from a year ago to $4.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 25% compared to 17% in 2020. 
Net income was $3.4 billion, up 118% from the prior year. Full year free cash flow was a record $3.2 billion, resulting in free cash flow margin of 20% for the year. In addition, we invested approximately $1 billion during 2021 in long-term supply chain capacity to support our expectations for future revenue and market share growth. 
Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer signals and does not contemplate the addition of Xilinx as that transaction has not yet closed. First quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be approximately $5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 45% year-over-year and approximately 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The quarter-on-quarter increase is expected to be driven by higher server and client revenue. In addition, for Q1 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50.5%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.2 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $207 million based on a 15% effective tax rate; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.22 billion shares. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $21.5 billion, an increase of approximately 31%, driven by growth across all businesses. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%. And non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 9% due primarily to the U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits in 2022. 
In closing, we had an outstanding quarter and an excellent year with very strong revenue growth and numerous financial records. As we enter 2022, our leadership products and growing customer momentum continue to position us very well for long-term growth. I look forward to AMD delivering another year of very strong financial performance.

Thanks for the question. So for 2022, I mean our current view is that we'll see growth in all of our businesses. We see strong demand for our products as well as we have increased supply capability given what we've done with our partners. 
So relative to the growth from the different businesses, the growth will be led by server. So from what we see from customers and sort of design wins and platforms and all that, server will be very strong next year. But we also expect growth from our other businesses, including consoles, including our PC business, our graphics business and our embedded business. So we expect the percentage of data center to continue to increase as we go into next year, and we'll give more on that as we go through the year.",138,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Excited to see what that brings and obviously, the strong results. 
One of the questions I'm getting tonight is with such a strong start, greater than 30% guidance for revenue in 2022, can you just kind of walk us through maybe with a little more specificity, some of the things that you've done in the supply chain around substrate, around back-end test and package, around wafer demand and just to give people comfort that there's coverage there and visibility and the potential for upside, particularly as you take server and desktop on the 5-nanometer. I imagine, 7-nanometer capacity won't go away. It will stay as that new capacity comes online.

Thanks for the question. So we've been working on sort of the supply chain really for the last 4 or 5 quarters knowing the growth that we have from a product standpoint and the visibility that we have from customers. So in regards to your question on 2022 supply environment, we made significant investments in wafer capacity as well as substrate capacity and back-end capacity. We feel very good about our progress in the supply chain to meet the 2022 guidance. And our goal is, frankly, to have enough supply to satisfy the demand out there. So our view is we're going to continue to work with our partners and our customers to ensure that we know what they need. And likewise, our capacity investments are for 2022, but also beyond '22 because as the business grows, we need to continue to forecast and make plans for that, and that's what we've been working on.",158,8.0,5.0,0.9444444444444444,0.5

Just as a follow-up, I've been hearing more and more, and as you guys roll out the 5-nanometer portfolio, many of those products in server and in desktop will include next-generation Infinity Fabric.

Well, we're very excited about our 5-nanometer products. I think Zen 4 is very critical. It's a focus for this year for both our server road map as well as our client road map. And then the work with the Infinity Fabric really -- really is just on top of that and allows us to continue to optimize sort of the AMD CPU and GPU ecosystem together. So whether on the data center side, with our data center GPU products, working with EPYC in high-performance computing or on the PC side, when we have our AMD APUs plus our discrete graphics plus the software on top.

Lisa, I just want to talk about the computing segment, the client computing side. At least in my model, that was a significant portion of the upside in the quarter after, I believe, last quarter, you talked about not wanting to fill the channel and make sure you shift according to demand. So in the near term, what changed? And perhaps more importantly, as you look into 2022, it appears that you're planning for significant share gains to continue in that sector.

So your question about the Computing and Graphics segment. Look, our focus in this segment is to be very closely aligned with our customers and what they're doing in the market. So we've been monitoring sell-in and sell-out and sell-through trends very carefully. I think the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter was very much a result of sort of the product strength. And we saw very nice notebook demand continuing at the premium part of the market in commercial, gaming, premium ultrathin. So we believe that the PC performance was a bit above our original guidance, but we believe that was to match end user demand. 
Going into 2022. Again, same story. I think the -- what we see is 2021 was a strong year for PCs. Overall, the industry shipped approximately 350 million units. I think our view is that 2022 will be roughly flattish from a unit standpoint. But we will see some mix changes in there with enterprise and premium being stronger than, for example, low end and education. 
So from our standpoint, it's revenue share that we believe we can gain. It's the strength of our Ryzen 6000 series that we just launched at CES. We have 200 platforms from all of the OEM customers. And we have pretty good visibility in working with our customers on that. So -- and I think we feel good about it. And again, the client business is one of -- all of our businesses will grow. And I like that diversity, frankly, in the portfolio. But we feel good about the progress we've made in PCs, and we'll continue to ensure that we're matching sell-in with sell-out so that there is not inventory build in the business.",293,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Well, I would say the way to think about pricing is the industry has seen some price increases across the supply chain. And that's as to be expected given the amount of capacity that we're all putting on to satisfy the strong demand. So we're always in this for the long term and working with our supply chain partners as well as our customers to ensure that we find a way to kind of share the additional costs. But our focus is on ensuring that we have the supply to meet the high demand. And I think what you're seeing is growth in the model from the standpoint that we've always kind of said we're under-represented in the business.

Your competitor, Intel, is launching their Sapphire Rapids platform. They seem to be very excited about that. They're adding a lot of capacity in their fabs. Yet enterprise spending, which has tended to favor them in the past, right, is also coming back. So I'm just curious, how are you thinking about AMD's ability to gain more share in servers this year?",81,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So look, we always expect the competitive environment to be very strong and very aggressive. And that's the way we plan our business. That being the case, I think we're very happy with the growth that we've seen in the business sort of last year. And as we look forward, we see opportunities in both cloud and enterprise. 
On the cloud side, we're in 10 of the largest hyperscalers in the world -- are using AMD. As they get familiar with us over multiple generations, they're expanding the workloads that they're using AMD on. So we see that across internal and external workloads. 
In the enterprise segment, we doubled year over year here in 2021. We continue to add more field support to have more people get familiar with our architecture. We have very strong OEM relationships. So I feel very good about our server trajectory. And yes, it's very competitive out there. But we think the data center business is a secular growth business. And within that, we can grow significantly faster than the market.",178,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

For my follow-up, Lisa, the semiconductor industry just went through a very tough time last year and even into this year, given all the supply shortages. I'm curious, what has that done to help you build stronger relationships with your customers who are perhaps looking for a more consistent execution on the road map and more reliable sources of supply? So how is the shortage environment in semis changed the way customers are looking at AMD today than how they used to look at you historically?",88,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think, Vivek, the most important thing that we are sort of working on with our customers is really consistent execution. And so when you look at the last year and sort of some of the supply-demand imbalance, it has actually caused us to work much, much more closely with our customers. I think we have -- we're talking about visibility now multiple quarters and, in some cases, multiple years out. For the type of capacity that we're talking about for the size of the customers that we're talking to, we need to do that to plan to have the capability to support all of that capability. So overall, I think we have definitely deepened the relationships with the customers. And by the way, also, we've deepened the relationships with our supply chain partners. So I think the entire sort of -- the entire food chain needs to come together to deliver on the very strong demand that's out there.

Thanks for the question. So yes, our guide in Q1 actually is up sequentially. Usually, we're down sequentially, just given normal seasonality, but the demand patterns are such that demand is strong and we have additional supply coming on board, and so that's why we're guiding sequentially up. 
As it relates to CPU inventory, whether in PCs or in servers, we don't believe there is any significant inventory of our products, whether at our customers or sort of in the retailer channel. So from that standpoint, I think we've been watching very carefully the sell-in and sell-through patterns, and we believe we're matched to end-user demand.",108,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

How has your view on the company and sort of the technology and the potential revenue synergies going forward evolved at all? I know you're still waiting to close this thing.

First, I'm wondering if you could just help me better understand the fungibility of your capacity planning throughout the year, i.e., I understand that your view on the PC market this year is sort of flattish with a better mix and you gaining share. But in the event that come midyear that were to change and perhaps be a little bit worse than thought, do you have the ability to re-jigger your sort of supply chain to move towards server and CPU?

So we've done numerous cross-qualifications and new factory bring-ups and all of that stuff. So I would say it's not 100% fungible, but there -- it is -- there is an ability to move across the different businesses. And we make that a dynamic allocation decision sort of like weekly based on what we see going on. 
So I think we have a pretty good pulse on the market. We sort of understand sort of what's going on. And our customers are giving us signals on a regular basis. And so I think we'll be able to manage through at all of the puts and takes as we go through the year.",132,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So data center GPU had a very strong year in 2021. It was sort of a key year for us as we launched the MI200 family and we had several large supercomputing wins. This year, for data center GPU, it's about the cloud and about sort of expanding beyond sort of the large HPC wins. I view it as a strategic growth vector for us over the next several years. I think your question is a good one about sort of the pull. Now that EPYC is very sort of well-established in these accounts, I do think that helps us with data center GPU. But the way to think about it is this is a long-term investment for us. The hardware is very, very good. We've been investing more in the software. We've been working with our customers to ensure that our tool chain gets them the performance that they need. And so I would say this is a longer-term driver, but I'm pleased with the progress that we made certainly through this last year.",177,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Well, I think the strategy is as we have gotten more scale in the business, we can invest more and we see ways to further differentiate our product portfolio. So I mean I think Milan-X is really sort of the highest of the highest end. And we see that for technical computing and some of these EDA workloads that, that does give us a very differentiated product. And then we have the regular Milan product line. We'll have Genoa. And Bergamo is really optimized for cloud. 
So I do believe it gives us more opportunity to expand from a market share and a footprint standpoint. And I think the broader statement, Chris, is that the data center is so large. There are so many different workloads that you can optimize. Like by doing these variants, we will actually get a better solution for the customer, give them better total cost of ownership and, hopefully, give us a larger footprint in that workload as well.",166,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Thanks for the question, Harlan. Look, I like the Embedded business. I've always liked the Embedded business. It's a nice, sticky business over many years. It is smaller, but it has grown nicely. And the volume design wins in automotive and they've now sort of expanded their usage. They've recently expanded their usage over a broader part of their product portfolio. We've focused on networking and storage as key markets. I do think there is a very good synergy with Xilinx in terms of just the customer set and the channels. And so I do see it as a nice grower for us as we go through it, and there's very good reuse from our server products as well as our client products.

For the last several years, we have been on a journey to both scale and transform AMD. We have consistently executed our strategy, expanded our portfolio of leadership products and diversified our business all while driving best-in-class growth. We reached a significant inflection point in our journey during the first few months of 2022 as we took several major steps that fundamentally reshaped our business.
In addition to delivering record financial results, we closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and announced our plans to acquire Pensando. The strategic importance of the Xilinx acquisition to our long-term goals cannot be overstated. As the industry's #1 provider of FPGA and adaptive computing solutions, Xilinx significantly expands our technology and product portfolio. Xilinx also adds multiple high-margin long-term revenue streams, spanning a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. Importantly, Xilinx has successfully executed its own growth strategy in recent years with the increased adoption of adaptive silicon across data center, communications, automotive and other large embedded markets. 
With Pensando, we will further expand our data center solutions capabilities. Pensando will add a proven team that has developed an industry-leading DPU and software stack already deployed with key customers, including IBM, HPE, Microsoft, Oracle and Goldman Sachs. Pensando's differentiated technology further expands our product portfolio and will enable AMD to innovate at the silicon, software and platform levels to deliver leadership solutions for our cloud, enterprise and edge customers. 
Now turning to our first quarter financial performance. We started the year very strong with record quarterly revenue and net income. First quarter revenue, including the contributions from 6 weeks of Xilinx, grew 71% year-over-year to a record $5.9 billion. We expanded gross margin 7 percentage points to 53% and more than doubled both operating and net income year-over-year. Excluding Xilinx, revenue grew 55% year-over-year to a record $5.3 billion, gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 51%, and operating income more than doubled to a record $1.6 billion. 
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 33% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, driven primarily by the ramp of our latest Ryzen and Radeon products. Client Compute revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year based on higher Ryzen mobile and desktop processor sales. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share for the eighth straight quarter. In desktop, we expanded our processor portfolio with the introduction of 7 new Ryzen CPUs, including the Ryzen 5800 X3D CPU, which is the industry's fastest gaming CPU and first desktop processor featuring 3D stack chiplets. 
In notebooks, record mobile processor revenue was driven by the launch of our Rembrandt Ryzen 6000 mobile processors that extend the leadership compute, gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors. 
In commercial, we recently introduced our latest Ryzen 6000 Pro processors with leadership performance and battery life and modern security and manageability features. We are well positioned to accelerate our growth in commercial notebooks in 2022 based on the expanded number of design wins on track to launch. 
Although the PC market is experiencing some softness coming off multiple quarters of near-record unit shipments, our focus remains on the premium, gaming and commercial portions of the market where we see strong growth opportunities, and we expect to continue gaining overall client revenue share. 
In Graphics, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year with record desktop graphics channel sales. Desktop GPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year as sales of our Radeon 6000 Series graphics cards were strong. In mobile, the first notebooks featuring our latest Radeon 6000 mobile GPUs launched in the quarter, and we expect sales to ramp over the coming quarters. Data center graphics revenue was flat year-over-year as we launched our Instinct MI210 accelerators. We expanded our engagements with large cloud customers in the quarter and launched our ROCm 5 software suite targeting exascale-class HPC and AI applications.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 88% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by record server semi-custom and embedded processor sales. Semi-Custom sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year based on strong demand for Sony and Microsoft consoles as well as Valve's new Steam deck. Sales for this game console generation continued to outpace all prior generations, and we expect 2022 to be a record year for our Semi-Custom business. 
Turning to our Embedded business. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year, led by growth in automotive. We also secured multiple design wins in next-generation security and firewall devices from Tier 1 networking providers. 
Turning to Server. We had another record quarter as revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We have more than doubled server processor revenue year-over-year in 8 of the last 10 quarters, highlighting the growing demand for our EPYC processors with cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. 
Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscalers expanded their internal infrastructure deployments, and 70 new AMD-powered instances launched from Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google and others. There are now more than 460 AMD-based cloud instances available from the largest hyperscalers, with additional instances on track to launch in the coming quarters. 
In Enterprise, revenue more than doubled year-over-year with strong growth in key verticals, including IT infrastructure, financial services and database applications. Our sales pipeline continues to be very strong, and we saw our win rate grow in the first quarter across a broad set of Enterprise end customers. We launched our first EPYC processors with 3D-stacked chiplets in the quarter. This technology extends our performance leadership in technical computing workloads by up to 66% compared to our prior generation. Atos, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro all launched servers featuring the new CPUs in the quarter. 
Excitement for our next-generation Genoa server processors continues to grow as we expanded customer and partnering sampling in the quarter. We expect Genoa will be the industry's highest-performance general-purpose server CPU, further extending the performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages of our EPYC processors. We remain on track to launch Genoa in the second half of the year and expect to continue our share gain trajectory based on expanded cloud, enterprise and HPC customer adoption. In addition, development of our higher core count Bergamo processors optimized for high throughput cloud workloads continues to progress well, with shipments on track to begin in the first half of 2023. 
Turning to the Xilinx business. For the 6 weeks following acquisition close, Xilinx revenue was $559 million. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx delivered its fourth straight quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth and the second straight quarter of greater than $1 billion of revenue. In data center, first quarter demand was led by expanded FPGA-as-a-Service and SmartNIC deployments at Tier 1 hyperscalers as well as low latency networking solutions with fintech companies. 
We saw strength in communications led by wired demand and access and optical transport. In wireless, Versal-based 5G deployments continue ramping in multiple regions, and we secured a strategic design win with a Tier 1 communications equipment provider to power their next-gen baseband solutions with a Versal ACAP solution. We saw strong demand across the Xilinx embedded markets, led by record pro forma full quarter revenue in automotive, industrial, vision and health care and consumer. Looking forward, we see very strong demand across all of the Xilinx end markets and are focused on increasing supply. 
Turning to our integration work. In the first few months since close, we have seen tremendous excitement from our customers, partners and employees, and we expect to see significant product and revenue synergies. We now have the best portfolio of high-performance and adaptive computing engines in the industry, and we see multiple opportunities to leverage our expanded technology portfolio to deliver even stronger products. 
As 1 example, we're integrating Xilinx' differentiated AI engine across our CPU product portfolio to enable industry-leading inference capabilities with the first products expected in 2023. We have also identified significant additional revenue synergy opportunities with some of our largest customers as we can now address a larger portion of their compute needs with our expanded product portfolio. 
In summary, the start of 2022 is a significant inflection point for AMD, marked by record top and bottom line financial results, driven by our leadership product portfolio and strong execution and the close of our Xilinx acquisition. We have now delivered greater than 45% year-over-year revenue growth for 7 straight quarters and increased net income by more than 60% year-over-year for the last 10 quarters. Based on higher AMD organic growth as well as the addition of Xilinx with strong demand across multiple end markets, we now expect annual revenue to grow by approximately 60% year-over-year, up from approximately 31% growth we guided at the beginning of the year. 
Longer term, I'm incredibly excited about our additional growth opportunities as we add the Xilinx and Pensando teams. We now see a significantly larger TAM opportunity for AMD across a diverse set of end markets based on our broader portfolio of leadership compute engines and expanded solutions capabilities. I look forward to sharing more about the products and technologies that will enable the next stage of our growth journey at Financial Analyst Day in June. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1579,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

The first quarter was an excellent start to the year with strong demand for our leadership products resulting in record quarterly revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability and record cash flow generation. In addition, we are very pleased to have closed the Xilinx transaction and announced our intention to acquire Pensando. 
First quarter consolidated revenue was $5.9 billion, up 71% from a year ago, driven by significant growth across all businesses and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue for the partial period. Excluding the Xilinx contribution, AMD revenue was $5.3 billion, up 55% from a year ago, with data center revenue doubling year-over-year. Gross margin was 53%, up 660 basis points from a year ago, driven by higher server processor revenue and high-margin Xilinx revenue. Gross margin for AMD, excluding Xilinx, was 51%, up 480 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher server processor revenue. 
Operating expenses were $1.3 billion compared to $830 million a year ago as we increased investments in our long-term product road maps to support the future growth of our business. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to a record $1.8 billion, up $1.1 billion, primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. 
Operating margin was 31%, up from 22% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.6 billion, up $947 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $1.13 per share compared to $0.52 per share a year ago. 
Now turning to first quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year, driven by higher client and graphics processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $723 million or 26% of revenue compared to $485 million or 23% of revenue a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $2.5 billion, up 88% from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by higher Server, Semi-Custom and Embedded revenue. EESC segment operating income grew significantly to $881 million or 35% of revenue compared to $277 million or 21% of revenue a year ago. The higher operating income and margin were driven by increased revenue, richer product mix and an $83 million licensing gain. 
Xilinx revenue for the partial quarter was $559 million with operating income of $233 million or 42% of revenue. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx generated over $1 billion of revenue, up 22% compared to a year ago, with growth across all Xilinx' major end market categories. We are on track to achieve our cost synergy goals for the acquisition and expect the addition of Xilinx to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for 2022. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. We deployed $1.9 billion to repurchase common stock in the first quarter. To date, we have utilized $3.7 billion of our initial $4 billion stock repurchase program. We also announced a new $8 billion share repurchase program during the quarter. In total, we had $8.3 billion in remaining authorization at the end of the first quarter. Quarterly free cash flow was a record $924 million compared to $832 million in the same quarter last year and $736 million in the prior quarter. 
We successfully executed a 5-year $3 billion sustainability-linked credit facility to replace our existing $500 million facility. This further demonstrates our commitment to our corporate ESG goals. Inventory was $2.4 billion, up $476 million from the prior quarter due to the addition of Xilinx inventory. 
Before I turn to our financial outlook, let me cover our financial segment reporting. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we plan to change our segment reporting to the following 4 segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded, which will align our financial reporting with our strategic end markets. I look forward to sharing further details with you at our Financial Analyst Day. 
Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 69% year-over-year and approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by the addition of Xilinx revenue plus higher server, semi-custom and client revenue. The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be primarily driven by Xilinx revenue plus higher server revenue. 
In addition, for Q2 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.56 billion or 24% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on the 13% effective tax rate and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. For the full year 2020 (sic) [ 2022 ] we now expect revenue to be approximately $26.3 billion, an increase of approximately 60%, driven by Xilinx and higher Server and Semi-Custom revenue. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 10% due primarily to U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits in 2022. Fiscal year 2022 will be a 53-week year and include an additional week in the fourth quarter. 
In closing, we had an excellent start to 2022 with strong revenue growth across all businesses. We are pleased to have completed the Xilinx acquisition, which strengthens our business model with revenue diversification, accretive gross margin and increased cash generation. We are very delighted to welcome the Xilinx team to AMD. Looking ahead, AMD is very well positioned for long-term growth, margin expansion and cash generation, driven by our leadership products and road maps.

I guess there's a lot going on from a macro perspective in the markets that you serve and in the supply chains, Lisa. So I mean, in the first half of the year, I think you're doing, I don't know, 54%, 55% organic growth in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk me through a bit the puts and takes in the quarter. I think there's a perception that you have additional supply coming online. There's obviously supply constraints and lockdowns in China. Your Server business doing extraordinarily well in the numbers that you just printed and then maybe some perception of a softening in the PC market. So there's a lot going on, and I'd kind of love you to walk me through the puts and takes of the quarter, if you could.",145,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks for the question. So we did have a very strong first quarter. There is a lot going on, without a doubt, in the business. I would say, if you look at the strength in our business in the first quarter, it was really broad-based. So very, very strong Server results. We continue to gain share. We continue to bring more supply online there. 
Also very strong results in our Semi-Custom or game console business as well as in the Client and Graphics businesses. There is some softness in the PC market. But we had, for the last number of quarters, actually been shifting our mix to the higher end or the more premium segments of the PC market, and so that's where more of our exposure is. And we actually saw significant growth in our PC business sequentially as we started ramping our Ryzen 6000 notebooks. And that resulted in strong ASP growth as well as just our key market segments of premium, commercial and gaming being covered there. 
As we go forward, obviously, all of the things that you talked about are in play. That being the case, I think we've managed through the supply situations very well. We continue to work with our customers and ensure that we're optimizing our builds to their builds. And with the addition of Xilinx, we also have another set of end markets that have very strong demand that are all additive to our business.",246,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I appreciate all the color. I guess as my follow-up question, I wanted to examine the full year guidance that you've given. Obviously, it includes Xilinx so it's a little bit apples and oranges from last year. But I think in the press release, you guys mentioned that you expect some upside from the original 31% organic growth guidance. If you have any comments on magnitude there, that would be helpful. 
And then I think just what investors would love to hear from you is maybe your view on the data center CapEx spending environment and also on the PC market. I think you guys had been maybe a bit more conservative than some of your competition in your market commentary about PCs maybe being flattish coming into this year. I imagine there's some new puts and takes to that. So just some thoughts on how you guys constructed the guidance for the year, especially relative to the original 31% would be really helpful.",166,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So lots of questions in there, Matt, so let me try to go through them. So first on the full year 2022 guide, it is a significant increase in guidance, up 60%. There are a couple of pieces to that. On the organic side of the AMD business, we originally guided up 31% based on what we saw in the market in January. As we look at the market now and our own sort of customer and supply situation, we see that organic growth higher, into the mid-30s. That's primarily driven by very strong demand in our Server business, very strong demand in our Console or Semi-Custom business, additional supply coming online. 
We have taken a bit more of a conservative perspective on the PC market. Again, I think the softness is in certain parts of the market. It's not in all parts of the market. And our focus is on where we add the most value in the market and that is in the premium segments. 
In terms of the Xilinx piece of it, the full year addition of -- 3.5 quarters of Xilinx is a significant add. On a pro forma basis, the Xilinx business is also growing very well, and it's growing sort of like in the low 20s, if you consider full year compared to calendar year 2021. So overall, I think we have a lot -- a broad-based set of growth drivers and multiple levers for growth as we go through the year. And we continue to work on working with our customers on where the demand is and ensuring that we're satisfying that demand.",271,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I had 2 questions myself. I guess, first on the supply chain situation, Lisa. Obviously, there's a lot going on in terms of wafer supply and substrates and now the China lockdowns. What are some of the bigger pain points for you? And to the extent the China lockdowns are impacting your business directly or indirectly, are you assuming any impact to revenue and profitability in the second quarter?",80,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

Thanks for the question. So on the supply environment, we've been working on this really for the last 18 months. We've made a lot of progress on both the wafer side and significant investments on the substrates. I would say that we continue to get sort of very good support from our suppliers. That's one of the reasons we can increase our guidance the way it is. 
From an overall -- you mentioned the China COVID situation. From our standpoint, we haven't had any significant impact on our own shipments in our own supply chain. We have been working with some customers that have had some customer build delays and that is contemplated in our second quarter guidance. We're going to continue to work on supply optimization with the addition of Xilinx, some of the, let's call it, more mature nodes. 16-nanometer and above wafer supply is still somewhat constrained. We're working with sort of the larger scale of AMD to try to bring more supply on board there as well as continuing to ramp our overall capacity to support a very strong sort of next few quarters. Hopefully, that answered your supply questions.",196,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then my second question, my follow-up question was on the data center business. It's great to hear that you've decided to re-segment your business, so thank you for that. Curious how meaningful data center was as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, server CPU, data center GPU and now FPGAs from Xilinx?
And I guess, more importantly, how are you thinking about the medium- to long-term opportunity in both your classic data center GPU business as well as the FPGA business? I think in data center GPU, you mentioned that it was flat in the quarter but you also talked about being engaged with more cloud customers. So curious what you're seeing there? And then on the FPGA side, I think Victor and team, prior to the deal announcement, was pretty vocal about the long-term growth opportunity there as well. So any update from your perspective would be great.",154,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So again, a few pieces to that. Let me try to give you some color and then maybe Victor will add on the FPGA side. So in terms of -- yes, we are going to change our segment reporting, as Devinder said, as of the second quarter to be -- to give you -- to more alignment to the markets. In terms of this quarter for the pieces that you mentioned, on higher revenue, the data center for those pieces was, let's call it, low 20s percentage of our overall revenue.
And then in terms of the longer-term data center picture, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity in data center. When you look at the pieces we have now, I mean, the CPU franchise is very strong, continuing to get stronger. We're excited with how Genoa looks and how Bergamo looks and sort of the engagements with customers there. We're excited about the GPU portfolio as well. GPUs for us are a longer-term sort of road map, similar to what we did on the CPU side. We had been more focused on, let's call it, supercomputing and HPC, so that was strong for us last year and that's why we're flattish year-on-year. We're very engaged on the AI front now, continuing our investments in our software stack and working with cloud guys to optimize our software stack. 
And then moving on to FPGAs and then also our adaptive SoCs and then the Pensando acquisition. I think what we now have is just an incredibly strong portfolio when we're dealing with whether you're talking about the largest cloud hyperscalers or you're talking about enterprise. And then with Pensando and Xilinx, it also gives us exposure to the edge as well. And so between -- we have all the compute engines and are able to optimize that. So I think you should expect to hear a lot more from us in the data center, certainly is -- at our Financial Analyst Day but really strong opportunities there. Maybe Victor, you want to add on some...",346,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is just, again, I think not only do we have a really broad portfolio of all the compute engines but we're doubling down on the networking side, right? Since we had strength in that in SmartNIC and then with Pensando, the kind of solutions that we could provide to customers in the overall infrastructure, right? It's not about point things, it's about the total solution. And as you probably know, scale out and just a lot of these applications, you could be thralled by the network so we really can optimize all of it. And the customers really want optimized, customized solutions. And I think that's what we could do with both the former Xilinx SmartNIC as well as Pensando, even going further.",136,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Milan helped you take and continues to help you take a lot of share in the market. I'm curious, what's the state of play in front of the next-gen Genoa versus the Sapphire Rapids server cycle from 2 perspectives? First, just from the industry adoption of DDR5, can that be a bottleneck to adoption of these next-generation servers? And second perspective is that you will have 2 different flavors of Genoa with the cloud-optimized version coming later. So just give us your sense of how this next-generation cycle plays out versus the very strong success you've had with Milan so far.",110,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So the way to think about it is the data center market and particularly in servers, people are getting much more optimized for workloads, and so there are different flavors. And we see that even in Milan today with Milan and our Milan-X, X3D -- the X3D we introduced. And so I think it's natural for these solutions to sit side by side. I think as you go into Genoa, the next-generation platform, we would expect, again, the adoption -- there's a lot of excitement on Genoa and there's a lot of customer demand for Genoa. I do expect that Genoa will sit, again, side-by-side with Milan for quite some time because you're not going to move the infrastructure instantaneously over. 
And then when you think about Bergamo, which is the cloud-optimized, I think that will be more specific for specific large hyperscalers who have the need for, let's call it, a more performance per dollar and performance per watt solution. So the way to think about this, Vivek, is as our business has grown, we can invest more broadly and that will give us just a more optimized solution for our customers' TAMs.",197,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then Lisa, my second question, kind of 2 or 3 interrelated question on the PC market. So what is your new sense of what the PC TAM can be this year versus what you thought before? And then I think as part of that, your competitor has mentioned several times that they are back in the market with Alder Lake and they are taking a lot of share, so I'm wondering what you have seen there? And then finally, what's your share in the commercial market today versus what it was last year? So just something on TAM, competition and commercial exposure.",105,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So Vivek, when we kind of started the year, we were thinking that the PC TAM could be flat to, let's call it, down -- let's call it, low mid-single digits. I think given sort of how we've started this year and then some of the other things in the market, we're taking a more conservative approach to the PC TAM. So for our modeling for the full year guidance, we're modeling something like down high single digits.
Now a lot of things can happen between now and then, so I would say that I think that's a good place for us to model. Within that, we've always been very focused on where we can add the most value and the premium segments, Ryzen 6000, our Rembrandt product, is extremely well positioned from a battery life or performance standpoint. We have a number of commercial, very good systems that are in the process of being launched. I think we're excited about that. 
To your question about commercial share, we're still underrepresented in the commercial market, and we know that and that's a focus area for us. I think overall, from a market share standpoint, we believe we're focused in the right segments. And so even under the backdrop of, let's call it, a softer PC market, that we will -- we can continue to expect to gain revenue share in the process. And that's sort of our overall strategy. 
But I think the other piece of it is we have so many levers in the business now as we go forward. I think the strength in the business is really looking at the overall data center portfolio, the PC portfolio, the gaming portfolio and the Xilinx portfolio together, there are lots of levers for growth. And as we go through this year, we see that being very helpful.",309,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So Aaron, obviously, it depends on the mix between cloud and enterprise. But in general, as we offer more value, let's call it, more performance, more capability, we would expect our ASPs to mix up.

I'm curious as you bring Xilinx into the model, you scale the business going forward, how could we think about flexibility from a perspective of capacity?

I'm just curious of how we should think about that ability to mix across product segments as you think about your wafer capacity agreements?",84,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Aaron, the way to think about that is, so both the Xilinx portfolio and sort of the organic AMD portfolio do use TSMC, so we are complementary there as our primary wafer supplier. We use very similar substrate suppliers as well. The Xilinx portfolio tends to be on more mature nodes. Although there is some 7-nanometer. The majority of the portfolio is on 16-nanometer and above. So I would say there's not that much fungibility there. 
However, on the back end, on the substrate side, there is very good fungibility across the portfolio. And from the standpoint of overall supply, I think you've heard it from Devinder. I mean, we have invested significantly over the last 18 months in sort of securing the supply and capacity and we're seeing it come online. And that's, again, what I'd like to do is, as you see it come online, that's when it will go into our revenue forecast. 
But I feel very good about the progress that we're making. And we're continuing to dimension the company for just a much larger business. And so it's a lot of supply that we're bringing online. We're working very much with Victor and his team as well because he has a strong backlog and strong demand, and we're looking to use all of the AMD assets to also accelerate some of his builds.",229,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So Harlan, thanks. So we've made great progress on the cloud side, so we have strong adoption on internal as well as external-facing workloads. We've also made strong progress on the Enterprise. I mean, as you said, all major OEMs have EPYC throughout the portfolio. And in this past quarter and in general, we've grown the Enterprise business about at the same pace as a cloud business. We're still cloud-weighted but I believe that it's going to be fairly balanced growth across both portfolios.",85,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then maybe a question for you or for Victor, but when I think about the Embedded markets, auto, industrial, aerospace and defense, comm infrastructure, consumer, just given the strong market positioning here by Xilinx, I mean, they're in a good position to catalyze EPYC-attached, to catalyze Ryzen-attached to their FPGA solutions. So maybe Victor can help us understand, like what percentage of Xilinx FPGA solutions in the Embedded market sits next to either an x86 or high-performance ARM processor because I think that the process opportunity in Embedded is much larger than the FPGA opportunity. And I believe that Embedded is a pretty small percentage of overall business for AMD. So pretty big opportunity but wanted to get your views.",122,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Maybe I'll take this one. I agree with you. Actually, one of the things that -- many things that's really exciting since we joined AMD is we've done some customer visits and they're really excited about exactly that point. We have a broader portfolio and processors and even in some areas, GPUs. It's also of great interest, the Embedded business at AMD has been selling APUs and Embedded versions of both the Server as well as the Client kind of products.
And now with the FPGAs and adaptive SoCs we have, we really can give a much more complete solution. And so that is definitely on the menu of things in terms of revenue synergies, which we'll discuss more at the Financial Analyst Day. But yes, we're really excited about what we have even with the existing products. And then we're already working on our road map for creating more value going forward.

And I think people, or at least I have thought about Xilinx, historically, doing networking and communications solutions for base stations as well as data centers, and they've kind of moved into this adaptive computing mode where they're doing more data processing also. 
And I wonder, you've seen other companies with general purpose computing solutions kind of adding communications capability. And I'm wondering, is there an opportunity for more data processing at the network edge, like say, at the base station where Xilinx has historically been really strong? And do you think the solutions, the architecture that you would have at the base station for the combination of data and communications network processing, do you think that ultimately, it looks very similar to what you see deep in the hyperscale data centers deep in the cloud?",169,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Sure, Mark. So I think the answer is yes, and maybe I'll generalize it a bit more. We're a big believer. I mean, the whole strategy behind AMD is to have the best sort of compute engines and then put them together in -- sort of in solutions for specific end markets. So I think our CPUs, GPUs, the FPGAs, the adaptive SoCs and then the DPU that we're adding from Pensando give us just a tremendous range of capability.
So to your specific question in sort of comms infrastructure, I definitely think there's a strong opportunity there. As Victor mentioned, we've been to a number of our joint large customers, and there is absolute interest in trying to put these solutions together. And more broadly, though, I think what we see in terms of growth going forward, there will be more customization around solutions for large -- for these large customers, whether it's cloud customers or large telcos or even some edge opportunities. And having these compute engines will allow us to basically optimize those solutions together. So we look forward to telling you sort of a lot more about sort of how we're thinking about these road maps as we go into our Financial Analyst Day in June.",211,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

You'll see us unify that, and that will be an important part of our road map going forward. And to your open source point, we do believe in open source.

Lisa, just again, a lot of moving parts, you've said that a bunch of times so forgive me if I dive into them a little bit. But as we think about your second quarter guide, I just wanted to get some of the moving parts that you're assuming there. Because I take up the Xilinx side or just give you the full quarter of it and a little bit of guidance there, it looks like the core AMD is kind of growing low single digits sequentially. 
You've mentioned about the PC side seeing some weakness. You've talked about that a bunch and then the strength in the Server and the Semi-Custom side. So any sort of color about the puts and takes to get you that organic growth?",138,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks for the question. So for the second quarter, in particular, the second quarter guide is driven by sort of one is the full quarter of the Xilinx business and strength in our Server business primarily as we see the second quarter. There are other puts and takes, I would call them, on the smaller side of that. If you recall, I mean, if you think about whether you talk about the PC business or the gaming business, they tend to be more second half weighted. So the second quarter doesn't tend to be a strong quarter for those businesses, and so that's not the driver of the sequential increase.",113,6.0,4.0,0.8333333333333334,0.4

And I guess a similar question, a perfect segue in your answer there. When I think about the full year guide, obviously, incredibly impressive. You talked about the organic increases. But it looks like, especially with that extra week, that you're kind of going up low -- or mid- to high single digits in one of those quarters and kind of flattish after that just to get to the full year. 
So a similar sort of question. What are the puts and takes there? Is the PC seasonality something you're kind of leaning against a little bit relative to the high single-digit drop you've talked about where you guys will still grow but maybe not as fast as in years past, given that backdrop? Or is there something else that plateaus out in the second half?",137,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

What I would say, though, is if I give you sort of the puts and takes of the second half of the year, the -- again, we expect that the Server business will continue to grow. As we said, good visibility there. We expect the Console business to grow in the second half versus the first half also, that's typical seasonality.
Typical seasonality in PCs would also have the second half higher than the first half. I think we're modeling for a little bit sub-seasonal, just given sort of all the puts and takes in the market there. And then we expect the Xilinx business to also grow in the second half as more supply comes online, given the strong demand. So if you see all those pieces, I don't think there's a plateau. I think it's a continued improvement as we see one, strong demand and also more supply coming online in the second half of the year.",174,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

It sounds like it can get pretty close, maybe you can get there. And I guess also as part of that question, I think you were thinking next year would be an up year also for Semi-Custom.

Sure, Tim. So without going into the exact numbers, I would say the Semi-Custom business is a strong growth driver. We have -- we work with these customers very closely. We have good views of where they think the demand is. We're still in a place, if you were to look into the retail channel, you would say that the demand is underserved today in the Semi-Custom business. And their real build is towards holidays. So the answer is we do believe that Semi-Custom will be at a record for us this year. 
We have more content. We also have the Valve Steam Deck that also has gotten very strong reviews and is ramping as we go into the second half of the year. And then on 2023, I do believe that 2023 will be another strong year for Semi-Custom and would be up. And again, if you look at the history of these ramps, it's really around the fourth year that you see -- that you really see the business kind of hit its peak. In addition to that, just knowing some of the game releases that are -- from a software standpoint, that are coming out, there are -- there's -- obviously, there's a good lineup [ of customers ]. There's also an expected strong lineup as we go forward. So yes, that's our current view of the Semi-Custom business.",233,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Let me start, Brett, and then I'll ask Victor to also make some comments. No question, AI is a huge opportunity for us and it's one where we're thinking about it very holistically in terms of how we address. So on the Server CPU side, a lot of inference is done on the Server CPU side. We've been investing in that area, on the GPU side for both training and inference. There are a lot this around the software stack, and so our focus is on optimizing our software stack with our large cloud customers and partners. 
And then what Xilinx brings to our portfolio is actually a lot of capability on the AI inference side, in their current portfolio and then additive to the AMD portfolio.

And as we've alluded to, that is exactly our plan. 
We're also -- a moment ago, in the discussion about software, we're absolutely working on the unified overall software to enable the broad portfolio but also especially in AI. So you'll hear more about that at the Financial Analyst Day, but we're definitely going to be leaning in, in AI both inference and training, and I would say, end-to-end because we have endpoints, we have edge devices, both computing and embedded devices and in the cloud and enterprise.

This was an excellent quarter for our business as we delivered record revenue and profitability based on our strong execution, leadership product portfolio and diversified business model. Each of our segments grew significantly year-over-year led by higher data center and embedded sales as we continue expanding our presence across a broader set of markets and customers. Revenue grew 70% year-over-year to a record $6.6 billion. We also expanded gross margin 6 percentage points year-over-year to 54% and set records for operating and net income, both of which more than doubled from the prior year. 
Turning to the business results. Starting in the second quarter, we updated our financial segment reporting to align with our 4 strategic end markets: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded. Let me start with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 83% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.5 billion led by record server processor sales. EPYC processor demand was strong in the quarter with significant year-over-year growth across both cloud and enterprise customers. 
In cloud, more than 60 new instances powered by 3rd Gen EPYC processors launched in the quarter from AWS, Baidu, Google, Microsoft Azure and Oracle, including the industry's first cloud-based, Software as a Service solution for chip design for Microsoft Azure and Synopsys powered by our Milan-X processors with 3D stacked triplets. In enterprise, OEM adoption accelerated in the quarter as Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco and others brought tailored solutions to market that deliver leadership performance and TCO across many enterprise workloads. Recent examples include Lenovo's AMD-powered ThinkSystem setting a price performance world record for transaction processing and AMD-based HPE ProLiant servers delivering record-setting virtualization performance. 
We made progress further establishing our data center GPU footprint in the quarter, highlighted by the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer debuting in the #1 spot on both the TOP500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers and the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers. I am extremely proud of our work with HPE and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build the world's first exascale supercomputer. Breaking the exaflop barrier is a significant computing milestone, and the fact that it was made possible by EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators highlights AMD's unique ability to push the envelope in computing further and faster than anyone else. 
Looking at our broader data center opportunities, we saw a strong growth year-over-year for our industry-leading FPGA and networking products with cloud and financial customers. We closed our acquisition of Pensando in the quarter, further expanding our data center solutions capabilities with the addition of a world-class team and an industry-leading DPU and software stack that complement our existing products. With the additions of Xilinx and Pensando, AMD now provides the industry's broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to enable the best performance, security, flexibility and TCO for leading-edge data centers. 
Looking ahead, customer pull for our next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa server CPU is very strong. We are on track to launch and ramp production of Genoa as the industry's highest performance, general-purpose server CPU later this year, positioning our data center business for continued growth and share gains. 
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $2.2 billion based on record mobile processor sales. We believe we gained client processor revenue share for the ninth straight quarter led by strong adoption of our latest-generation Ryzen mobile processors. Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and others are on track to significantly expand their portfolio of AMD-based notebooks as they bring almost 300 new designs to market this year powered by Ryzen processors. 
We also saw strong demand in the quarter for our latest-generation Ryzen PRO processors that deliver leadership performance and battery life for professional notebooks. Commercial client processor revenue grew significantly year-over-year as HP, Lenovo and others launched more than 50 AMD-based commercial notebooks and Dell announced its first AMD-based precision workstation. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch our all-new 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 desktop processors and AM5 platforms later this quarter with leadership performance in gaming and content creation. Taking a step back, while there has been additional softness in the PC market in recent months, we believe we are very well positioned to navigate through the current environment based on the strength of our existing product portfolio and upcoming product launches. 
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $1.7 billion as semi-custom growth more than offset a decline in gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC sales continue outpacing the prior generation, and we remain on track for record semi-custom annual revenue in 2022. Gaming graphics declined in the quarter as macro conditions impacted discretionary spending. New AMD Advantage gaming notebooks that combine Ryzen and Radeon processors to enable outstanding gaming experiences launched recently to strong reviews, highlighted by the Alienware m17 receiving multiple Editor's Choice awards from leading industry publications. 
While we expect the gaming graphics market to be down in the third quarter, we remain focused on executing our GPU road map, including launching our high-end RDNA 3 GPUs later this year. Our next-generation RDNA 3 architecture is another major step forward for our graphics road map, delivering more than a 50% generational improvement in performance per watt by combining our most advanced gaming architecture with 5-nanometer triplet manufacturing. 
Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue grew significantly year-over-year to $1.3 billion led by robust demand across all markets and nodes for our FPGA and adaptive computing products. Xilinx products are deployed in virtually every market, powering mission-critical applications for thousands of customers. We accelerated Xilinx product sales in the second quarter with the benefit of the additional manufacturing scale and resources of AMD. 
We delivered record core markets revenue led by aerospace and defense, industrial vision in health and test and measurement. Communications growth was led by higher demand in wired from multiple Tier 1 system vendors, while wireless demand was driven by multiple ramping ORAN deployments in North America. Embedded CPU revenue also grew significantly in the quarter based on higher automotive sales and the ramp of new networking and storage design wins. As we highlighted at our Financial Analyst Day in June, we have identified greater than $10 billion in long-term revenue synergy opportunities as we bring the AMD and Xilinx assets together. Our largest opportunity is in AI, and we've already started executing new hardware and software road maps to capture the significant opportunity we see to drive pervasive AI across cloud, Edge and endpoints. 
In summary, our work over the last several years has placed AMD on a significant growth trajectory. AMD has never been stronger and the markets for our products have never been as large or diverse. As a result, we have now delivered 8 straight quarters of record revenue as our strong execution and leadership products have driven increased adoption across an expanded set of markets and customers. 
Despite the current macroeconomic environment, we see continued growth in the back half of the year highlighted by our next-generation 5-nanometer product shipments and supported by our diversified business model. We remain laser-focused on executing our product and technology road maps, further deepening our customer relationships and investing strategically across the company to drive our next phase of growth across the $300 billion high-performance and adaptive computing market. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1243,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2022",2022-08-02,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3393.0,2617159.0,98735286.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD reported excellent second quarter results. Strong demand for our leadership products drove record quarterly revenue and continued gross margin expansion. The second quarter includes the first full quarter of Xilinx' financial results, and we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Pensando in the quarter. 
Second quarter revenue was $6.6 billion, up 70% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue across all segments and the inclusion of Xilinx' revenue. Gross margin was 54%, up 640 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by higher Data Center and Embedded revenue. 
Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $909 million a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to record $2.2 billion driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 30%, up from 24% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.7 billion, up $929 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $1.05 per share compared to $0.63 per share a year ago. 
Now turning to our reportable segments. As previously communicated, we modified our segment reporting to align with our strategic end markets and the way we now manage the business. The Data Center segment includes server CPUs, data center GPUs, Pensando and Xilinx data center products. The Client segment includes desktop and notebook PC processors and chipsets, while the Gaming segment includes discrete graphic processors and semi-custom game console products. The Embedded segment includes both AMD and Xilinx embedded products. 
Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 83% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in 3rd Gen EPYC server processor revenue. Data Center operating income was $472 million or 32% of revenue compared to $204 million or 25% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
Client segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year, driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Client operating income was $676 million or 32% of revenue compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. 
Gaming segment revenue was $1.7 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales. Gaming operating income was $187 million or 11% of revenue compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by higher semi-custom revenue, which was partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses. 
Embedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, driven primarily by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $641 million or 51% of revenue compared to $6 million or 11% a year ago driven by higher revenue. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $6 billion at the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we deployed $920 million to repurchase common stock and have $7.4 billion in remaining authorization. Cash from operations was a record $1 billion. Quarterly free cash flow was $906 million compared to $888 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $2.6 billion, up approximately $220 million from the prior quarter in support of second half revenue and the inclusion of Pensando. During the quarter, we established AMD in the investment-grade debt market by issuing debt of $1 billion. 
Turning to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macroeconomic environment and customer demand signals. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 55% year-over-year primarily led by growth in the Data Center and Embedded segments. 
In addition, for Q3 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.64 billion or 24.5% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on the 13% effective tax rate; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue of approximately $26.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 60% at the midpoint led by growth in Data Center and Embedded segments. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%. 
In closing, we had an excellent second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth across all segments, margin expansions and record profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our product and financial objectives while continuing to monitor market signals and work closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions. We are confident that we are well positioned for long-term growth driven by our revenue diversification, financial model and earnings power. 
Before we transition to the Q&A, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank Laura Graves for all her service to AMD and wish her every success on her retirement later this month. Thank you, Laura.

I had 2 questions. The first one, I wanted to better understand what's contemplated in your guidance, your Q3 guidance as well as your implied Q4 guidance, both in terms of revenue and gross margins. If you can kind of speak to the pluses and minuses on a sequential basis, that would be super helpful. And then I have a follow-up.",68,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So in terms of the Q3 and the Q4 guidance, so if we would start first with Q3, I think the Q3 guidance implies that, first of all, the revenue growth is led by the data center as well as some increase in our semi-custom or game console business, which historically peaks in the third quarter. We have taken a more conservative outlook on the PC business. So a quarter ago, we would have thought that the PC business would be down, let's call it, high single digits. And our current view of the PC business is that it will be down, let's call it, mid-teens. And that's contemplated into our third quarter guidance. 
And then as we go into the fourth quarter, what we see is, again, the sequential growth there will be led by the data center as well as our embedded business with the same view of the PC business. But what we also have there is a set of new product ramps that we're very excited about. So we have a number of 5-nanometer products that will be ramping in the fourth quarter, including our client products as well as our server -- our Genoa products as well as our graphics products. So that's sort of the view of Q3 and Q4 from a revenue standpoint. And then from a margin standpoint, again, we're guiding full year margin at 54%, which is what we -- which is the same. And again, it's a mix of business in each of the businesses that is resulting in that.",266,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thank you for the color particularly around your PC assumptions. My follow-up, I was hoping you can speak to what you're seeing in your data center business given the macro backdrop. We get a bunch of questions from investors about the forward and sort of concerns related to both enterprise and spending in the cloud. What are your customers telling you at this point? What kind of visibility do you have? And at what point do you become more dependent on the overall market? And I asked the question because if we take the most recent quarter, you're probably about 1/3 of your nearest competitor in terms of revenue scale. You were about 1/7 a year ago. So obviously, you're significantly larger. Curious at what point do you become more correlated with the broader market.",137,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

Thanks for the question on the data centers. So look, the data center business has grown very nicely for us. We're pleased with the segment growth both on a year-over-year as well as a sequential basis. In terms of what we're seeing underneath that, in the second quarter, for example, we did see the cloud business continue to be very strong. So from what we -- from our customers, we're continuing to ramp new cloud instances and workloads with Milan, and we see that continuing into the second half of the year. 
For the enterprise business, we actually did make also a good progress on the OEM side there as well. What I would say is the trends there are a bit more mixed and perhaps more correlated to some of the macro backdrop. So we do see a significant pipeline, although some of the deals are taking a little bit longer to close. And I would say that there are some match set of things that the OEMs are working through. 
But all in all, I think we continue to see significant growth opportunities as we go into the second half of the year and into 2023 just given our strong product positioning. And as I said, in this part of the cycle, we see Milan continuing to ramp into the second half of the year, and then we see Genoa coming in towards the end of the year into 2023. So I do think, to your overall question, do we become more correlated to the market, I mean, I think we are -- we've certainly gained a lot of share. So we're a larger piece of the market, but we are still underrepresented. And the visibility with our customers, especially our large cloud customers, second half of this year into next year is very good. And we're planning really for the next 4 to 6 quarters, and that gives us good visibility.",325,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I'm curious, how do you see your inventory levels? And do you think AMD could be impacted by any excess PC or server or graphics inventory from your main competitor? Just is your second half, do you think, adequately derisked the way you see it today?",87,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

So look, if you look at our second half guidance and maybe let's talk about the full year guidance, we have -- there are some puts and takes in how we're seeing the business today. So whenever we guide, we recognize that there are multiple dynamics that we're looking at. In the current guidance for the full year and the second half, what we're saying is that we continue to see strong demand in the data center, in our embedded business as well as in the console business. 
And we are being more conservative in our PC outlook. Our PC outlook, now at mid-teens, would kind of put the market at somewhere around, let's call it, 290 million to 300 million units. So I do think we've appropriately derisked the PC business. As it relates to inventory, as we look at the current situation given some of the COVID lockdowns and things in the second quarter, I think there was a bit of buildup in PC inventory, and we've taken that into account in the second half. We think the AMD portion of that is modest. And as a result, it will rebalance itself in the second half of the year. 
So overall, I think we feel very good about the second half. And again, with the portfolio that we have, one of the things that has been important is we were still supply constrained in several of the areas. Certainly, on the embedded side, we were supply constrained in the second quarter. And even on the server side, we were tight in the second quarter. We have additional supply that's coming online especially as we get towards the end of the year. That will help us really meet more of the demand from customers. So we feel pretty good about all of those puts and takes.",310,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And for my follow-up, Lisa, one more on the data center side. So cloud spending seems very strong right now. But we see all these media reports about the cloud players wanting to control their spending levels, et cetera. When do you think that shows up in their spending outlook? Or do you think you have enough of a share gain story with Genoa coming out later this year to offset any slowdown from just a broader spending environment perspective? And just how are you feeling about the next-gen kind of Genoa versus Sapphire Rapids competitive outlook?",99,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

What I would say is every customer is different. So they each have their own dynamics of what they're trying to optimize. We have seen a bit of a slowdown in China, and you might have expected that. But certainly, with North America cloud, they've been very strong this year, and the forecasts are robust for next year. 
Relative to your overall question, I think we do feel like we're in a share gain position. I think the product positioning is such that Milan is very, very strong right now, and we think that Genoa as well is very well positioned into next year. So we'll always spend time with the customer set and see what they're seeing. But from our current view, I think we have a strong opportunity to continue to grow the data center business into 2023. And our view is we have an expanding portfolio as well. In addition to Genoa, we have our Bergamo, which is a cloud optimized capability, as well that's coming online early next year.

Do you have the supply as we go into next year to upside on that number if the orders actually do get stronger in the wake of the Sapphire Rapids delay?",108,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks for the question. So we're very focused on our own product ramp. And certainly, the key for us was to continue to work very closely with our customers to get them to ramp as fast as possible. I think Genoa looks very good. We've gotten very strong feedback from the customer set. The performance looks very good. There's a lot of interest to ramp quickly on both the cloud as well as some of the high-end enterprise stuff. So we feel very good about it. And to your question about supply, we have spent basically the last 12 months building our capacity across the world to support the type of growth that we think the product can handle. So there is a large step-up in supply that we expect to see over the next 4, 5 quarters, and I think we'll continue to work on that.",149,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit more into the implied Q4 outlook. Again, I know you answered some questions on some of the drivers into Q4. But if I look at it, it's -- taking it at the dead midpoint, it's something like a 7% sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 with gross margins going up about 100 bps to 55%. I guess, of that increase, is it fair to say that the bulk of it continues to be Data Center and maybe Embedded? The gross margins, to me, would suggest that that's probably the case. But any more further color you could give us on the magnitude of what's driving that increase? That would be helpful.",123,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Actually, our Embedded segment has performed really well. Very pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. And then in terms of the margin, it very much is a mix within the business as well. So the pluses and minuses are, yes, Data Center and Embedded are up, but the mix of Data Center is a little bit more to cloud than enterprise and Embedded a bit more from communications than some of the other markets. But overall, the 7% increase, I think, is very well supported given all of the new product ramps that we have going on in addition to some additional supply that's coming in as we get into the fourth quarter. And just as a reminder, it's also a 14-week quarter for us in Q4. And so all those things give us sort of the implied guide.",161,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And Laura, congratulations on your retirement. Lisa, I want to dig a little bit into the Gaming business. You obviously have the 2 parts of that: the client GPUs and the game console side of things. It seems like there are very different dynamics happening there. So when you talked about the -- I believe you said the client GPU side would be down year-over-year in the third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's happening there? Is that just a reflection of the PC market? Or is there any sort of share gains, product issues going on? And then the semi-custom color, you sounded like it's going to remain strong for the rest of the year. So is there -- is that just the fourth year of the ramp or the third year, I guess, it would be? Or is there some sort of seasonal effect we should appreciate as well?",164,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Sure, Ross. Thanks for the question. So our Gaming business is the 2 halves of the sort of the discrete graphics or the consumer graphics and then our game console business. So I would say that on the semi-custom side, let's take that first, the console business has been very strong. So I would say it's a strong cycle. Overall, we were more supply constrained in sort of last year into the first half of this year. We've been able to get additional supply for that. I think there's continued belief that it's a strong cycle for the consoles. We expect consoles to peak in the third quarter, and then the normal seasonality would see a decline in the fourth quarter. 
As it relates to the consumer graphics, I would say that as we entered this year, we were coming off of a very strong 2021 for consumer graphics where gaming demand was very high. We have seen a slowdown here in the second quarter, and we expect that, that is somewhat due to sort of demand now -- sort of the supply now and more supply versus demand as well as some of the macro issues as it relates to consumer spending. We do expect as we go into the fourth quarter, though, that we'll see some sequential increase in that business because we'll have new products that are launching in that time frame. 
So those are the puts and takes. I think overall, as a segment, we continue to believe Gaming is a long-term secular driver. There are some sort of short-term dynamics here in the PC market that we're dealing with. But I think the fact that the game consoles have performed so well is a positive for the segment.",294,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

You guys have done an amazing job on that, and Xilinx obviously helps raise the bar as well. As we look forward, I know you have a long-term target of 57%. Can you just talk about if supply becomes looser -- and I know you have areas that are loosening and areas that are tight simultaneously, but can you talk about the cost inflation you're feeling?

So the increase in margins as we go forward in the long-term model really is as a result of mix. So what we've said is that we believe the Data Center and Embedded businesses can get to over 50% of the company. We're right now sitting probably in the low 40s. And we expect Data Center, in particular, to grow faster than the rest of the company, and that will drive sort of margin expansion. It is -- we're all working on costs and trying to ensure -- there are some inflationary kind of costs that are out there. We're all working on trying to keep those to a minimum and frankly, going back to the work of working on cost reductions as we do in semiconductors over time. So -- but the primary margin expansion for us is in Data Center as well as Embedded growing sort of faster than the other businesses.",173,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Lisa, I wanted to ask a question about the Server business. Obviously, the growth is very strong right now, but a lot of that business continues to be driven by the engagement that you've had and continue to build out with cloud. As we look forward over the next -- I mean, you had talked in some of your script about how you guys were preparing for continued growth in the server business over the next 4, 6, 8 quarters. And the road map's going to diversify some next year with Bergamo and Ciena and Genoa-X seeming to launch on top of the Genoa platform. And I wonder if you could give some color on how the relationships and engagements are going in enterprise and in the telco wireless space as well.

So definitely, I think our focus -- we love the progress that we're making in cloud, and we're going to continue to earn every amount of share that we can there. On the enterprise side, as we've always said, it takes a bit longer because the sales cycles are a bit longer. We've made very nice progress with all of the top OEMs. I think the portfolios are continuing to expand. We're excited about not just the current portfolio, as you said, with Genoa, but as we expand to Genoa-X at the very high end of the performance as well as Ciena that just broadens our portfolio for telco. 
So our expectation is that we continue to steadily grow share in the enterprise as well as we go through 2023 and beyond. And I think there's a broader opportunity to sell the broader AMD portfolio as we have not just the CPU, but I think the addition of the Xilinx assets and the Pensando assets as well as our GPU portfolio, I think, all lead to the overall growth in the Data Center business for us.",188,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But a few people have pointed out to me that the cash flow -- or the free cash flow was only up a tiny bit or very, very modestly, and I wonder if you could walk us through that a little bit.

I think, one, is when the revenue grows a lot, there's investment needed in working capital. So look, our working capital numbers from an inventory and AR standpoint, they're up significantly year-on-year. We also have, as we said previously, a 3% tax rate, going up to about 10%. And the cash taxes get paid, but the timing of the cash taxes sometimes is Q2. And in Q2, we did have some significant cash tax payment from a payment standpoint given the timing of payments to the federal government. 
And then you have timing of shipments that does affect the free cash flow. And the last thing I'll mention given the discussion, some of the questions that Lisa was asked about, supply for server and supply overall [ over ] the share gain on the growth of the business, we are making investments in capacity from a prepayment standpoint. And those obviously require funding the suppliers, and that also has an impact on the free cash flow because that flows through the free cash flow accretion.

So Aaron, I guess what I would say there is Genoa has much more content than Milan, right? If you think of Milan, Rome and Milan are 64-core processors. And as you get into Genoa and Bergamo, you get to 96 and 128 cores. So you would expect on a per unit basis that the ASP would go up.

So actually, I would say that the Xilinx business has performed extremely well. The demand across all segments has been strong. And what we were able to do as we brought Xilinx into the portfolio is really make some significant improvements in the supply chain. And so we have seen a nice step up. If you were to look on a pro forma basis, the Xilinx portfolio grew about 20% sequentially, which is a very nice growth. 
As we look into the second half of the year, we are still a bit constrained in certain parts of the Xilinx portfolio, although we continue to make good progress. And I expect additional supply to come on especially towards the latter part of the year and into 2023. Our view of the business, again, I think the quality of the design wins, the quality of the overall -- when you look -- the diverse market is very strong.

I think it depends a little bit on where you're talking about within the market. But on the Data Center side, what we have found is pricing is not sort of the first factor that customers are paying attention to. It's really total cost of ownership. So the performance and the sort of the performance per dollar equation is very important there and sort of the power efficiency. 
As we go into the PC market, we've deliberately focused our PC market on, let's call it, the more premium segments. So gaming as well as high end, sort of the ultra-premium as well as the commercial segments. And again, I think those are much more about the product. There are some parts of the PC market that are very price sensitive, like the low end. And like I said, we've tried to reduce our exposure there going forward.

I guess since -- that would put you against Intel, I guess, in the like kind of the mid-20s, and I'm curious if you think that math sounds about right to you. And I'm hoping that you could -- because we're grouping more things together, if you could just share with us, was there any outsized contribution from Xilinx or Pensando or something like that and that, that would make that look -- that might change the interpretation from what it looks like on the service because that's a pretty big jump in share?

I mean I think the planning that we're doing jointly with our customers has been very helpful. Much of our conversation right now, frankly, is about 2023 and ensuring that we have enough capacity for some of the build-outs that are out there. So I would say the visibility is very good. And obviously, things can change, plus or minus here and there. But overall, I think the ZIP codes of how much growth, how much more content the customers need are very active conversations. And frankly, they've been active conversations for the past few months. I think the one positive of sort of the supply chain stuff that we've all gone through is that there's a new recognition of the need for long-term planning so that they can get their match sets and they can get their factory capacity and we can get our factory capacity in line as well.

On the ramp of Genoa back half of this year, kind of early next year, I believe the team has a total of around 20-plus SKUs across their cloud, enterprise and embedded customers. Your cloud customers obviously are anxiously awaiting these platforms. Would you be rolling out your high-volume cloud SKUs first? And what's the qualification look like on these high-volume SKUs? Just asking because, obviously, your competitor is struggling with SKU releases, and I just want to make sure that the AMD team is executing and releasing its high-volume SKUs to your cloud customers.",102,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So we certainly go through a full, again, interlock with our customers. Our focus is on the high-volume cloud SKUs as well as sort of the high-volume enterprise SKUs because there is a fairly sort of lengthy qualification cycle that's actually in both the cloud and the enterprise. From what we see today, again, there is a strong customer pull on Genoa. And so we're working very closely with our customers, and we expect to ramp production in the fourth quarter and then into the first half of next year. And it will be different by different customers and different platforms and so on and so forth, but what we're seeing is a lot of strong engagement with our customers.",122,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It seems like maybe if you take the lost units and you multiply by ASP, it seems like it costs you maybe $750 million, but you kept the full year, and Data Center seem pretty in line.

No, I wouldn't say that, Tim. What I would say is that, again, whenever we put together full year guidance especially from the beginning of the year, we understand that not everything is going to be exactly so. So as we look now into the second half of the year, what we're seeing is, again, Data Center is strong. Again, we expect Data Center to grow second half to first half nicely. Embedded/Xilinx will also grow to some extent second half to first half. And the consoles will also grow as well. And so I think as we look at those components offsetting what is perhaps a more conservative PC outlook, we believe that, that offsets nicely. And again, just as a reminder, we do have a number of product ramps in the fourth quarter that are coming out in 5-nanometer. And we think that will drive sort of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter. So I think those are some of the puts and takes in the full year guide.",173,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Our third quarter revenue and gross margin came in below our expectations due to softening PC demand and substantial inventory reduction actions across the PC supply chain. Despite the macro backdrop, overall revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $5.6 billion as our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments each delivered significant year-over-year growth and performed in line with our expectations. We also expanded gross margin and grew net income year-over-year, highlighting the strength of our business.  
Turning to the business results. Starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 45% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $1.6 billion. We delivered our 10th straight quarter of record server processor sales, driven by strong demand for third-gen EPYC processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Genoa CPU to select customers. Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased sequentially as multiple hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal properties and more than 70 new AMD instances were launched by Microsoft Azure and Amazon, Tencent, Baidu and others in the quarter.  
In enterprise, OEM revenue was down sequentially as server OEMs continued working through match set issues, and some business load the pace or scale of their purchases based on the macro uncertainties.  
Looking at the broader competitive landscape, our third-gen EPYC CPUs in market today are the highest performance and most energy-efficient x86 server CPUs available. And we expect to further extend that lead with our next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa processors, which deliver significant performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages for both hyperscale and enterprise workloads.  
We will publicly launch Genoa next week and are ramping production to support initial cloud deployments and the introduction of fourth-gen EPYC processor platforms by HP Enterprise, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others.  
Looking at our broader data center portfolio. As expected, Data Center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had substantial shipments supporting the build-out of the Frontier exascale supercomputer. We made good progress with our Data Center GPU software enablement work in the quarter, including announcing our role as a founding member of the PyTorch Foundation. We look forward to working closely with the largest cloud providers as we drive a standards-based approach to the development of popular PyTorch deep learning software framework.  
Demand from data center customers for our adaptive SmartNIC and DPU products was strong during the quarter. We had record sales of our Xilinx FPGA and networking data center products led by demand from cloud and financial customers.  
Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter driven by cloud adoption. The addition of Pensando DPUs to our product portfolio has been very well received by customers, highlighted by our enterprise customer pipeline doubling in the few months since the acquisition closed.  
We were excited to support VMware's launch of its next-generation cloud virtualization platform in the quarter. Our Pensando DPUs will be included in the first validated server and HCI solutions, supporting the new VMware virtualization offerings from Dell, HPE and others that will make it much easier for enterprise customers to build more performance and secure data centers powered by our industry-leading DPUs.  
Taking a step back, we have built significant momentum in our Data Center business as we have consistently executed our server CPU road map and expanded our solutions capabilities with the addition of the Xilinx and Pensando products to our portfolio. We remain on track to further expand our product portfolio in 2023 with the launches of our edge and telco optimized Siena and cloud optimized Bergamo processors.  
With 128 cores and 256 threads per socket, we expect Bergamo will first end our performance and energy efficiency leadership in cloud workloads. Customer response has been very strong based on the performance, features and software compatibility Bergamo delivers. We believe our broad family of leadership CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs and DPUs position us well for long-term growth and share gains in the Data Center.  
Now into our Client segment. Revenue declined 40% year-over-year to $1 billion. Our Client processor shipments were below PC consumption in the third quarter as we worked closely with our customers to reduce downstream inventory. Desktop channel sell-through increased from the prior quarter, driven by increased demand for our Ryzen 5000 Series CPUs and the launch of our Ryzen 7000 Series processors and AM5 platform in September. We launched our 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 Series processors with strong reviews based on delivering leadership performance in gaming, productivity and content creation applications. We expect Ryzen 7000 CPU sales to ramp this quarter aligned with the launches of a broader range of mainstream and enthusiast AM5 motherboards.  
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as strong semi-custom sales offset a decline in gaming graphics. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of record semi-custom SoC sales as demand for the latest game consoles remained strong and Sony and Microsoft prepare for the holiday season.  
Gaming graphics revenue declined in the quarter based on soft consumer demand and our focus on reducing downstream GPU inventory. We will launch our next-generation RDNA 3 GPUs later this week that combine our most advanced gaming graphics architecture with 5-nanometer chiplet designs. Our high-end RDNA 3 GPUs will deliver strong increases in performance and performance per watt compared to our current products and include new features supporting high resolution, high frame rate gaming. We look forward to sharing more details later this week.  
Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.3 billion, driven by growth from aerospace and defense, industrial and communications customers. Demand across our core markets remain very strong. We had record sales to aerospace and defense and automotive customers who are increasingly using our FPGA and adaptive SoC products to enable differentiated capabilities and features in their products.  
Record communications market revenue was driven by growth from both wired and wireless customers. We saw a particular strength in North America led by new 5G wireless installations and expanded wired infrastructure deployments.  
Overall demand for our Xilinx products remain strong as we continue to leverage AMD's scale to secure additional supply to address this demand. Longer term, we're very excited about the growth opportunities in our Embedded business. We closed multiple high-revenue design wins in the quarter with automotive, networking, emulation and prototyping, communications and aerospace and defense customers. We're also seeing new design win opportunities and deeper engagements with many of our Embedded customers based on the expanded breadth of our adaptive SoC, FPGA, CPU, GPU and DPU product portfolio.  
In summary, we are well positioned to navigate the current market dynamics based on our leadership product portfolio, strong balance sheet and growth in our Data Center and Embedded segments.  
We have 3 clear priorities guiding us. First and foremost, we're focused on executing our road maps and delivering our next generation of leadership products. Second, we're building even deeper relationships with our customers as we make AMD a fundamental enabler of their success. And lastly, we remain very disciplined in how we manage the business. We will continue to invest in our strategic priorities around the data center, embedded and commercial markets while tightening expenses across the rest of the business and aligning our supply chain with the current demand outlook.  
The secular trends driving increased demand for high performance and adaptive computing in the cloud, at the edge and across intelligent end devices remain unchanged and provide a strong backdrop for long-term growth.  
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1280,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

AMD reported third quarter results in line with the preliminary results we announced last month. While we are pleased with the performance of our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each of which grew significantly year-over-year, our third quarter results also reflect lower-than-expected Client segment revenue. Third quarter revenue was $5.6 billion, up 29% from a year ago. Gross margin was 50%, up 150 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client revenue and $160 million of inventory, pricing and related charges in the graphics and client businesses. 
Operating expenses were $1.5 billion compared to $1 billion a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income was up 20% from a year ago to $1.3 billion, driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 23% compared to 24% a year ago due to higher operating expenses.  Net income was $1.1 billion, up $202 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.67 per share compared to $0.73 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower Client segment revenue.  
Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.6 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue. Data Center operating income was $505 million or 31% of revenue compared to $308 million or 28% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.  
Client segment revenue was $1 billion, down 40% year-over-year due to reduced process shipments resulting from a weak PC market and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $26 million compared to operating income of $490 million or 29% of revenue a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue.  
Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales, partially offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming operating income was $142 million or 9% of revenue compared to $231 million or 16% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue and inventory pricing and related charges.  
Embedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx' embedded product revenue. Embedded operating income was $635 million or 49% of revenue compared to $23 million or 30% a year ago, driven primarily by higher revenue.  
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we repaid the 7.5% senior notes totaling $312 million that matured in August and deployed $617 million to repurchase common stock. We have $6.8 billion in remaining authorization for stock repurchases.  
Cash from operations was $965 million, and free cash flow was $842 million compared to $764 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $3.4 billion, up approximately $721 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by client products and new products ramping in the second half of the year.  
Now turning to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the near-term macroeconomic environment. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth is driven by Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by a decline in the Client and Gaming segments. On a sequential basis, Embedded and Data Center segments are expected to grow, offset by declines in the Client and Gaming segments.  
In addition, for Q4 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.55 billion or 28% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $175 million based on a 13% effective tax rate; and diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year, we expect revenue to be approximately $23.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 43%, led by growth in the Embedded and Data Center segments. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%.  
In closing, we continue to focus on executing our long-term strategy while navigating current market conditions. We will prioritize the key investments for our product road maps and long-term growth while taking several near-term cost management actions, including prudently controlling operating expenses and headcount growth while actively managing inventory in line with our revenue expectations.

I know it's early and difficult to predict. But given the supply comment that you just made, given what you're hearing from customers, both on the cloud side as well as the enterprise side, and the ramp of your new products, how are you thinking about the positives there versus the macro, which continues to be a headwind? I think many of us have your business growing in Data Center kind of in the 20% to 30% range. Is that a fair place to be? Or is that a little too optimistic given what you know today?",115,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So it is a little bit early to talk about 2023 precisely, but maybe let me give you a backdrop of where we see the data center market today. As you said, in the near term, there are some overall macro headwinds that are affecting all markets, including the data center market. Now it varies by segment. And so if I go through each of the segments, what we're seeing is I think North America cloud is probably the most resilient out of the segments within the data center market, and this is where AMD is the strongest. 
We've had very good progress at the North America cloud vendors. And we continue to believe that although there may be some near term, let's call it, optimization of, let's call it, individual footprints and efficiencies at individual cloud vendors over the medium term, as we go into 2023, we expect growth in that market, particularly customers moving more workloads to AMD, just given the strength of our product portfolio and overall, Genoa coming forward. As we look through the other segments, I think China is -- has been very weak in 2022, and we're not forecasting a significant recovery in 2023. So we'll see how that goes.  
And then on the enterprise side, I would say enterprise is probably most impacted by the macro. So we have seen customers taking longer to make decisions and perhaps being a little bit more conservative on CapEx. That being said, though, we feel very good about our value proposition. We feel very good about our product portfolio. And we believe, even in a little bit of a choppy market that we can gain share across that business. So overall, I think our Data Center trends are good, and we need to work through the macro as everyone does.",305,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And then as my follow-up, a question on gross margins, maybe for Devinder. So you're guiding Q4 gross margins up about 100 basis points, which is good to see, but you're still 300 basis points below where you were in Q2. And since then, obviously, Client is down significantly. Your Data Center business is very resilient and so is the classic Xilinx business. So from a mix perspective, you should be in a better place. What's driving down gross margins in Q4, I guess, versus Q2? Are you recognizing another inventory hit? Or is it something else?",100,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

On the gross margin, as you said, Q2, 54%. If you go all the way to Q4, 51% primarily is the weak PC market and Client margins coming down. For example, if you look at Q3, all other businesses were in line with expectations, and Client margins came in lower.  
We also have in the Data Center, a place cloud weighted, which has lower ASPs. So that also has an impact on margins. And then as Lisa mentioned earlier, some of the new capacity that we have from a supply standpoint, there are some additional costs from the supply capacity agreements. And those are all baked in into the Q4 51% margin guidance.",120,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

So I think if you look at the third quarter, it was -- there are a lot of dynamics in the Client business. So market was weak. In particular, consumer was weak. And we have more of a footprint in consumer. So in that framework, we saw units come down. But we also saw ASPs come down on a sequential basis. Now I will say that ASPs were still up on a year-over-year basis. So we've been, let's call it, disciplined in this pricing environment. 
We did see some pricing dynamics in the quarter, and we couldn't face unprofitable business. And we'll continue to be sort of watching that space. So that was the pluses or minuses as it relates to Client ASPs. And as we go into the fourth quarter, again, I think we're forecasting for a competitive environment given the market weakness, and that's embedded in the guide.",152,-3.0,5.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5

Do you get to $1.5 billion? And I asked that because your competitor was suggesting that next year, the PC TAM would only be down 4% or 5%, which seems a little bit optimistic.

So a couple of different points, Vivek. Let me just answer the sort of the expectations around Q4. I would say we're guiding, let's call it, modestly down for Client and Gaming. And obviously, we're coming off of what is already a low base in Q3. We want to do that to correct the sort of the inventory situation as quickly as possible. And as a result, we're going to under-ship consumption again in the fourth quarter to do that.  
As it relates to next year, I think there are a lot of factors. I mean this year, PCs will be down quite a bit, let's call it, high teens, close to 20%. As we go into next year, I think the industry is calling mid-single digits. I think that would be a good case. I think we should model down to minus 10%. And again, within our PC business, we expect as we get through this inventory correction -- I mean we have very good products, and I feel very good about our product portfolio and very good about our platforms overall. So I do think the PC business will recover as we go into 2023, but we'll have to work through these dynamics over the next quarter or so.",212,-6.0,7.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7

And for my follow-up, Devinder, maybe one for you on gross margins. How much of the write-offs and pricing actions that you're taking in -- that you took in Q3 and are taking in Q4? How much are they recoverable in Q1? So let's say, hypothetically, Q1 revenue is the same as Q4 revenue. What can gross margins be? How much of the actions are recoverable? And basically, how do you start getting back to the prior trend of 54% gross margin because the longer-term target is over 57%?

If you look at Q3 in and of itself, we came in with about 50% gross margin. We had $160 million of charges, which are inventory pricing and related charges. If you adjust for those, the margin for -- in Q3 is about 52%. And we had guided to 54%. We came in at 52%. And primarily, that's due to 2 reasons, right? You have the Client weak PC market. And obviously, the Client margins are down. As I said earlier, the rest of the business will perform for the expectations.  
We have to work through what's going on with the PC market over this quarter, next quarter and maybe early '23, and then we come back and talk about the margins.

On the Data Center business, if you look back to the pre-announcement a month ago, I think there was a little bit of maybe -- you came in a little bit under where we were modeling, I'll just say that way. And so I got a ton of questions on that, and I was really interested in some of the comments that you made in your script about how cloud revenue still more than doubled year-over-year. And anyway, just confirming that I got that right. 
And maybe if you could help us break down your Data Center business a little bit between the strength in cloud that I would expect to continue given the CapEx commentary we've heard, but there were obviously some headwinds from enterprise that you called out and clearly from HPC, both on CPU and GPU. So I think that would be helpful to just break it down because I was surprised that, that cloud revenue was as strong as it was given where the numbers came in, in the quarter.",192,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

Sure, Matt. So for focus on the third quarter, what I would say is cloud revenue did more than double. Enterprise revenue was down. And then on the GPU side, because we had a strong quarter in the third quarter of 2021, that was down, too. And perhaps that wasn't quite in your modeling. But the larger dynamics are, as I said earlier, the North America cloud is probably the best out of all the Data Center segments. There is some impact on macro, though. I mean I think everyone is aware of that, that there is a little bit of pullback in CapEx spending. That being the case, I think our market share is very good there, and we'll -- we expect it to continue to grow. 
And as the business becomes more cloud weighted -- there have been a few margin questions, so I'll just mention, as the business becomes more cloud weighted, that tends to have a little bit of downward pressure on the margin. But our goal right now is footprint and expanding our footprint across cloud and enterprise. I will say even in a weak enterprise market as we go forward over the next few quarters, we feel really good about how we're positioned and the platform solutions that are coming out with all of our OEM partners. So I think on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you may not get the model exactly right.

I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to kind of revisit what we've learned over the last 3 or 4 months in the PC market. It's super dynamic times out there. And obviously, things have changed in demand really, really quickly from when you guys guided back at the beginning of August until the pre-announcement. And I just kind of wanted to walk back through sort of the dynamics of how the quarter progressed from when you guys gave the original guidance. 
I guess, obviously, the market went down. There was inventory corrections and whatnot. But just how quickly did you guys see that? And I guess the real question coming out of this is, how are you thinking about changes you might make in monitoring inventory levels or working with your channel partners?

So yes, the third quarter, the PC market was very volatile. Going into it, we expected the market would be weak. It was weaker than we expected. And the weakest portion of the market is a consumer market where we tend to be more heavily weighted. 
I think the thing that perhaps we saw in the market is we -- as the overall macro economy has also weakened, customers, in general, across the board, have just become more cautious. So even as they were selling through their inventory, they were not replenishing stock to the same levels. And frankly, we were coming off of a supply-demand imbalance where in the first half of the year, people were actually trying to gather inventory, and we had been in a supply-constrained situation. So it is a very dynamic situation, I would say. 
I think that we have great partnerships across the supply chain. I feel good about the visibility that we have. I think the market will continue to be volatile, but we will -- we're all sort of biased towards reducing inventory levels so that we can better react to the market factors and the market situation.

Absolutely, Joe. So the Xilinx business, our Embedded business has been performing just extremely well. Another very strong quarter in Q3, and we have -- we see growth into the fourth quarter. We have been very focused on what's happening within the various subsegments. I think the nice part of the business, as you know, is that it has -- it's very broad based. So we have seen communications was up for us. Aerospace and defense, very strong. Automotive was also up for us here in the third quarter. 
We did see some weaknesses. Consumer was weak. There was some subsegments of industrial. So test and measurement was weaker in the third quarter. So we do see the puts and takes there. But overall, I would say the business has strong visibility. We are still supply constrained in certain nodes and some of the legacy nodes. We've made a lot of progress on supply. So we're seeing additional supply come in, in Q4, and that leads us to good confidence in Q4. 
We expect the first half -- again, we have multiple quarters of visibility just given the lead times in that business, and we'll be watching it very carefully.

And then as it relates to Data Center and Embedded, it's about the same, let's call it, modest plus as we go forward. We expect, again, cloud to be stronger than enterprise. That's some of the margin dynamics that we were asking earlier. And Embedded, as we get more supply, modestly up as well.",129,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think the key thing is we continue to invest in the strategic areas, in Data Center and Embedded and the product road maps. The macro environment has weakened, soft PCs. And we are taking actions to reduce expenses especially in the rest of the business besides what I talked about earlier in terms of the areas of focus, and we have slowed down hiring. 
So you're right, Q4, if you look at E2R business is high, but we are very disciplined in terms of what we're going to do. Expense actions do take time to kick in. And we expect that as we go out into 2023, the E2R comes more in balance with the revenue, and we manage it in line with the revenue out in time.",130,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

There's such a big disparity between your 3Q guide and what Intel guided to or reported versus what they're guiding to in 4Q. And usually, things normalize over a longer period of time. But I just wanted to understand, is it a case of they took their medicine earlier and AMD continued to over-ship versus demand? Just kind of help us understand.

Sure, Ambrish. Look, I think -- again, let me comment on our business, right? So for our business, as we exited the first half of the year, I think we were planning for a sort of a reasonable PC market in the second half. Usually, the third quarter is higher than the first half. And the third and the fourth quarter are seasonally higher. And so that's what we were building to, together with our customers, by the way, with that expectation. 
I think the market weakness as well as just the overall caution in the environment just caused people to behave a bit differently, and that really required us to work together with our customers on the inventory corrections. And as you said, there were some temporal sort of dynamics. And we're aware of those temporal dynamics. Some of it is very -- sort of very aggressive pricing that we chose not to follow. And again, that's a decision that we made. And others are, as you might expect, there might be some temporal optimization that people are doing. 
I don't think there's anything fundamental. I think fundamentally, our product portfolio is strong. I think we have very good platforms in place, and we'll work through this.

Thanks for the question, Harlan. So yes, look, we're very happy with our Milan sort of workload ramp. We are continuing to ramp Milan here this year and then into next year as well. 
As it relates to Genoa, we did start initial shipments of Genoa to our strategic customers in the third quarter. That is continuing in the fourth quarter. So we're ramping production in the fourth quarter. A lot of the, let's call it, the qualifications or the first instances are being qualified here in the fourth quarter into the first quarter. 
And what we've said before is that Milan and Genoa are going to actually coexist for quite some time just given how competitive both are. Genoa is a new platform. It is new DDR5 and PCIe 5.0, and that takes a bit longer for people to qualify.

Right, Harlan. I would say it's a little bit of both. And I think you said it well. In the very near term, there is a little bit of optimization that each cloud vendor is doing. But in the medium term, what our customers are telling us is they need more compute. And the more compute is for additional workloads building out. It's also for upgrade of, let's call it, older compute given our new products have very strong TCO, power efficiency, given the cost of power and energy around the world.

I got it. Okay. Yes, I want to be responsive to the question. Well, let's start with the Data Center. I think in the Data Center, we believe that we will continue to gain share. We expect to continue to gain share in both cloud and enterprise. We are more underrepresented in enterprise. And so again, that's a key focus for us. But as we just stated in the last few questions, I think North America cloud, in particular, I think we see line of sight to significant new deployments based on our current road map. 
In the desktop and notebook business, our focus is on certain segments. So we're very focused on premium. We're very focused on gaming. And we're focused on commercial. I think in those areas, there are, again, opportunities for us to continue to gain share. I think in desktop DIY business or sort of the desktop channel business, we have a strong lineup.

And then as my follow-up, I guess, just getting back into the macros that you mentioned that ASPs are getting a little -- or at least pricing is getting a little tough on CPUs.

Our strategy is not to lead on price. So if you look at -- look in the Data Center, although price is one factor, we find price is not the leading factor in the majority of the selections. There is work for us to do in terms of workload optimization, and that's where a lot of our focus has been in the Data Center. So hopefully, that answers that piece. 
As it relates to the PC business, it is more price-sensitive. We have seen it become more price-sensitive. I think, again, where we have a strong value proposition, we will continue to be very competitive. But even back a year ago, we didn't choose to compete in the Chrome market because, again, that was just not a profitable business for us.

And then I think on a medium-term basis, again, my view on these things is we will always follow the U.S. regulations and understand the need for national security.

So Blayne, it was certainly more units. I think Stacy asked the question earlier. ASPs were down sequentially, but they were up year-over-year. So the decline was more driven by units, but there was an ASP factor on a sequential basis. 
And then in terms of what we see in the market, I would say that as the market weakened, there was sort of more pressure at the high end in terms of just velocity and desire to clear inventory. And so the mix did mix towards lower ASPs and towards more incentives to clear that inventory.

We want to make sure that we have -- we do clear additional inventories. 
We do see in Data Center a mix to -- when the mix is higher for North America cloud, that tends to be lower ASPs just given the environment in that business.

Do you think that the data center market is inherently growing in the December quarter, the market, not AMD? And do you think -- and/or do you think you're growing because you're launching Genoa? 
And to that point, you talked about dislocations and sort of the cloud and the data center market. I was curious what specifically are you seeing? And if you could differentiate between are you seeing just slower growth or is there inventory that's built up? And then I've got a follow-up.",104,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So look, what I would say is, again, on a very discrete basis, I wouldn't say the overall data center market is necessarily up. Just given the macro impact, there is some impact on overall spending. In terms of our business, we do have a weighting towards North America cloud that tends to be sort of the most resilient part of the market. 
And then as it relates to what's happening in the market, like I said, I think what's happening is -- enterprise is weak. I think that is overall people -- businesses are just being more cautious. China is weak and has been weak all year. And then in cloud, in general, there's not in general. Every customer is a bit different in what they're trying to do. Some are just optimizing inventory, some are optimizing footprint, and then some are continuing to build. And so I wouldn't call it a market per se. I would call it their individual instances for each customer. 
What's helpful for us is -- what we're talking about is not just Q4 with our customers. We're really talking about what do they need for all of 2023. I mean we are coming from a place where we were supply constrained. And so we're planning for the capacity that's necessary. And there, we see which workloads are moving and when are they moving each of the workloads. And so that gives us some visibility into what their spending plans are for 2023.",250,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And then for my last follow-up, can you talk about the gaming market in general? Of course, September, you mentioned was the peak quarter. So December will be off some. But is this also the peak Gaming year in 2022? And should we be thinking that Gaming will be down? Or just because these things are still so hard to get, to try to go buy PS5, you still can't get your hands on it easily. So do you think there's more legs left to the growth next year?",92,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So Harsh, we do believe that there is still some pent-up demand, especially coming into this holiday season. So Q3 was the peak for us this year. Q4 is down seasonally, as you might expect. 
Going into next year, I think there are puts and takes. I would say the best way to model at this point is to model Gaming segment flattish. And let's see how the holiday season goes, but that would be the way we would call it at this point.",85,6.0,4.0,0.8333333333333334,0.4
