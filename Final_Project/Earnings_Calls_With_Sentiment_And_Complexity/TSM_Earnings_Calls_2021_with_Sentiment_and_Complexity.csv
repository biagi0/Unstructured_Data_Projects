380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2021",2021-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5273.0,2172238.0,85228565.0,Presenter Speech,Jen-Chau Huang,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2020. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2021. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased 1.4% sequentially in NT terms or 4.4% in U.S. dollar terms as we saw strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications. Gross margin increased 0.6 percentage point sequentially to 54%, mainly thanks to cost improvement, partially offset by the margin dilution from 5-nanometer ramp and an unfavorable exchange rate. Our utilization rate in the fourth quarter was at an extremely high level partially due to more production output, of which some of the wafers will be shipped in the first quarter. Total operating expenses slightly decreased by TWD 2.6 billion. Therefore, operating margins increased by 1.4 percentage points sequentially to 43.5%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 5.51, and ROE was 31.4%. 
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 7-nanometer and 16-nanometer contributed 29% and 13%, respectively. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 62% of wafer revenue. 
On a full year basis, 5-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 8% of 2020 wafer revenue, 7-nanometer was 33%, and 16-nanometer was 17%. Advanced technologies accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 50% in 2019. 
Now moving on to the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 13% quarter-over-quarter to account for 51% of our fourth quarter revenue. HPC decreased 14% to account for 31%. IoT decreased 13% to account for 7%. Automotive increased 27% to account for 3%. Digital consumer electronics increased 29% to account for 4%. 
On a full year basis, smartphone, HPC and IoT saw strong growth of 23%, 39% and 28%, respectively. DCE also increased 2%, while auto decreased 7% in 2020. Overall, smartphone accounted for 48% of our 2020 revenue, HPC accounted for 33%, and IoT accounted for 8%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 791 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 29 billion mainly due to the increase of TWD 57 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD 38 billion in accrued liabilities and others, offset by the decrease of TWD 69 billion in short-term loan. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 28 billion mainly as we raised TWD 30.5 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. 
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 1 day to 39 days. Days of inventory increased 15 days to 73 days primarily due to the ramp of leading nodes. 
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 259 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 89 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for first quarter '20 cash dividend. Short-term loans decreased by TWD 67 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 30.5 billion due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 56 billion to TWD 660 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $3.2 billion. 
Now let's look at the recap of our performance in 2020. We saw a strong growth in 2020 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 31.4% in U.S. dollar terms and 25.2% in NT dollar terms to reach TWD 1.34 trillion. Gross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 53.1% primarily due to a high level of capacity utilization and cost improvement. Operating margin increased 7.5 percentage point to 42.3%. Overall, full year EPS increased 50% to TWD 19.97. 
On cash flow, we spent TWD 507 billion in CapEx, while we generated TWD 823 billion in operating cash flow and TWD 315 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 259 billion in cash dividends in 2020. 
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 12.7 billion and USD 13 billion, which represents a 1.3% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.95, gross margin is expected to be between 50.5% and 52.5%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. The sequential decline in first quarter gross margin is mainly due to a slightly lower utilization rate in the first quarter, albeit it is still staying at the high level, as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. 
Now I would like to talk about the tax rate. We expect our 2020 tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 11%, and this will be equally applied to all 4 quarters of the year. 
This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now I would like to start with the key messages for the quarter. I will start by making some comments on our capital budget in 2020 and 2021. Every year, our CapEx is invested in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the next few years. Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership; flexible and responsive manufacturing; retaining customers' trust; and earning the proper return. 
In 2020, we spent USD 17.2 billion to capture the strong demand for our advanced technologies and support our customers' capacity needs. In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies and further support our customers' capacity needs, our 2021 capital budget is expected to be between USD 25 billion and USD 28 billion. Out of the $25 billion to $28 billion CapEx for 2021, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer; about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making; and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies. 
Next, let me talk about our capital intensity outlook. As we have said previously, our long-term capital intensity is in the mid-30s percentage range. However, when we enter a period of higher growth, our CapEx needs to be spent ahead of the revenue growth that will follow, so our capital intensity will be higher. For example, during 2010 to 2014, our CapEx spending increased threefold as compared to the previous few years, and our capital intensity ranged between 38% to 50%. Because of the increased investment, we were able to capture the growth opportunities and deliver about 15% growth CAGR from 2010 to 2015. 
Today, as we enter another period of higher growth, we believe a higher level of capacity -- of capital intensity is appropriate to capture the future growth opportunities. We now expect a higher growth CAGR in the next few years driven by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications, which C.C. will discuss in more detail. 
We also expect this higher level of capital investment to continue to drive our technology leadership, enable flexible and responsive manufacturing and earn customers' trust. While our leading nodes capital costs continues to increase due to increasing process complexities, it is expected to be compensated by continuing to sell our value, which includes the value of our technology, service, quality and capacity support and diligently working on cost improvement. With this level of CapEx spending in 2021, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. 
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",1283,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2021",2021-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5273.0,2172238.0,85228566.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Hi, everyone. This is C.C. Wei. Good afternoon. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. 
Now let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our fourth quarter with revenue of TWD 361.5 billion or USD 12.7 billion, which was in line with our guidance mainly due to strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications. 
Concluding 2020, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory course, was about 10%, while foundry industry increased about 20% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue grew 31.4% year-over-year in U.S. dollar term. 
Moving into first quarter 2021. Our business continues to be strong, supported by HPC-related demand, recovery in the automotive segment and a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. 
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory was digested throughout the fourth quarter. We now expect it to approach the historical season, exceeding 2020, better than our forecast 3 months ago. We observed that the supply chain are changing their approaches to inventory management amidst the lingering macro uncertainties. Looking ahead, we expect the supply chain and our customer to prepare a higher level of inventory compared to the historical season level for a longer period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security. 
Next, let me talk about the automotive supply tightness. The automotive market has been soft since 2018. Entering 2020, COVID-19 further impacted the automotive market. The auto supply chain was affected throughout the year, and our customers continued to decrease their demand in the third quarter. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter. However, the automotive supply chain is long and complex, while many of our technology node has been tight throughout 2020 due to strong demand from our other customers. 
Therefore, in the near term, as demand from the automotive supply chain is rebounding, the shortage in automotive supply has become more obvious. In TSMC, this is our top priority, and we are working closely with our automotive customer to resolve the capacity support issues. 
Now I will talk about our 2021 outlook. For the full year of 2021, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow about 8%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 10%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by mid-teens percentage in 2021 in U.S. dollar term. Our 2021 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, where we see stronger interest from all 4 growth key focus, which are smartphone, HPC, automotive and IoT. 
Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. We are entering a period of higher growth as a multiyear megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021. We expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. 
We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance, bandwidth and latency improvement of 5G networks to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multiyear megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all 4 of our growth platform in the next several years. 
As we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing and, therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. 
With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in U.S. dollar terms. 
Now I will talk about our N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021, and volume production is targeted in the second half of 2022. 
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Finally, I will talk about TSMC 3DFabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3D IC technology road map to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplets and heterogeneous integration technology drive better, power-efficient and smaller-form-factor benefit for our customer while shortening their time to market. This technology is including chip-stacking solution such as SoIC as well as advanced packaging solutions such as InFO and CoWoS. We observed chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3DFabric to enable chiplet architecture. 
SoIC's [ full ] volume production is targeted 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where our bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which are including both advanced packaging and testing, to grow at the rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.

Dr. Wei, how should we think about the price of 3-nanometer? What we have seen is over the past 2 years, 28-nanometer was a very big node. 7-manometer came out to be roughly 17% bigger if you think about peak revenue compared to 28-nanometer when you had new applications coming in. 
How is -- given the big CapEx plan that you're also outlining, should we think that 3-nanometer, once it ramps up fully, would be substantially bigger than 7-nanometer in terms of peak revenues? Just wondering how we should kind of think about the size of this sort of node. 
And could you also talk a little bit about the opportunities in HPC? Right now, you are already engaged with multiple HPC customers. But could you talk a little bit about CPU, x86 CPU, obviously, which is something on everybody's mind? Could you talk a little bit about how TSMC would be exposed to this market as well as we go into the 3-nanometer era?",175,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Great. And my second question is, sorry, 2 parts. I just want to ask on gross margin and inventory. The gross margins you've improved 4 points year-over-year. Part of that is utilization, but depreciation also was up 45% NT dollar [ against the ] 6 points. So could you discuss if you've had a breakthrough on the cost reduction side and if now -- I think last quarter, you said about 50%. But given what you've seen on cost reduction and coming off 54%, if you could have better confidence on margin could continue to do better. 
And then I just want to ask a quick on inventory, which is up 15 days, historically, you draw down within the fourth quarter, but maybe the trend-wide inventory was rising into early in the year.",134,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Right. Now in terms of gross margin in the long term, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable. There are 6 factors affecting our profitabilities: the ramp of leading-edge technology, price, cost, mix, utilization and foreign exchange rate. Take foreign exchange rate for example. In 2020, the average dollar against NT rate was TWD 29.43. It is now trading between TWD 27.90 to TWD 28. That is already a 5% appreciation of NT. So every 1% of appreciation of NT will affect our gross margin by 40 basis points. 
The other thing is the -- in the fourth quarter of last year, as we mentioned, the utilization rate was very high, extremely high. And that's the abnormal level of high utilization rate cannot sustain. Therefore, in this quarter, we believe the utilization rate will come down a little bit, albeit it is still at a very high level. Now every point of utilization rate change will impact the gross margin by 40 basis point. 
A third example will be the ramp in our leading-edge technologies. We mentioned last time that we expect N5 ramp in 2021 to affect our margins by 2 to 3 percentage point, and we still think that will be the case. 
So if you take all of those into considerations, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable in the long term.",230,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

So if I look back in the past 2 quarters, the -- your gross margin actual result turned out to be either at the high end or the -- to the upside to your original guidance, while revenue is much on the high end of the guidance, while the Taiwan dollars continued to appreciate in the second half of last year, so which means that the margin turns out to be better than what you originally guided for 2 quarters consecutively. So my question is whether or not the 1Q outlook margin is too conservative again. And second to that is whether our structural profitability will need to revise up just as our 5-year revenue growth CAGR has just been revised up officially.",136,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Sebastian, let me summarize your first question, your observation that in the past 2 quarters, our gross margin has come in at the high end or slightly above the high end of our guidance, revenue at the high end, and the currency appreciation is there. So Sebastian's question is, first, is the first quarter gross margin guidance too conservative.

Sebastian, if we compare fourth quarter to first quarter, 54% in fourth quarter, and the midterm of our guidance for first quarter is 51.5%. The 2.5 percentage point difference actually mainly comes from the utilization as well as the unfavorable foreign exchange rates. So at this moment, we are still sticking to this guidance, although, obviously, we will work hard to continue to improve the gross margins.

My second question is on your CapEx outlook. Apparently that at least there's a significant upside surprise to me and, I think, also to the concensus estimate. So the last time, in the comment, you raised CapEx from $10 billion to $12 billion level to the like a $15 billion to $17 billion level, then that resulted in the 30% revenue growth in 2020. And then -- so my question is that I think that CapEx we invest for the future growth, so whether or not this -- another step-up of the CapEx to like -- to $25 billion to $30 billion these years will represent a reacceleration of the growth in 2022 or '23.",118,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And for example, the leading-edge technologies, the complexities increases, the CapEx per K, it's more expensive than before. So we are working very hard with the customer to sell our value, the service value, the technology value and also the capacity value and firm up the wafer price. At the same time, we also work very closely with our suppliers to continue to improve our cost so that altogether, we can maintain and earn a proper return in the leading nodes compared to those of the previous few nodes.

So on the revenue guide, I guess you're starting the year with a far better than seasonal Q1. But I just wondered, how do you see the year playing out? Should we expect in the second half a typical seasonality this year? 
And then in terms of the CapEx guide for this year, obviously, there's a big step-up. And spending this year is normally a reflection of how you think about long -- future capacity growth beyond 2021. So can we assume from the big increase in CapEx this year that your implied revenue growth in 2022 will be higher than 2021?",108,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter 2021. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter 2021.
First quarter revenue increased 0.2% sequentially in NT dollars or 1.9% in U.S. dollars. Our first quarter business was supported by HPC-related demand, balanced by a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. Gross margin decreased 1.6 percentage points sequentially to 52.4%, mainly due to relatively lower level of capacity utilization and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.
Total operating expenses slightly increased by TWD 0.8 billion, mainly due to higher level of R&D activities for the N5 family. Therefore, operating margin decreased by 2 percentage points sequentially to 41.5%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 5.39, and ROE was 29.5%.  
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 14% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 35%. Advanced technologies, which we now define as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 49% of wafer revenue.
Now moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone decreased 11% quarter-over-quarter to account for 45% of our first quarter revenue. HPC increased 13% to account for 35%. IoT increased 10% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 32% to account for 4%. DCE increased 10% to account for 4%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 797 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 45 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 49 billion in short-term loans, an increase of TWD 50 billion in accrued liabilities and others, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 51 billion in accounts payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 23 billion, mainly as we raised TWD 21.1 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 1 day to 40 days. Days of inventory increased 10 days to 83 days, primarily due to N5 wafer prebuild.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 228 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 248 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for second quarter 2020 cash dividend. Short-term loans increased by TWD 52 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 18.5 billion due to the bond issuance. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 4.6 billion to TWD 665 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $8.8 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our second quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 12.9 billion and USD 13.2 billion, which represents a 1% sequential increase at the midpoint. This revenue guidance includes the minor impact from the power outage that occurred yesterday at our Fab 14 in Tainan.
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.4, gross margin is expected to be between 49.5% and 51.5%, operating margin between 38.5% and 40.5%. The sequential decline in second quarter gross margin is mainly due to the margin dilution from higher 5-nanometer contribution, the slower rate of cost improvement as our fabs continue to run at a very high level of utilization and the absence of positive inventory revaluation. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 362.4 billion or USD 12.9 billion, which was in line with our guidance. The slight sequential increase was mainly driven by HPC-related demand, balanced by a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. Moving into second quarter 2021, we expect our revenue to be flattish as HPC-related demand will continue to grow, offset by smartphone seasonality.
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory was healthy exiting fourth quarter of 2020. Amidst the lingering macro and supply uncertainties, we expect our customers and the supply chain to gradually prepare higher levels of inventory throughout the year as compared to the historical seasonal level. We expect this to persist for a period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout the year supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and special technology.
For the full year of 2021, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow about 12% while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 16%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by around 20% in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As we enter a period of higher growth underpinned by the multiyear structural megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications, we believe a higher level of capital investment is necessary to capture the future growth opportunities.
In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies in the next several years, we have decided to raise our full year 2021 CapEx to be around USD 30 billion. About 80% of the 2021 capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",954,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.
First, let me talk about the capacity shortage and demand outlook. Our customers are currently facing challenges from the industry-wide semiconductor capacity shortage, which is driven by both structural increase in long-term demand as well as short-term imbalance in the supply chain. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand as multiyear megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive and essential in people's life.
In addition, the need to ensure supply security is creating short-term imbalance in the supply chain, driven by supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions.
Now let me talk about TSMC's investment plan and disciplines. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logical IC industry for years to come. In order to support our customers' growth, TSMC is taking several action to help address the capacity shortage for our customers. We are working hard to increase our productivity, to drive more output, to help support our customers for the near term.
To address the structural increase in the long-term demand profile, we are working closely with our customers and investing to support their demand. We have acquired land and equipment and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousand of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites. TSMC expect to invest about USD 100 billion through the next 3 years to increase capacity, to support the manufacturing and R&D of leading-edge and specialty technologies. Increased capacity is expected to improve supply certainty for our customers and help strengthen confidence in global supply chains that rely on semiconductors.
Our capital investment decision are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node, new investment in mature nodes and rising material costs. Therefore, we will continue to work closely with customers to share our value. Our value includes the value of our technology, the value of our service and the value of our capacity support to customers. We are looking to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level. We will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement.
By taking such actions, we believe we can continue to earn a proper return that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and fulfill our mission as trusted foundry partners. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about the automotive supply update. The automotive market has been soft since 2018. Entering 2020, COVID-19 further impacted the automotive market. The automotive supply chain was affected throughout the year, and our customers continued to reduce their demand throughout the third quarter of 2020. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter of 2020.
However, the automotive supply chain is long and complex with its own inventory management practices. From chip production to car production, it takes at least 6 months with several tiers of suppliers in between. TSMC is doing its part to address the chip supply challenges for our customers.
In January of this year, TSMC announced that capacity support for automotive customers is our top priority. Since then, we have worked dynamically with our other customer to reallocate our wafer capacity to support worldwide automotive industry. However, the shortage further deteriorated due to the unexpected snowstorm in Texas and the fab manufacturing disruption in Japan. Together with our productivity improvement, we expect the automotive component shortage from semiconductor to be greatly reduced for TSMC's customer by the next quarter.
Now I will talk about Taiwan water supply update. The water supply in Taiwan is currently tight due to the lack of rainfall in the past year. We have been prepared for this. TSMC has a long-established enterprise risk management system in place, which cover water supply risk as well. Through our existing water-conservation measures, we are able to manage the current water usage reduction requirement from the government with no impact on our operations. We also have detailed response procedure to handle water shortage at different stages. We will continue our collaborative effort with the government and the private sector on water conservation and new water sources. With our comprehensive enterprise risk management system, we do not expect to see any material impact to our operations.
Finally, I will talk about the N5 and N3 status. TSMC's N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. N5 is already in its second year of volume production with yield better than our original plan. N5 demand continue to be strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications, and we expect N5 to contribute around 20% of our wafer revenue in 2021.
N4 will leverage the strong foundation of N5 to further extend our 5-nanometer family. N4 is a straightforward migration from N5 with compatible design rules while providing further performance, power and density enhancement for the next wave of 5-nanometer products. N4 risk production is targeted for second half this year and volume production in 2022. Thus, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, driven by the robust demand for smartphone and HPC applications.
N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 and will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We continue to see a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone applications at N3 as compared with N5 and N3 at a similar stage.
Risk production is scheduled in 2021. The volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology, which it is introduced -- when it's introduced, I'm sorry. Thus, we are confident that both our 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer will be large and long-lasting nodes for TSMC.

Intel is an important customer, and we will collaborate in some areas and compete in other area. And we always work with our customer to develop the necessary technology to support their products.
Now let me comment a little bit on the competition. As a leading pure-play foundry, TSMC has never been short on competition in our 30-plus-year history, and we know how to compete. We are -- we will continue to focus on delivering technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and earning our customers' trust. The last point, customers' trust, is fairly important because we do not have internal products that compete with our customer. So we can be the trusted technology and capacity provider and for years to come.
And if you ask other comment, how we support Intel, we support them as an important customer. And we plan our capacity for the long-term industry megatrend also. It's not for the short-term demand.",170,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But now as I said in my statement, the cost structure start to change, structural change, because of -- we have to invest on the leading-edge technology, which is more complex than ever. And we also increased the mature technology node capacity, which a lot of them already been fully depreciated and now we have to invest on the new tools.
So we refrain from opportunistic and short-term action, but we also had to share our value. So we are working with our customer closely, and we want to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level.

I do have a second question. I think we're -- for many reasons, we have seen in many countries, globally, they plan or they want to increase their -- build their own semiconductor fabrication capacity domestically. We're also seeing some IDM, they are forced to increase their in-sourcing or add some internal capacity because of the chip crunch. So my question is that IDM outsourcing has been one favorable driver for the foundry industry and TSMC growth in the past 3 decades and how TSMC see this trend evolving in coming years. And would you be concerning this could lead to some overcapacity in a few years even if some of those may not be effective? That is my second question.",122,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And we expand our capacity based on the customers' need. And we saw the technology leadership that provided their product to be very competitive in the market. So they are all happy to work with TSMC in developing their product for now, for the future.

And also, linked to that, what does that mean to the long-term gross margin trend? Because in today's conference call, I keep hearing some comments about structural cost increase.

It's okay. Yes, I think, Charlie, your question is on capital intensity, looking at what is the capital intensity looking like in the next few years.

Charlie, in terms of capital intensity, we -- I've actually given out several points already. First of all, if you look at -- we're saying in the next 3 years, we'll be spending USD 100 billion and this year will be $30 billion. We also say that in the next 5 years, we expect to grow between 10% to 15% revenue CAGR. So if you do math, you probably will have a good idea about where our capital intensity will be in the next 3 years. Now at this moment, we still expect that the capital intensity will go back to mid-30 level in the longer term. That's the capital intensity.
In terms of gross margins, I think as C.C. has already mentioned, we see some challenges from manufacturing costs due to the increasing complexity of leading nodes, the new investment in mature nodes and some rising material costs. And therefore, we are taking actions to ensure that we earn a proper return by firming up our price, working with the supplier to drive the cost improvement.

So can you give us a little bit more color about like what kind of application demand, which is strong enough to give the company such a high confidence for the CapEx?

I just got one question here. I think your top -- regarding your second quarter guidance, the revenue is going to grow sequentially in U.S. dollar terms. And also, if I don't remember wrong, Wendell did say that your inventory increase in Q1 was mainly because your customers prebuilt inventory for 5-nanometer. So that assumes that your 5-nanometer contribution will also increase in second quarter.
So -- and also the exchange rate, also not getting worse, right?
So against the backdrop of these 3 positive factors, right, revenue increase, 5-nanometer increase and favorable exchange rate, why your gross margin guidance for the second quarter is below your first quarter?",110,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Rick, let me explain to you. The sequential decline is mainly due to mix as the contribution from N5 will increase, but it still carries a dilutive effect. And secondly, we see a slower rate of cost improvement as our fabs continue to run at a very high level of utilization, leaving less time to do cost-improvement activities.

So I'm curious, factoring your depreciation guidance, 5 getting more mature, if your view is 50% gross margin or if you're running very tight utilization, we may be able to stay a bit above the long-term range in the second half.",125,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

I think when smartphone was our big growth driver in the last 10 years, we had leading-edge growth from processors, et cetera, but we also had a lot of other ICs in smartphones as well as our applications, which drove the second, third, fourth wave of demand for any process node.
So now that HPC seems to be one of the key drivers for growth, how do we think about second-, third-wave demand? Would it keep up with the first and second wave for N5, N3, et cetera? Or should we think about TSMC will be doing more capacity conversion compared to in the past? That's my first question.",130,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

And so we prepare the mature node capacity for them.
However, building a fab from a green fab start and also to install the capacity, it won't be available until 2023.

Second quarter revenue increased 2.7% sequentially in NT dollar terms or 2.9% in U.S. dollar term. Our second quarter business was supported by continued strength in HPC and automotive-related demand. 
Gross margin decreased 2.4 percentage points sequentially to 50% mainly due to N5 dilution, the slower rate of cost improvement and the absence of positive inventory revaluation. 
Total operating expenses slightly increased TWD 1.47 billion. Therefore, operating margins decreased 2.4 percentage points sequentially to 39.1%. 
Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 5.18 and ROE was 27.3%.  
Let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 18% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 31%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 49% of wafer revenue.  
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone decreased 3% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 12% to account for 39%. IoT decreased 2% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 12% to account for 4%. And DCE decreased 12% to account for 4%.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 871 billion. 
On the liability side, current liabilities decreased TWD 14 billion mainly due to the decrease of TWD 23 billion in accrued liabilities and others, partially offset by the increase of TWD 6 billion in dividend payable.  
Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 134 billion mainly as we raised TWD 137 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.  
On financial ratios. Accounts receivables turnover days increased 2 days to 42 days, while days of inventory also rose 2 days to 85 days primarily due to N5 wafer prebuild.  
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 187 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 167 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for third quarter of 2020 cash dividend.  Short-term loans increased TWD 4 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 137 billion. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 83 billion to TWD 748 billion at the end of the quarter.  
In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled USD 5.97 billion.  
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our third quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between USD 14.6 billion and USD 14.9 billion, which represents an 11% sequential increase at the midpoint. 
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.9, gross margin is expected to be between 49.5% and 51.5%, operating margin between 38.5% and 40.5%.  
This concludes my financial presentation. I will turn the microphone over to our CEO, C.C.",462,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with TSMC's long-term growth outlook and investment plan. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand as the multiyear megatrend of 5G- and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel massive increase in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, which will require leading-edge technologies.  
COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive and essential in people's lives. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well positioned to capture the structural growth from the favorable industry megatrend with our differentiated technologies. 
We now expect our long-term revenue CAGR from 2020 to 2025 to be near the high end of our 10% to 15% CAGR range in U.S. dollar terms.  
In the near term, we continue to observe both short-term imbalances in the supply chain driven by the need to ensure supply security, as well as a structural increase in long-term demand. While the short-term imbalance may or may not persist, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout the year and into 2022 fueled by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and special technologies.  
For the full year of 2021, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market excluding memory to grow about 17% while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 20%.  
We now expect -- for TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow above 20% in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms.  
To address the structural increase in long-term market demand profile, TSMC is working with closely our customer to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their demand. Our capital investment decision are based on 4 disciplines, that is: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return. 
To ensure a proper return from the investment, both pricing and costs are important. TSMC's pricing strategy is strategic, not opportunistic. At the same time, we face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node, new investment in mature nodes, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint and rising materials and basic commodities cost. 
Therefore, we are firming up our wafer pricing. We will continue to work closely with our customers to provide our value. We will also continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. By taking such actions, we believe we can continue to earn proper returns that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.  
Next, let me talk about automotive supply update. TSMC has actively taken steps throughout the first half of this year, and we will continue to do so in the second half to address the chip supply challenges for our automotive customers. The automotive supply chain is known and complex with its own inventory management practices.  
From chip production to car production, it takes at least 6 months to reach the automotive OEMs with several tiers of suppliers in between. However, we have worked dynamically with other customers to reallocate our wafer capacity to support the worldwide automotive industry. In first half of this year, we successfully increased our output for MCUs, one of the key components in automotive semiconductor products, by about 30% as compared to first half 2020. For the full year, we expect to increase output for MCUs by close to 60% over the 2020 level which also represents about a 30% increase over the 2018 prepandemic level.  
By taking such actions, we expect the automotive component shortage from semiconductor to be greatly reduced for TSMC customers starting this quarter.  
Now let me talk about the N5 and N4 progress. TSMC's N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. N5 is already in its second year of volume production with yields well on track. N5 demand continued to be strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications and we expect N5 to contribute around 20% of our wafer revenue in 2021.  
To further enhance our 5-nanometer family's performance, power and density improvements for the next wave 5-nanometer products, we introduced N4 technology, which is a straightforward migration from N5 with comparable design rules. N4 risk production will begin this quarter and volume production in 2022. Thus, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, driven by the robust demand for smartphone and HPC applications.  
Finally, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full scaling from our N5 and will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We have developed a complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone application of N3. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3 and expect more new tapeouts for N3 for the first year as compared with N5. 
Risk production is scheduled in 2021, and production will start in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced.  
With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that both N5 and N3 will be large and long-lasting nodes for TSMC and become an important driver of our long-term growth.

We concluded our second quarter with revenue of TWD 372.1 billion or USD 13.3 billion, slightly above our guidance mainly due to better demand from HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications than our forecast 3 months ago.  
Moving into third quarter 2021. We expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies driven by all 4 growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications.  
On the inventory side, we expect our fabless customers' overall inventory to exit second quarter of '21 at a healthy level. We expect our customers and the supply chain to gradually prepare higher levels of inventory in the second half of the year as compared to the historical seasonal level, given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security following supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions.  
Next, let me talk about our profitability. Our second quarter gross margin of 50% was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Our gross margin guidance provided 3 months ago was based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.4, whereas the actual second quarter exchange rate was USD 1 to TWD 28.01. This created about 0.5 percentage point difference in our actual second quarter gross margin versus our original guidance.  
In other words, if the exchange rate had maintained at $1 to TWD 28.4, our second quarter gross margin would have been 50.5%. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.9, we have just guided third quarter 2021 gross margin to increase by 0.5 percentage point sequentially to 50.5% at the midpoint, mainly due to better back-end profitability.  
Despite the rapidly rising depreciation costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rate, we are able to maintain our gross margin at above 50% in both second quarter and third quarter. Although a higher level of capital intensity is necessary in the near term as we are accelerating our investment pace in anticipation of the strong growth that will follow, we expect to continue to earn a similar level of long-term return.  
Our long-term financial objectives remain unchanged. We reiterate the long-term gross margin of above 50% is achievable with operating margin to be above 39% and ROE to be above 20% through the cycle.  
Now let me make some comments on our cash dividend distribution policy. TSMC remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. In June, TSMC's Board of Directors approved the distribution of a TWD 2.75 per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2021, which will be distributed in October 2021. Therefore, TSMC shareholders will receive a total of TWD 10.25 cash dividend per share in 2021. That also means shareholders will receive at least TWD 11 per share cash dividend for 2022 and the quarterly cash dividend is expected to be at least TWD 2.75 per share.  
Now let me turn the microphone over to our Chairman, Mark.",521,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thank you, Wendell, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will talk about TSMC's global manufacturing footprint. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. TSMC always treat our customers as partners. We do not compete with our customers. We grow our business by unleashing our customers' innovations and enabling their success. We earn our business by providing solid values, by providing industry-leading technologies, the world's largest logic capacity and efficient and cost-effective manufacturing to our customers, while maintaining trusting relationship with them.  
In our capital investment, our responsibility as TSMC management is to make the best decision in the interest of the company and our customers. And our fiduciary duty is to our shareholders.  
As the need for semiconductor infrastructure security has increased in recent years, we are expanding our global manufacturing footprint to sustain and enhance our competitive advantages and to better serve our customers in the new geopolitical environment.  
In Taiwan, we are building capacity for N5 and N3 in Tainan Science Park. Due to the strong customer demand, we have further expand -- plan to expand in Northern, Central and Southern Science Parks in Taiwan. And Taiwan will continue to be the home base and center of R&D for TSMC. As the initial phase of volume production of a leading-edge technology has to be in close proximity and closely coupled with R&D fab due to massive collaborative engineering activities, our leading node will continue to be ramped in Taiwan as well.  
In the U.S., we are increasing our presence with an advanced 12-inch semiconductor fab in Arizona and the progress is well on track with our plan. We are actively in a fast learning phase to optimize the operating efficiency for the U.S. fab.  
The first wave of U.S.-hired engineers arrived Taiwan in late April for training on 5-nanometer technology. Construction of the fab has already begun with equipment moving in scheduled for second half 2022. Phase 1 volume production of 20,000 wafer per month of 5-nanometer technology will begin in first quarter '24. At that time, our 5-nanometer family will still be the most advanced high-volume production technology commercially available in the U.S.  
Our customers welcome us to build capacity in the U.S. and pledged their strong support and business commitments. Therefore, we do not rule out the possibility of a second phase of expansion to meet our customers' strong demand.  
In China, as our fab construction in Nanjing has already completed in 2017, we have completed the Phase 1 volume ramp in third quarter 2020, now reaching 25,000 wafer per month capacity of 16-nanometer technology. We are further expanding our presence in Nanjing with 28-nanometer technology to support our customers' urgent needs with volume production beginning in second half 2022 and reaching 40,000 wafer per month capacity by mid-2023. 
For the long term, we forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications and our structural demand for 28-nanometer will be strongly supported by multiple specialty technologies.  
Our global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customer needs, business opportunities, operating efficiencies and cost economic considerations. While overseas fab are not initially able to match the cost of our manufacturing operations in Taiwan, we will work with governments to minimize the cost gap to ensure we start with a level playing field. We are working closely with our customers to firm up our wafer pricing to reflect the cost increases and ensure we earn a proper return. We will work diligently on enhancing our operations and service capabilities and optimize our efficiencies in overseas locations to continue to provide technology leadership with efficient and cost-effective manufacturing for our customers.  
By taking such steps, we believe an expansion of our global manufacturing footprint will enable us to reach global talent, better serve our customers' needs, earn the proper return from our investment and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.

C.C., you mentioned that you're expecting demand to still remain extremely strong, supply to remain tight through end of this year potentially through next year as well. 
Could you talk about when do you expect supply and demand to come back into balance? Do you see a situation where your customers go into a bit of an inventory correction mode sometime soon?

Wei,,Executives,9,"Well, Gokul, let me answer your question. Let's -- let me share with you our perspective on the shortage right now. The current semiconductor capacity shortage is being driven by both a structural increase in long-term market demand and also a short-term imbalance in the supply chain due to uncertainties from COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions. And that may or may not persist.  
We do not rule out the possibility of an inventory correction in the future, but we expect our capacity will remain tight throughout this year and extend at least into 2022. But let me share with you also that even inventory correction to occur, we believe it will be less volatile than previous downturn as our underlying structural megatrend of 5G-related and HPC application will continue.

I think that ensures business continuity of TSMC and also global semi supply chain.  
And my question is about still your gross margin trend. So first of all, is your 3D IC or advanced packaging. It seems like Wendell mentioned that the back end product possibilities are getting better in 3Q, I'm not sure if that's true. So the question is that currently the percentage of advanced packaging of TSMC's revenue. 
And would the company still believe 3D packaging can still outgrow the wafer business and whether they would create a margin dilution. So the first question is about the 3D advanced packaging.",120,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

First of all, the gross margin that I was talking about, improvement of back-end service in the third quarter actually is a seasonal factor. As you know, our back-end services has seasonality. So second half normally has a higher gross margin. But longer term, we expect its margin to continue to improve although it's still not as high as a gross margin of our wafer revenue. But it has a lower asset capital intensity, therefore, the returns from back-end services is satisfactory.

Yes, my next question is about the long-term gross margin trend, right? Because we did create something better about the thrust -- or the higher CapEx intensity, your bargaining power against different vendors and those customers. So really, I want to ask this openly to company management. Does TSMC believe you has acquired the monopoly of the leading edge in the industry, why and why not? 
And if yes, do you think you have the monopoly, why can not TSMC charge higher wafer price to cover the increase of CapEx intensity?

And it's far away from you say that we try to bargaining power. In fact, we work with our customers closely and we want to help them to be successful while we get a proper return. That's all I can answer for you for our pricing. 
And looking ahead, we continue our practice, try our best to hear our customers, to grow and we want to get the proper return. So that's why we are firming up our wafer pricing.

I guess you've talked about 50% gross margin as a long-term target for quite some time now. And I understand there's been FX headwinds and the 5-nanometer ramp as a headwind. If I look at your big fabless customers, they are delivering structurally much higher gross margins as a result of accessing your leading-edge capacity, particularly in the last 12 months when your gross margins are going down.

Brett's first question is about our gross margin. He notes that, of course, we have been facing headwinds from the foreign exchange rate and also the 5-nanometer ramp, which carries some level of dilution. But he points out that our customers' gross margin is, particularly in the last 12 months, has been structurally higher than ours. So he wants to know, given our position, do we think 50% is achievable? Why would it not be something structurally higher? Is that correct, Brett?",83,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

This is Wendell. Let me answer your question. First, if we look at shorter term, you talked about in the last 12 months. Foreign exchange does play a very big role in the gross margin between last year and this year, year-to-date. 
Last year, the dollar against NT rate was $29.43 in average. This year, year-to-date, is 28% -- somewhere around 28%. That creates a 2 percentage point difference in gross margin, i.e., if the gross margin -- I mean, if foreign exchange rate stays where it was last year, we would be having a 52% gross margin in the second quarter already. And also, I talked about the dilution from the N5 this year, another 2 to 3 points. So with all these negatives, we still can make 50% in second quarter and the third quarter. That's the short term. 
Now longer term, the investment that we are making is for future business growth. At some point of time, at the beginning, we made -- the short-term advanced technology is getting more and more challenging in cost. Then we are working closely with our customers to firm up the wafer pricing and also working with our suppliers to ensure that the cost improvement can be delivered. And with all these efforts, we still think that 50% is a good target and is achievable.",225,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Historically, if I understand correctly, your smartphone platform seems to lead the adoption in the past, at least especially in the first year of the production ramp. And I think you did say that the high-performance computing will be coming increasingly important. 
So the question really is about 3-nanometer, which we are about a year away from the mass production. So could high-performance computing, from what you see today, really play a bigger role or even like the leading role in the first ramp of the 3-nanometer especially in the first year?

So Charles' first question is about the drivers of leading node adoption. He notes in the past traditionally it's mainly come from smartphones, but HPC also seems to becoming more important.

Wei,,Executives,97,"Charles, This is C.C. Wei. Let me answer this one. The N3's first year is ramping up, still smartphone plays the biggest role. Of course, your observation is correct. HPC application is also important and getting more and more important. And in fact, HPC will be our largest revenue driver in the next 5 years. So in the N3 node, in addition to the smartphones, we do expect the HPC's application will become important also. Did that answer your question?",80,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Excellent. So maybe the second question, I still want to touch upon your global expansion. I know you probably are tired of answering that already, but forgive me, I'm going to ask another one. 
You announced your fab in Arizona, which the technology node will be 5-nanometer. And as I understand, 5-nanometer wafers will very likely require your in-house advanced packaging solutions like either InFo, CoWoS or maybe even SoIC going forward. So -- but your current packaging facilities, as I know, are 100% in Taiwan. And I can imagine that if you are really out putting wafers in Arizona for 5-nanometer, based on your current footprint, you got to ship those back to Taiwan for packaging then send back to your customers, which I can imagine it could be a little bit challenging in terms of cost, logistical efficiency. 
So I'm not going to ask for a specific plan, but do you kind of foresee maybe you want to set up an advanced packaging facility in Arizona in the near future?",174,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I counted, you said geopolitical risk 5x during today's call. And someone mentioned about the fact it seems in Taiwan with vaccines are getting even more political. I just wonder, for management, how concerned are you with politics? It seems the U.S. sometimes is fighting against China; China, Taiwan. And what things have you thought about to mitigate, if anything, such political risk? 
And also, are your customers concerned when COVID happened in Taiwan, when China from time to time threatened a war against Taiwan? And are your customers concerned that they are so reliant on you?",103,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

So Martin's question is about politics and geopolitical risks. He notes that geopolitical is talked about more and more. His observation is that vaccines in Taiwan has become a political issue as well. So he wants to know how does TSMC manage or mitigate the political risks looking at U.S., China, Taiwan relations? 
And do our customers have concerns on things such as the recent increase in COVID or the threat of invasion from China? And how does TSMC manage these risks?",83,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

Thank you for asking. First of all, the -- on the recent COVID situation in Taiwan, I think the confirmed case has dropped. And of course, the current -- first priority is to get the people of Taiwan get vaccinated upon variants keep coming. But I'm really grateful that us and YongLin and Foxconn come together a humanitarian donation of 10 million doses of vaccine to the Taiwan government, CDC -- Taiwan's CDC and be able to vaccinate our people in Taiwan because TSMC's employees is inevitably embedded in the community of Taiwan, and that is important. 
The reason -- you know this could be political in the beginning. But at the end, we completed the contract and we did get support from all sites. So I don't think at the end it's as political anymore. Otherwise, this donation wouldn't be successful.
In a global sense, the geopolitical development is continuing. I think this is a challenge for every company. Every company's management has to deal with it. And -- but I think in the new administration from U.S., I think the development is more predictable, more rule-based. So as long as rule-based, I think it's better for every company to adopt it, too. 
So that also prompted the talk I have earlier -- given earlier that the global manufacturing footprint may need to do an adjustment for our customers. Our customers in different countries, their infrastructure, supply security -- semiconductor-related infrastructure, supply security maybe come up a higher priority, and we do that adjusted to it. But of course, there is the customers' needs that we are adjusting it to upon the greater geopolitical development. 
As to the invasion of China, let me tell you, nobody -- I mean, everybody wants to have a peaceful Taiwan Strait. And because not only -- because it is to every country's benefit, but also because of the semiconductor supply chain in Taiwan, no one wants to disrupt it. You have a COVID -- only a COVID situation already made a major disruption for the global economy. And I don't think that any disability in Taiwan Strait is any country wish to make it happen. So I'm optimistic on that. Thank you, Martin.",374,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Can I follow up with a second one? It's kind of related. You mentioned about global manufacturing. You also mentioned about the need to maintain your highest -- most of your technology in Taiwan because of the proximity to R&D. My understanding is majority of our engineers are from Taiwan. 
As you go for this global manufacturing, do you -- can you talk about how you are changing, say, for example, your talent acquisition? Like how you try to get more people outside Taiwan so that maybe over time you can become more manufacturing outside Taiwan? 
And also maybe on the Board, I mean, because when I look at the Board, it remains largely Taiwanese. The recent 2 additions, one is Dr. Kung who's a minister; Yancei who's from Delta. Do you see also the Board maybe changing, become more international? Or maybe if I try to propose some debate, have a Mainland Chinese on the Board?",159,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

So Martin's second question is around talent and Board composition. Basically, with our expanding manufacturing footprint, he wants to know what is our strategy to attract more global talent for TSMC.

Indeed, I think the -- we have been advocating the talent development in semiconductor field in Taiwan as well as in U.S. I think semiconductor industry talent has been underdeveloped over the past decades. And today, everyone look at the semiconductor as a key economic drivers. So the talent needs to be connected with that. And in Taiwan, I think we have been advocating the government to set up the high-end advanced research colleges across the Taiwan major universities. 
In the U.S. and also President Biden talked about semiconductor human infrastructure, that is to develop the human talent in semiconductor through the vast investment of the R&D. So this is catching up in every place. And particularly in Taiwan, we get very strong support from the local government to be able to continue to supply talents in Taiwan. 
As far as the Board member, yes, Delta, Yancei has joined a year ago. And more recently, I think this coming shareholder meeting, we will nominate Rafael Reif, who is the President of MIT, to come to our Board. And we hope that it will go through the blessing of our shareholders. And that is a major increment of our corporate governance and particularly in the area of the talent development. 
We invited chair -- Board members upon they have a very strong knowledge and experience on the corporate governance. And that is we will continue to look for without any differentiation about nationalities.",246,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Third quarter revenue increased 11.4% sequentially in NT terms or 12% in dollar terms. Our third quarter business was driven by strong demand across all 4 growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications.  
Gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 51.3%, mainly due to the improvement in back-end profitability and a more favorable technology mix. Operating margin increased 2.1 percentage points sequentially to 41.2%, mainly due to better operating leverage. Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 6.03 and ROE was 30.7%.  
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 18% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 34%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 52% of wafer revenue.  
Now moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 15% quarter-over-quarter to account for 44% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 9% to account for 37%. IoT increased 23% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 4%. And DCE decreased 2% to account for 3%.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 976 billion or equivalent USD 35 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased TWD 8 billion mainly due to the increase of TWD 24 billion in accounts payables and the increase of TWD 6 billion in dividend payable, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 21 billion in short term loans.  
Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 50 billion mainly as we raised TWD 49 billion corporate bonds during the quarter.  
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 40 days while days of inventory remained at 85 days.  
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 319 billion in cash from operations, including some customer prepayments, spent TWD 189 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for fourth quarter '20 cash dividend. Short-term loans decreased TWD 18 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 49 billion. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 106 billion to TWD 854 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled USD 6.77 billion.  
I'll finish my financial summary. Now let's turn on to our fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 15.4 billion and USD 15.7 billion, which represents a 4.5% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28, gross margin is expected to be between 51% and 53%, operating margin between 39% and 41%.  
On July 12, we announced we have completed the purchase of 5 million doses of vaccine as part of our efforts to help fight against COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. We recognized a small portion of the vaccine donation expense in the third quarter and the majority of it will be recognized in the fourth quarter, which will have around 1 percentage point impact on our operating margin.  
This concludes my financial presentation.  
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our 2021 capital budget.  
Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications. In order to support our customers' growth and meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies in the next several years, we have budgeted our full year 2021 CapEx to be around USD 30 billion.  
Next, let me talk about our profitability. Our third quarter gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 51.3% mainly due to better back-end profitability and technology mix. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28, we have just guided fourth quarter 2021 gross margin to be 52% at the midpoint.  
The midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin guidance also implies that our full year 2021 gross margin is expected to be higher than 50% despite the rapidly rising depreciation cost, the dilution from N5 ramp and the unfavorable foreign exchange rate in 2021 as compared to 2020.  
As we have discussed before, 6 factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership, technology development and ramp-up; pricing; cost; capacity utilization; technology mix; and foreign exchange rate, which is not controllable. Taking all these factors into consideration, we believe our long-term gross margin of 50% and higher is achievable.  
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",781,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of TWD 414.7 billion or USD 14.9 billion, driven by strong demand across all 4 core platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications.  
Moving into fourth quarter 2021. We expect our sequential growth to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technology. Based on the midpoint of our fourth quarter revenue guidance, our full year 2021 revenue is expected to grow about 24% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms.  
On the inventory front, we continue to expect our customers and the supply chain to gradually prepare a higher level of inventory in the second half of this year as compared to the historical seasonal level. Given the industry continuing to ensure supply security, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory for a longer period of time.  
In the near term, we continue to observe short-term imbalances due to interruptions in the supply chain brought about by COVID-19. We also continue to observe the structural increase in long-term demand, underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications and the higher silicon content in many end devices, including automotive, PCs, servers, networking and smartphones.  
While the short-term imbalances may or may not persist, we believe our technology leadership will enable TSMC to capture the strong demand for our advanced and specialty technologies, and we expect our capacity to remain tight in 2021 and throughout 2022.  
Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth driver and return. We are entering a period of higher structural growth. The multiyear megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel a massive requirement for computation power and propel greater need for energy-efficient computing, which demands the use of leading-edge technologies. These megatrends will not only spur unit growth but also drive increasing semiconductor content in HPC, smartphone, automotive and IoT applications.  
COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive and essential in people's lives. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, TSMC is better positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend with our differentiated technologies.  
To address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile, TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their demand.  
Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customer's trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node, new investment in mature nodes, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint and rising material and basic commodity cost.  
As we continue to work closely with our customers to support their growth, our pricing strategy will remain strategic, not opportunistic, to reflect our value creation. We will also continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement.  
Even as we shoulder a greater burden of the investment for the industry, by taking such actions, we believe we can achieve a proper return that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth with 50% and higher gross margin for our shareholders.  
Now let me talk about our Japan fab plan. We are expanding our manufacturing footprint to sustain and enhance our competitive advantage in providing industry-leading technologies, the world's largest logic capacity, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing and to better serve our customers.  
Our global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customers' needs, business opportunities, operating efficiency and cost economic considerations. After conducting due diligence, we announced our intention to build a specialty technology fab in Japan, subject to our Board of Directors' approval.  
We have received a strong commitment to support this project from both our customers and the Japanese government. This fab will utilize 22-, 28-nanometer technology for semiconductor wafer fabrication. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in 2022 and production is targeted to begin in late 2024. Further details will be provided subject to the Board approval.  
We believe the expansion of our global manufacturing footprint will enable us to better serve our customers' need and reach global talent while earning the proper return from our investments and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.  
Finally, I'll talk about the N3 and N3E status. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track. We have developed complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3 risk production is scheduled in 2021, and production will start in second half of 2022. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3 and expect more new tapeouts for N3 for the first year as compared with N5.  
We also introduced N3E as an extension of our N3 family, N3E will feature improved manufacturing process window with better performance, power and yield. Volume production of N3E is scheduled for 1 year after N3.  
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that N3 family will be another long and last -- will be large and long-lasting node for TSMC.

My first question is on the long-term road map. Intel has now unveiled their long-term road map until 2025 with 4 process nodes, looking to catch up with TSMC and potentially even overtake. Could TSMC talk a little bit more about its own longer-term road map, timing of adoption of some of the new technologies like gate-all-around, high-end EUV battery power line, et cetera? 
And where does TSMC see itself from a process technology leadership perspective in the next 3 to 5 years? The entry message is definitely well received. But maybe could we talk a little bit more longer term, given some of your competitors are kind of addressing that kind of time frame as well?

So looking at CapEx, I think back in Q1 results, TSMC indicated spending $100 billion-plus in CapEx over the next 3 years. Since then, you have talked about Japan capacity expansion. It looks like there are some capacity expansion plans for leading-edge in Taichung as well. Could we talk a little bit about is $100 billion going to be enough? Or do you still need to see -- do you still see some upside to this $100 billion budget on the CapEx over the next 3 to 4 years since the growth seems to be stronger?  
And if we see that upside in CapEx, are we still looking at the high end of 10% to 15% growth CAGR? Or do we believe that there could be faster growth than this 10% to 15% -- or high end of 10% to 15% that we had talked about previously?",148,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return, as C.C. just mentioned.  
Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As we said, we are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand, underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications and increasing silicon content. So as long as our growth outlook looks good, there could be upside to our CapEx plans, and we will continue our disciplined investment approach to support our customers and capture the growth opportunities.

But let me say that TSMC's participation in the global automotive IC market is only about 15%. And we are doing our part to support our automotive customer with what they need. However, we cannot solve the entire industry's supply challenge. And recent factors, such as pandemic in Southeast Asia, are also affecting the auto IC supply. Again, we are actively taking the steps throughout the first half of this year to address the chip supply challenges for our automotive customer.

But on the other hand, on the demand side, we are also seeing that smartphone growth is slowing down, particularly in China. So I think back in the early -- earlier this year, we mentioned about a 5G smartphone shipment. We estimate that will be 500 million to 550 million units. Just wondering, do you still keep that target? 
And also, do you have any idea or preliminary projection for the 5G smartphone into next year? And also, where is like the smartphone if 5G move into a more like a lower-end or mainstream kind of segment? What's the implication to TSMC? That's my first question.",126,1.0,6.0,0.5555555555555556,0.6

So Laura's second question is on capital -- CapEx intensity. She is asking, what is the outlook for our capital intensity beyond 2023? Will we still have a very high level of capital intensity?

Laura, in 2020, the capital intensity was 38%. 2021, this year, is going to be over 50%. As we said earlier, and C.C. mentioned this earlier, our CapEx stand every year in anticipation of the growth in the future years. So if we think the future growth outlook is good, then there's a possibility of higher CapEx. 
And we're entering into a higher-growth period because of the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC applications plus the silicon content increase. So the capital -- higher capital investment in the next few years is appropriate. As a result, we expect the capital intensity to be relatively higher than previous year, like in 2020, for the next 2 to 3 years before gradually coming down maybe to mid- to high 30s level from what I can see at this moment.

So my follow-up is that given that the next couple of years' CapEx plan, it is still fluid, and I think CFO also mentioned there could be upside to our CapEx plan because of the Japan or any other reasons. So does that imply this will be a continuous adjustment? Meaning that it won't be just 1 shot, but we will evaluate the future pricing and what kind of value we can offer to customers based on the CapEx and based on our -- and also to balance the structural profitability.

Is there a function of end demand? Or is it a function of not being able to get the components to make those products? And then I have a quick follow-up.,87,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

Krish's first question is on the higher level of inventory that we see preparing in the supply chain. He wants to know which end markets or applications specifically or which technology nodes do we see this higher level of inventory. And then also, the slower momentum in the sell-through of smartphone or PCs, is this related to component tightness or shortages?",63,-6.0,7.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7

Wei,,Executives,116,"Well, let me answer the question. The high level of inventory is actually is caused by some of the necessity, not to the disruption in the supply chain. So it's across the board. Actually, it's not any node or any product. It's across the board. 
And we say it will be continued for a period of time. That is because of today, all those elements to drive the people to prepare more inventory still continue to exist. Did that answer your question?",82,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

Yes, it did. And then just like the second part of this question, which is the softness in smartphone and PCs, is that end demand-related or component tightness-related?

This year, you just guided 24% year-over-year growth. I think this number is probably in line with the industry. It is clear we have a strong growth in advanced technology but losing some share in the legacy. Earlier, Wendell mentioned we will build more mature technology based on the customers' demand.

But certainly, the most important thing is that we are working with our customers to support their demand. This is very important. That including the specialty technologies.
