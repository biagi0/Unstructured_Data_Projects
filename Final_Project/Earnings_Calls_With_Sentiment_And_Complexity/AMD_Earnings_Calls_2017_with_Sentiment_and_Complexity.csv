168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2017",2017-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2845.0,1120949.0,46509061.0,Presenter Speech,Lisa Su,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Laura. And good afternoon to all those listening in today. In 2016, we made meaningful progress across the company, strengthening our product offerings, regaining share in key markets and creating a solid foundation for sustainable growth. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.11 billion grew 15% from the year-ago period based on a substantial increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue. 
Revenue decreased 15% sequentially based on seasonally lower semi-custom SoC shipments, while we achieved our second straight quarter of Computing and Graphics segment revenue growth. 
For the full year, growth across both of our business segments resulted in a 7% increase in annual revenue, non-GAAP gross margin expansion and positive free cash flow. 
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment. On a full year basis, CG annual revenue grew for the first time since 2011 as our focus on strengthening this key part of our business gained momentum. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased 28% from the year-ago period, based on strong GPU and mobile APU sales growth. Our CG quarterly revenue was the highest in 2 years. Our client revenue was the highest in 7 quarters and we delivered our highest graphics processor revenue in 11 quarters. 
Mobile APU shipments and revenue growth accelerated as strong adoption of our seventh-generation notebook APUs drove notebook share gains in the quarter. Desktop processor sales increased sequentially and declined from a year ago in advance of our Ryzen desktop processor launch this quarter. 
At CES, we highlighted broad design win and ecosystem momentum for Ryzen. 17 different system integrators unveiled Ryzen-based gaming and enthusiast systems, and multiple ecosystem partners announced plans to offer a broad range of premium Ryzen motherboards. We have also secured a number of high-end design wins for Ryzen with our global OEMs. We remain on track to launch Ryzen in early March, with widespread system and channel availability expected on day 1. 
In Graphics, strong sales increases across all of our product lines drove a double-digit increase in GPU processor revenue from a year ago. Desktop GPU shipments and revenue increased by double-digit percentages from a year ago based on growing OEM and channel adoption of Polaris GPUs. Polaris processor sales were particularly strong in the performance and enthusiast portions of the market, resulting in our highest channel GPU sales in more than 2 years. Mobile GPU sales growth outpaced desktop in the quarter, and we believe we gained further share in this part of the market as the first Polaris-based notebooks launched. 
We also launched Radeon Pro 400 mobile GPUs in the quarter. These ultrathin performance GPUs are ideal for mobile content creators and are powering Apple's latest premium MacBook Pro notebooks. And in professional graphics, we finished off a record year with record quarterly revenue and unit shipments. 
Traditional workstation GPU sales grew in the quarter as HP, Dell and others began offering systems powered by our recently launched Radeon Pro WX GPUs. 
We also continued to make progress in the server GPU market with sales increasing significantly to support new mega data center deployments. 
As a part of our strategy to drive Radeon GPUs into the data center, we announced our Radeon Instinct family of machine intelligence accelerators and detailed our plan to expand the market for machine learning based on AMD's unique combination of high-performance GPUs, CPUs and open-source software. 
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 4% from a year ago, driven by growing embedded processor sales and ongoing demand for AMD-powered Microsoft and Sony game consoles. As we expected, revenue declined sequentially following the annual sales peak in the third quarter. 2016 game console sales aligned with our expectations, resulting in new records for semi-custom annual unit shipments and sales. Embedded processor sales grew by double-digit percentages sequentially and from the year-ago period based on adoption across our targeted vertical markets. And development of our next-generation server CPU, Naples, is on track as we continue to expand the breadth of our customer and partner engagements to enable broad platform ecosystem and software validation work in advance of launch. 
Naples is meeting our performance targets and customer response to our competitiveness and differentiated feature set continues to be overwhelmingly positive. As a result, we expanded our design win momentum in both traditional and cloud servers as well as in the embedded infrastructure and communications markets. 
As we look back on 2016, we successfully accomplished our key priorities including growing discrete graphics share, led by Polaris GPU adoption; regaining client compute share, led by our seventh-generation APUs; growing in adjacent markets with record annual semi-custom game console revenue and professional graphics; and strengthening the financial foundation of the company by achieving annual non-GAAP operating profitability, reducing debt and increasing cash. 
All of our work in the past 2 years has been designed to strengthen the technical, operational and financial foundation of the company. We entered 2017 with strong revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities as we prepare to launch our Zen-based CPUs and Vega GPUs that can return AMD to the high-performance markets where we have not materially participated in recent years. The production ramp, customer adoption and ecosystem support for our Zen-based desktop processor, Ryzen, are all mapped into our plans. 
We also remain on track to expand Zen into the data center market in the second quarter, followed by the embedded and notebook markets in the second half of the year. 
Our Vega GPU development is also progressing to plan. Vega is designed to scale beyond the limitations of current GPUs to enable PC gaming, professional design and machine intelligence experiences that traditional GPU architectures have not been able to effectively address. We provided our first performance preview of Vega GPUs earlier in the quarter in advance of the launch planned for the second quarter of this year. 
Bringing all this together, based on our current market expectations and the strength of our upcoming products, we are confident we can grow annual revenue, expand gross margin and deliver non-GAAP net income in 2017. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter financial performance.",1024,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2017",2017-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2845.0,1120949.0,46509062.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2016 was a good year for AMD as we grew revenue, improved our financial performance and strengthened the financial foundation of the company. 
AMD annual revenue grew 7% year-over-year with growth in both business segments. We expanded gross margin, maintained essentially flat operating expenses, achieved operating profitability and reduced net losses significantly. 
In addition, we improved our balance sheet with strategy capital market transactions that reduced and reprofiled debt and lowered interest expense. 
Finally, we generated positive free cash flow and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1.26 billion. 
Now let me provide the specifics of the fourth quarter 2016, together with quarterly year-over-year comparisons. Revenue was $1.1 billion, increasing 15% year-over-year, due primarily to higher GPU processor sales, and declining 15% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs, partially offset by higher sales in the Computing and Graphics segment. 
Gross margin was 32%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and up 1 percentage point from the prior quarter due to higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue. 
Operating expenses were $357 million compared to $323 million a year ago and $353 million in the prior quarter. Both increases were due to ongoing targeted investments in R&D to support our new products. 
Net licensing gains associated with our server JV with THATIC was $31 million, up from $24 million in the prior quarter. Operating income was $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to an operating loss of $39 million a year ago and operating income of $70 million in the prior quarter. Operating income is down from the prior quarter due to lower revenue. 
Fourth quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $34 million, down from $44 million -- down from $40 million a year ago and $43 million in Q3 2016, primarily due to reduced interest expense. 
Net loss was $8 million, a loss per share of $0.01 calculated using 931 million shares of common stock. This compares to a net loss of $79 million or $0.10 a year ago and net income of $27 million or $0.03 in the prior quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $60 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of minus $5 million a year ago and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million in the third quarter of 2016. 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $600 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially, primarily due to higher GPU and client processor sales. Computing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $21 million, improving significantly from a loss of $99 million from a year ago and a loss of $66 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $506 million, up 4% year-over-year and down 39% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $47 million, down from $59 million a year ago and down from $136 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher R&D investments in Q4 2016, partially offset by an IP monetization licensing gain. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.26 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $785 million a year ago and $1.26 billion in the prior quarter. 
Inventory was $751 million compared to $678 million a year ago and $772 million in the prior quarter. Inventory levels were higher from 1 year ago in support of product transitions and higher revenue in the first half of 2017. 
Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 2016 was $665 million and $239 million in the fourth quarter. 
Long-term debt on the balance sheet as of the end of the quarter was $1.44 billion, down from $1.63 billion in the prior quarter, primarily due to debt redemptions. The principal debt amount of $1.77 billion, down from $1.93 billion as of the end of the third quarter 2016, is reflected on the balance sheet as a carrying value of debt after netting the unamortized discount of our convertible debt and issuance cost. 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we redeemed $268 million principal amount of debt. In addition, we issued $105 million principal amount of 2 1/8% convertible notes due 2026 as a result of the underwriters exercising the option to purchase an additional 15% of the original issuance, bringing the total principal balance of the convertible notes to $805 million. 
Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $167 million, a significant improvement from $27 million 1 year ago and $20 million in the third quarter of 2016. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, we expect revenue to decrease 11% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. The midpoint of guidance will result in Q1 2017 revenue increasing approximately 18% year-over-year; gross margin to be approximately 33%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $360 million; interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; inventory to be approximately flat sequentially. 
We look forward to sharing additional 2017 and long-term guidance parameters at our Financial Analyst Day in May. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2016. As we begin 2017, we look forward to introducing several new leadership products and remain focus on further improving our financial and operational performance.

My understanding was that Ryzen was a higher-end SKU to comp against the Core i5 or Core i7, which is above where the existing microprocessors competed in the stack. So I'm wondering if we should think about Ryzen either cannibalizing the existing desktop microprocessors at a higher ASP? Or are you kind of ramping down the lower end? Or should we think about Ryzen layering on top of the existing lower-end desktop microprocessors?",95,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Thanks for the question. So look, you are absolutely right. Ryzen is really a high-end desktop product, and I think the comment was really around our overall channel inventories in desktop. So we wanted to ensure a very smooth transition. No question that Ryzen will layer on top, competing well in the Core i7, Core i5 range.

And so as we go through the year, I think we're quite pleased with the performance that we're seeing on both of those products. And so we should see Ryzen doing very well on the high end as well as Vega. And by nature, since both of those high-end markets are markets that we don't have significant presence today, there will be an opportunity to both gain share as well as increase attach rates in those markets.",114,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Absolutely, Matt. So as you stated, Ryzen and Naples share the same core, the same CPU core, which is our Zen core. Our performance on that core has done very well. We've actually met or exceeded our expectations. So Ryzen will launch in early March. Naples will launch in the second quarter. We've made very good progress, actually, in the last few months with customers really testing the performance capability on their own software and their own application workloads, so we feel good about where the product is positioned. We expect that the key workload -- Naples has really -- has broad applicability in the server market. But we're especially targeting workloads that will benefit from more threads, higher memory, as well as I/O-bound applications, so we expect cloud, big data applications as well as traditional enterprise.

And then a couple of follow-ups for Devinder, if I could. I noticed quite a big ramp year-over-year in growth in the Computing and Graphic segments, but it's still a slight operating loss on the P&L. Maybe you could talk through maybe as the new product launches in the GPU and CPU segments through the year, how do you think about gross margin in that Computing and Graphics segment and getting that back to profitability? And then quickly, I think you guys guided to $50 million in THATIC IP revenue. Any help about how that is distributed through the year would be really helpful.",105,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We had $88 million of that in 2016. As you observed, we guided $50 million in 2017. It's really dependent on milestone deliveries. But I can share with you that based on tracking to those milestones, we expect to recognize approximately half of that, call it $25 million in Q1 of 2017. And then as far as the second question, the segment, Computing and Graphics, yes, very good progress, I think, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We're very pleased with that. The segment loss has gone down significantly from Q4 of 2015, where we were about $100 million, to about $20 million. And with the new products that are coming up, in particular the Ryzen product we just talked about, with better gross margins, and other products in the graphics space, we expect to continue to make progress in that segment and reduce the losses and get back to profitability.",162,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So on the console market, I think you're right. I think the last few years have been very good from a console cycle standpoint. We finished 2016 with both units and revenue up. As we go into 2017, this is going to be the 5th year of the cycle. So normally, if you look at historicals, it would say that hardware sales might be down. This cycle is a bit different with both the PlayStation 4 Pro that launched a couple of quarters ago and then the Scorpio -- Microsoft Scorpio that will launch later this year. So we'll need to see how they do through the year. But I think from our standpoint, the console business has been a strong business performer for us and we're pleased with that. Relative to the GPU market, we were very pleased with the performance in Q4 and actually throughout 2016. We've got both nice desktop channel as well as notebook acceleration as we went through the year. In terms of channel inventory levels, actually they look quite normal. I would say we drained a little bit of inventory in Q4. We would expect a seasonal slowdown as we go into Q1 ahead of our product launches, but nothing unusual in the channel inventory on the GPU side.",218,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So on the CPU side with Ryzen and Naples, we believe we'll be quite competitive. On the GPU side, as we launch Vega, we will have a full stack sort of top to bottom with new hardware. We continue to invest in software, and our approach to software is really around open source and using the ecosystem and using the community and focused on sort of the new APIs.

For the first quarter and then perhaps more importantly for the full year, can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics between your 2 segments? You guide down 11% for the first quarter. Which is above or below that number? And then how does mix change throughout the year as you have a bunch of new products launching on one side of the equation but perhaps not as many on the EESC side?",81,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

So for Q1, I think if you look at the overall -- the guidance sequentially down 11%, you would expect that the semi-custom business should be down more than that, and you've seen that in our numbers in the past couple of years. So it's behaving as it normally would. Sequentially, you would expect that the Computing and Graphics segment would be better than seasonal, given that we'll have 1 month of Ryzen in the market. On a year-over-year basis, I would say the Computing and Graphics business is where you're seeing the majority of the growth as we go into Q1, with both GPU as well as Ryzen driving that growth. As we go forward in the year, I think the expectations are that the product launches tend to be faster in the CG segment. In other words, from launch to revenue ramp, it's faster because it's more consumer-based. So as we launch Ryzen in the first quarter and Vega in the second quarter, then notebook and embedded in the second half, you would expect to see that reflected. On the EESC side of the business, we do have our Microsoft Scorpio design win that will ramp in the year, and that's an important one from the semi-custom side. And we'll see Naples ramp as well, albeit server will tend to be a little bit slower from design win to revenue ramp. We would expect some contribution in the second half of the year.",248,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

How do we think about the OpEx side of things as we go through the year? And I know you purposely didn't guide to it in your 2017 as a whole.

We did that, as you saw in the 2014, '15 time frame. In 2016, we made some very targeted investments to products, which is -- with the launches that are happening in 2017, I'd say they're going to pay off in terms of all the products we have on track to launch in 2017. We have invested in software. We have got obviously some go-to-market expenses as we get to 2017. But I would say that you see our guidance for Q1 2017 at $360 million, so you will see a trend of continuing investments in product roadmap, new product launches, software. R&D, if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, is up, actually, close to $50 million, and SG&A was down even though we were essentially flat on OpEx 2015 to '16.

Clearly, you mentioned some of the key products that are margin drivers for us. So Ryzen in high-end desktop, our server CPUs, server GPUs, professional graphics are all north of the corporate average. And we still have game consoles, which will be a significant piece of our business. That will be less than corporate average. So our expectation is that we will make progress with margins as we ramp these products.

I think the opportunity for leverage does exist longer term in our model. But in the short term, I'm very focused on ensuring that we execute our product roadmap really, really well. And so this year, it's about our product launches, making sure that we have the right software investments and go-to-market.

168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 01, 2017",2017-05-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,1187441.0,48823667.0,Presenter Speech,Lisa Su,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all of those listening in today. First quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million based on growth across both of our business segments. Gross margin also improved, driven largely by the success of our recently launched Ryzen CPUs. I am pleased with our first quarter product execution and improved year-over-year financial results, which demonstrate the revenue growth and gross margin expansion potential with our strong set of new products. 
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment. We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth. Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in CG revenue increasing 29% from the year-ago period. CG revenue declined 1% sequentially, which was better-than-normal seasonality as significant growth in desktop processor sales, driven by the first month of Ryzen CPU sales, largely offset seasonal declines in GPU and notebook APU sales. 
Solid demand for our family of premium Ryzen 7 processors, including our flagship Ryzen 7 1800X offering, which is the industry's highest performance 8-core CPU, drove our highest desktop processor revenue in more than 2 years. Ryzen CPUs have been consistently ranked among the top-selling processors at global e-tailers and retailers. And press reviews and end-user sentiment have highlighted the strong performance and value proposition. 
In early April, we launched our enthusiast-class Ryzen 5 processors and received overwhelmingly positive reviews that demonstrate our multi-threaded leadership and unmatched value proposition. 
The Ryzen CPU partner ecosystem also continues to strengthen. We have seated more than 300 software developers to support their work optimizing for Ryzen CPUs and have already seen double-digit performance gains across a number of top-tier gaming titles. Last week, the first Ryzen-based OEM gaming desktops were announced, and we continue the rapid rollout of Ryzen-powered systems with additional launches planned for major OEMs later this quarter. 
In Graphics, GPU sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago based on growth across all of our product lines. The ramp of Polaris-based notebook design wins drove increased mobile GPU sales while our desktop growth was led by improved channel sales. 
In early Q2, we launched 4 new Radeon RX 500 GPUs, featuring our Polaris architecture that deliver improved performance. These new mainstream GPUs provide a compelling solution for the millions of gamers looking to upgrade their PCs to support advanced display technologies and deliver optimal gaming experiences. 
We also saw higher professional graphics revenue from a year ago, driven by expanding channel sales and growing data center wins, as we continue to increase our GPU-compute footprint with leading cloud service providers. 
We remain on track to launch the first products from our next-generation Radeon Vega family later this quarter. Vega is a forward-looking architecture that combines a revolutionary memory subsystem, next-generation compute engine, advanced pixel engine and new geometry pipeline to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for the next generation of GPU workloads. Customer excitement is building as we focus on bringing significant competition to the high-end GPU space across the PC gaming, professional design and GPU compute markets. 
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by the latest game console offerings from Sony and Microsoft and our third straight quarter delivering year-on-year embedded revenue growth. We see solid demand for our latest FinFET-based semi-custom offerings in 2017, including the planned holiday launch of Microsoft's 4K-focused Project Scorpio console featuring a new AMD SoC. 
On the data center front, in March, we demonstrated that our upcoming Naples server CPU would offer more cores, I/O and memory bandwidth when compared to the highest-end dual socket x86 server CPUs currently available, resulting in better performance across multiple workloads. 
Naples platform development work continued to accelerate in the quarter. We are in the final stages of preparation in advance of launch and are very pleased with the status of our silicon and customer engagements. We have now seated thousands of Naples processors across an extensive set of OEMs, end users and partners, and remain on track for our first Naples products to launch this quarter. 
In closing, we started 2017 delivering significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion based on solid product execution and strong market and customer reception to our new leadership products. Our focus in 2017 remains on launching our Naples server CPU with broad customer, partner and ecosystem support. Naples is the first step in our long-term plan to deliver a leadership data center product road map. 
Complementing the success of our mainstream Polaris-based GPUs with our high-end Vega GPUs, extending our Zen core into the mainstream desktop and premium notebook markets with the launches of our Ryzen 3 CPUs and Ryzen mobile APUs in the second half of the year, and expanding our participation in the fast-growing market for GPU compute with the launch of Radeon Instinct accelerators midyear. 
2017 is an important year for AMD, and we are well positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion based on bringing performance, choice and innovation to an expanding set of markets. I look forward to discussing more about our long-term strategy at our Financial Analyst Day later this month. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance.",886,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 01, 2017",2017-05-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",2945.0,1187441.0,48823668.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a good start to 2017 as we expanded gross margin, increased revenue 18% year-over-year to $984 million and reduced losses year-over-year. 
Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 29% year-over-year, driven by the launch of our high-performance Ryzen desktop processors and our strengthened GPU product portfolio. Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue increased 5% from a year ago. 
Let me provide some specifics for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 34%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year, driven by a higher overall mix of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment and a richer product mix within that segment, due to Ryzen desktop processor sales. 
Operating expenses were $364 million compared to $332 million a year ago. The increase is due primarily to R&D investments in Graphics and our server business. Net licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $27 million compared to $7 million a year ago. Operating loss was $6 million in the first quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from a $55 million loss a year ago. 
First quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $32 million, down from $41 million year-over-year, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance. Net loss was $38 million, or loss per share of $0.04 calculated using 939 million shares of common stock as compared to a net loss of $96 million or $0.12 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $28 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative $22 million from a year ago. 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $593 million, up 29% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher Ryzen desktop, CPU and graphics processor sales. The better-than-seasonal quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower mobile and graphics processor sales, largely offset by Ryzen desktop processor sales. 
Computing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $15 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $70 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher revenue. 
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $391 million, up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. Operating income was $9 million, down from $16 million a year ago, due primarily to higher server-related R&D investments, largely offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $943 million at the end of the quarter compared to $1.26 billion at the end of 2016. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments and increased inventory. 
Inventory ended at $839 million compared to $751 million at year-end in support of the ramp of new products and increased semi-custom SoC sales in the second quarter. 
Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.41 billion, down from $1.44 billion at year-end, primarily due to debt reduction activities. The principal debt amount was $1.73 billion, down $34 million from the prior quarter as a result of debt reduction actions. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter. We expect revenue to increase 17% sequentially plus or minus 3%, non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 33%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $370 million, licensing gain associated with our server JV to be approximately $20 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million, and inventory to be down sequentially. 
For 2017, we now expect revenue to increase low double-digit percentage from a year-over-year basis and CapEx to be approximately $140 million, including the capitalization of production mask sets beginning in Q1 2017. Additional 2017 guidance can be found in the CFO commentary document. 
In closing, we remain focused on continuing to improve our financial performance on the strength of new product introductions, continued financial discipline and ongoing strategic investments in the business. I look forward to sharing further details on our longer-term prospects at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on May 16.

So, look, we're very pleased with how the Ryzen launch well -- went. It was a big launch for us. We did Ryzen 7 first in early March and then Ryzen 5 here in the middle of April. All of the feedback that we've gotten so far from both our customers and from end users has been very strong. I think the value proposition is very strong at both the Ryzen 7 8-core devices as well as the Ryzen 5 4- and 6-core devices. Relative to how it performed in the quarter, actually it performed as we expected. So with the global launch, we were reaching many distributors and many channel partners, and I think that's going well. We did see some early shortages in terms of motherboards, and that was our motherboard partners ramping their supply in line with our CPU supply. But that was really dissipated after the first couple of weeks. So nothing out of the ordinary there. So we feel really good about where it is. I think the important thing is as we go into the second quarter, we not only have the channel sales, but we also have the major OEMs that will be launching their systems in the second quarter. So I think that's the next piece of the Ryzen launch for us. But overall, I would say it went quite well.",233,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Lisa, you talked in your prepared remarks about as the new product roll out across the different parts of the company through the year that margins should expand. Yet your -- with a full quarter of Ryzen, you're guiding gross margin down slightly sequentially. I know the new gaming console business starts to ramp for the upcoming season in that quarter as well. So any kind of puts and takes around that gross margin? Because for some reaction I got from investors tonight that sequentially down gross margin surprised a couple of folks.

Absolutely, Matt. So if you look at our gross margin progression, given the mix of our business, clearly we made actually very nice progress year-over-year. So if you look at Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016, we expanded margin by 2 points and that was really on the strength of Ryzen. When you look sequentially, because of the mix of our business, game consoles were at the lowest point in the first quarter, and there will be a ramp of game consoles going into the second quarter. So the relative mix of the business sees more game consoles in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So that's the reason for the sequential guidance. But again, if you look year-on-year, Q2 '17 to Q2 '16, you see again a nice margin expansion as a result of the strength of the products.",143,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And you're right about the inventory. The ramp of new products and especially the ramp of the semi-custom product revenue that Lisa just talked about was the main reason for the high inventory. We also had the opportunity in the quarter to put [ those wafers ] in Q1 ahead of Q2 sales and took advantage of the opportunity leading to the inventory at the $839 million. On the share count, you're right. As we go ahead and look at the share count on a basic share basis, we have 939 million, but there are 2 parts to it. If we were profitable, the warrants that we issued to Mubadala last year as part of the WSA, those get converted depending on the stock price, and that would be in there depending on profitability. And then the second thing is a convertible, obviously, as you know, how that works, is, if converted, then obviously those will be included in the share count, otherwise it will depend upon dilution or not, depending on the EPS.",176,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

I think certainly the rise in gross margins are substantially better than the legacy portfolio. So I think that is true. I think when you look at the sequential, there was 1% sequential decline, and there was a $7 million or $8 million sequential improvement in operating loss. There was also some additional R&D in that segment as we're ramping up both product expenses as well as some sales and marketing and go-to-market expenses in the quarter.

First of all, on the mask piece, okay, you're right. The mask costs, as our product development becomes profitable, I think the mass costs have gone up. Especially with the latest technology, we went ahead and decided to capitalize the production mask set cost. From a geographic standpoint, the mask costs, but as they would have been an R&D previously, would be sitting in the COGS side of the P&L, and therefore, amortized in the COGS side related to the production of the unit.

And I guess, if you assume that all of it transitions to Ryzen eventually, had that occurred in the March quarter, can you give us an understanding of how much better gross margins would have been? And then I have a follow-up.",79,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

But let me give you the high-level view. So, look, we started selling Ryzen on March 2, and a good piece of it was basically for us positioning into the distributors. We take revenue on a sellout model, and so you should think about -- although we shipped a number of Ryzens, we didn't necessarily revenue them all in the quarter, just given that we're on a sellout model for our revenue recognition. In terms of where we are in the transition, Ryzen, non-Ryzen, we still have a long ways to go. I mean, the way you should think about it is Ryzen 7 was at the very high end. We're going to -- Ryzen 5 has started, we have Ryzen 3 that will come next and then we have the entire mobile portfolio as well. So it will take us through this year to really transition the majority of the product over to Ryzen. I think everything that we've seen, the ASP uplifts are definitely very beneficial. And so we're pleased with sort of the pricing that we're commanding for the product and the reception for the product. So I think it's just that it will take us a couple quarters to transition the overall portfolio over to Ryzen.",223,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But to the extent that your old gross margin target was sort of 36% to 40%, I'm just kind of curious to what extent can you get to that sort of 38% midpoint just by moving your current market share mix towards Ryzen? And to what extent does getting to 38% or above imply either market share gains in the compute business on the desktop notebook side or on the server side? How do I think about that dynamic?",106,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Certainly, on the PC side, it is not anticipating that we gain a significant amount of share over our historical numbers. So I think the idea on the PC side is, again, I think 2017, a large percentage of the margin story is around PCs. I think as you go into 2018, you'll see a larger percentage of that be in servers. But to the fundamental question, I think we feel good that the mix dynamics are there, the product is strong enough to command the right ASPs that we can get to the long-term margin target several different ways.",118,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

When I look at your Q2 outlook, it's going up about $170 million or so sequentially. And when I look at the last few years, generally Q1 to Q2, just the console side, has gone up over $100 million or so. So is it fair to assume that Ryzen perhaps is contributing something in that $50 million, $60 million, $70 million? And if that is the case, how does that compare to your original expectations? Did they change throughout the quarter because of whatever pricing action [ people ] might have taken? Just that this $50 million, $60 million, $70 million, if this is right, is this a run rate number for Ryzen? Or how should we put this in the context of what Ryzen can be as it becomes a bigger part of your portfolio?",144,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So without commenting on the exact numbers between semi-custom and Ryzen, I think it's fair to say that the semi-custom business will have a reasonable ramp in the second quarter as will Ryzen. In terms of relative to our expectations, it's actually very close to our expectations of what we expected the ramp rate to be as we're going into this new segment. As I think I mentioned on one of the previous questions, we don't expect to be at peak run rate in the second quarter. I think we will be continuing to ramp Zen-based product in the PC business throughout the year as we bring more and more SKUs online. And so I think the second quarter is -- will certainly be higher than the first quarter, and I would expect the second half to be higher than what we're seeing in the second quarter, as we ramp more and more SKUs, as more OEM platforms come online. As you guys know, the PC business is -- it tends to be a very back-half loaded business. So as we get into back to school, the retail segments and holiday, you would expect that both channel and OEM PC sales to benefit from the stronger product portfolio.",209,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

From what we see, I think we feel good about the gaming segment overall. Graphics continues to be a strong segment. For, us it's not just a channel business, but it's the ramp of our OEM business. So we have a number of new OEM systems that are also ramping here in the first half of the year. As it relates to ASPs, we are excited with the launch of Vega that will see a significant improvement in our ASPs, just given our current presence in the high-end segment of the GPU market.

The key areas are in GPUs and server. And it's both on the R&D side as well as on some go to market. So from our standpoint, these are very strong products.

Q2 was a strong quarter for us as we continued to ramp our high-performance product portfolio. Second quarter revenue increased 19% to $1.22 billion, and gross margin improved year-over-year. Importantly, we returned to non-GAAP net income profitability in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our Computing and Graphics segment. 
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we made excellent progress in the quarter and reported operating profitability for the first time in 3 years based on our leadership Ryzen processor and GPU product offerings. The expansion and growing adoption of our Ryzen CPUs, combined with our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year graphics revenue growth, resulted in a 51% increase in Computing and Graphics segment sales year-over-year.
Client computing revenue increased by strong double-digit percentage from a year ago, driven by a significant ramp and strong sell-through of our Ryzen CPUs in the first full quarter of sales. Our Ryzen family of processors drove a richer mix of shipments, and client ASPs improved significantly from a year ago. All major PC OEMs have announced premium Ryzen-based desktop systems with widespread availability expected for the back-to-school and holiday seasons.
As we move into the second half of 2017, we are on track to complete the full family of Ryzen processors, including Ryzen 3 processors targeting the mainstream and value market segments with on-shelf availability later this week; Ryzen ThreadRipper products for the high-end desktop markets with global component channel availability in early August; Ryzen PRO-based offerings targeting the commercial client segment with availability in Q3; and Ryzen Mobile APUs, which will be available for the consumer market later this year.
In graphics, GPU revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago with higher unit shipments and ASPs driving growth across our desktop and mobile GPU products. Demand for Radeon RX GPUs was strong in the quarter driven by gaming and cryptocurrency mining.
In June, we began the introduction of our Vega GPU architecture with the launch of the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, delivering a powerful professional workstation graphics card designed to tackle demanding design, rendering and machine intelligence workloads. Apple announced that our Radeon Pro Vega product will power the new iMac Pro, a workstation-class product line designed for creators running the most demanding workflows. In addition, Apple also announced expanded iMac offerings, which are powered by the Radeon Pro 500 series.
We will launch additional Radeon Vega products at Siggraph next week, expanding further into premium portions of the consumer and professional GPU markets. 
Our investments in GPU compute and Radeon Instinct are continuing to build momentum. We introduced our first Vega-based Radeon Instinct data center products in June. These new GPU accelerators will significantly increase performance, efficiency and ease of implementation for machine learning and high-performance computing workloads. 
We also showcased a server powered by AMD's EPYC SoC and 4 Radeon Instinct MI25 accelerators, working together to deliver groundbreaking performance of 100 teraflops. Interest and excitement are high as we recently started shipments of our Radeon Instinct MI25 accelerators to strategic data center customers.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year and increased 44% sequentially. The sequential revenue gains were primarily based on higher semi-custom product shipments due to seasonality. In addition, we reached an important milestone in the quarter, delivering initial EPYC server revenue.
In our semi-custom business, unit shipments were up sequentially and down year-over-year as we enter the fifth year of the current game console sales cycle. This console cycle continues to outpace previous cycles as Sony recently passed a milestone of 60 million PlayStation 4 consoles shipped. Last month, Microsoft announced the new Xbox One X with availability in November. This system will be Microsoft's smallest and most powerful Xbox ever made and will be based on the combination of high-performance CPU and GPU IP that only AMD can provide. 
As we look at the remainder of the year and given the maturity of the current game console cycle, we expect semi-custom revenue to be down for the full year.
In our server business, last month, we launched our EPYC family of high-performance data center processors, reentering the incredibly important $16 billion data center market and setting several new industry performance records. With up to 32 high-performance ""Zen"" cores and an unparalleled feature set, our EPYC family of processors deliver greater competitive performance at every price point across a full range of integer, floating point, memory bandwidth and I/O benchmarks and workloads. Our 2-socket and 1-socket EPYC CPUs are designed to deliver industry-leading performance on critical enterprise, cloud and machine intelligence workloads and provide a substantial TCO advantage.
At our EPYC launch event, we were joined by more than 20 leading server manufacturers and global ecosystem partners who showcased optimized support and EPYC-optimized platforms. We received compelling endorsements from OEM, cloud providers and mega data center operators, including HP Enterprise, Dell, Baidu, and Microsoft Azure with more than 20 EPYC-based platforms announced at launch. And we expect an additional 20 EPYC platforms to be available in the second half of 2017. With the strong global ecosystem and customer interest we have built around our EPYC processor family, we are on track to reenter the data center market in a major way.
In closing, we are very pleased with the trend of our quarterly results and how our products are positioned heading into the back half of the year. Our business foundation and growth opportunities are strong based on our high-performance product portfolio and our expanding customer traction. Given our first half 2017 performance and our visibility into the third quarter, we are happy to report we are progressing ahead of our annual revenue guidance, and we look forward to a strong year overall.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?",991,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2017",2017-07-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3136.0,1253530.0,50790401.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2017, AMD revenue grew 19% and gross margin expanded on a year-over-year basis, driven by a 51% year-over-year revenue increase in our Computing and Graphics segment. We achieved non-GAAP profitability on both an operating and net basis with net income of $19 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.02. Let me provide more specifics for the quarter.
Gross margin was 33%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year due to a richer product mix and a higher percentage of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment, driven by the first full quarter of Ryzen processor sales. Operating expenses were $381 million compared to $342 million a year ago. The increase was due primarily to higher graphics and data center R&D-related investments.
Net licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $25 million compared to $26 million a year ago, and we have recognized a total of approximately $140 million of net licensing gain to date. The remaining payments are related to production milestones, and I expect it to occur in 2018 and beyond.
Operating income was $49 million in the second quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from an operating income of $3 million a year ago.
Second quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $30 million, down from $43 million a year ago, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance. Net income was $19 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.02 as compared to a net loss of $40 million or loss per share of $0.05 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $84 million compared to $36 million a year ago and $28 million in the prior quarter.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $659 million, up 51% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by demand for our Ryzen desktop processors and graphics processors.
Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $7 million, the first quarterly operating profit in 3 years, compared to a loss of $81 million a year ago. The significant improvement was primarily due to higher revenue and an improved product mix.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $563 million, down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower semi-custom SoC sales. Revenue was up 44% sequentially due to the seasonal semi-custom ramp. Additionally in the quarter, we reached an important milestone and recognized initial revenue from EPYC data center processor shipments. Operating income was $42 million, down from $84 million a year ago due primarily to lower revenue and higher data center-related R&D investments.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total $844 million at the end of the quarter compared to $943 million at the end of the prior quarter due primarily to changes in working capital, largely driven by wafer purchases in anticipation of stronger revenue growth in the third quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $833 million, down slightly from the prior quarter of $839 million. Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.38 billion. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion.
In Q2, we repurchased $40 million of term debt, utilizing our lower-cost secured revolving line of credit. Free cash flow was negative $94 million due primarily to changes in working capital largely driven by wafer purchases.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter. We expect revenue to increase approximately 23% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. We now expect annual 2017 revenue to increase a mid- to high-teens percentage year-over-year compared to our prior guidance of low double-digit growth, non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 34%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $400 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $28 million and inventory to be down sequentially.
Third quarter diluted share count for modeling non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately 1.14 billion. This includes shares related to our 2026 convertible senior notes and the warrant held by a Mubadala entity. Additional information regarding diluted share count calculation can be found in the CFO commentary.
In closing, Q2 was a strong quarter, and our financial performance continues to improve. As Lisa shared in her remarks, our business continues to strengthen as we ramp new high-performance products and expand our presence in premium markets. We are pleased with the strong growth in revenue coupled with improving gross margin on the back of focused execution, financial discipline and ongoing strategic investments in the business.

Thanks for your question. So we are very pleased with the reception to EPYC. The launch that we did in June was very well received. We had a number of customers as well as partners, OEM providers, ODM guys as well as cloud providers who participated in that. The general reception has been very positive. I would say that interest level is very high. In fact, we're adding additional customer support to really ensure that we help customers get their platforms up and running. In terms of what to expect in the revenue ramp, we started shipping early volume in the second half of June. We would expect that we'd continue to ramp that revenue in the second half of the year. We would expect some additional customer announcements in the second half of the year, and then, as we stated with both cloud and enterprise accounts, depending on their qualification cycles, it can take anywhere up to 4 quarters to qualify the parts. But so far, so good. I think very good traction, and we continue to lean in hard on the data center opportunities.",188,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So certainly, the overall quarter for graphics was strong. Q2 tends to be seasonally down, and we were up in the quarter. So it was better than seasonal. I would say the better performance was due to 2 things. First of all, we did launch our RX 580 and 570 gaming cards in April, and those cards are very, very well positioned in the market. So they're doing well with gamers. Relative to cryptocurrency, we have seen some elevated demand. If you look at GPUs across the world, the inventory in the channel is actually quite lean, and so we're working on replenishing that inventory. Our priority though really is on our core market, which is the gaming market. And so couple of things that we are certainly doing are we're prioritizing supply towards the gaming market, so you'll see system integrators as well as on some of the major e-tailers, we have bundles with Ryzen and Radeon. And then some of our partners are also offering mining-specific cards that have a different feature set such that we're really segmenting the market between gaming and mining. But it's important to say we didn't have cryptocurrency in our forecast, and we're not looking at it as a long-term growth driver. But we'll certainly continue to watch the developments around the block chain technologies as they go forward.",228,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It occurs to me, and through some of the conversations we've had, particularly in the enterprise markets of high-end desktop and server, that some of the purchasing decisions made by your customers might be sort of dictated by how confident they are in the long-term road map that you guys are putting together as you move to 7-nanometer versus just the products that you've launched so far. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the road maps, how they're developing and the progress that the team is seeing on the 7-nanometer front.",116,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So look, I think the overall road map execution has been very good, very solid. I think our customers see that the Ryzen performance, the EPYC performance on the CPU side and then certainly the Vega performance on the GPU side have met our commitments. And the important thing, particularly in the enterprise market as well as the commercial market, having a road map, a strong road map with multiple generations is important. We stated at our Financial Analyst Day that we're already investing heavily in 7-nanometer. The 7-nanometer will be key for us on both the CPU and the GPU side, and I would say that development is progressing well. We're working with multiple foundries on that.

The -- I guess, the first one is on share count. There was obviously some movement higher in the share count, either the -- in the in-the-money converts. Maybe you could talk us through, if you were modeling maybe your business on a long term, from an earnings power perspective, how would you think about modeling that share count? And then secondly, on the operating expense line, there's plenty to invest in here.

Thank you, Matt. I think on the share count, basically, beyond the basic shares, the dilutive impact come from 3 components. You have the employee equity grants. You have the 75 million share warrant that we issued to Mubadala in 2016. And you have the 101 million shares underlying our $805 million convertible note. The good news is that you start making money and you get beyond inflection point. All of that gets included in dilute share count. So I think given what we have laid out as guidance, in particularly in the Financial Analyst Day, the assumption should be, as you model profitability in the company, those shares get included. We have provided color in the commentary, and for Q3, we are estimating that the total share count is about $1.14 billion (sic) [ 1.14 billion ]. As far as the OpEx is concerned, we are obviously, with the strength in the business, performing stronger. We are making targeted investments, particularly in R&D. We have included and invested in targeted R&D areas.

I know the Ryzen side, the mix had to go up, and those carry much better ASPs. But the client category as a whole, the ASPs went down.

Good question, Ross. When you take a look at our client business, think of it as desktop and mobile, and then within the desktop segment, it's channel and OEM. So Ryzen performed very well. I think the ASP contribution is very evident on the desktop line item. But when we look at where we are in the progression of the Ryzen rollout, we're still in the early innings. So we had our first full quarter of Ryzen desktop in the channel. The OEMs launched their desktop products in about mid-June, and so they just started selling at the end of June. And that will flow through into the second half of the year. And the mobile products are still our legacy products. So you saw the mobile ASPs were down slightly as we went from Q1 to Q2, and that was just a mix on some of the legacy business. But the desktop ASPs were quite strong, and we should expect that, as we go into the second half of the year and we have Ryzen really take off in the OEM sectors as well as once we introduce Ryzen Mobile towards the second half of the year, is when you'll see sort of more of the full portfolio over to Ryzen.

And a related follow-up on that is just transitioning those ASP and mix commentaries over to the actual gross margin. The full year revenue guidance is increased again. Just recently, you guys did it at the Analyst Meeting. Now you're doing it again, so that's clearly a positive. It seems like the C&G side of things is what's driving that given your commentary on the game console side being down. So given everything you just said about the mix improving in the back half of the year and the revenues now being higher, I'm a little surprised the gross margin guidance didn't change for the year. So if we translate everything you just said, Lisa, to a gross margin dynamic, can you help us kind of make all of that make sense as well?",136,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

We do have a bit of a year-over-year headwind when we compare game consoles.

So I think, from an overall standpoint, we see strong demand in graphics for the third quarter. I think that's a mix of a couple things. That's a mix of gaming being seasonally stronger in the third quarter. That's a mix of inventories being very low in the channel, and there is a crypto -- probably a cryptocurrency component as well relative to overall demand. When we look at it as a whole though, we think that the growth in the business is really on the strength of the products and how the design wins, both OEM and -- as well as system integrators, are improving. Now how is it different than sort of a couple of years ago? I think we understand the market much better from the standpoint of the products are significantly stronger. And so if you look at the product portfolio, not just the current sort of Polaris or RX 5-series products but the Vega product coming in, really opens up a larger TAM for us. And we are working with our add-in-board partners to segment the markets in terms of the feature set that go into the cards as well as prioritizing some of the gamer ecosystems, so in terms of system integrator supply as well as bundling and OEM supply. So I think we are doing quite a bit to make sure that we protect against any downside as it relates to cryptocurrency, but overall, I would view it as GPUs are strong. And we see GPUs continuing to be strong, and so it's a great market to be in.",268,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Vivek, I think we are actually very pleased with sort of the conditions around the server market for us. I mean, it all starts with a good product or a great product, and so I think the EPYC product performance is very important. But I think the other conditions that are different and perhaps even more favorable than in the past is the fact that the cloud data center guys are making up such a large piece of the market, and they tend to move faster in their qualification cycles given the fact that they have sort of more control of their own software environment. So I think our differentiation is strong. I think we have -- we put out a product that is not only strong on basic CPU performance but also offers much more flexibility in terms of what you can do with memory and I/O.

So I think, Vivek, you're referring to when we initially launched Ryzen 7, there were some games, particularly in 1080p resolution, that were not as good as some of the higher resolution. And I believe we worked around a lot of that. We've seen game developers, content developers really sort of support the Ryzen ecosystem. I've actually been very happy with how they've jumped on the support of it. We have been continuing to improve the ecosystem. So if you look at the motherboards and if you look at the memory capability, they've significantly improved just in the last 3 or 4 months. I think you'll see, as we go through ThreadRipper launch, which is coming up very shortly, that the Ryzen ecosystem is strong. And as it relates to EPYC, I think the -- very similar comments.

I would say, Joe, we have a broad set of customers that we're engaging with. So definitely, we see top-tier cloud guys very engaged with EPYC and talking about a number of different instances. Microsoft Azure was at our launch event, and Baidu was at our launch event. And we're working with a number of other cloud vendors as well. But we also have a very strong OEM support base as well. So with HPE and Dell putting out a number of platforms with EPYC, I think that will ramp enterprise customers in 2018 as well. So I view it as really both sides of the equation are important for 2018. I think we will see cloud be a little lumpier. So certainly, they tend to buy in stages, so they may be a little bit lumpier.

We are, as I said, in the process of catching up to demand, and so we're certainly increasing some of the production. And that was Devinder's comment about some of the working capital and some of the inventory comments. Overall though, I think we're going into a stronger second half of the year.

Hans, actually, the feedback has been actually quite good, and I think the -- what we're able to do -- obviously, it's a decision to make, right? We could have built one big monolithic chip or -- we decided very strategically to build a modular approach because it just gives us so much flexibility when we talk about the combination of CPU cores and I/O. So, so far, so good. I think there is some work to do to make sure that the latencies are appropriately taken care of, and the customers are working with us on that. I think the flexibility is really, really appreciated, particularly when you look at what we can do with single-socket servers as well. So we feel very good about where EPYC is positioned.

So yes, John, let me answer that. When you look at our typical seasonality, as you said, we tend to be down in Q4. Semi-custom is still a large, large piece of our business and semi-custom will peak in Q3. And it will come down in Q4. I also think that we want to be cognizant of the fact that some of the graphics demand that we see might be temporal, so we're not counting on that staying through the full year. We'll see what happens. Frankly, I think we'll see what happens with the whole mining stuff. But I think when you look overall, I think that it shows that the business is strengthening. And so we like the growth very much. Ryzen will continue to grow through the second half. EPYC will continue to grow through the second half.

So I think there are a couple points, John, that I want to make sure that we're clear about. Although OpEx is going up and R&D is going up, we're doing it in a very thoughtful fashion. And so staying within the confines of the business model is really important. And as Devinder said earlier, our model that we laid out at Financial Analyst Day for 2017 has us, let's call it, at approximately 31% ER, and we're going to stay within that model for sure. Now relative to priorities in R&D, it is very much focused on sort of the new growth areas for us, very much focused on data center and very much focused on GPU computes around machine learning and sort of the entire compute space on the GPU side. It is fairly incremental in terms of adding things like customer support, field application engineering, software support given that we're familiarizing people with our architecture.

We think that we have a product and a customer set in an environment that does support that. It will take longer than this year to get there. So I think this is a multiple-quarter ramp for us. But in terms of how we've laid out the business model, I mean, that's all contemplated sort of in our overall growth model for 2017. As it relates to margins, again, without being very specific, I would say the EPYC margins are highly accretive even at our current sort of pricing, which offers, I would say, significant value to the customer. I think it also gives us significant credit for the capability of the product. And so the margins are accretive to our business model.",163,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

You can never segment it perfectly, but I think we are segmenting it well. And we continue to be very closely in tune with our partners and how this develops. And my expectation is that there will be a leveling off of the demand at some point. And as we fill the channel, that will become clear in what the level-off point is. But right now as we said, the channel inventories are very low, and so it's hard to call the absolute demand.

Q3 was a strong quarter for us, demonstrating the significant growth potential of AMD, driven by our high-performance products, leadership IP and long-term strategy.
Revenue increased 26% from a year ago to $1.64 billion. Gross margin also improved significantly year-over-year as we achieved profitability and generated positive free cash flow in the quarter.
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we made excellent progress in Q3 as the continued success of our Ryzen family of CPUs, combined with significant graphics growth, resulted in a 74% increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue year-over-year.
Client computing revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago as we expanded our Ryzen processor family and saw increased demand in the desktop market. Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors have ramped well in the desktop channel market, reaching 40% to 50% desktop market share at strategic e-tailers worldwide. In addition, OEM adoption is accelerating as customers ramp shipments in advance of the holiday sales cycle.
In the quarter, we launched additional Ryzen CPUs, including Ryzen 3, expanding our reach in the mainstream and value market segments; Ryzen Threadripper processors, returning AMD to the high-end desktop market; and Ryzen PRO-based offerings, which have been adopted by all major commercial PC providers, including Dell, Lenovo and HP, expanding our presence in the commercial space.
Also in the quarter, we qualified and began early shipments of our Ryzen Mobile processors, combining our Zen CPU cores and Vega GPU cores in a high-performance APU designed to power ultra-thin and 2-in-1 notebooks. Acer, HP and Lenovo plan to launch their initial Ryzen Mobile-based systems in the coming weeks, and we expect an expanded assortment of premium notebooks to launch in Q1 2018. 
In graphics, we achieved record GPU revenue in the quarter based on significantly improved ASPs and higher unit shipments from a year ago. These financial improvements were driven by the launch of our Vega-based GPUs and its strong demand for our Polaris products across both gaming and blockchain markets. In the quarter, we expanded further into premium portions of the graphics market with new consumer and professional GPU solutions. Our Radeon RX Vega family of GPUs launched in the channel, targeted at the enthusiast class gaming segment. Revenue from initial shipments of these products is significantly outpacing previous premium Radeon GPUs.
Radeon Instinct MI25, our GPU compute solution, also began shipping in volume to mega cloud data center customers, and Radeon Pro WX 9100 professional graphics cards, targeting the high-end professional content creation market, started shipping late in the quarter. In addition, we saw expanded AMD Radeon adoption with cloud customers in the quarter, driven by our investments in GPU compute. Amazon Web Services announced that they have deployed AMD Radeon Pro technology to power Amazon AppStream 2.0, driving GPU-accelerated cloud delivery of virtual applications. We also announced a collaboration with Baidu to build more flexible and powerful AI computing platforms based on the deployment of our Radeon Instinct GPUs in their data centers.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 46% sequentially. Sequential growth was based on a seasonal increase in semi-custom revenue as well as growth in server revenue from our EPYC data center processors. Our semi-custom business continues to perform as expected for the year, and we anticipate seasonal demand to remain healthy as our customers enter the holiday sales cycle with Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and Microsoft's Xbox One X.
In our server business, the server revenue increased from a year ago as we began ramping sales of our EPYC data center processors to key cloud and OEM customers. Customer engagement with our EPYC processors is growing as the true performance and features of the new platform are tested and implemented, with Tencent and JD.com joining the list of data center customers planning to deploy EPYC processors.
In a short period, 3 of the Super 7 mega data center providers have publicly announced plans to deploy EPYC-based products into their Hyperscale environments, including Baidu, Microsoft Azure and Tencent, and we have strong engagements with other major cloud providers. In addition, HP Enterprise and Dell are in the process of bringing their first EPYC-based platforms to market in Q4, and we are actively engaged with them to accelerate testing and validation of EPYC-based systems in data centers across a broad number of large and medium enterprise customers. We remain confident and focused on the steady expansion of our data center presence over the coming quarters based on the high performance and rich feature set of the EPYC product.
In addition, as a part of our ongoing strategy to monetize our differentiated IP, we successfully closed a patent licensing transaction in the quarter.
In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Throughout 2017, we have delivered significant year-on-year revenue growth and margin expansion as we achieved multiple major product, customer and market milestones. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we look forward to continuing to accelerate our business. 2017 annual revenue growth is now tracking above our previous estimates, and we remain confident in our ability to make AMD one of the premier long-term growth companies in the tech industry.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance.",905,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2017",2017-10-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3108.0,1318719.0,52967120.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our performance for the third quarter of 2017. We increased revenue 26% year-over-year, expanded gross margin and achieved both operating and net income, with net income of $110 million and diluted earnings of $0.10 per share. We are executing well with our strongest portfolio of products in many years, including our Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega offerings. Let me provide some specifics for the third quarter.
Revenue of $1.64 billion grew 26% year-over-year and 34% sequentially. This is our highest quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2011. Year-over-year growth was primarily due to our Computing and Graphics segment, while sequential growth was driven by the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue seasonality as well as higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue. We also took another step in our IP monetization efforts by closing a patent licensing agreement that had a positive impact on both our segments.
Gross margin was 35%, up 4 percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit of IP-related revenue and a richer mix from the Computing and Graphics segment, which were partially offset by cost associated with our GLOBALFOUNDRIES Wafer Supply Agreement for wafers purchased at another foundry. We continue to make good progress on the ramp of our new high-performance products, which had a positive impact on our gross margins.
Operating expenses were $419 million compared to $353 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher R&D-related investments and expenses related to annual employee incentive programs driven by our better financial performance. Operating income was $155 million in the third quarter of 2017, a solid improvement from $70 million a year ago. Third quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $45 million, up slightly from $43 million a year ago. Lower interest expense from a year ago was largely offset by withholding taxes for licensing revenue.
Net income was $110 million or diluted earnings of $0.10 per share as compared to $27 million or $0.03 per share a year ago. The diluted earnings per share calculations for the third quarter of 2017 was based on 1.143 billion shares, which includes 100.6 million shares related to our 2026 convertible notes. Adjusted EBITDA was $191 million, compared to $103 million a year ago.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $819 million, up 74% year-over-year, primarily due to strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $70 million compared to a loss of $66 million a year ago. The solid improvement was primarily due to higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $824 million, approximately flat year-over-year due to lower semi-custom SoC sales partially offset by IP-related revenue. Additionally, server revenue increased from a year ago driven by the increased sales of EPYC products. As you heard earlier from Lisa, customer interest and deployment plans are strong. Operating income was $84 million, down $52 million from $136 million a year ago, primarily due to higher costs.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $879 million at the end of the quarter, up from $844 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $794 million, down 5% from $833 million in the prior quarter.
Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.36 billion. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion. In the third quarter, we used $28 million from our lower interest secured revolving line of credit to pay down long-term debt, which has a higher interest rate. Free cash flow was $32 million compared to $20 million in the year-ago period.
Before turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, let me remind you for comparative purposes that the fourth quarter of 2016 was a 14-week quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect revenue to decrease approximately 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 35%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $410 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and inventory to be down sequentially. We now expect 2017 annual revenue to increase by greater than 20% over 2016 compared to the prior guidance of mid- to high-teens percentage growth. We do not anticipate significant changes to the diluted share count in the fourth quarter, and you can find additional information regarding the share count in the CFO commentary, which is posted online.
In closing, the third quarter was a strong quarter, and we are pleased with the momentum of our new premium products. We are making solid progress towards our growth and margin expansion objectives, and as our financial performance improves, we remain committed to investing in our multi-generational road maps and achieving our long-term financial targets.

So look, we are very pleased with how the revenue ramp is going in general on our new products. When you look at the Q4 guidance, year-over-year, we'll be up 26%, so we're really accelerating the business as we go into the second half of the year. As you know, our business is typically seasonal. And so Q3 is the peak, and then we're down seasonally from Q3 to Q4 due to some of the semi-custom revenue. But what we see going into the fourth quarter is we see a strong ramp of new products. We see Ryzen continuing to ramp. We will ship volume of Ryzen Mobile in Q4 and then more in the first half of the year. We will see a ramp of EPYC, and we will also see an OEM ramp of Vega. In terms of the headwinds, we have the semi-custom seasonality, and we're also predicting that there will be some leveling off of some of the cryptocurrency demand. As we look at it, it continues to be a factor, but we've seen restocking in the channels and stuff like that.

Let me start, Mark, and then maybe Devinder will add. So look, we have multiple puts and takes in the business as we look at gross margin. When we look at gross margin in Q3, we were pleased with the gross margin progress, and that came from both the richer mix of our Computing and Graphics revenue year-over-year as well as some benefit from the IP-related transaction. As we go into Q4, we have new products continuing to ramp, so you'll see Ryzen, Vega and EPYC ramp. And the primary driver for the Q4 gross margin is the product revenue, and we do have sort of the headwind of not having the benefit of the IP revenue in Q3. So those are the puts and takes. But the main point is the new product revenue is ramping and the gross margins are accretive, and that's contributing to our Q4 gross margin outlook.",153,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So in terms of size of the business, again, I think we stated in the prepared remarks that the GPU business had a record quarter for us, and we're seeing very strong growth. We're seeing strong growth as a result of the new product launches. So the Vega product actually did very well for us in the quarter as well as overall Polaris in both gaming and blockchain markets. But yes, we're pleased with the graphics performance. But I'll also say, Ryzen did very well in the quarter. We look at the progress that we're making in the desktop channel when you look across retailers and e-tailers across the world and in the sort of Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 segment, we're seeing significant share gain in those parts of the business.

And we expect that consumer blockchain will level off a bit as we go into Q4, but there's also a commercial blockchain component that we believe is interesting and likely to continue into the medium term.

So look, we are really pleased with how Ryzen is performing competitively and -- in the market. It's fair to say, though, that we're still at the early stages of the Ryzen ramp, so primarily in Q2 and Q3, Ryzen has been a desktop channel phenomenon. So most of the sales have been in the desktop channel. We have started ramping OEMs in the desktop space, and we will continue ramping OEMs as we go into Q4. But it's nowhere near the majority of the client revenue. You should expect that Ryzen will continue to ramp for us through the first half of next year because we're adding more and more platforms as we speak, both on the consumer and also on the commercial front. And -- so we see -- again, it's ramping well. The ASPs are good, so actually, we saw some ASP increase in Ryzen as we went from Q2 to Q3, and we launched the high-end desktop version as well as Ryzen 3.

So John, I'm not sure we ever said 2% by the end of next year, but what I would say is that we expect EPYC to be a sizable portion of our revenue in 2018. So the second half of this year, we're doing early pilots and we're doing some early deployments. The Hyperscale guys are aggressive, and they are first. We will start seeing some enterprise revenue here in Q4 as the early platforms launch, but I expect more of the enterprise to fill in as we go into 2018. And I think the important point is, as we look at the product, as we look at the competition and where we're positioned, the product positioning is strong, and so the customer engagements are growing. And we're seeing significant interest from enterprise customers ramp now as some of the OEM platforms are becoming available and starting their seeding. So overall, EPYC will continue to ramp into 2018 and should be a sizable -- we expect it to be a sizable portion of our revenue in 2018.",178,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So definitely, desktop ASPs are up. Mobile ASPs are down. I think we will see -- again, there will be an initial ramp of Ryzen Mobile in Q4, but I think in the first half of the year, you should see a significant amount of the volume that we ship into notebook be with Ryzen Mobile. So when I look at sort of the rate and pace of the ramp, I think it's going as we expect with desktop channel first, then desktop OEMs and then commercial desktop and then, same, consumer notebook starting in Q4, ramping into Q1, and then we'll see commercial platforms in the first half of '18 as well. So I think there should be a steady ramp of ASPs as we go forward. We're also taking some opportunity, as you can imagine, to clean up some excess inventory as we transition to the new product, and so that's part of what we're doing to just ensure that we have a strong launch as we go into the new product portfolio.

They are -- in the current moment, there's a lot of products ramping just in the last few months. You heard about the Ryzen ramp. You heard about EPYC. We talk about Vega, and obviously, their go-to-market costs will ramp up new products. But as far as our 2017 guidance is concerned, I have said previously 31% has potential of revenue, but I think right now where the numbers are coming out, especially with the strength of the revenue side of the equation, we think we end up at about 30% on an expense-to-revenue ratio in 2017, of which you -- as you probably recall, is at the upper end of what we are setting of a long-term target model, which is 26% to 30%. So actually, I'm pretty pleased because, if all else, if everything works out in the Q4 guidance that we gave and in 2016 would have been a 32% of revenue, in 2017, approximately 30%, and then obviously, we'll see where we get into 2018 but very pleased from a viewpoint of being able to make the investments in the business to support the product road map, the go-to-market cost for the ramp of new products and at the same time, bring down the percentage of OpEx over revenue.",246,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So 7-nanometer, we've talked about, is a very important node for us, and it's an important node for the industry. It's a major node, so we have a lot of engineering resources on that. And you should expect that, that will be across all of our businesses, and we're actively working on those products now. We do see an opportunity with 12-nanometer. 12-nanometer is a relatively small engineering lift, and I would view it as a performance enhancement to our current road map.

And from a go-forward standpoint, despite the costs being there, we look at it overall from a viewpoint of the trend of the margin.

The Embedded business last year was down 40%. It's been tracking down slightly year-over-year. So is that the right way to think about that segment this December? And then maybe you can talk about on the graphics side. I just want to understand the commentary. You said that crypto or blockchain was kind of flattening out and that you were kind of getting some restocking. Just to kind of understand, when you look at growth in that segment, what are the moving pieces?",105,1.0,6.0,0.5555555555555556,0.6

So Blayne, let me answer that question. So overall, I think our business does have the seasonal pattern where the Q3 is a peak, and we're down in Q4 primarily due to the semi-custom business. I believe those dynamics are the same. I've -- we've looked at sort of how the business will perform on a year-over-year basis. We believe that semi-custom revenue will be down a little bit on a year-over-year basis, and that's expected. We're in the fifth year of the cycle, and you would expect that units to be down, although we have some positive mix because of the new launch of the Microsoft Xbox One X console, which is a higher ASP product for us. When you look at the graphics business, again, overall, we see the business as quite strong. We see Vega ramping as we go into Q4. We see that from an OEM ramp standpoint. We see that from a GPU compute standpoint, and that's offset with a little bit of leveling off of the blockchain demand. But overall, I think we see sort of Computing and Graphics continuing to grow as we go into Q4.",194,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

You had high reuse with the server product this time. When you see -- how do you think about the R&D cost in terms of if you were doing a core at TSMC versus doing one at GLOFO, a dual track?

So it's part of our engineering model. So we've -- we sort of engineered a model where we can use our IP at multiple foundries, and that will continue as we go into 7-nanometer. So if you look at this year, we have multiple products in 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer. As we go into 2018 and beyond, it's the same thing. So there are no additional costs related to our dual-sourcing strategy. I think from an overall R&D standpoint, as Devinder said, we will look to ramp our spending in line with revenue, and primarily, it's around continuing to invest in our new market opportunities, continuing to invest on the GPU side and what we're doing in the compute markets, continuing to strengthen our sales and marketing as we go to market with these broad new products.

So I'm not going to comment directly on timing of products because, obviously, there's a lot of R&D yet to be done. But I would say that our product portfolio, in general, will take advantage of 7-nanometer.

You broke up a little bit there, Vijay. But I think I got the question. So the question was sort of the strength of EPYC and where do we see it -- how do -- where do we see it going in Q4. Look, I think EPYC had a good quarter. Obviously, it's growing off of a small base since we had a small base for the server revenue, but we certainly saw growth in unit shipments and revenue into Q3. We will see more growth or we expect to see more growth into Q4, especially as some of these trial runs turn into more deployment activity. And as more OEMs ramp our platforms, the platforms will be more available in the industry, and we're seeing growing interest from a number of enterprise customers as well. So -- but we should think about EPYC as a long-term growth driver. So yes, we will see growth into Q4, but it will be a sizable portion of our revenue as we go into 2018.",174,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Okay, so for your first question, I think, as Laura said, we haven't made any determinations about a different segment reporting. But we will give you markers on how the business is growing, and I think it will be clear just given the accretive nature of EPYC. As we start ramping that product, you'll see more impact of the product-related revenue. The second question is as it relates to channel inventory in graphics. I believe that channel inventory is healthier in graphics here in October than it was in July. We've certainly restocked some of the channel both for Polaris as well as the Vega products. I would still say that channel inventory might be a little bit light. It's not fully restocked yet, but it's certainly healthier than it was in the July time frame.",137,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
