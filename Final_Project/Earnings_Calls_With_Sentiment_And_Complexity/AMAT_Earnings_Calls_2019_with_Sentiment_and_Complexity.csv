In our first fiscal quarter of 2019, Applied Materials delivered solid results in a challenging business environment. Over the past 2 months, we have become increasingly cautious about near-term macroeconomic risks and have seen further pullback in customers' investments. At the same time, we remain highly optimistic about the long term. Powerful new growth drivers for the semiconductor and display industries are emerging, and we see tremendous opportunities for the company ahead.
While we're taking appropriate actions to navigate current market dynamics, we are not losing focus on the bigger picture. We're making strategic investments in new technology, products and capabilities that will position Applied to play a bigger and brighter role in the future. In today's call, I'll start by providing more details about our outlook for the year ahead, then I'll talk about the future growth drivers that are reshaping our industry, and I'll finish by describing Applied's strategy and highlight some recent accomplishments and milestones.
Let me begin with the near-term environment and our current perspective on 2019. In the past quarter, there's been more negative than positive news with the whole industry facing challenges, which include: macro conditions in emerging markets that have weakened; smartphone demand falling short of expectations, particularly for high-end models which have more semiconductor content; and DRAM prices, which have declined as inventory levels build.
On the positive side, we've also observed that NAND inventories are coming down from very high levels seen in the fall, although they remain above normal levels. Fundamental dynamics in the memory market are healthy with very disciplined investment in new capacity and a strong commitment to advance the technology roadmap. And looking more broadly at semiconductor capital investment, it's important to note that we're in a period of market transition and diversification.
For the past several years, smartphones drove the majority of wafer fab equipment spending. This year, more than half of customers' investments will be driven by other categories as new growth drivers, including cloud data centers, IoT devices, 5G and automotive applications, gain momentum. 
When we take all these factors into account, we see the following implications for Applied's served markets. Based on recent public comments by our customers, NAND bit demand is expected to grow in the mid-30% range this year, and DRAM bit demand in the mid- to high teens. As a result, we believe that investment by memory customers will be down substantially in 2019. However, we also expect channel inventory levels to normalize as the year progresses, creating a more favorable setup for 2020.
In foundry logic, we see investment being flat to slightly up year-on-year, but we expect a higher portion of the spending to be directed towards long lead-time equipment, specifically EUV lithography. While this represents a market share headwind for Applied in both 2018 and 2019, it's also a positive indicator of customers' future investment in leading-edge process tools. Overall, we believe that wafer fab equipment spending in 2019 will be down mid- to high teens on a percentage basis versus last year. 
In display, weakness in emerging markets is also impacting the timing of customers' investment plans. We see some TV factory projects pushing out of the year and into 2020. As a result, we now believe our display equipment revenue in 2019 will decline by about 1/3 from 2018's record levels. We also expect revenue in the second fiscal quarter to be significantly lower than our average run rate for the year.
Over the longer term, we believe the display market remains attractive as the industry is going through several large technology transitions, as larger substrates are introduced in TV manufacturing, rigid OLED adoption increases in smartphones and expands to other applications, and initial flexible OLED products get closer to release. These inflections create important growth opportunities for Applied over the next several years.
While we're paying close attention to current headwinds and driving efficiencies across the company, we remain focused on our long-term opportunities. I strongly believe that in the future, technology will play a larger part in many areas of our lives. Entire industries will be transformed by artificial intelligence, big data and Industry 4.0, and at the foundation of those transformations are semiconductors. We're moving beyond a world of general-purpose computing to specialized solutions that address new types of applications and workloads in the cloud and at the edge. And while the need for semiconductor innovation has never been greater, classic Moore's law scaling is challenged. Simply shrinking transistors no longer delivers simultaneous improvements in the power, performance and cost of chips.
As I've said before, to unlock the full potential of AI and big data, we need a new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing, which will include new architectures, new 3D techniques, novel materials, new ways to shrink transistors and advanced packaging techniques. All 5 of these areas require major advances in materials engineering and create tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials.
To enable this playbook and accelerate innovation for our customers, we are making investments in new capabilities, creating entirely new types of products and expanding our engagements across the ecosystem. For example, we recently announced that we're expanding our long-standing technology partnership with IBM as a member of their new AI hardware center. We're also making good progress with our new Materials Engineering Technology Accelerator, which is on track to open later this year. The META Center will support deeper collaborations with system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community.
In addition to broadening our participation in the AI/big data inflection, we are also building a more resilient company with diversified revenue streams. The portion of our revenue generated from sources other than new 300-millimeter semiconductor equipment sales is increasing. Combined, we expect our services, spares, upgrades, consulting, software and display and flexible technology businesses to represent about 45% of total sales this year.
In Applied Global Services, our progress is fueled by our growing installed base and new advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yields and optimize operating costs. We grew AGS revenue more than 20% in fiscal 2018, and we anticipate high single-digit growth this year, even with wafer fab equipment spending expected to be down significantly. One reason for this is that more than half our service and spares business now comes from subscription-type revenues in the form of long-term service agreements.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Given the elevated macro risks and the challenging environments in both the memory and display markets, our near-term outlook is one of caution. Despite these headwinds in 2019, we remain highly optimistic about the future. While we're taking steps to ensure our spending is aligned with short-term market conditions, we're focusing our investments on long-term opportunities. We're driving innovative new product development and building new capabilities that position Applied to play a bigger and broader role in the industry over the coming years.
Now Dan will provide his perspective on our performance and outlook.",1170,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2019",2019-02-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3453.0,1659736.0,65455927.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll outline our financial strategy in the current environment, then summarize our Q1 financial results, provide our Q2 business outlook and give you an update on our new META Center in New York. As Gary outlined, the end markets that our customers serve weakened during the quarter. As a result, our semi equipment customers are taking proactive steps to carefully manage capacity additions and reduce inventories. This sets the industry up well for 2020 and beyond. We continue to expect the recovery to be shallow and gradual, and we're still not ready to call the bottom of the current cycle.
At the same time, it's important to put this year's spending into context. Our WFE forecast for 2019 is still billions of dollars higher than the peaks of all the prior cycles. Today, our backlog remains healthy, our profitability is solid, we're generating strong free cash flow and we're returning cash to shareholders. Most importantly, we see significant opportunities ahead, and we have the resources to make disciplined investments to secure technology leadership and growth.
Our strategy is to navigate the current environment by carefully managing our overall expenses, fully funding our new product pipeline and maximizing our recurring revenue. Here are some specific examples. First, expense control. Our Q1 non-GAAP OpEx was $750 million, including savings from our holiday shutdown and only 1 month of our annual merit increase. In Q2, absent these same benefits, we're guiding our overall OpEx to be approximately flat sequentially. Next, R&D funding. Even in the current environment, we're investing more in R&D to strengthen and grow our new technology and product pipeline. Gary described how the industry needs new architectures and materials to enable better chips for AI. Later this year, we plan to introduce materials engineering solutions designed to accelerate the adoption of the next generation of memory chips, which will be highly enabling to cloud computing and the Internet of Things.
Third, recurring revenue. Gary described how our services revenue should be higher in 2019, even as WFE declines. We expect the transactional portion of our AGS revenue to grow more slowly this year as our customers work down excess inventories. But the subscription-like part of AGS should be higher year-over-year. In fact, in 2018, we grew the number of tools under comprehensive service agreements at 3x the rate of new system shipments. So we're doing a good job of delivering ongoing value to our customers across a larger portion of our installed base, which is the largest in the industry.
Next, I'll summarize our quarterly results. As a reminder, Applied adopted the ASC 606 standard for revenue recognition this quarter, using the full retrospective approach. Bear in mind, the differences between revenue recognized under ASC 606 and the old standard will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But over time, they will offset each other and the cumulative difference will be minimal. As we expected, the adoption of ASC 606 had a minimal cumulative impact on the company, increasing our retained earnings by about $6 million.
Now to the results. In Q1, we delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses were at the midpoint of guidance. We generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.81, which was $0.02 above the midpoint, including the impact of a slightly higher tax rate.
Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems revenue was $2.27 billion and about 1 percentage point above the midpoint of our outlook. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin was 28.3%. Global Services revenue was $962 million and 2 points above the midpoint of our guidance. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6%. Display revenue was $507 million and 1 point above the midpoint of our guidance. The group's non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $834 million, or 22% of sales. We returned $942 million to shareholders, including $750 million in buybacks. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and investments and $3.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Next, I'll provide our Q2 guidance. We expect company revenue to be approximately $3.48 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Within the outlook, we expect Silicon Systems revenue to be in the range of $2.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Services revenue should be $970 million, plus or minus $25 million. Our Display revenue should be in the range of $340 million, plus or minus $25 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margins of around 43.5% and non-GAAP OpEx of around $750 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP earnings should be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per share, and our current non-GAAP tax rate expectation is approximately 14%. This is about 2 percentage points higher than our initial expectation for 2019. We've raised our rate expectation primarily to reflect the potential impact of new regulations proposed by the Treasury Department, along with our latest forecast for geographic revenue mix.
Now I'll close with an update on the R&D capabilities we're creating at our META Center in upstate New York. Over the past quarter, we received approvals needed to begin receiving $250 million in public funding, which is being used to purchase and install Applied Materials systems and other equipment. We've now shipped our first systems to the META Center, which will be one of the most advanced R&D centers in the world. We're already engaged with multiple customers to accelerate breakthroughs in semiconductor technology, along with new applications of our materials engineering capabilities, and we're on track to be running wafers in the second half of the year.

Thanks for the questions. Let me give you some overall color on the display business, and hopefully, I'll cover the 2 questions that you have. In the 6 years through 2018, we were able to grow the display business at a compounded annual growth rate of around 25% to $2.5 billion last year. In '19, we signaled incremental weakness on the last call, and the market has continued to weaken since that call. We now believe that the market is down around 1/3 from 2018's record levels, with second quarter -- our second quarter to be significantly lower than our projected average run rate for 2019 to 2020. Relative to the mix on -- what we have as the biggest incremental change since the last call is weakness in TV, delays in TV investments. It's still compelling for customers to go to Gen 10.5 panels because you can produce 8 65-inch TVs versus 3 on Gen 8.5, so it's strategically important for them to go and make that transition, but the timing of the investments are being pushed out. And then going into 2020, we see small improvement in 2020, and we definitely like the longer-term technology trends and opportunities to grow the business. So hopefully, that gives you some indication around mix. The biggest difference from our last call is in the TV market.",226,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

We'll all see the numbers, including our share. One thing that we'll see is that in the 6 years going into 2017, we were the only major supplier to be up or flat for 6 consecutive years. And certainly, what we've said in '18 is that our share will be down. Demand softened in the back half of the year, we saw a pushout to NAND reuse in foundry. And overall, spending mix shifted towards litho and areas we don't compete. What you will see in about a month is gains in areas like implant, epi, etch, gaining momentum in packaging. And also, in our process control business, I'm happy about the progress there, we had a record year. Very strong growth in our e-beam technologies. We may end up being #1 in e-beam for the first time ever, and very well positioned with the additional adoptions of new products in '19. In '18 and '19, logic customers are buying EUV systems, and those systems have very long lead times. They're buying the EUV tools years before they go into high-volume manufacturing. We look at that as a positive indicator in the adoption of future nodes. But certainly, right now, in '18 in '19, it's definitely a headwind. And as we go forward, as NAND spending resumes, that's more material spending versus litho spending, that's certainly good for us. The trailing nodes are also not litho dependent, so that's also going to be good going forward. And then another factor in '19 that's more favorable setup for us, we have balanced share in foundry, logic and memory. So in a year where DRAM and NAND are much weaker, the relative setup for us is better in 2019. And then, what we've talked about is over the longer term, we see a very different picture emerging. It's clear the industry needs a new playbook that goes beyond 2D scaling, and I deeply believe Applied is in the best position to enable the playbook. I meet all the time with customers, the leaders of R&D for our top customers on a monthly basis, and this is a big focus for all of those customers. We've talked about 5 drivers of power, performance, area and cost as 2D scaling slows, and all of those are dependent on breakthroughs in materials engineering. So I would say, longer term, that creates a great opportunity for us. Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, new memory technology for AI that's coming later this year. I talked about 1,000x improvement in leakage current that improves power efficiency. Those are just early examples of the new playbook, extensive playbook that we've developed. And then, we've also talked about speeding up the new playbook by opening the META Center and figuring out how to integrate all this together so customers can move it into their fabs. Now I definitely believe the right vision for the industry is materials to systems 10x faster, driving this new playbook. There's never been a time where it's more important, so that's the playbook on how we're going to move the needle for the industry and for Applied.",548,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And whether or not you see either recovering in the back half of the calendar year?

Let me take first the market opportunity for us. There's no question, as customers increase the number of layers, it's all about materials intensity, and so that creates a tremendous opportunity for us. We grew market share in memory a significant amount over the last 5 years. A lot of the improvements around new materials, new technologies that drive that scaling are really great opportunities for Applied. We are increasing our etch share also in memory. So that's also a very good setup for us. So certainly, as the scalings goes forward, we expect that we're going to continue to grow our share, as we've done over the last several years.

Thanks, Gary. And John, to get to how 2019 is profiling in the memory space, let me start with what we saw in 2018, and use that as a jumping-off point to make some comparative statements about how we see the market profiling in 2019. We're probably not going to be point-specific on how 2018 ended up because Gartner is going to come out in a month or 2 with those estimates, but we definitely saw 2018 up over '17, definitely has a 5 handle on it. And as you indicated, it was a strong memory growth year. We think, as 2018 settled, 60% of the spend in the market was memory-related, 40% -- about 40% was foundry/logic-related. Within memory, we saw the NAND, DRAM spend very balanced. As we look forward into 2019, in Gary's prepared comments, he said year-over-year, WFE in '19 will be down. Memory will be down by a good amount, we expect foundry/logic to be flat to up a little bit. So as 2019 shakes out, we expect foundry/logic to be greater than memory. Overall, the market will be down mid- to high-teens. And as we look at the market between NAND and DRAM, we see it profiling very similar to '18 and being balanced. In terms of the second half, and I come back in the market, I think we want to set expectations for a slow, gradual recovery off of these levels. While we're having conversations with customers and we see positive lead indicators, we think it's prudent in this environment to set those expectations for a slow, gradual recovery. As we look into the back half of the year, inventory levels come down faster than we expect, utilizations come up and price stability, those would all create the environmentals for a more robust second half. And if that scenario materializes, then we would benefit significantly from that environment. And then I wanted to come back to C.J.'s original question because, now, I think I understand a bit of what he was asking for. And I apologize, C.J. Let me help shape the revenues this year to, I think, get at the question you were asking. Off of the levels we guided in Q2, we see our semi systems group flattish on a quarterly basis into the back part of the year. The run rate of our display business in Q2 will be below the annual average, so we would see -- expect to see that growing into the back part of the year, and then AGS will have its normal seasonal profile and be higher into Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, that helps giving you a bit of the profile and color. And then the gross margin part of your question, again, we expected that to incrementally step up in Q3, and again into Q4.",474,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The philosophy we have at the company is we are going to be an inflection-focused growth company, we're going to grow organically and invest in products and capabilities that will help drive that growth going forward. We do it in the context of the environment we operate in, we will be disciplined operators and instill spend discipline throughout the company. As you take a look at the guide into Q2, what I would expect, if you take a step back and think about where we were a quarter or 2 ago, we had said we spent about $3 billion on OpEx in 2018, we would expect that to grow by about $200 million into '19. We've adjusted those plans in light of the current environment we're in, and we'll probably bring that down by about $175 million over the course of 2019, off of the original expectations. So up 1%, maybe 1.5% off of the levels we were in 2018. And we think this strikes the right balance given everything we know between near-term discipline that reflects the environment we operate in, and strong pursuit of new technologies, new platforms, new winning products that will preserve shareholder value creation into the infections that we see materializing in the years ahead.",218,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So how much visibility do you have at this point in time on when EUV gets introduced in mass manufacturing? How's the share, I would say, of AMAT's -- of spending for wafer is evolving? So that's one question. And then, the second question is how much of the benefit you see on the back of EUV is just more of what you do already? And how much is actually new technology you're going to introduce as well, things like cobalt interconnect and others?",115,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And in '19, you're going to see the first chips being built, so you have pilot production. And when you're adopting a new technology like this, it happens years before you go into high-volume manufacturing. So you see this initial adoption surge in advance of the high-volume manufacturing. And so again, we do see that as a good leading indicator relative to N5, for instance, when that happens. Now one thing also to remember is that EUV will remove legacy etch and depth steps, I mean, that's why customers are adopting EUV because it replaces a number of different etch steps, but those aren't our steps. So at every node, the most important thing for the customers is they have to drive power, performance, area and cost. And it's definitely with power and performance, 2D scaling helps, but even more important is innovation and materials. So if you look at a node like N5, for instance, there are many materials inflections that are being adopted as customers drive improvements in power and performance. We have a number of different new steps there, advanced metal gate materials, epi steps. We have hot and cold implant, going from 500 degrees C to minus 140, new surface treatments. We're increasing our share in critical etch steps and have good momentum in new process control solutions. So that is what will come for us, but what you see right now is this early adoption of EUV as customers prepare for those higher-volume ramps. What I would also say, and I talked about this many times, is I do believe that the industry needs a new playbook. We have stronger and deeper engagements than we've ever had with customers. So that really positions us well. Relative to N5, we're well positioned, we have deep engagements with customers to drive power and performance on N5 and also for future nodes. And just the last thing I would add, when we talk about EUV adoption, the majority of EUV is really in leading-edge technology in logic/foundry. You have half the market that's memory, that's driven by materials. You've got about 25% of the market that's specialty nodes, power devices, image sensors, which also are great opportunities for us. So we see about 75% of the market, really great opportunities. And in the leading-edge foundry and logic, it's really about power and performance, in addition to 2D scaling, and we're in the best position to drive that with our customers going forward.",428,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So relative to China, from what we see today, it seems like mostly business as usual with our customers in the region. We're very well positioned in China with domestic and multinational customers. We've been in China for 35 years, very deep relationships across semi and display. Just a little bit of color on China. We expect China wafer fab equipment investment to be down year-over-year in '19 versus '18, and we see both domestic and multinational down in China. In China domestic, we see higher spending on foundry/logic versus memory, with foundry/logic focused on trailing nodes for sensors, IoT, those types of devices. Within China domestic spending, we're in a great position, and we expect that we're going to gain share. And then, also, our display business in China will be down in line with our overall global display forecast. So overall, we have a super strong position in China, semi, service, display, great teams, strong relationships, and feel good about how we're positioned going forward.",171,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

The trailing node geometries, in general, have been profiling very strong for the last couple of years, and 200-millimeter equipment demand is also the same. We continue to expect a healthy outlook for those mature nodes going forward. And the 200-millimeter equipment demand remains strong. Like you said, IoT sensors are proliferating and driving significant demand at those mature nodes. I'd also say that there are new AI chip architectures that are being designed at the 28-nanometer node, and they're going to deliver high-performance. But to get the same transistor count out into the market as the 7-nanometer node, you need 8x the wafers at 28 nanometers. And so the fact that we're getting new designs of highly-capable silicon at nodes like 28 nanometers, I think, bodes well for the trailing node market. 200 millimeter is experiencing the same type of dynamic and continues to be strong.

As you -- as we've talked about historically, gross margin is going to be a function of a number of factors. There's an aggregate revenue component, there's mix between our segments, and then product mix within segments as well as overall activity levels in the factory, and they will vary from quarter-to-quarter. As we take a look at our guide into Q2 when we compare it to peak quarter about a year ago, we're profiling favorably relative to our peers in the industry. And so the company, we think, is doing a good job in a difficult environment given the parameters we talked about that influence gross margin, and we're profiling, I think, favorably relative to peers in the industry, given that peak comparison.

Yes, I'm just trying to understand the change in the model. I think you said maybe 6-or-so months ago, before WFE fell off, I think the feeling was that you would do roughly $3.25 annualized at $40 billion WFE. We're sort of even a little bit above that right now, we're probably at $41 billion or $42 billion. But even if you say we're at $40 billion, you're sort of, based on the guidance, you're roughly $2.65 a year annualized, so that's roughly 20% below where you thought. So pretty big number.

So here's what I would share with you and what we see. In the November quarter, we noted that 2019 was going to shape up a lot like 2017, and that would give us an earnings per share a bit above $3.25. And since then, we've seen pre-announcements by end customers. One company in the smartphone space, another one in the GPU, and cryptocurrency continues to be weak. So we've taken customer spending down in semi and display. And if you layer in what Gary said, down mid- to high teens on a year-over-year basis, clearly, WFE spend is now below the levels we saw in 2017. So my expectation is, is that earnings, not surprisingly, will be lower than they were in 2017. But I do like the way the customers are taking proactive steps to get supply in balance with demand, work down inventories in both memory and the logic/foundry space, so I see the setup into 2020 as being quite good.",165,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

On the clarification, Dan, I was hoping you could give us some more color around the subscription versus transactional mix in AGS. So let us predict how sensitive that business is to WFE versus your increasing base of deployed tools. And then, the question is, if I look at WFE over a longer period of time, it was in the low to mid-30s for many years, and then, in '17 and '18, it jumped well above that trend to $50 billion-plus. And now, this year, they are in the low-$40s billion. What I'm trying to understand is, what is the right baseline level. That when we have, let's say, 2020 as a ""normal year,"" do we grow off of the low-$40s billion that we are at right now, or do we grow off of the $50s billion.

I'll start with the subscription question, and then turn it over to Dan. So overall, our service business has grown about 15% compounded annual growth rate over the last 4 years. In 2018, we grew over 20%. What I said in the prepared remarks is we see high single-digit growth in 2019 in a soft market. And part of what helps us is exactly what you talked about, is this subscription revenue. We have a higher percentage, over half of our business is subscription revenue with long-term agreements. And so when you're in a soft market, those long-term agreements versus just selling parts makes a very, very big difference. That's been a conscious strategy on our part to create value for our customers, drive more of these comprehensive service agreements. If you look at 2018, the comprehensive service agreements grew 3x faster than the rate of new shipments. So we have -- we really changed that strategy around 5 years ago relative to driving more long-term agreements, subscription-type revenue. And even in 2018, it's still growing at a very high rate. It really comes back to creating value for customers, optimizing output, yield, cost. We've put a tremendous focus there. And again, we're getting a lot of traction. So it's good for us, and also definitely good for our customers. And then, I'll have -- turn it over to Dan for the next question.",238,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

And Vivek, on the second part of your question. I think there's a couple of ways to look at it. If we take a longer-term perspective around WFE, and we look at it as a percentage of overall semiconductor revenue, and you go back a couple decades to 2000, WFE as a percentage of semiconductor revenues was about 17%. This was a bit of a peak because our customers were investing in both 200- and 300-millimeter systems. And then, over the course of the next decade, as 300-millimeter cut in, all the factory automation systems and the way our customers consolidated and became more efficient in operating their footprint of capacity, you saw it come down to about 9% in 2013. Now that all the efficiency gains from 300-millimeter have worked their way through the system, 450 millimeters is not on the roadmap, in the last few years since 2013, that WFE intensity has climbed to 11%, 12%. In an environment characterized like we're in now, where we see elevated inventory levels on both the foundry/logic side as well as the memory side, and our customers managing, in a very disciplined way, supply to meet end-market demand, we see those inventories come down. And so I think it's a good setup for 2020. But I don't think what happens this year forms the baseline because we do think what's happening this year is shipping below true end-market demand as these inventories come down.",244,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

Thanks for the question. Memory technology, I think you can see in terms of the 3D NAND ramp, is very difficult. Companies that have decades of experience, tremendous technology, deep experienced talent, I mean, those customers had difficulty transitioning from 2D to 3D NAND. And certainly, DRAM scaling is extremely difficult right now. So it just takes a lot of time to build that type of technology base. And you also need experienced talent across many, many different types of skill sets. So what we've said before in terms of China is that China will definitely continue to incrementally spend, but it's going to be years before you see -- I mean, if you look at cost per bit, any type of competitiveness on the leading edge is going to take a lot of time to develop the technology, to develop the talent. And in the meantime, again, in the foundry/logic area, there is a tremendous growth in sensors, IoT, trailing-edge technologies, and we see rational spending there, ramping in China. And again, that's more of the spending in 2019. So again, we see increases, but as we've said before, we don't see a hockey stick.

As I said earlier on N5, really, for all the customers, every node, they're driving power, performance, area and cost. 2D scaling is one of the ways that they're driving those improvements. And certainly, shrinking is part of that. Pattern placement, techniques to place patterns in the right location are also part of that, where we've said before, we expect our patterning revenue to grow. We've grown significantly over the last several years. We do still see, if you look across the whole industry, our patterning share to continue to grow for Applied Materials. And then, for power and performance, some of the things I talked about earlier in N5, gate materials, epi, implant, surface treatment technologies. I'll tell you, the interfaces are getting very, very difficult. And so when you look at how you improve power and performance, you're talking about a few items making a very big difference. In some cases, you take wafers out of one process chamber, immediately, in a matter of seconds or minutes, you have moisture being absorbed into the films, oxidizing, that impacts device performance. So more of these integrated material solutions will be the path in terms of how people drive scaling going forward. The 1,000x leakage-of-current example I've given is, I think, a prime example of a huge improvement in power and performance, and that requires a combination of technologies on a platform where Applied has a significant advantage. So those are the areas we're focused on. We have many deep conversations with a number of different companies. I meet on a regular basis with all of the R&D leaders, and really, that's the focus for us and creates a big opportunity.",283,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

In our second fiscal quarter, we delivered results toward the top end of our guidance range reflecting solid execution across the company and a challenging business environment. Overall, our outlook has not changed significantly since our February call. Investment by memory and display customers remains muted for the time being, and we continue to pay attention to the broader macroeconomic risks.
Looking further ahead, we maintain our strong positive view of our markets as powerful new demand drivers take shape. We're excited about the opportunities these secular trends create for Applied, and while we're carefully managing discretionary spending consistent with current market conditions, fueling our long-term growth remains a top priority. We are focusing on driving R&D to accelerate customers' road maps, building new capabilities and positioning Applied to play a bigger and broader role in the AI big data era.
In today's call, I'll begin with our latest perspective on near-term market dynamics. Then, I'll talk briefly about the future growth drivers that are reshaping the semiconductor and display industries as well as the implications for Applied, and I'll finish by describing our performance and strategic priorities.
Starting with the near-term environment, our view of 2019 is largely the same as it was at the start of the year and shaped by 2 key factors. First, the semiconductor industry is in a period of diversification. If you look back over the past 5 years or so, you will see that smartphones drove the majority of semiconductor capital investments. We believe that is changing.
As we transition to the AI/big data era, major new drivers are emerging that will fuel industry growth for years to come. Although we're only in the early stages of the build-out, we see the combination of cloud data centers, 5G infrastructure, IoT and automotive technologies underpinning a much more significant portion of wafer fab equipment spending in 2019.
The second major factor impacting this year ahead is the memory cycle that the industry has been navigating for the past several quarters. Recent data shows that NAND pricing is stabilizing and inventory levels are down from their peak, although they still remain above normal levels. DRAM is not as far along in the correction cycle with high inventory levels and prices still falling.
As I've said before, I believe this memory cycle is different from those of the past. The fundamental dynamics in the market are healthy with disciplined investments in capacity. This year, customers are focusing resources on advancing their technology road maps and overall memory spending will be down significantly from 2018. We expect inventory levels to normalize as the year progresses, creating a more favorable environment for capacity investments in 2020.
In foundry logic, we have seen customers' plans firm up over the past few months and now expect spending to be up year-on-year. In aggregate, our view of overall wafer fab equipment spending in 2019 is unchanged. We still see spending down mid- to high teens on a percent basis versus last year.
 
In display, the picture is also consistent with our outlook from last quarter. We are still anticipating that our 2019 display revenues will decline by about 1/3 from 2018's level as customers push out investments. Over the longer term, we maintain our view that display is an attractive market, which is becoming more technology-intensive and increasingly dependent on materials' innovation.
The introduction of larger substrates in TV manufacturing as well as rigid and flexible OLED technologies for mobile applications creates important growth opportunities for Applied over the next several years. Even as we work through this period of softer demand, I believe it's critically important we do not lose sight of the bigger picture. Major new industry growth drivers are emerging in the form of IoT, next-generation communications, big data and artificial intelligence. These technologies are disruptive and transformative and will touch almost every area of the economy and our lives.
From a semiconductor perspective, we believe the AI/big data era will be characterized by 2 major inflections. The first is the computing architecture inflection towards AI workloads as we move beyond general-purpose computing to specialized systems designed for new applications in the cloud and at the edge. The second is overcoming the deceleration of classic Moore's law scaling to deliver system-level improvements in power, performance and cost that will unlock the full potential of AI and big data.
We see a new industry playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing emerging that includes 5 key components: new architectures; 3D structures and scaling techniques; novel materials; new ways to shrink feature sizes; and advanced packaging, including new ways to connect chips together. We see Applied's breadth and depth as a key strength as we collaborate broadly to address the technology challenges that will enable this new playbook. Our strategic priorities are to accelerate innovation for our customers while finding new ways to create sustainable value with our technology. 
I'll highlight 4 important ways that we're doing this. First, we're building new capabilities. We're creating powerful R&D platforms like the META Center in New York and the advanced packaging lab in Singapore to complement our existing Maydan Technology Center in Silicon Valley. In parallel, we are leveraging state-of-the-art centers in metrology combined with data science, machine learning and simulation to reduce product development cycles and speed up transfer of new technologies from lab to fab.
Second, we're developing entirely new types of products to address the most complex challenges in a chip manufacturing process from the introduction of novel materials to key integration bottlenecks. Some of our key areas of focus include: critical deposition, implant and etch processes to scale current memory structures; the introduction of novel materials combined with sub angstom level control of those materials that are needed to enable new memories, including MRAM, ReRAM and PC RAM; new materials and interface engineering to enable significant improvements in power efficiency and performance at leading-edge foundry logic nodes; and next generation advanced packaging for heterogeneous integration. Our product pipeline spans from new unit process tools all the way to Integrated Materials Solutions, or IMS, where we can combine multiple processes together with customized metrology within a single system.
Third, we are expanding our engagements across the AI ecosystem to accelerate innovation from materials to systems. In July, we will be hosting another AI Design Forum, bringing together leading companies in the field to support deeper collaboration between system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community. I hope that many of you will be able to join us for this event.
And fourth, we're building a more resilient company that performs well and can continue to fuel innovation in a variety of market conditions. For example, increasing our focus on our service business has been a great way to deliver additional value to customers while providing a revenue stream that is relatively decoupled from industry cycles. We expect Applied Global Services to deliver high single-digit growth this year even in an environment where semiconductor and display customers are trimming their capital spending.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Despite soft, near-term demand, the company is delivering solid performance. We are prudently managing discretionary spending and relentlessly focusing on our R&D pipeline. We expect 2020 to be a more positive setup, both in terms of industry spending and how much of that spending Applied can address. And we remain highly optimistic about the longer term. As powerful new drivers for semiconductors and displays emerge, we see tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials.
Now Dan will provide his perspective on our performance and outlook.",1267,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, May 16, 2019",2019-05-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3544.0,1752564.0,68627933.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. In Q2, Applied delivered solid financial results in a challenging environment. While we're still not ready to call the bottom of the semi equipment cycle, I believe our industry thesis is very much intact. New demand drivers are taking shape. And even in this memory correction year, wafer fab equipment spending could be $10 billion higher than the peaks of all the prior cycles.
In this environment, I'm focused on 4 financial priorities: carefully managing our overall expenses; fully funding our new product pipeline; maximizing our recurring revenue; and delivering attractive cash returns to our shareholders. I'll share my thoughts on each one.
First, in Q2, we reported OpEx of $745 million, which was below the midpoint of our guidance, it was also below our spending in Q1, which included a holiday shutdown and only 1 month of this year's merit increase. We'll continue to keep a tight rein on discretionary spending.
Second. At the same time, we are fully funding R&D. As Gary described, our customers need more innovation than ever to improve chip performance, power and cost. We're investing in unique systems that enable new architectures, materials, 3D design techniques and packaging in addition to 2D scaling.
Third, in addition to strengthening our competitiveness in the near term, these investments will increase our installed base and give us more opportunities to earn recurring revenue well into the future. I'll give you some metrics to think about. You may know that Applied has the largest installed base in the industry of more than 40,000 systems. Many of our systems have multiple chambers, and we actually have over 140,000 chambers in the field. Helping customers maximize the installed base is a key opportunity for Applied, especially in a year like 2019.
This year, we expect to generate about 40% of our semi-related revenue from the installed base, which includes 200- and 300-millimeter upgrades, refurbs, parts and services. The most strategic pillar of the AGS growth strategy is long-term service agreements, which allow us to deliver the most value to our customers and generate subscription-like revenue for Applied. Today, more than 20% of our semi-installed base is covered by long-term agreements. This business needs to be earned, and we do it by generating recurring value to our customers in the form of faster ramps, higher yields, greater throughput and lower costs.
Our strongest growth comes from advanced services, where we use data science to help our customers achieve maximum performance and continuous improvement. Our renewal rates are world-class. 2018 was the first year when AGS generated over 50% of services and spares revenue from subscription-like agreements. In 2019, we expect to grow the subscription part of the business at about twice the rate of the segment as a whole.
Finally, cash returns. As Gary said, the memory correction we're seeing today is different from those of the past. For our part, we are still generating solid profitability and more cash flow than we need to support the business. In Q2, we generated operating cash flow of $800 million, and we returned $814 million to shareholders. We paid $189 million in dividends, and we announced a 5% dividend increase.
We were opportunistic with the buyback program, using $625 million to repurchase approximately 16 million shares. In fact, over the past 4 quarters, we've repurchased 8% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of that period. Over a 5-year basis, we bought back approximately 28% of the shares.
Looking ahead, we're excited about the industry and confident that the actions we're taking today will generate substantial shareholder value in the years ahead.
Now I'll summarize our Q2 results. We delivered company revenue of $3.54 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.5% and in line with our outlook as the revenue upside was relatively balanced across the segments. We held non-GAAP OpEx at $745 million, and we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.70, which was the top of our guidance range.
Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems revenue was $2.18 billion and slightly above the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP operating margin was 27%. Global services revenue was $984 million, which is a new record and demonstrates how well we're growing the business even in a correction year for the industry. 
AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 28.8%. Display revenue was $348 million, which was above the midpoint of our outlook as some of the systems scheduled for Q3 actually shipped before the end of Q2. Display non-GAAP operating margin declined 10.1 points sequentially, and we expect the margin to recover along with revenue in the upcoming quarters.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and investments and nearly $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Next, I'll provide our Q3 guidance. We expect the company revenue to be approximately $3.525 billion, plus or minus $150 million, and we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.75 per share. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be approximately $2.175 billion. Services revenue should be about $990 million. Display revenue should be around $335 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase by about 30 basis points sequentially and non-GAAP OpEx should be approximately flat sequentially.

Let me start with the overall market profile and then what we expect from a margin standpoint as we roll forward into 2020. So as we take a look at where we sit in 2019, we talked about the overall WFE being down mid- to high teens. Our view on that hasn't changed. That puts us in about a mid-$40 billion range for WFE this year. As we look at the profile across device types and you look at foundry logic and you look at memory, we think foundry logic is going to be up a little bit this year. We think memory is going to be down a good amount this year. That gives you a bit of a setup on how we're profiling in 2019. 
As we roll the clock forward, and we look at how WFE is likely to unfold in 2020, we view this as a growth year in WFE. As we look in the foundry logic space, and we have advanced purchases of things like EUV and metrology systems around advanced nodes, we see the capacity adds building out those nodes going in, in 2020 beyond, and we think that's a favorable setup for our overall markets.
On the memory side, we don't see a memory correction this year, and we do see the memory correction profiling into 2020. That is our current expectation. If it happens faster than that, then we'll benefit in a material way. The combination of the setup around foundry logic and memory going into 2020 is a favorable setup for Applied, and we feel really good about the position that we're in. 
As we take a look at operating margins, operating margins are going to be a function of 2 things: how we profile from a gross margin standpoint and how we invest to fund future growth and deliver key enabling technologies to make our customers successful. Gross margin in any given quarter, not surprisingly, will vary depending on product mix and customer mix and factory activity levels as well as aggregate revenue levels, and it's going to vary from quarter-to-quarter.
As we look at the investments we are making today, we see 2D scaling and Moore's law increasingly having challenges, we see the road map, and Gary has talked about this in the past, there's a new playbook that our industry is going to create to drive power and performance for our customers. Applied has a key role to play in each of those elements of the new playbook, whether it's materials or architectures or 3D structures or packaging, and we're going to position our business and invest in our business to lead going forward. 
Now that said, in an environment where you see recovery in our end markets and our ability to grow into those end markets, we fully expect to see leverage on both the gross margin and the operating margin line. Premature at this point, I think, to give a point estimate on 2020, but we like the setup around 2020, and we do think we will see leverage in our margin structure as the business returns to growth.",525,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

C.J., thanks for your question. Let me start with 2019, and then I'll go to 2020 and beyond and build on some of what Dan talked about. 
While we're not going to forecast 2019 share on the call, we do think '19 is a more favorable setup for Applied. While we still see additional EUV adoption in 2019, the non-EUV spending mix is more favorable for Applied than it was in 2018. And going forward, I believe that we are very well positioned to drive share gains. Customers are struggling to deliver improvements in power, performance and cost. And as Dan said and as I've talked about many times, it's very clear a new playbook is needed based on new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to drive costs and new ways to connect chips together. 
A great example of our new playbook is our potential to enable a 1,000x improvement in leakage current. And there are other enabling capabilities that we have that address power, performance and costs that we're not going to discuss in public. We're engaged with the majority of our leading customers with Integrated Material Solutions, and we're even more confident that in both future and trailing nodes, we can help our customers integrate new technologies in their chips and drive incremental growth for Applied. 
We also have a very strong pipeline of new products, including products that expand our positions into markets that we don't currently serve. Some of those new products are already gaining traction with major customers.

So for 2019, we still expect display revenue to be down about 1/3 from 2018's record levels, with TV now being about 3/4 of the business this year as customers move to Gen 10.5. 
Going forward, we see demand becoming more balanced between TV and mobile OLED. And as we look into 2020, based on everything we see today, TV demand looks stable and we expect mobile to grow year-over-year with a broader mobile OLED customer base. And longer term, we see great opportunities that drive growth in the display business. Some of the new technologies are more capital-intensive. There are some great inflections where we can create value for customers.

Thanks for the question, Toshiya. So let me give you a color on China. China wafer fab equipment will be down year-over-year in '19 versus '18, a small amount. We still see domestic flattish and multinational down in China. In domestic China, we see slightly higher spending on foundry logic versus memory with foundry logic focused on trailing nodes for sensor, IoT, those kinds of devices. 
Within China domestic spending, we're in a great position. We expect we're going to maintain a very strong share position in China. In our display business, China is going to be down in line with the overall global display forecast. And I would say relative to customer progress, certainly in the domestic foundry logic business, we see a lot of growth in IoT, communications, automotive, power, sensor types of devices, and those are on more trailing nodes. Certainly, China has the ability to build those kinds of devices, and again, that's where we see more spending in 2019. And we see pretty strong growth there going forward. 
In memory, I don't want to comment on any specific customers in terms of progress, but what I would say is that memory is a very difficult market. If you look at DRAM, customers are adding letters to their nodes because scaling is becoming more capital-intensive and more difficult. And certainly, also in 3D NAND, scaling is difficult, and you can see customer presentations where capital intensity is going up as they try to scale those devices. 
So I think that being in the leading-edge memory is very, very, very difficult and will take many, many years.",271,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

I think there's a couple of things at play, at least how I process it. So let me share with you a little bit of my thinking, and hopefully, that will give you a bit of color on how we're viewing the world right now. 
I think our reluctance to call the bottom is a semiconductor comment, it's not an overall company comment. And what I mean by that, if we take a look at our semi business, there's no change to our outlook this year in terms of -- no material change in terms of the WFE, the overall market, down mid- to high teens, mid-$40 billion WFE ZIP Code. 
I gave you the profile on how foundry logic and memory will profile into this year. And if we go back a quarter on our earnings call, we provide a guidance around our semi systems business to be at a run rate of $2.15 billion and flat for the year. Very little has changed in our view on that business. We did a little better than that in Q2. We guided a little better than that in Q3, but what we're talking about is really a 1% move, and I think we've got to stay focused on the right run rate to think about the business is about $2.15 billion. And against that flat profile in semi, we see an OpEx level that underpins that, that's roughly flat with where we were in 2018. 
If I transition to the services business, we do see a step-up into the back of the year. We do have confidence in our high single-digit growth projection for the business. And I think it's important to note that Q4 is typically a seasonally good quarter for us, so we feel good about how that business profiles. 
In display for the full year, no change in our outlook. We said Q2, Q3 would profile very similarly. We see that playing out. We do see growth into the back part of the year. So when you bring it altogether as an overall company for Applied, while we do see flatness from a semi standpoint from this point forward, we do see growth from a services perspective, we see growth off these levels from a display perspective and the overall company will grow from this point in 2019.
And when we take a look at that mix towards the latter part of the year, we all know that our semi business has the highest gross margin, followed by display, followed by service. So with flat semi, growing service, growing display, that creates a natural gross margin headwind for us. We think we can execute well into that environment, and we're going to look to hold the gross margins flat into Q4, off of the levels we produce in Q3. So we've got confidence that we can execute well into that environment. Now we don't want to guide more than 1 quarter out, and so a quarter from now on our earnings call, we'll let you know what we see in Q4. But we hope to execute well against that natural margin headwind and keep our margins where they're at in Q3.",536,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

As we look at what's driving it, we said incremental improvement in foundry logic versus where we were a quarter ago. It's offset by incremental weakness from a memory standpoint. No change to the overall WFE. As we double-click on foundry logic, I don't think there's any one element that we can point to. We do see a diversification and a broadening of spend across mature nodes and leading-edge nodes. We do see capacity adds beginning to take shape around 5-nanometers, more at 7-nanometers. 
Still too early to extrapolate a trend line from that, but we're encouraged by the strength and resilience of that end market and the environment we find ourselves in. But no one specific thing to point to.",123,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

By my math, you sort of peaked at close to 22% in 2016, it was pretty flat in 2017, and you lost about 200 basis points last year. In that same time, ASML gained about 400 basis points-worth of share, and it sounded in the prepared remarks like you're a little more optimistic about gaining WFE share next year, and I guess, that's in a year where it seems like the industry has to come up with at least a couple of billion dollars year-over-year for EUV. 
So I guess, I'm just trying to parse through. Are you more bullish because of maybe some risk to EUV? Or are you bullish about the wafer capacity addition that you see on the NAND side next year?",136,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Thanks for the question. I just -- again, when we look at the setup for 2019, we believe that the mix is definitely more favorable for us. Certainly, you look at the foundry logic business, the growth in IoT communication, automotive, power sensors, those different markets, that's going to be a bigger percentage in terms of 2019. We think we're set up pretty well there. 
The initial buys for 5-nanometer also, we think that we're in a better position there. Again, if you look at the EUV adoption, certainly that's one way for our customers to drive their road maps. But we talked about 5 different ways, and EUV is one of those 5. And you see customers driving improvements in power and performance, and that's all about materials' innovation. So we have new steps that are being adopted, both in transistor and interconnect. That's going to be positive for us in terms of the leading-edge foundry and logic. And then in memory, we also are gaining positions there. And longer term, we see that, that's a really good growth opportunity for us. 
If you go back over, let's say, a 5-year period of time, we were probably 14%, 15% of the memory spend, and now we're over 20% of the memory spend. And as customers are driving DRAM devices with new foundry-like processes in the periphery, that's great for us because that leverages our leading-edge products, the PVD implant, thermal, CMP. All of those areas, we have very strong positions. And we're gaining new positions also in memory. 
So again, overall, we like the setup much better in 2020. And longer term, longer term, again, all of these road maps are becoming more difficult. Customers are adding all kinds of pluses to their technology nodes because, again, the scaling is getting much more difficult. And at the foundation of all that is materials' innovation, Integrated Material Solutions, where we have engagements with all the major customers. It takes some time to drive those architectures and structures and materials into new devices, but we have tremendous traction there. We're certainly more optimistic in '19, and definitely, there's a lot of great things that come together for us in 2020 and beyond that will be positive for Applied.",378,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

When Gary explained earlier, he said there were 2 reasons why the share dropped year-over-year. He said one was EUV, and that was coming in while our customers were in reuse mode. He said one other thing, he said there are other markets that we don't participate in that were very strong in 2018, specifically dielectric edge, and then a host of batch processes. So we do expect that EUV will continue to be good in '19, but we don't see as much of those other areas that we nominally compete in but in reality do not. As a reminder, we're in conductor etch, not dielectric, right? We're in single wafer processes, not batch processes.

The -- just like in semi, those display technologies are very difficult. If you look at mobile OLED, I mentioned that the customer base will be broadening out, and that will be great for Applied, it will also be great for adoption as there are more customers that can supply those types of devices. And we look at the capital intensity is increasing. As I said, in flex OLED, it goes up by about a factor of 2.

What's happening in the installed base? Does that mean 0 capacity additions? Does that mean capacity reduction?

As we take a look at the overall market and the willingness to call the bottom, that's as much a function of what we're seeing in the end market as it is just a recognition of the elevated risk environment we find ourselves in, and we just think it's prudent right now to set expectations in a way that reflect that environment. And I just think you see that coming through in the way in which we're talking about the business. And again, it's only intended to be prudent in this environment. 
As we take a look at both memory types, and we look at capacity additions, as we think about the investments going in today, the investments are more of a technology transition nature. Technology transitions are fundamentally, as you know, about cost competitiveness of our customers going forward. And so as those markets recover, they're going to need to keep pace from a technology road map standpoint to be cost-competitive as those markets recover. 
If we look at the aggregate capacity in each of those markets, we look at them as flat to down slightly in both of those markets. This is not a year for capacity adds. What you see are some conversions going on. And when you convert, you tend to lose some capacity. So investors are acting in a very -- I mean, I'm sorry, the customers are acting in a very profit-minded, disciplined way to keep the supply/demand in balance in a difficult year. 
I think what that sets us up well for as we exit the year, we do think that our customers under-ship end market demand as they work down inventories in the channel, both their inventories as well as their customers' inventory, and that's a good setup going into 2020. But in this year, we don't expect capacity additions in either of those 2 markets.",316,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

I think the best way to think about this is not read too much in any one quarter in terms of what we do from a buyback. I think you need to take a look at a longer-term trend line of what our company has done. We've always talked about our 3 priorities for capital allocation, and it's a consistent approach to capital allocation that hasn't changed over time. 
First element is, is we're going to fully fund growth of this company that has an organic and inorganic component to it. The second priority will be to maintain a strong, flexible balance sheet. And the third priority is to take the vast majority of the excess cash and give it back to shareholders. If you look at a 2-decade trend for the company, we're very close to 100% of excess cash has gone back to shareholders. 
We've been big purchasers of our shares given what we see happening and unfolding in our end markets as a result of the data economy diversifying end market demand in our business. We think that takes the semiconductor industry structurally larger. By implication, that's going to take our industry structurally larger even off the levels we saw in 2018, and Applied will benefit in a very material way. 
In the last 4 quarters alone, we've repurchased about 8% of the company; last 3 years, around 17%; and the last 5 years, just about 28% of the company. So I think we've been significant purchasers of our shares in light of what we see unfolding. And we think a steady approach to this quarter in/quarter out isn't the right approach to take to drive long-term shareholder value.

Your comments upfront, you talked about NAND kind of stabilizing, and I guess, there are segments of NAND where that's true. But generally, your customers have sort of talked about margin -- margins continuing to come down in the back half. I just want to make sure, I mean, when you're talking about NAND stabilization, that's not weighing heavily into your forecast. It seems like there's fairly dormant NAND spending in the second half. But just as -- when you're talking -- when you see that stabilization, is that kind of upside to your -- the numbers that we're talking about here? Or just how should we think about that?",114,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

Let me share a little bit of our thinking, and hopefully, that will help give you insight into where we see the NAND correction cycle. 
If we were on this call a year ago, that was the first time we started to talk about a pullback from an investment standpoint of our customers, and it was still at a time when margins hadn't reached their peak. And so I think it's the first time in the industry's history where you saw that disciplined behavior of our customers begin to pull back at a time when margins were still moving forward. And I think it created some confusion. And the reason I bring that data point up is, is I think the NAND industry is further along the correction cycle than the DRAM industry. And in the prepared comments, we talked about inventory being off of their peaks but still at an elevated level. 
So when we talk about early signs of stabilization, I would say it's stabilization not in hindsight or in the past tense. I think it's in the process of stabilizing, hasn't fully stabilized yet. But we feel good that we're seeing those early signs, and we see NAND is further along in that correction cycle than DRAM. So we've got more work to do as an industry. But again, as we roll the business forward off of these levels, we think we profile roughly flat for the rest of the year from a semi system standpoint.",251,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And within that, I'll talk about the different products. 
So when I look forward, I see a number of factors that can drive very strong performance for Applied. As we've said before, in the semi market, we're at the biggest -- beginning of the biggest wave we've ever seen, this AI/big data wave. In the next 2 years, we could see this wave building momentum and creating a very strong semiconductor market. At the same time, as I talked about earlier, capital intensity is increasing in memory and foundry logic. And in foundry logic, you see the end of classic Moore's law. And as I talked about earlier, you see customers having 7, 7P, 7-plus, 6 popped up on the road map, some customers talking about many pluses. 
Again, I think that's an indication that driving improvements in power, performance area and cost is getting harder and harder. So we certainly see that in both the memory business and in the foundry logic business. And we've talked about this new path forward with 5 drivers. We've had some of our peers talk about similar drivers and some customers talking about those drivers relative to how you're going to improve power performance area and cost. And we're really, really in the beginning of this, but you can see evidence of this in terms of the customer behavior, how they're driving the devices. 
So that's a great setup for us. If we look at our unit processes, we look at the Integrated Materials Solutions that we have like the 1,000x improvement in leakage current, it's really a great setup for us.
Let me go a little bit broader and talk about our display business. We've said our display market will pick up over the next 2 years. Capital intensity there is also increasing. Our service business is becoming an increasing part of the company. We have the largest installed base for service. Our subscription-type revenue is also growing very fast. And if the semiconductor market strengthens over the next 2 years, this business can go back to double-digit growth for Applied. 
So you put the new products that we have that are targeted for the biggest problems our customers have in memory, scaling, the memory devices, addressing the leading-edge foundry and logic performance, power, area, cost, new segments like IoT, communication, automotive power, sensors. All of those things together, if you look out 2 years from now, you've got stronger markets, a stronger position, service still growing, a combination of factors that could be really great for overall performance for Applied.",454,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

One for Gary. I just want to better understand how a greenfield fab would help with some of these initiatives that you have taken over the past 2 years versus the existing fabs that are basically being converted like there are fabs -- NAND fabs that are being converted from a 64-layer 3D NAND to 96. And there are greenfield fabs, the same for DRAM. So as these greenfield fabs at some time in the future are actually going to turn on again, would that create a bigger opportunity for you given all the R&Ds of the past? Or is that going to be the same as a fab being converted? And I have a follow-up.",130,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I think the bigger -- so certainly, the greenfield fabs create a bigger opportunity for us, but I think that really the biggest factor for us is what technologies are enabling those future devices when they ramp those greenfield factories. So if you look at DRAM, as I mentioned, DRAM, you have the periphery moving to more logic-like type structures. So similar to what we saw in 28-nanometer foundry, you see strong demand for PVD implant, thermal processing, CMP, DRAM. You see capacitor formation, new structures. 
We have positive patterning inflections for Applied in memory, I/O layer formations, so many things within DRAM. In 3D NAND, scaling is about multiple things, more layers, more tiers, focusing on layer thickness, lateral scaling. We're winning new etch applications in NAND. And one of the things that is most important in scaling NAND is new materials, especially high selectivity hard mask, where we have very strong capability. We have a new hard mask material that increases etch selectivity by 50%, and we already see qualifications in future technology nodes. 
So a lot of those types of technologies, Mehdi, are ones that are enabling our memory customers. We have similar types of technologies for foundry and logic. And then the other thing, again, I wanted to talk about that I mentioned before, are the Integrated Materials Solution, combining multiple technologies in the same platforms under vacuum. And we see engagements with many of our large customers. It takes some time for those new structures to be integrated into a node, but if you think about customers announcing improvements in power and performance, that's a key part of their competitiveness. We have technologies that enable improvements in power and performance. We have traction in there with many large customers. And again, that will also fuel our growth over the future years.",307,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

We're currently, tracking 31 300-millimeter factories around the globe. There's only a couple of them that are in the very early stages of beginning to take equipment. And if we look at the aggregate WFE that those facilities represent, it's about almost $180 billion of WFE over time. 
So our customers are preparing for something that we think takes our industry structurally larger and is going to benefit Applied Materials as these macro trends we're talking about play out over time.

While I'm still not ready to call the bottom of the semiconductor cycle, I do believe we're seeing the early signs of stability, and that's something that I find encouraging. 
Second, I like our setup for 2020. I believe off of these levels, WFE can grow into next year.

Our results for the third fiscal quarter demonstrate strong execution in an environment that remains challenging for the time being. Overall, our view of 2019 is consistent with what we've previously communicated.
Within our served markets, foundry and logic spending is strong, while investments by memory and display customers are significantly lower than last year. We also remain mindful of the broader macroeconomic risks. During this industry down cycle, my primary focus is ensuring the organization is executing on the initiatives that will put Applied Materials in the best position for the future. I believe the opportunities for Applied are compelling as powerful new demand drivers emerge in the form of IoT, big data and artificial intelligence.
So even though we are prudently managing discretionary spending in the near term, we are fully funding R&D to accelerate customers' roadmaps and building new products and capabilities that will underpin the company's growth in the years ahead.
In today's call, I'll begin with a brief update on the near-term market dynamics, I'll then talk about emerging technology trends and Applied's strategy to address them, then I'll finish by highlighting some of our recent accomplishments.
Starting with the current environment. Our views of the semiconductor and display markets are largely unchanged. In memory, spending has softened slightly since our May call. On the supply side, we still see customers making disciplined investments, while adjusting factory output to reduce inventory levels. On the demand side, we believe the price elasticity of NAND is starting to take effect in the form of increases in the average bits per box for both smartphones and PCs.
Based on our current visibility, we remain optimistic about 2020, with an expectation that NAND investments will recover ahead of DRAM. In foundry logic, demand has strengthened as the year has progressed as we see customers accelerating the ramps of their leading-edge nodes. Demand for specialty nodes that serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets is also driving robust investments in capacity and new technology. Taking these factors into account, our view of overall wafer fab equipment spending for 2019 remains the same, down mid- to high-teens on a percentage basis relative to last year. We see 2020 as a more positive set-up for the industry and Applied, with the start of a recovery in memory investment and sustained strength in foundry logic spending.
In display, there are no significant changes to the outlook we provided last quarter, and we still anticipate our 2019 revenue being down by about 1/3 relative to 2018. Just as in semi, we're excited about the inflections taking place in display and the opportunities these create. We're getting ready for the future by ensuring we have the right portfolio of products to help our customers accelerate the introduction of next-generation technologies, including rigid and flexible OLED and larger substrates for manufacturing.
A few weeks ago, Applied hosted our second AI Design Forum with more than 700 attendees, representing leading companies from across the ecosystem. My main take away from this conference is strong alignment around 4 key themes: 
First, AI and big data are driving new approaches to computing that require new system architectures built from new types of semiconductor devices. 
Second, at a time when improvements in power, performance, area and cost are paramount, classic Moore's Law scaling is running out of gas.
Third, to address this, new approaches for semiconductor design and manufacturing are needed. In our view, the new industry playbook has 5 elements. New architectures, new devices in 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink feature geometries and new ways to connect chips together.
Fourth, to accelerate implementation of the new playbook, companies need to connect and work together differently by breaking down traditional silos. At Applied, we're aligning our strategy and investments around this vision of the future. 
For example, new types of memory, including MRAM, PCRAM and ReRAM are high potential technologies that can enable new architectures and provide significant PPAC benefits at the edge and in the cloud. But these 3D devices are also incredibly challenging to make at high volume and yield. In the case of MRAM, the device is based on a film stack of more than 30 thin layers, some of which are only 8 atoms high. Missing atoms or imperfections in materials have a significant impact on the performance and endurance of the device.
To help drive adoption of these advanced memories, we recently introduced one of the most sophisticated products we've ever created, combining many of our leadership technologies in one integrated system. This new system has 9 different wafer processing locations and each process chamber can deposit up to 5 different materials. The entire process flow takes place under ultra-high vacuum to keep impurities out, and we use cryogenics and heat to vary process temperatures by hundreds of degrees. All of this is critical to optimize material, structures and interfaces.
The system also includes unique onboard metrology that allows us to measure key properties of the materials to 1/100 of a nanometer as they are being created and modified. This next generation of equipment that we call Integrated Materials Solutions is one of the ways Applied is bringing to bear our broad technologies and capabilities to address our customers' most complex challenges.
Another area where Applied has unique technology and breadth is advanced packaging. Applied has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions to support customers' advanced packaging roadmaps and new heterogeneous integration approaches.
In the past quarter, we won an important process tool of record positions at leading customers, securing over 80% of the applications we competed for, including CVD, PVD, CMP, and etch where we have highly differentiated new products. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is also yielding results with our unit process tools that enable new 3D structures, the introduction of new materials and new ways to shrink. For example, we've been building on our strength in conductor etch for memory by winning new steps in both DRAM and NAND, as well as new positions for critical etch applications in foundry logic.
We're also finding new ways to deliver more value to customers through our service business. One example of this is using advanced metrology sensors, data science and simulation to speed up the transfer of new technologies from Applied's labs to customers' factories, and then reduce the time it takes to optimize yield, output and cost.
While growth in Applied Global Services is slightly below our prior expectations, we still anticipate our combined spares and service revenues being up this year, even as customers pull back on their capital spending and operating expenses.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Our view of 2019 is relatively unchanged. Thanks to the hard work of our employees across the company, we are delivering solid performance, even with the current weakness in memory and display demand.
During this industry down cycle, we are focused on driving R&D programs and building new capabilities that will move the needle for customers and Applied in the AI era. And we remain excited about our long-term opportunities as these powerful secular demand drivers start to take shape.
Now, Dan will provide his perspective on our results and outlook.",1210,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2019",2019-08-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3560.0,1810108.0,70868281.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied delivered solid financial results with revenue, margins and earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. Our semi-related business continues to feel stable. And while I'm still not ready to call the bottom of the cycle, I see positive leading indicators of future growth.
In memory, our customers reported significant output reductions during the quarter. They discussed inventory reductions in their end markets and demand elasticity across smartphones, PCs and servers.
In foundry logic, demand is strong, both in the leading nodes and in trailing geometries driven by IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor applications. We believe our markets will become significantly larger as powerful new demand drivers kick in. And we're positioning Applied to generate strong shareholder value by focusing on our 4 financial priorities: 
One, we are tightly managing our overall spending. While two, fully funding and expanding our product road map and customer technology engagements to fuel growth. Three, increasing the recurring revenue we earned by helping our customers maximize their returns from the installed base. And 4, delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders. 
For example, this quarter we held overall spending flat but increased the R&D portion of non-GAAP OpEx to 69%. This outcome demonstrates how we are controlling our discretionary spending, while fueling innovation and future growth.
We announced plans to acquire Kokusai Electric to expand our presence into batch technology and accelerate innovation for our customers. This will also strengthen our services and customer support capabilities in the memory markets and throughout Asia. And we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders, including while the Kokusai transaction is being reviewed.
During the quarter, we paid $0.21 per share in dividends, including the 5% increase our Board approved in March. And we used $528 million to repurchase over 12 million shares at an average price of around $42 per share.
Over the past year, we've repurchased 68 million shares at an average price below $39, and we have $2.4 billion remaining on our buyback authorization. In short, we're excited about our opportunities, and we're focused on taking actions that will generate significant shareholder value in the years ahead.
Now, I'll summarize our Q3 results. We delivered company revenue of $3.56 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin of 44%, both above the midpoint of our outlook. We held non-GAAP OpEx to $746 million, and generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.74, which was near the top end of our guidance range.
Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems revenue was $2.27 billion, which was above the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 27.5%.
Global services revenue was $931 million, which was below the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP operating margin declined to 27.8%. I'll take a moment to explain what we're seeing in AGS.
Last quarter, I explained that we have 2 kinds of service business, long-term agreements that give us subscription-like revenue and transactional parts and services. In Q3 and in our outlook for Q4, long-term service agreement revenue is growing right in line with our forecasts. But our transactional business is being impacted by the output reductions in memory. We still expect a record year for AGS, but we're lowering our growth target to low single-digits.
Revenue from our overall semi-installed base business, which includes parts and services, along with upgrades and refurbs, will grow even faster and set a new record. Moving to display, Q3 revenue and operating margin both declined slightly, as we expected.
Next, I'll provide our Q4 guidance. We expect company revenue to be approximately $3.685 billion, plus or minus $150 million, and we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80 per share. Within this outlook, we expect Semiconductor Systems revenue to be approximately $2.25 billion. Services revenue should be about $955 million. And display revenue should be around $455 million, which would be up 34% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 43.5%, and non-GAAP OpEx should be about $755 million.
Looking ahead to 2020, we continue to expect growth across our markets and a gradual U-shaped recovery. While we only guide one quarter at a time, I'll offer you some planning assumptions for the early part of fiscal 2020 to help with your models.
On a quarterly basis, we view $2.2 billion as a good baseline for Semiconductor Systems revenue until we see evidence of a recovery. We expect AGS revenue to be flat with our Q4 guidance, which is a bit better than seasonal. And we expect display to be about flat with our Q4 guidance, which demonstrates our expectation that we've passed to the bottom of the display cycle. Gross margin should remain approximately flat versus Q4 on the mix we foresee, and OpEx should increase to around $800 million as we layer in the annual merit increases, along with R&D for new products and the new technology initiatives Gary described. 
In short, we see structural growth in the years ahead, positive leading indicators for 2020 and the opportunity to drive strong shareholder value by investing in breakthrough innovations that Applied Materials is uniquely positioned to deliver.

And so, I guess, on that front, how are you thinking about that coming back in terms of both timing and magnitude? 
As well as, as we move from single stack to multi-stack and there's clearly clean room availability, how are you thinking about conversions versus new capacity as that comes online into 2020 and beyond?",75,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So when we think about the memory market, and you called out NAND specifically. But let me broaden the comments just a little bit more to encompass the entire memory market.
We don't expect to see a recovery in 2019. We see it as a 2020 event. And as you pointed out, we expect to see NAND first then followed by DRAM. If we think about where we sit today from an overall WFE standpoint, the memory markets are clearly down in 2019 versus where we were in 2020, so this is clearly a correction year. But we are seeing early signs of improvement. 
Output across the industry has come down. We are under-shipping true end-market demand from a supply standpoint as we exit the year. This is bringing our customers' inventories down. It's bringing our customers' customers' inventories down, and we do see the early signs of demand elasticity beginning to kick in and signs of price stability. When we net all of this together, we definitely see 2020 as a recovery year in the memory market. And again, we see it as a NAND-led event followed by DRAM.
In terms of magnitude, I think it's premature to be point specific on any individual market right now into 2020, but we like the setup of what we see. When we take a step back and we think about the long-term in these markets beyond 2020, we do see that there is a data explosion as the data economy kicks in and the value of that data is increasingly going up as companies learn how to monetize it. We see capital intensity going up. We see new forms of memories, which really plays to our strengths in materials. We see our customer base being rational and disciplined. We net all that together, we think there's a real opportunity to go structurally larger as a memory market, off of the levels we're currently seeing in the current environment. So we feel good about the long run.",354,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Maybe I can add something relative to our position in memory and also in NAND. I think many of you know that we have a much more balanced overall share across memory and foundry logic. In memory, we increased our share of total spending from less than 15% in 2013 to around 20% today, and we're confident we're going to continue to drive gains into the future. 
Another thing that's really positive for Applied is memory is very much driven by materials-enabled scaling. And I think everyone's aware, capital intensity has been increasing. We are also engaged with all the major memory companies with Integrated Materials Solutions. Again, it's all about new structures, new materials, how far, especially in NAND, you can scale vertically. So we have very strong pull from customers for new materials, new products, to enable their cost and performance roadmaps.
In NAND, specifically, we're winning new etch applications in NAND. And to get more layers in NAND, one of the most important things is new materials, especially high selectivity hardmasks where we have very strong capability. I talked last quarter about hardmasks that increased etch selectivity by 50%, and we are seeing strong adoption of those new capabilities across multiple customers with new steps that give us significant TAM growth. 
So again, we've been increasing our share in NAND. We have new materials and new products that make us very optimistic. We're going to continue to drive strong momentum into the future.",247,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Gary, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China from a technology progression perspective, both on the DRAM side as well as the NAND side. It continues to be a pretty big part of your business as well as your peers' businesses in the near term as well. So if you can talk about the rate of progress on the technology front as well as your expectations in terms of WFE for 2019 and preliminary thoughts on 2020. That will be helpful, and I've got a follow-up.",99,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We don't see any major inflection in spending. 2019, we see relatively flat versus 2018. If you look at domestic China, our view is a little stronger over the past few months with some increases in memory. For the year as a whole, we see slightly higher spending on foundry logic versus memory. With foundry logic focused on IoT, communications, sensors, those types of devices. 
In our -- in display business in China, we believe that's going to be down roughly in line with our global display forecast. Overall, in China, we have a great position, semi-service. We've been in China for 35 years. The display is a great team for us, very, very strong customer relationships and engagements. 
Relative to the technology progression, I don't really think, again, anything has changed from what we communicated before. As I said, we believe the foundry logic on the trailing nodes is where we will see over half of the domestic investment this year. We think that market is going to continue to grow. If you look at image sensors, that's going to be a very strong market. And we see the investment there as being rational and in line with the increase in demand for those types of products.
Memory is a -- those are very difficult technologies, and it's a long road to be able to produce those technologies at a competitive level for performance and cost. As we've communicated before, we don't see any big hockey sticks. I really don't see much different than what we saw before.

And as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about market share. If we take your October quarter guide for the Semiconductor Systems business and the guide from Dan into the January quarter, I guess, we get a calendar '19 segment revenue number that's slightly better than what you described for overall WFE. Is the slight market share gain implied in your guidance a function of your SAM acting a little bit better than prior years? Or are you actually picking up share within the markets that you serve?",89,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And I have really very strong confidence that we're in a great position to keep the momentum going into the future. 
If you look at the third-party data for overall spending, you'll see that we've been on a trend of higher or flat share, all the way back to 2012, except last year where the mix was very heavy in places like batch processing, dielectric etch, litho where we don't participate. So absolutely the mix is more favorable for us this year, so we are not going to make any specific predictions. But the set up for sure is much better for us this year. 
We're winning many head-to-heads and especially in applications. We have a very strong pipeline of new products, including products that expand our positions into the markets that we don't currently serve. Some of those products are already gaining traction with major customers. I spent a lot of my time with the customer and R&D leaders, that's what I love to do more than anything else. And in discussions with them, it's clear that they're struggling to deliver improvements in power, performance and cost. 
I think it's also clear, and this was evident at the AI Design Forum last month that the future's not going to look like the past. The classic 2D scaling isn't working. In all my interactions with R&D leaders, they talk about new materials, 3D structures, new ways to connect chips together, new ways to drive cost. And I really deeply believe, Applied is in the best position we've ever been in to enable this new playbook with the breadth of products we have to create, shape, modify and analyze new structures. Our combined capability is unique, enables us to deliver Integrated Materials Solutions. We talked last year about 1,000x improvement in leakage current. We talked this year about this amazing MRAM capability, and those are new ways to drive performance in power performance area and cost. 
And also, we're currently engaged with all major customers in memory and foundry logic with these new integrated material solutions. So that combination of new IMS solutions, our capability to enable the new playbook, new products, put us in a great position to accelerate roadmaps for customers and drive future growth for Applied.

I think I'll jump in and take this. So all we can bake into our forecast and the expectations we set into the market are the things we see, the conversations we have with our customers about expectations out into the future as well as the bottom modeling we do from an industry and end-market device standpoint, and the consumption of bits in those boxes as well as top-down economic modeling and forecasting. 
And as you can imagine, our forecast comes together, it's a triangulation of those events. But we've spent a lot of time talking to customers and based on all of the information that we have to date, our best view out into the future is for 2020 to be a recovery year in the memory market and for WFE to be up year-over-year. 
That said, in this environment, we are setting an expectation. And we think it's prudent to do this, setting an expectation for gradual U-shaped recovery. If the industry does better than we're currently contemplating, then we, as a company, will benefit in a very material way, and we like that setup. But when we net it all out, to us, it's a matter of when, not if. And in our view, it's a 2020 event for memory.",217,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And I guess, importantly, with trailing edge nodes staying stronger longer, what does that do for reuse at the foundries at leading-edge? Is that actually driving a bigger end spend because reuse is slowing down?",85,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Yes, I think, for sure, we see that this, especially market growth, is going to continue to increase for the future. If you think about -- people talk about a trillion connected devices and generating significant amounts of data, that's right smack dab in the middle of that type of market. And this is a really great growth opportunity for Applied. 
We have a great portfolio of products across 200- and 300-millimeter technology. If you look at foundry logic, again, maybe some people don't understand the dynamics, about 50% is growing in areas like IoT, communications, auto, power devices and sensors and innovation there is really driven by materials innovations. So again, those are areas where Applied has a significant strength. We've increased focus on these markets, and we have a great team of leaders across the company to work with customers to enable their roadmaps. I mean, I personally have visited a lot of these key customers over the last 2 or 3 months, tremendous pull for the technologies that we're developing. 
I'll give you one example of a situation that happened this last quarter. We won 2/3 of the revenue opportunities at a major customer in this specialty market where the selections are very sticky over many, many years. Once you're qualified, you're in for a long period of time. So again, that was a case where in terms of the spending, we were winning a huge percentage of those opportunities. And this is, again, all about materials, innovations and structures, and we have a lot of technologies currently that are unique for these particular markets. And we have an increased focus there in developing new technologies. 
Our culture is really focused on being the preferred strategic partner for all of our different customers, enabling their technology roadmaps, enabling their future for those different markets.

I do think we're seeing a different pattern evolve in the industry. When I walked in the front door a couple of years ago, I think we had a point of view on what the total capacity footprint in 28 nanometers was for the industry, and that has gone up significantly in the last couple of years. 
We're looking at mature nodes. And the way the industry used to work, as you know, you'd introduce a new node, you'd have a big investment cycle to put the capacity statement in place. And then, you'd see the investment level falloff on that node. And then, our customers would opportunistically look to reuse equipment as they build out the next node. 
I think what we're seeing is investment profiles, many years after the introduction of the node, being much larger than we've seen historically and I do think that, that's going to impact the rate of reuse as these more mature nodes continue to grow in size relative to our original expectations. So we really like the way the industry is broadening and diversifying, and the implications that has long term on the attractiveness of this market for us.",225,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So this is a company we're very focused on increasing operating margin percentage over time. I think what you saw in the most recent quarter is a very disciplined approach to the OpEx. We're compressing discretionary spend, and we're channeling more of our OpEx towards the R&D engine, things that are going to fuel growth at the company over time. And so 69% is a record high for the company, and we feel good about that discipline. 
What you see profiling into Q1 is the annual merit increase that we get every year, but it's also a statement around the opportunities we see. Moore's Law is hitting a wall. Gary has talked about a new playbook that is going to increasingly define the power performance roadmap of this industry that creates an enormous set of opportunities for us. We are going to invest in R&D. We are going to drive growth and drive leadership into this industry over the next decade as it fundamentally inflects and drives the power performance roadmap in a very different way than we've seen historically. 
The way -- from where we sit today, we expect our semi business to be up year-over-year. We expect our services business to be up off of these levels year-over-year, and we expect our display business to also grow into next year. And as the industry recovers, and we take our company structurally larger, I think you're going to see the operating margins expand as we grow the company and the investments that we're making today to drive that future leadership should allow us to outperform as that industry recovers.",295,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Absolutely. Yes. So let me give color on the display business and this gets at your question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we still see display down about 1/3 versus 2019. We don't guide display fab equipment, but this is basically what customers are telling us about next year. 
We see 2020 for Applied being higher than 2019. We also expect TV investment to be roughly flat next year. Many of these are Gen 10.5, there are long lead times, and so we have pretty good visibility into that part of the market. And we do expect mobile OLED to increase as a percentage of the overall market next year. So we do see the overall display business being up next year. Longer term, we believe the market is still going to be cyclical. But we continue to be optimistic about the market based on trends, including TV size and build-out of Gen 10.5 that's going to take many years, the mobile OLED conversion and eventually innovations like RGB OLED TV, foldable smartphone, all of those different areas.
For Applied, the adoption of OLED, I think many of you know, is also more capital-intensive. So as those technologies are adopted in more types of devices, that's good for us from a capital intensity standpoint. 
We're also investing to drive new products to expand into very large TAM growth areas.  We're not to give any more color today about those specific products. But again, the pull from customers is still very strong, and we're making progress in those areas. 
Together, take all this together, we see good opportunities to drive growth in our display business into 2020 and beyond.",281,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And then maybe as a follow-up to one of the prior questions. On your new MRAM and storage-class memory PVD platforms, just given the increase in content and microcontrollers, in IoT industrial and automotive applications and a growing need for higher embedded memory density for MCU, seems like there's just as much opportunity on legacy semi MCU processes as there is for high-performance storage class memory architectures. Has the team tried to size the SAM opportunity here for your 2 new platforms, sort of looking out over the next 2 to 3 years?",94,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

So we think this market is going to start small. It's around $100 million for us so far. But as you mentioned, it's very strategic in future custom applications. We see this type of device moving from NOR flash replacement to bigger applications like L3 cache replacements, especially DRAM replacement. Again it's not something that's going to ramp overnight, but we do see incremental growth in the market. 
And then, I think for us, when I was at Semicon and AIDF, this was one of the things for me, personally, I was most excited to talk about. Because when you think about these new devices, I think many of you know, it takes many, many, many years to go from a single structure that you publish a paper with certain kinds of performance to making billions of those devices at the right cost, high yield, speed, power, endurance, all of those things. 
And so talking about the system that we had at Semicon, you have all this amazing technology into 1 Integrated Materials Solution and ultra-high vacuum. You have a structure that's like an atomic layer 3D printer almost, where you're -- you have a structure with more than 30 layers, some only 8 atoms high, 10 different materials, temperatures on the wafer that range about 500 degrees C. And the ability to measure the key properties of the materials as they are being created to 1/100 of a nanometer.
And all of this, all of this is really critical to optimize the material structures and interfaces. So again, certainly, the better you can drive the performance, yield, reliability, the more applications you can win and the faster the market ramps. And so what we're excited about, and certainly, the companies that we're working with, they're very excited about, is being able to scale a technology like this into high-volume, high yield and right cost and right performance. 
So again, we see this market as small today but certainly, relative to future compute architectures, it is very, very, very important.",345,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I don't know if, Gary, you want to take it or, Dan, you want to take it. But if I look at July, service was like $60 million light in July. And then October, you have been saying kind of like high single digit for the year. So that would imply that the October number is like coming in at about $150 million light of what you thought it would be. So that's like a $200-million number over a 6-month period. And so that's like 10% of the entire AGS segment revenue. 
But I think you had also said previously that the spares and service portion of AGS is like half of the revenue. So really, it's like 20% of the spares and service portion. So I get the memory production cuts, but that's a huge number for a business, but I think people consider it to be quite stable. And I think your peers are sort of seeing a little bit better trend there. So I'm wondering if you can talk about that.",180,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

If we take a look at our services business, this is a business that the team has really tuned the strategy. We've got a great strategy. Strong execution over the last, call it, 4 years. It's a business we've grown at a compound rate of about 15%. Last year, we grew it at over 20%. This year, expectation coming into the year was high-single digits. As we look at underlying components of the business, there's an element of the business that's long-term service agreements that's more subscription-like in its revenue. As we look at performance of that business in Q3 and Q4, it's profiling exactly like we thought. And so a mid-teens grower into Q3 and Q4.
When we look at the other part of the business, the other half of the business being more transactional, spares and service-related, that has a connection to industry utilization and factory outputs. Clearly, we saw a falloff in Q3 and Q4, as the memory industry has structurally brought down its factory output to work through the induced -- inventory correction. We initially thought this was going to be of flattish business for the year. It now looks like it's down low double digits for the year. The combination of the mid-teens grower and down low double digits gets you a low single-digit grower as an overall business, if we were to classify our business similar to others in the industry. In addition to growing low single-digits, added our 300-millimeter refurbs and upgrades to the business. This is an all-time record year for us, and it's something that's growing quite a bit stronger than the segment reported services business. 
So I wouldn't necessarily look at our absolute performance or relative performance and think that there's something deficient in the way the business is profiling. We think we've got a great business, the team is executing well. And as industry utilization recovers into next year, should provide a nice leg of growth to the business going forward.",355,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

As Dan talked about, certainly, there's been a reduction in wafer starts. And you also mentioned this in the question with memory customers, so that's impacting the spares parts business. 
But one thing that's been a major change in our strategy, starting in 2013, was to drive more subscription-type revenue with customers. And that's been very successful. If you go back to '13, we had net 0 adds in terms of -- and service contracts. Since then, that part of the business has been growing very, very fast, Dan talked about even in this year with WFE down a fair amount, that part of our business is still growing at a very high rate and that subscription revenue from longer-term agreements is now larger than our transactional spares and service business. And that's really because we continue to see strong pull from customers, accelerating R&D, accelerating fab ramps, optimizing yield output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. 
We also have a very strong strategy in data analytics. We have over thousands of tools connected in customers' fabs. That's creating value for customers today and that creates a great opportunity for us to continue to drive that data-enabled strategy to create value for customers and also to drive growth for Applied.
Just one more data point, if you look at our spares and service business. And again, this is separating out upgrades, refurbishments and other things that are counted by some people, if you look at just our subscription revenue and our spare parts business, transactional business, that business has grown 27% over the last 2 years with wafer fab equipment being flat. So that shows that even in a case where wafer fab equipment is not growing, that service business is growing. So we're very optimistic that we're going to drive this business at a high rate going forward at Applied, and also create more value for our customers.",331,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

I've said this in the past over the last few years also, haven't seen a big hockey stick. I think that the spending certainly in foundry logic is rational around IoT sensors, communications all of those kinds of devices. That's a little over 1/2 of the domestic spending this year. And certainly, we believe that there will be some incremental spending but we're not going to give any color on the call today relative to forecasting 2020 for China.",121,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

Dan, given that the semi business is stabilizing at these revenue levels, but the mix is shifting more towards foundry logic versus memory, I would have thought your gross margin performance had been better. Can you give us how to eliminate some of that and what's going on the gross margin side? 
And then as a follow-up, I'll ask it right away. You guys gave some color on FY '20 display revenues relative to 2019. Given the deal was almost 9 months late on visibility, how should we think of FY '20 just relative to FY '18, where you did about $2.5 billion?",108,-2.0,5.0,0.3888888888888889,0.5

Let's take them in order. First, on the gross margin and the foundry logic showing signs of strength. Let me start by saying this is a company that's laser-focused on driving gross margins up over time. And if we were talking about the business mix from maybe a few years ago, I think maybe we'd be seeing incrementally higher gross margins. 
But let me help you a little bit with some of the mix factors that we see going into gross margin, given who we are today. So as we take a look at our services in display business and growing it as a part of our portfolio, we know that those 2 businesses, and we've done a great job growing them, those 2 businesses have a gross margin that's lower than the corporate average. But we expect each of those businesses -- and we expect each of those businesses to be up as we look into 2020.
And then within our semi portfolio, our leadership businesses are doing really, really well, but the profile of our semi business is changing as we grow. And there's a couple of things I would point to. 
First, our etch footprint. These are gross margins, products with gross margins that are not as high as maybe other parts of the portfolio, but we're doing a great job driving that business. We're expanding that business into new opportunities and beyond memory into foundry logic. And that certainly changes the profile of our business as we grow forward. 
Second thing I'd point to, and we talked about it on this call, is foundry logic spend diversifying. There was a time a decade ago when it was 90% on the leading-edge, and then it evolved to 80-20, 60-40%. And now for, the last 3 years, '17, '18 and '19, it's fully split 50-50 between leading-edge technologies and trailing node geometries. And where we compete in the trailing node geometries with differentiated equipment and our key enablers of some of the technologies and products that are being brought to market, that's super attractive business for us. But there's also opportunities in that market where we compete with 300-millimeter refurbs, 200-millimeter systems. And while those products offer really attractive operating margins and cash flow, the gross margins might be a little bit lower than we see in some of the other businesses we pursue. 
So we're going to continue to stay focused. We're going to continue to drive gross margin over time, particularly as we see the industry recover. We drive revenue higher from this point going forward. We do think we're going to be able to grow the semi business into next year, grow the AGS business into next year and the display business. So we're going to stay focused on execution, and we feel good about how the business is profiling.

I just think it's prudent in an environment that's characterized like the one we're in to set expectations in a modest way. We have conversations with customers. If I would give a direct read through on those conversations, I think you would see expectations set at a different level. But again, and come back to environment like this, I just don't think that's a prudent place to be.
So we want to set expectations in a more modest way. We're setting expectations for gradual and U-shaped off these levels. Certainly, if the industry recovers faster than where we're setting the expectations given our broad portfolio and how we're positioned in all of the markets, this is a company that's going to benefit in a very material way if that happens. So we feel good about the position, we feel good about finding stability in the business and we do think it's just a matter of when, not if.

And as a quick follow-up. On the market share side, I know last year, you guys were down 2 point -- but you're starting to recover that in recent quarters.

As we've communicated before, last year, EUV was a headwind. 
As we look forward, you have to look at different segments. EUV has a very small impact on memory. When memory recovers, that's going to be very positive for Applied relative to the TAM opportunity. Memory is really about materials enabled scaling, and we have gained share in memory, very deep engagements with our customers and good opportunities to continue to drive share gains. 
In NAND, we have a great opportunity to enable 3D scaling. I talked about new hardmasks. Our etch position continues to grow. And DRAM, they're adding metal gate in the periphery, and this is where we have high share as those processes are adopted. I talked earlier about IoT communications, sensors. That's an area where I talked about we won 2/3 of the TAM opportunity here recently with a customer, and that's about 50% of the foundry logic spending. So we have momentum in all of these different areas. 
And then other thing I would say is that we've talked about this new playbook. New architectures, new materials, new structures, new ways to connect things together and new ways to shrink. We really have new technologies and new products in many of those different areas. And so I've given color today on the call about many of those different opportunities, and that's also why we're investing more going forward. We have a very strong point of view. 
The market, driven by AI, big data is going to be strong in the future. We believe that the new playbook, with new structures, new materials, new ways to connect devices, all of those areas are areas where Applied has unique technologies, unique capabilities. We have products that, some of which are already seeing adoption with customers where we have traction, we're going to invest in those areas.

First, I'm encouraged. I'm encouraged by the stability we're seeing in our business. I'm encouraged by the positive leading indicators that we're seeing in memory. But I'm still not ready to call the bottom, especially given the macro risks that we need to keep an eye on. 
At the same time, we've been in this industry a very long time, and long enough to know that something new and big is happening in computing, and it's happening just as Moore's Law is slowing down.

I'm pleased to report our results for the quarter were at the top end of guidance driven by a healthy uptick in demand for semiconductor equipment combined with strong execution across the company. This rounds out a solid year of performance in a challenging environment as we navigated down cycles in both memory and display. These results would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of Applied Materials employees around the world. I would like to thank them for the passion they bring to work every day and congratulate them on their accomplishments this year.
As this is our year-end call, I'll begin with a brief recap of the past 12 months before providing our perspective on the current market environment. I'll then talk about the broader context for the industry, including the major growth drivers and inflections that will shape our markets over the next several years. I'll conclude by summarizing the key elements of our strategy and outlining the investments we're making to put Applied in the best position for the tremendous opportunities ahead.
Applied's fiscal 2019 was shaped by the first significant pullback in customer investments since 2013. However, this provides a good illustration of how the semiconductor industry is evolving. As I have highlighted before, the market for semi equipment and services is now significantly larger and less volatile than it was in the past.
If the second calendar quarter of 2019 proves to be the low point of this spending cycle, then the downturn lasted 4 quarters and our quarterly revenue at the trough was approximately 20% lower than at the peak. In contrast, during the industry cycles that took place between 2000 and 2013, our average peak-to-trough revenue drop was more than twice that magnitude.
This cycle was different, in large part, due to the growth and diversification of demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise end markets. It's also important to note that the fundamental dynamics of the memory market are healthier through this cycle. The memory makers are highly focused, making disciplined investments in capacity and continuing to drive their technology road maps forward. As well as a more robust core market, Applied is a more resilient company that's balanced across different areas of the market and can perform well in a variety of conditions. Thanks to the breadth of our portfolio, our semi equipment business is outperforming both the wafer fab equipment market and our direct peers this year.
Fiscal 2019 was also a record year for Applied Global Services. In fact, we're growing our services revenue significantly faster than the underlying equipment businesses. Over the past 12 months, we've grown our installed base of semi and display equipment by about 2,000 systems to almost 43,000. We have also increased the number of installed base tools covered by long-term service agreement, which generate subscription-style revenues by around 30% since 2017. Overall, 45% of our FY '19 revenues came from sources other than new 300-millimeter equipment sales. This is up from 41% just 2 years ago.
In terms of our near-term outlook, while I don't want to speculate about the exact shape or timing of the market recovery, I can characterize what we currently see with 3 observations. First, strong investment by foundry/logic customers driven by demand in key geographies, an acceleration of the 5G road map and commitment to advance the leading edge. Second, early signs of a recovery in NAND investments. And third, positive progression of the ongoing inventory correction in DRAM.
Because of the strength seen in recent months, we're revising our estimates for 2019 wafer fab equipment upwards. We now believe 2019 spending levels could be similar to 2017. Based on the visibility we have today, we're optimistic about 2020, with an expectation of sustained strength in foundry/logic and a step-up in memory investments during the year with NAND recovering ahead of DRAM.
In display, as anticipated, FY '19 revenues were down 1/3 relative to FY '18. At this point, we expect FY '20 revenues to be at similar levels as we bounce along the bottom of this market cycle. In this environment, our display business remains profitable, even as we fund R&D for next-generation products. We still believe the display market provides good long-term growth opportunities for Applied as the industry becomes increasingly technology intensive. We remain focused on working closely with customers to drive their technology road maps forward and ensuring we have the right portfolio of products in place to outperform the market when investment levels pick up.
Looking beyond the cycle, at the broader context for the electronics industry, it's important to recognize that we are in a period of transition as major new growth drivers emerge in the form of IoT, big data and artificial intelligence. Over the next decade, we expect hundreds of billions of edge devices to be deployed, an explosion of data generation and new approaches to computing to sustainably process and create value from all the data that's available. AI and big data have the potential to transform every area of the economy and our lives. These inflections will also have a profound impact on the semiconductor industry. As we move from the age of general-purpose computing to demand-specific approaches, new system architectures and new types of semiconductor devices are needed in the data center and at the edge.
A major factor in the adoption rate of AI will be how quickly we can realize improvements in the power, performance, area and cost or PPAC of the foundational semiconductor technologies. However, at a time when PPAC improvements are on the critical path, classic Moore's Law scaling is slowing. To drive the PPAC road map in the future, a new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing is needed. This playbook has 5 main elements, new architectures, new devices and 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink feature geometries and new ways to connect chips together. Then to accelerate implementation of this new playbook, I strongly believe the ecosystem needs to work together differently by breaking down traditional industry silos.
At Applied, we've aligned our strategy and investments around this vision of the future. While we are carefully managing all non-R&D spending, we're investing more than ever in new capabilities and products to accelerate the new playbook. We recently announced the official opening of our META Center in New York. This state-of-the-art facility enables us to work with customers and partners in new ways, accelerating the transfer of novel technologies from lab to fab.
I'm equally excited about how our future product pipeline is shaping up. In addition to our traditional unit process equipment, which spans deposition, removal, modification and analysis of materials, we're developing entirely new categories of products that we call Integrated Materials Solutions. The applications for these IMS products include: co-optimization of deposition, removal and analysis, all the way to creating, shaping, modifying and analyzing new structures and devices. We'll share more details as we bring new products to market in 2020 and 2021. For the time being, let me highlight a few examples of how we are defending our leadership positions, winning new applications and expanding our available market in the near term.
In DRAM, customers are introducing advanced transistors and interconnects to improve performance and low power. These technologies where Applied has long held leadership were originally developed for logic applications and are now migrating to memory. Growing demand for specialty nodes that serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets is also driving robust investments in capacity and new technology. PPAC improvements are equally important for these applications, and we're finding new ways to migrate our leading-edge technologies into these specialty markets.
Advanced patterning is a critical enabler for shrinking feature geometries which translates to a large, growing opportunity in foundry/logic and DRAM. The patterning road map is increasingly enabled by new materials as well as co-optimization of materials deposition and removal. As a result, we are expanding our positions in memory and winning new applications at foundry/logic customers.
And in markets where we have plenty of room to grow, we're also building momentum. In optical wafer inspection, we're winning new positions at foundry/logic customers. And in etch, we have recently won multiple critical applications in NAND as well as in foundry/logic, where we delivered record etch revenues for the year.
Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. First, we're seeing a strong finish to 2019 driven by a healthy uptick in foundry/logic spending. Although it's still too early to call the shape and timing of the recovery in memory, we're encouraged by the signs we're seeing.
Second, we have a strong, positive point of view about the opportunities the AI, big data era will create for the industry and Applied. While we're tightly controlling non-R&D-related spending, we are investing more than ever in new products and capabilities that put us in winning positions for the future.
Third, the technical collaboration between Applied and our customers has never been stronger. And we're working with a broader set of customers and partners to accelerate the time to market for new, game-changing technologies.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dan.",1535,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2019",2019-11-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3465.0,1878063.0,73529574.0,Presenter Speech,Daniel Durn,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary.
Applied delivered another solid quarter in Q4, with revenue, margins and earnings in the upper end of our guidance range. I like the way we ended our fiscal year, and I particularly like the way we're set up for the year ahead. On today's call, I'll summarize our fiscal 2019, give you my sense of the business entering fiscal 2020 and share our outlook for Q1.
In 2019, our end markets were softer across semi, display and the transactional portion of our services business. Despite that, we delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, and our quarterly revenue and earnings were stable, which demonstrates the resilience of our broad portfolio, even in a memory correction year. In fact, we earned significantly more in every quarter in fiscal 2019 than we did in all of fiscal 2013, which is the most recent year that included a significant equipment correction.
I also like our relative performance. In calendar 2019, we expect to significantly outperform our core market and our most direct peers. Specifically, while the equipment market will be down by mid-teen percentage, we expect semi equipment plus AGS to be down in the mid-single digits year-over-year.
Looking ahead to 2020 and beyond, we have high confidence in the future growth of our markets and the unique opportunities Applied has to enable our customers' road maps. As a result, we invested a record amount in R&D this year while reducing our spending in SG&A. We delivered over $3 in non-GAAP earnings per share and generated nearly $3.25 billion of cash from operations. Our capital return strategy is to fully fund our profitable growth opportunities, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver attractive cash returns to our shareholders through dividends and dividend growth, along with opportunistic share buyback.
In 2019, we returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders, equivalent to 113% of free cash flow. We returned nearly $800 million in dividends, raised the dividend by 5% and took advantage of market volatility to repurchase 60 million shares of our stock at an average price of $39.86. As a reminder, we're working to complete the acquisition of Kokusai Electric. Upon close, we plan to direct most of our free cash flow towards repaying the term loan we're using to help fund the transaction.
Now I'll share my thoughts on the business environment. On our previous earnings call, I talked about positive leading indicators of future growth. These included inventory reductions across memory, demand elasticity in NAND and strong foundry/logic demand, both in leading edge and specialty nodes. Today, I feel more positive.
In semi, we have strong pull for our leadership products, including record demand for epitaxy and metal deposition. We're also winning many new applications for our high-growth semi products in dielectric deposition, etch and inspection. We are significantly outgrowing our markets in foundry/logic with growing strength at the leading-edge nodes and key wins in automotive and advanced packaging. While it's always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it's a matter of when, not if, and we expect NAND to lead the way.
In AGS, revenue was stronger than we expected in Q4, and we still expect better-than-seasonal revenue in Q1. The subscription-like portion of AGS has momentum and will benefit from the thousands of new systems we added to our installed base in 2019. The transactional portion of the business should strengthen as memory utilization recovers in 2020.
Rolling it all up, we're entering the new fiscal year with a backlog of $6.5 billion, which is our highest year-end backlog ever.
Next, I'll provide our Q1 guidance. We expect company revenue of $4.10 billion, plus or minus $150 million, which would be up by about 9% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.95 per share. Within this outlook, we expect Semiconductor Systems revenue to be approximately $2.775 billion. Services revenue should be about $975 million. And Display revenue should be around $330 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 44.6% and non-GAAP OpEx should be around $800 million.
In summary, I like the setup for Applied as we enter fiscal 2020. Our thesis surrounding IoT, big data and AI is being validated throughout the ecosystem, and our business outlook is transitioning from positive leading indicators to growing demand.
The investments we're making in the new playbook are strengthening our product portfolio and driving new design wins that will serve us exceptionally well as the new nodes ramp across foundry/logic, NAND and DRAM.
Our opportunities in the specialty nodes are also expanding. Our Services business delivered a record year in 2019 and is on track for solid year-over-year growth in 2020.
Finally, we look forward to closing the acquisition of Kokusai Electric and welcoming its talented team to Applied Materials.

Thanks, C.J. So what we're seeing in memory is customers continuing to drive technology road maps this year even as they're cutting the capacity additions to help with supply and demand. We really like the setup for Applied when memory spending recovers, which we think is in 2020 led by NAND.
So if we look at the different types of devices. In DRAM, customers are moving to more advanced metal gate transistors in the periphery, and this is going to drive more demand like we saw in 28-nanometer foundry. So that's really positive for us in leadership areas like epi, PVD, implant, thermal. Also, we're gaining share in etch. We're also enabling new DRAM capacitor module capabilities and new patterning technologies that create large, new opportunities for Applied, where we're reducing the number of steps for multi-patterning and also improving pattern placement. So DRAM, especially with the more logic-like types of steps, really plays to our leadership positions. And so as those nodes go forward, we're in a good position in DRAM.
In 3D NAND, as customers are scaling beyond 96 layers, we're winning new applications with etch in NAND. And as you go to more layers, you need new materials, especially high-selectivity hardmasks were designed in to many of the next nodes as they ramp into high-volume manufacturing.
We also have momentum with Integrated Materials Solutions. One example is in NAND where we do co-optimization of new hardmask films with the Sym3 etch. The co-optimization increases etch selectivity by about 50%. And we're seeing new dep and etch wins across multiple customers as we enable much better high aspect ratio patterning. So there's strong pull across all the NAND customers for new materials, new products, Integrated Materials Solutions. We're seeing both in NAND and in DRAM. So we're optimistic. We're going to continue to drive strong growth as customers scale to future nodes.",315,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Thanks, C.J. This is Dan. I'll jump in and take that. So the services business is a great growth driver for us. It's been a steady source of revenue growth, cash flow generation. I would say, over the last handful of years, this is a business that's grown at a compound rate of about 15% per year. In the current downturn, current year, memory-driven downturn, utilization is falling. The business is a low single-digit grower. When you include things like refurbs and upgrades, you're a mid-single-digit grower. So good performance in a very difficult market that's down about mid-teens.
As we think about the performance of the business that drives those results, the long-term service agreement portion of the business this year was up mid-teens. It's really the transactional portion of our services business that's fallen with industry utilization and has been a headwind to growth this year. And that's in the sort of down 10%, 11%.
And as we profile into 2020, we really like the setup around our services business going forward. We think we can continue to execute on the long-term service agreements and continue to drive that performance at the levels we've seen historically. And when industry utilization recovers in memory, we would expect our transactional business to transition from a headwind of growth to a growth adder for us in 2020. So we really like the setup and the execution of the team in this environment. We think it sets us up well for 2020.",251,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So as we go to the display market and we think about how 2019 played out, it played out exactly as we expected. We said down about 1/3 year-over-year and that's where we ended up.
Forecast expectations were set probably 3, 6 months ago. Embedded in that was incremental growth off of these levels. And what really drove that incremental growth is, as we said, solid performance of the TV market into next year and the handset market would recover creating incremental growth for the company. We think the handset market is going to play out exactly as expected. We're going to see recovery in the handset market.
What's happened in the interim in the TV side is, is we've seen several news headlines from some of our customers about delayed investments. There's a bit of inventory build on the TV side. Third-party research firm has come out and confirmed what we've been reading about in the headlines. And our customer conversations also confirm this dynamic. And so as we look forward into 2020, we think there's going to be some incremental softness on the TV side that reflects all of the news that's out in the market to date. We expect the handset to recover as we originally expected. And that gets us a flattish profile, similar revenue levels, to what we're seeing this year. That's the best way I would describe it.
And then from an OpEx perspective, I think we're going to take this one quarter at a time. We came up to $800 million. We all know that profiling into Q2 there's the full impact of merit. And we don't get the benefit of the shutdown over the holiday season. And so maybe that goes up incrementally to $820 million to reflect that dynamic. That gives you a sense of where we level out on those typical seasonal aspects of transitioning from Q1 to Q2 and then we probably hover in that neighborhood for the rest of the year.",343,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Toshiya, I guess, I can also add a little bit of color. I think relative to the different areas where we compete today, definitely, we're driving innovations and unit processes around deposition, removal, modification and analysis. We have momentum with some new products and we have some major new products in the pipeline that we're driving.
But beyond that, as we've talked about before, you've got AI, big data, a need for 1,000x improvement in performance per watt and classic Moore's Law 2D scaling not being enough really to meet those needs for performance per watt. So we're not only driving unit processes. One thing that we've also been driving are the Integrated Materials Solutions. We're co-optimizing steps and even integrating multiple steps in a single system under high vacuum.
And we have really strong pull from customers, again, not just for unit processes where, again, I want to emphasize, we're driving very hard with some big, new products in the pipeline. Some we already see some adoption, early momentum. But beyond that, it's really how do we enable not just materials or removal, how do we create structures, shape structures, modify and analyze structures. And I spend a lot of my time with R&D leaders across our customer base, tremendously strong pull for improvements in power and performance.

Thanks, Toshiya. I'll jump in on the first part, transition to Gary on the second part. For Kokusai, there's no change in the timing of the transaction.

So thanks, Krish. From a WFE standpoint, we don't want to get into guides around next year. But what I would say is, since Gary has come into the company, we've become very balanced as a company in terms of our penetration of device types. This is a very balanced company. I think we're seeing the benefits of that in this environment as we inflect from one device type to another. And I think it serves the company well. In a time of uncertainty, the company has worked hard, made a lot of investments to create that very balanced portfolio by device type. And so without being specific, I would just leave you with that contextual thought that we're fairly agnostic to how these device types flash in one quarter or another. And I think that gives you some parameters on how to think about things.
From a guidance standpoint, we don't guide by device type. But the thing I would highlight is, next quarter will be a record quarter for us in foundry/logic based on the guidance that we've given, but we typically don't guide by device type.",190,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Yes. Thanks for the question. Our view on China is pretty similar to what we've communicated before. The domestic China market is incrementally stronger than our view at the beginning of the year, within the range of what we had expected, but incrementally stronger. And we now anticipate domestic China will be up from last year to around $6.5 billion.
Longer term, I've been in many meetings and conferences over the last several years, and my message is the same today as it's been over the last several years. We still expect steady growth in China. So we think next year will be another year of investments. But we don't see hockey sticks. Again, what we do is we look at leading indicators for all of the different projects, either domestic or international.
And again, our view is, again, very, very similar to what I've talked about in the past. We think there's going to be steady growth. We're positive about the market. We're positive about our position in the market. Our share continues to be healthy and accretive to our overall global market share.

Then as my follow-up, Gary. Just going back to your comments about foundry/logic looking sustainable going into calendar year '20. I guess just given the recent CapEx raise from TSMC and sort of the implied run rate from calendar fourth quarter, I guess there's a lot of concern in the investment community that perhaps from Q4 run rate levels things will have to come down as you go into 2020. I'd like to hear your view on that. And if foundry weakens in the back half of next year just because it's so strong now, do you think logic sort of picks up the slack? Is your comment about sustainability a full year figure comment or kind of a current run rate level comment?",127,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

Thanks, John. Let me jump in on that and give you my perspective. So what we see in the foundry/logic right now, I would consider and characterize as demand-led. We had a solid Q4 in the foundry/logic market. Implicit in the guide for Q1 is a record foundry/logic quarter for this company. We ended the year with backlog at record levels. So the foundry/logic view, we see follow through into next year, and it's not a one quarter phenomenon.
There's strong pull from customers for the tools. It's multiple customers and multiple nodes, which gives us a sense of comfort. We take a look at the foundry market and one foundry customer well into the ramp of N7, volume production at N7 plus, N5 in risk production, volume production in the first half of 2020 and N6 risk production in the first half of '20, volume production in the second half of 2020. You could make other similar comments about leading-edge technology nodes ramping at other foundry/logic customers exposed to the leading edge, so multiple customers, multiple nodes.
In addition to seeing strength on the leading edge, continue to see strength on trailing node geometries and specialty nodes. That continues. And while we don't have perfect visibility for the full year, we're very positive on the foundry/logic market over the long run. We are layering in the next wave of compute in the semiconductor industry to complement what is already there in the form of PC demand and mobile compute demand. We've got new architectures hitting data centers, lots of new tapeouts. Cloud demand is recovering, 5G beginning to kick in. We see a proliferation of intelligent edge devices and auto is growing.
And so as we take a step back, we see the strength continuing into next year. We're really positive about the long run. But as I provide a little more context on 2020, the company is performing well. We talked about the backlog entering the year. We talked about strength in foundry/logic. We talked about AGS setup and looks good as we profile into next year. Swing factor next year for us is timing of the memory recovery. For us, it's a matter of when, not if. And so it's really tough to determine the timing and magnitude of that. And we'll stay close to the market, stay close to our customers. And as new information becomes available, we'll try to be as open and transparent as we can be to help the investors.",418,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We talked about the transactional nature of the business, transactional spares, last quarter being a bit of a temporary dynamic with a limited number of customers. And this is us just getting back to a more normalized environment. Clearly, customers are seeing the strength we're beginning to flash in foundry/logic. I think we're seeing some early signs around the setup for memory as we go forward led by NAND than DRAM. And it's hard to really parse against that contextual backdrop exactly what's in customers' minds when they drive the transactional part of the business.

Certainly, the agreements, as Dan said, were up to maybe close to 60% of spares and service with agreements where we have higher revenue per tool. But the big incremental driver will be when memory comes back and utilization goes up in those memory factories. And certainly, as Dan said earlier, we expect that to happen in NAND first.

Thanks for the question. So I talked earlier about co-optimizing hardmask materials with etch to improve etch selectivity. Now that's certainly for the high aspect ratio patterning incredibly important. We have other cases where we're working with customers on patterning, where we're reducing -- I mentioned that earlier, we're reducing the cost of multiple patterning. In some cases, we're able to reduce the cost 30% and also enable better pattern placement. So for memory, especially in NAND, those are some of the areas we're driving.
Another area is in the performance with the periphery going to more logic-like structures, especially higher speed memory devices. That's an area that plays to our leadership products. And certainly, we see tremendous traction from customers in those areas. I think longer term, it's about how do you optimize new structures, creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing new structures. We have a lot that we're doing today in co-optimization of those capabilities. A tremendous amount in the pipeline where we have very strong customer pull.",169,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Is there a way you could give us some sense of how your exposure is going to change on 2 specific nodes? So the ones I have in mind are the TSMC nodes, when TSMC moves from 7-nanometer to 7-plus. So some kind of critical dimensions, but more EUV insertion. And at Intel, between the 10-nanometer node and the 7-nanometer node, same thing, a lot of additional EUV layers. I understand you guys remain very well exposed to this new EUV heavy nodes, but I imagine that when you move from multiple patterning to EUV, the type of business you get is different. So could you describe that for us, please?",134,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Thanks, Pierre. So it's important to remember that when customers are scaling, I would say the first thing is that they're driving 5 different areas where shrinking is 1 of those 5 different areas. We talked about new architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together and the shrink. So again, we have tremendously unique technologies enabling that new playbook. And I'm with one of the R&D leaders for one of our customers next week. I'm with another one the following week. Again, constantly, we're getting tremendous pull in driving power and performance because it's very, very, very difficult. So the first thing I would say is that, we have unique capabilities in enabling the new playbook. That's where we're investing. That's where we have tremendous engagements with customers.
So then if you think about shrinking, I talked earlier on the call about where we're working with customers on multiple patterning. And there are cases where we're able to reduce the number of steps by 30% and increase pattern placement. So that's another area we're doing co-optimization. And it's also important to remember that as you're scaling and EUV layers come in, some other steps also need to shrink and multi-patterning is still growing. So with Applied, the EUV steps that are coming in to replace other steps are not our steps. So Applied has opportunities and we are winning when EUV is being adopted in some of those replacement steps. There's this focus on multi-patterning where we're focused on reducing steps, reducing costs.
I think another, Pierre, another really good example is in 2019 in foundry/logic we have very strong momentum with our Sym3 etcher. And this is where you're seeing the highest EUV adoption. We're seeing very high growth in 2019 with wins across many customers. And we definitely see significant growth much faster than the market with our Sym3 etch business in leading foundry customers. And we anticipate based on the wins that we have, we're going to continue to grow at 5 and 3 as these new technologies are being adopted.
Just another data point with Sym3. That's the fastest-ramping product in the history of Applied. We just shipped our 4,000th chamber and many of them going into foundry and logic. So that's kind of a top-level view. I would say, again, the key thing for all of these customers is how do they drive the technology road map for power and performance. 2D scaling is slowing down. They need new ways to drive the road map, and that's really the sweet spot for Applied Materials.",434,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks for the question, Patrick. So if we look at 2019, we talked about a record foundry/logic performance. And we have a very strong incumbent leadership position as you talked about in foundry/logic. A much larger business and more diverse business than our process tool appears. And that's driving our outperformance in 2019. So if we look at foundry/logic, in this calendar year, we'll have the highest foundry/logic revenue ever, highest epi revenue ever and highest metals revenue ever. So those are areas that are part of our leadership products. We're working with customers on new materials like tungsten deposition, shaping structures with selective removal, where we're gaining key wins. That's enabling performance gains for our customers and growth for Applied. So those are some of the areas where we're seeing growth.
In terms of 2019, we're also seeing strong growth besides etch in CVD, thermal. And you talked about inspection, that's an area where we just introduced a new product. We're seeing very strong adoption. And that will give us momentum to grow quickly in that business in 2020. So anyway, that's a little bit of color around some of the areas that we're driving. But it really does get back to driving power and performance, area and cost for customers and really more and more, not just with unit processes, but also with these integrated solutions is a sweet spot for Applied and gives us tremendous momentum going forward.",242,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We think our performance compares favorably with our peers over this cycle. Our peak-to-trough gross margin over this cycle was down about 210 basis points. 
Our next closest competitors in the process tool space, one was down 300, another one was down 310. And as we're profiling into the back part of the calendar year on a relative basis, I think that gross margin performance on a quarter-over-quart0er basis also looks pretty good. So we like how we're executing. Are we ever satisfied with our gross margins? No. Are we maniacally focused on driving improvements and improving the cost structure? Absolutely. We're going to keep at it. We're going to continue to work hard. And I think you're seeing the breadth and depth of our portfolio in a broad sense play out in the gross margin resiliency over the course of the cycle.",211,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

So if memory spending is incremental to the model from here on, and you said foundry and logic should sustain and even on the display side, I think you're starting at a low point in January.

And the environment is clearly better today than it was a quarter ago or 6 months ago. And what I would say, just at the very highest level, the company is performing well. We've got a good backlog entering the year. You pointed out strength in foundry/logic services. Swing factor in the year, I said it before, it's really the essence of the issue. The swing factor for the year is going to be what happens in the memory market. So we're going to stay close to customers. We're going to be ready to respond when the NAND market starts to hit followed by DRAM. And we'll take it one quarter at a time. So I don't think we want to start giving multiple quarter guidance and shaping the full year given some of the uncertainty we see from a timing standpoint on when things like memory are going to start to flash.",183,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

It seems almost illogical for us to assume that the foundry strength that you're seeing in the January quarter sustains at that quarterly level through each quarter of fiscal '20 because that would get the business up probably well into the teens, if not 20% year-on-year. And so again, I guess, I'm not asking you to necessarily guide us quarter-to-quarter, but isn't it logical to assume that you're probably not going to sustain that peak quarterly revenue at foundry in every quarter of 2020?",99,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

No question, Quinn. And my sustainability into next year is really meant to be that it's not going to be a one quarter phenomenon. We've got a nice backlog. Q4 was a really nice quarter for us in foundry/logic. Q1 will be a record quarter. And I think it would be probably not the right place to set expectation to think every quarter is going to be at a record foundry/logic level.

First, like I said at the beginning, I'm pleased with the way we ended the fiscal year and I especially like the setup for Applied in 2020 given the record year-end backlog and the momentum that we see in key parts of the business.
Second, we look forward to staying close to investors. December 3, Gary and I are going to be at the Crédit Suisse Conference in Scottsdale. Next week after that, I'll be at the UBS Conference in New York. In the meantime, we hope you all have a happy and safe Thanksgiving with your families.
