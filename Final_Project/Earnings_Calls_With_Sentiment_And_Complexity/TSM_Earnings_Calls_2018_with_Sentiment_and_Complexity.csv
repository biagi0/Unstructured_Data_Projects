Can you all hear me okay? Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.
My presentation will start with the first quarter highlights and followed by the second quarter guidance. In the first quarter, due to seasonality, our first quarter revenue in US dollars decreased 8.2% sequentially to USD 8.46 billion, which was at the middle of our guidance range. The NT dollars revenue declined 10.6%, reflecting 2.7% appreciation in NT dollar against U.S. dollar. Gross margin increased 0.3 percentage points sequentially to 50.3%. As our cost improvement efforts and inventory valuation benefit offset the lower-capacity utilization in unfavorable foreign exchange rate.
Total operating expense decreased by TWD 2.1 billion and represented 10.8% of revenue versus 10.4% in the prior quarter. Thus, operating margin slightly decreased 0.2 percentage points to 39.0%. Overall, our first quarter EPS reached TWD 3.46, and ROE was 23% for the quarter.
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the first quarter, Communication and Industrial/Standard decreased 19% and 4% from the prior quarter, respectively, while Computer and Consumer increased by 30% and 9%, respectively.
Now let's take a look at our revenue by technologies. 10-nanometer process technology contributed 19% of our total wafer revenue in the first quarter, the combined 16/20 contribution was 22% of total wafer revenue, 28-nanometer and below advanced technologies accounted for 61% of total wafer revenue.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 684 billion, an increase of TWD 35 billion from last quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 16 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 2 days to 42 days. Days of inventory increased 11 days to 63 days due to an increase of raw wafer and the 10-nanometer wafer previewed before the capacity is converted to 7-nanometer.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and the CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 161 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 72 billion in capital expenditures. So our free cash flow was TWD 89 billion. We also repaid TWD 17 billion of corporate bonds and the prepaid TWD 34 billion of corporate bonds and interest. As a result, our overall cash balance increased TWD 24 billion to reach TWD 578 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar term, our first quarter CapEx expenditure was $2.45 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let me turn on to the second quarter guidance. Based on current business outlook, we expect second quarter revenue to be between USD 7.8 billion and USD 7.9 billion, which is a 7% to 8% sequential decline, but a 11.2% year-over-year increase at the midpoint of my revenue guidance.
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 29.20, our second quarter gross margin is expected to be between 47% and 49%. Our second quarter operating margin is expected to be between 35% and 37%. Also, in the second quarter, we will again need to accrue the 10% tax on the undistributed retained earnings. But due to higher accumulative translation loss as a result of anti-appreciation against U.S. dollars, which will reduce our retained earning tax. Therefore, our second quarter tax rate will be between 18% to 19%. The tax rate will then fall back to 10% to 11% level in the third and the fourth quarter, and a full year tax rate will be about 12%.
This concludes my remarks, and I will now make comments on capital capacity and the profitability. I will start with CapEx and capacity. At our last conference, we stated our 2018 CapEx budget to be between USD 10.5 billion to USD 11 billion. We now see our CapEx to be between USD 11.5 billion and USD 12 billion. The increase is due to: number one, we plan to spend about $500 million more to increase our mask-making capacity to support our customers higher tape-out activities; and to spend about $300 million as prepayment for our high-end EUV tools.
Going forward, we expect our annual CapEx in the next few years will be ranging between USD 10 billion and USD 12 billion. Now let me explain how we are able to support our 5% to 10% long-term growth with a similar level of annual CapEx as the follows. For the existing capacity, we are able to grow capacity through productivity improvement, that is, for the same tours, the output can increase every year through our engineering efforts and innovations. This way, without spending fresh CapEx, we are able to grow capacity to support growth. On average, we are able to grow our overall capacity by the mid-single digit each year through the productivity improvement. Our marketing strategy with respect to the existing capacities, which grow in productivity perpetually, is to seek enough demand to feel this growing capacity at all times. As for the new capacity which is mainly leading-age technologies, we are very careful in planning the right level of PIC capacity, knowing that initial capacity we build will grow continuously to a larger size due to productivity improvement.
To summarize, through productivity improvement and careful planning of new capacity, we are able to support revenue growth of 5% to 10% with annual CapEx at a USD 10 billion to USD 12 billion level in the next few years.
Now let me make a comment on profitability. TSMC's profitability is determined by the following factors: leadership technology, development and ramp-up, pricing, capacity utilization, cost reduction, foreign exchange rate and technology mix.
Now I will go through the changes for our second quarter gross margin compared to second quarter '17 and first quarter '18, respectively. Compare second quarter '18 gross margin using the midpoint of the guidance I just mentioned, which will be 48%, compare that with second quarter '17 gross margin, which was 50.8%. The decline of 2.8 percentage points gross margin rate is explained by 1.3 percentage point negatively due to exchange rate. NT dollars has appreciated 3.6% from second quarter '17 to second quarter '18. In addition to that, there is a negative 1.5 percentage point due to unfavorable product mix and inventory valuation, which is resulting from a utilization change. If I compare second quarter '18 with first quarter '18, where our margin was 50.3% last quarter, the decline of 2.3 percentage point gross margin is explained mainly by the favorable 2 percentage point of inventory valuation that was embedded in the first quarter '18 gross margin, which I have explained in the last quarterly conference.
To conclude, our leadership in technology development and ramp-up remains solid. We continue to maintain our competitive price, and we are making good progress in cost reduction. We will continue to work on feeding our capacity. I finished my remark.
Now let me turn the microphone to C.C. Wei for his comment.",1159,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2018",2018-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5334.0,1433289.0,57027131.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term outlook. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 248.1 billion or USD 8.46 billion in line with our guidance given 3 months ago. This result was mainly driven by a strong demand from high-performance computing such as cryptocurrency mining and increases from both automotive and IoT, but offset by seasonal decline in smartphones.
Moving into second quarter this year. Our business is expected to be affected by continued softer demand from Smartphone segment. This decline is expect to be partially mitigated by the strengths in HPC. Our revenue in US dollar is likely to grow by only about a 10% over second quarter last year. We forecast our fabless DOI to stay slightly above seasonal level, but will attract seasonal pattern. For the whole year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow by 5%, while foundry expect to grow by about a 8%. We forecast TSMC's 2018 revenue in US dollar will be about a 10%, rather than the previously indicated 10% to 15% due to the Smartphone weakness and the uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining demand.
Now let me talk about the long-term business growth driver. We are optimistic about the development of some of the industries of mega trends, particularly AI and 5G communication. We believe these 2 will help semiconductor to separate is progressively seem to our daily lives. Both AI and 5G will create the new usage models and spur new waves of demand for both of the existing and emerging applications with the increasing silicon content. We expect TSMC to benefit from these industry mega trends in all 4 of our gross platforms. In mobile, silicon content of the smartphones were increased due to increasing functionality such as facial recognition and new usage such as AR, VR and 3D video. In HPC, we expect AI will boost the attach rate of accelerators using data center for today's mid- to teens level to about 50% by 2020. In automotive, the use of the new safety-related functionalities such as ADAS and eventually autonomous driving will drive the increasing silicon usage. In IoT, AI will proliferate into broad-based current devices across many applications, such as the smart voice assistance or electronics appliance management. These, again, will increase silicon content. We believe our 4 growth platform are well positioned to benefit from the longer-term mega trend of AI and 5G. Our leadership in advance and specialty technologies as well as our advanced packaging solutions should enable us to capture the future growth opportunities well.
Now let me talk about the N7 ramp-up. TSMC's 7-nanometer technology in terms of performance, power and area density as well as its schedule is leading the industry. So far, we have already favored out more than 18 customer products with good yield in performance. More than 50 products tape-outs has been planned by end of this year from applications across mobile, server CPU, network processor, gaming, GPU, PGA, cryptocurrency, automotive and AI. Our 7-nanometer is already in volume production.
Now I'll talk about the N7+ and EUV. We believe we can extend the success of our 7-nanometer. N7 too is enhanced version. N7+, which will have 20% better density and greater than 10% power reduction.
And N7+ will use few EUV layers to replace emerging decacore processor. As a result, fewer [indiscernible] layer can be used. As the N7+ will use more than 90% of the same tours with the N7 and N10, where we have fine tune all the advanced equipment to their optimum condition during their ramp-up, we believe we can leverage our production learning to N7+ and enjoy the industry's best deeper density among competitors of comparable technologies. Our N7+ silicon result today are very encouraging. Not only we have demonstrated equivalent or better performance in yield on both 256-megabit SRAM and on product like test vehicle when compared to N7 baseline, we have also demonstrated a tighter distribution of electrical parameters in the areas, where EUV is supplied. Since we maximize design [rule] compatibility between N7 and N7+, our customer can minimize the IP porting effect -- effort, I'm sorry. A few customers have already planned to tape out the N7+ resource in second half this year and more in the first half next year. Our N7+ volume production is planned in 2019, which remain unchanged. We have made ready multiple EUV scanners to support not only N7+ development but also N5 development. At N5, with more extensive use of EUV, we have obtained consistent double-digit yield on 256-megabit SRAM as well as our larger test chip. Our silicon data has proved or the benefits we expect from process simplification with EUV. Besides the silicon development, EUV technology continue to mature toward a high volume production with the improving source power toward the 250-watts goal, which we expect to achieve in a few quarters. Good progress continue to be made in the EUV infrastructure in the last few months. They include photoresist, mask defect in yield, pellicle defects in transmission. We are confident that EUV can meet our goal of 2019 volume production for N7+ and 2020 volume production for N5.
Now let me move to 16-FinFET and 12-FinFET. We introduced our 16-FinFET in 2015 and then 12FFC in 2017. Compared with the 16-nanometer, our 12-nanometer technology deliver better density, performance and more efficient power. With continual improvement in yield, customer are gradually moving from 16-nanometer to 12-nanometer.
Among all the product tape-outs we received for this year on the 16/12 node, about 30% are for 12FFC. The application of 16/12 includes mobile, GPU, AI, networking FPGA, consumer application and automotive. Our capacity of 12/16 node is being fully loaded currently.
Now let me update on Nanjing fab. We expect to expand our business in China. Our Nanjing fab will enhance our support to local customers. Because of high demand on 16-nanometer, we had advanced the startup of Nanjing production. The production of our Nanjing plant starts this month. Both yield and performance are comparable to our 16-nanometer Taiwan fab. Our advanced packaging -- now let me talk about the last item. Our advanced packaging technology, InFO and CoWoS, are becoming more important for our customer to reduce their product footprint, packaging techniques while enhancing the performance. TSMC's InFO is surreal of volume production. We have expanded its capability to cover large die size so that we can integrate 2 or more chips together into 1 package. This is particularly useful for HPC product to obtain optimum cost performance benefit. And CoWoS, we have observed a growing number of tape-outs from HPC customers in graphic and networking segment. As a result, we are increasing our capacity now to support the demand. And thank you for your attention.",1137,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So a couple of years back, you had given a guidance of 5% to 10% with half of the growth coming from mobile and half of the growth coming from HPC and other areas. Could you update the component of that guidance? Does it mean that now smartphone is probably not going to grow from here? Is that how you think about it?

380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5394.0,1504089.0,59490247.0,Presenter Speech,Lora Ho,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will first summarize our second quarter financial results and then provide the guidance for the third quarter. 
Our second quarter revenue in USD 7.85 billion, a decrease of 7.2% sequentially, but an increase of 11.2% year-over-year. In NT dollars, revenue declined 6% sequentially mainly due to the impact from mobile product seasonality. 
Gross margin was 47.8% in the second quarter, a decrease of 2.5 percentage point versus first quarter. About 2 percentage point of the decrease was attributable to the absence of the favorable inventory valuation that I had mentioned in April, while the remainder was attributable to a lower level of capacity utilization, partially offset by cost improvements and slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate.
Operating expenses ratio was 11.3% as our revenue decreased more than our expense decreased. Operating margin decreased 2.8 percentage points Q-over-Q to reach 36.2% in the second quarter. 
As I said during the last quarterly conference, the corporate tax rate was increased to 17.5% in the second quarter as we accrued the 10% tax on undistributed retained earnings, the tax rate will fall back to 10% to 11% level in the second half, and the full year tax rate will be above 12%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was $2.79 and ROE was 18.7%. 
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the second quarter, Communication and Industrial standard decreased 14% and 1%, respectively, while Computer and Consumer increased by 34% and 23%, respectively.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. We begin while in production of 7-nanometer process technology in the second quarter. The revenue contribution was less than 1% in second quarter, and it will ramp to above 10% in the third quarter. 10-nanometer contributed 13% of total wafer revenue during the second quarter, while the combined revenue from 16- and 20-nanometer accounted for 25%, and 28-nanometer was 23%. Advanced technologies defined as 28-nanometer and more accounted for 61% of total wafer revenue.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 749 billion, an increase of TWD 65 billion from the first quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 121 billion as we accrued about TWD 208 billion for cash dividends, which will be paid out today. 
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 4 days to 38 days. Days of inventory increased 11 days to 74 days primarily due to the ramp-up of 7-nanometer, which has a longer cycle time and a slight increase in low wafers.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 130 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 60 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 70 billion. Overall, cash balance increased by TWD 54 billion to TWD 632 billion at the end of the second quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, the capital expenditures spent in the first half of 2018 totaled USD 4.5 billion. 
Now I have finished my financial summary of the second quarter. Now let me provide you the third quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect third quarter revenue to be between USD 8.45 billion and USD 8.55 billion, which is an 8.2% sequential increase at the midpoint. 
Based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.50, our third quarter gross margin is expected to be between 48% and 50%. And our third quarter operating margin is expected to be between 36.5% and 38.5%. This conclude my financial summary. 
Now let me make remarks on capital expenditure and profitability. I'll first talk about the capital expenditure. In our last Investor Conference in April, we stated our 2018 CapEx budget to be between USD 11.5 billion to USD 12 billion. However, we now plan to trim our CapEx budget by about USD 1.5 billion and expect our 2018 CapEx to be between USD 10 billion and USD 10.5 billion. 
The reduction of 2018 CapEx come from the following 3 factors. The first one, about USD 700 million came from delay of payment to 2019 due to leading edge towards relocation schedule adjustment. However, the planned capacity remains unchanged. 
Second, about USD 600 million comes from efficiency gains that allow us to spend less on tools. Third, about USD 200 million comes from the U.S. dollar appreciation against euro and Japanese yen. 
My second remark is regarding profitability. Now I will talk about third quarter '18 gross margin and the overall outlook of our profitability. Our third quarter gross margin is expected to improve from second quarter by more than 1 percentage point. The increase mainly comes from better utilization rate, more favorable foreign exchange rate and improved profitability of our back-end business, offset, however, by the offerable technology mix, which include the ramp of 7-nanometer that is expected to dilute our gross margin by more than 1 percentage point in the third quarter and the lower contribution from 28-nanometer. The net gain in gross margin, therefore, is expected to be slightly more than 1 percentage point.
That said, TSMC's financial objective remain unchanged. Our goal is to achieve revenue and net income compound annual growth rate in the next few years to be between 5% and 10% in U.S. dollars, gross margin to be about 50%, operating margin to be about 39% and ROE to be above 20%. 
This ends my remark. Now let me turn the microphone to C.C. for his comment.",937,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5394.0,1504089.0,59490248.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term demand outlook. We conclude our second quarter with revenue of TWD 233.3 billion or USD 7.5 -- USD 7.85 billion, in line with our guidance given 3 months ago. This result reflected mainly a stronger demand from high-performance computing, including cryptocurrency mining, but it was offset by seasonal decline in high-end smartphones.
Moving into third quarter 2018. Our business is expected to benefit from new product launches using TSMC's industry-leading 7-nanometer technology, while cryptocurrency mining demand was declining due to weakening cryptocurrency prices. That being said, we do see slight improvement in smartphone demand in second half of this year as compared to our forecast 3 months ago. CPU demand for AI in the gaming continues to increase.
For the full year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow by 5% while foundry is expected to grow by about 7%. We forecast TSMC's 2018 revenue in U.S. dollar will grow by a high single-digit rate rather than the previously stated about 10% due to general weakness in cryptocurrency mining demand.
Now let me move to long-term business growth driver. As we stated 3 months ago that we are optimistic about the development of the industry's megatrend, particularly AI and 5G communication. Recently, we have observed more promising development. For example, we see AI continues to faster proliferate from data center to edge server and to end client devices. As for 5G, major operator in several countries has rolled out the development schedule, while multiple ODMs and IC vendors have planned their 5G products, which are set to ramp in the coming 2 years. Despite the slow unit growth in smartphones in the near term, we expect the development of 5G will fuel the next wave of smartphone growth both in units and in silicon content.
In HPC, we expect the increasing workload in data center and complexity of AI will boost the demand for AI accelerator, GPU and CPU in several. We also expect the introduction of next-generation video gaming will add growth of HPC. We believe all our 4 core platforms, smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive, are well positioned to benefit from the longer-term megatrend of AI and 5G. We saw a leading and comprehensive technology offering our vast capacity and our policy of not competing with customers. We will be able to support our customers to expand their markets and, therefore, fuel our future growth.
Let me talk about N7 ramp-up stages. TSMC's 7-nanometer technology is leading in the industry. It has the best performers, power and area density, and its schedule is ahead of competition. For the tape-outs that we have completed for customers, all have very good yield and performers. We forecast a total of more than 50 customer product tape-outs by end of this year from a wide range of applications covering mobile, server CPU, network processor, gaming, GPU, FPGA, cryptocurrency, automotive and AI. Our 7-nanometer is already in volume production and accounted for less than 1 percentage of our total wafer revenue in second quarter. It's expected to jump more than 10% of our wafer revenue in third quarter and is estimated to contribute more than 20% revenue for us in fourth quarter in this year.
Let me talk about the N7+ and EUV. Our 7-nanometer-plus or N7+ can leverage the success of our N7 and enjoy 15% to 20% better [ day ] density and more than 10% power reduction. We saw few EUV layers replacing certain emerging [indiscernible] where we process, we're able to have few masking layers, shorter cycle time and less process complexity. Therefore, we expect to achieve better yield as compared to our N7. 
Furthermore, as we have fine-tuned all the advanced equipment to their optimum condition due to the ramp-up of both our 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies, we believe we can leverage our production lending to 7+ and enjoy the industries of best defect density among our peers' comparable technologies.
The silicon result from our N7+ today are very encouraging. The [ deed ] N7+ product has tape-out early dispense, and we expect to receive a few more tape-outs by end of this year. Volume production will start at Q2 next year. That is Q2 2019, which will be the worst first EUV fund reproduction by that time. We have made ready multiple EUV scanners to support not only the N7+ development but also N5 development. Our silicon data have proved all the benefits we expect to form process simplification with EUV. In addition, we have also started our N3 technology development using EUV.
Now let me talk about the EUV status. Good progress continued to be made in the EUV infrastructure in the last few months. They include photoresist, mask defect and yield petticoat defects in transmission. Beside the silicon development, EUV technology continues to mature toward high-volume production. We have achieved 250 watts source upgrade in April, and the tools are running smoothly with minimum degradation and high level of uptime. In summary, we started EUV development work early, and we have secured the largest number of EUV tools among our peers to be ready for 2019 volume production for N7+ and 2020 volume production for N5.
Let me talk about N5. Our 5-nanometer technology, N5 is progressing well. The 256 megabits as revealed is 1 quarter ahead of schedule, and the device performance is well on track. TSMC's N5 will begin risk production in first half 2019. We believe it will be the most advanced technology in the foundry industry by that time. We are actively engaging with several lead customers, and we are running their test chip now. We expect to receive first customer product tape-out in first half 2019. Volume production is expected to start in first half 2020.
I'm talking about now with our specialty technology. We work closely with our customer to accelerate our specialty technology roadmap. By leveraging our logic capability, we developed specialty technology features, such as MEMS, CMOS image sensor, high-voltage power management IC, emerging and bigger memories and analog to more advanced node, including 55-, 40-nanometer and 28-, 22-nanometer. These efforts bring scaling benefit to our customers.
Our 22ULP process is qualified and on track for risk production in August. That is next month. About 40 customer product tape-outs using our N22 are planned in the next few quarters, covering a broad spectrum of applications from digital EUV, consumer electronics, to IoT and RF connectivity. N22 have 15% performance gain, 25% power reduction, and 5% to 10% die error shrink when compared with N28. With these improvements, we expect our N22 will extend our leadership at 28-nanometer node and enjoy a long and successful economic life. 
Since we have already built a broad technology capacity at 12-inch for various specialty technologies, we are migrating some of our customer's product from 8-inch to 12-inch with similar transition, where our customer can enjoy flexible capacity support and further scaling benefit. And that's all. I thank you for your attention.",1179,7.0,9.0,0.8888888888888888,0.9

The reason is the Moore's law over the years is indeed slowing down. That means that we have to create more value to our customer on their product to allow the technology migration to continue. And advanced packaging is -- you can almost say it's a parallel thrust together with Moore's law to develop our customers' products. And advanced packaging development encompass the -- our customer's architecture development and algorithm development. In that, I'm talking about we're going to the 3D-IC and that is the purpose to add to this -- to Moore's law development to maximize our customer's product. Okay, so this is not a typical packaging business. It is a major technology development for TSMC. Although today it is indeed more expensive, some of the market sector cannot afford it. So today we see the affordable segment will be the high-performance computing, particularly the server and also the high-speed networking area. Of course, the current biggest customer is in the mobile and I believe the mobile sector will gradually come in when they see the value. So it is not a typical Moore's law 10 pace, rather it is an additional development effort to augment it to the Moore's law.

Is there a law or rule or something going forward going to dictate how you can serve Chinese customer because Chinese customer now account almost 1/4 of your revenues? Second on China is UMC is going to list its China -- entity in China and arguably can get a lot of capital for R&D and the growth.

This year, you have 7-nanometer going to greater than 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter. The guidance that you just gave for the third quarter suggested 100 basis points of headwind from the initial ramp of 7-nanometer. I'm curious as 7-nanometer goes to more than 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter, does the volume start to offset and you won't get as much of a headwind? Or the fact that it's such a large percentage of mix, will 7-nanometer still be a significant headwind to potential margin progression going into the fourth quarter?",122,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

For example, you look at the smartphone in these days, the application processor embedded a lot of AI functionality inside. So you can have a lot of new features, right, the face recognition, the voice recognition and then -- et cetera, et cetera. So if you want to specifically identify what is increased over last year, what is increased over this year is pretty hard for us to do. But we can see the activity going up because if you look at networking processor keep coming, application processor for the older smartphone keep increasing functionality so you can estimate what kind of die size they increase, so the silicon content. By doing that, you probably can figure out what is that contribution and why TSMC making it so big deal because we saw the trend from AI and 5G all combined together, that would be a megatrend.",170,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

AI is in every growth segment we have, okay. In the smartphone, in the automotive, in IoT, AI increased the silicon content. For the high-performance computing, indeed there are a lot of discrete AI chips. So if we -- those discrete AI chips that include xPU, accelerator GPUs and network processors and some of them even games is in that -- those are discrete CPU. So as we speak today, indeed high-performance computing growth is pretty fast.

First of all, Happy New Year. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. 
My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of 2017 for the whole year. Then after that, I will provide a guidance for the first quarter. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased 10.1% sequentially to TWD 278 billion, mainly driven by major mobile product launches and continuing demand for cryptocurrency mining. 
Gross margin increased 0.1 percentage point sequentially to 50.0% as the benefit from higher capacity utilization and the inventory valuation adjustment helped offset the impact from continued 10-nanometer margin dilution and NT dollar appreciation. 
Total operating expenses increased by TWD 1.3 billion but, thanks to operating leverage, only represented 10.4% of revenue versus 10.9% in the prior quarter. And operating margin increased by 0.3 percentage point sequentially to reach 39.2%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS reached TWD 3.83, and ROE was 26.9% for the quarter. 
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the fourth quarter, Communication and Computer increased 20% and 8% from the prior quarter, respectively; while Consumer and Industrial/Standard decreased by 38% and 4%, respectively. On a full year basis, Computer and Industrial/Standard increased 25% and 14% year-over-year, respectively; while Communication and Consumer decreased 2% and 10%, respectively.
Now let's take a look at the revenue by technology. 10-nanometer process technology continue to ramp strongly, accounted for 25% of total wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. The combined 16/20 contribution was 20% of total wafer revenue. Advanced technologies, meaning 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 63% of total wafer revenue, up from 57% in the third quarter. On a full year basis, 10-nanometer contribution reached 10% of total wafer revenue in 2017. The combined 16 and 20 contribution was 25% of total wafer revenue. Advanced technology, 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 54% in 2016.
Moving on to balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable security of TWD 649 billion, an increase of TWD 148 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 60 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 40 days, while days of inventory decreased 1 day to 52 days.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 204 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 61 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 143 billion, and our overall cash balance increased TWD 145 billion to reach TWD 553 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. In the U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditure reached $2.1 billion, and the totaled CapEx for the whole year was USD 10.9 billion.
Now I would like to give you a recap of our performance in 2017. 2017 was another strong year of -- for TSMC as, once again, we set a new record in terms of most revenue and earnings despite a 5.5% depreciation in the NT dollars. Our revenue grew 9.1% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms and 3.1% in NT dollars to reach TWD 977 billion as we saw wafer shipments increase across nearly all technology nodes. 
Gross margin increased 0.5 percentage point to reach 50.6% in 2017 as continual operating efficiency improvement and better capacity utilization more than offset the headwinds from the unfavorable exchange rate and the 10-nanometer margin dilution. 
Our operating margin declined 0.5 percentage point to 39.4% so increased our R&D spending ratio to 8.2% of revenue, reflecting a higher level of 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer development activities. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 13.5%, same as in 2016. And full year earnings per share was TWD 13.23. 
On cash flow, we spent TWD 331 billion in capital expenditure or $10.9 billion in U.S. dollar term, while we generated TWD 585 billion in operating cash flow and TWD 255 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 182 billion in cash dividend, an increase of 17% from 2016.
Now I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to the first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect first quarter revenue to be between USD 8.4 billion and USD 8.5 billion, which is an 8.3% sequential decline but a 12.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint and represent a new record high in terms of first quarter revenue. Based on the exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 29.60, our first quarter gross margin is expected to between 49.5% and 51.5%. Our first quarter operating margin is expected to be between 38% and 40%. 
This concludes my remarks. Now I would like to turn it over to Mark for his comments.",797,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

Firstly, I would like to talk about our -- everyone's foundry strategy. Being everyone's foundry is the strategy TSMC takes by heart. Through our technology and services, we build an Open Innovation Platform, where all innovators in the semiconductor industry can come to realize their innovation and bring their products to life. 
As our customers continue to innovate, they bring new requirements to us, and we need to continuously develop new capabilities to answer them. In the meantime, they utilize those shared capabilities such as yield improvement, design, utilities, foundation IPs and our large-scale and flexible capacities. In this way, this open innovation ecosystem expands its scale and its value. We do not compete with our customers. We are everyone's foundry.
Now on cryptocurrency demand. In the past, TSMC's open innovation ecosystem incubates numerous growth drivers for the semiconductor industry. In the '90s, it was the PC chipsets; then in the early '20s, the graphic processors; in the mid- to late '20s, it was chipset for cellular phone; recently, start 2010, it was for smartphones. Those waves of innovation continuously sprout in our ecosystem and drive the growth of TSMC.
Lately, we observed the demand from cryptocurrency mining surged. Cryptocurrency mining requires massive, high-performance and low-power computing. TSMC's advanced technology and productization serves -- services suits it well. We have sized 2018 cryptocurrency mining demand carefully. Since it is still in its early stage of development, it is difficult for us to forecast its demand too far into the future with accuracy. However, as long as the cryptocurrency miners can derive positive returns, demand for TSMC wafers will continue. Furthermore, we are quite certain that deep learning and blockchain technologies, which are the core technology of cryptocurrency mining, will lead to new waves of semiconductor innovation and demand for years to come. 
Now on N5 progress and EUV readiness. Our N5 technology development is well on track for 1Q 2019 risk production. We already achieved good SRAM yield. Device development is also well on plan. Progress on both are similar to our N7, at the same development stage. N5 customer test chips are already running in our fab. 
We also made significant progress in improving EUV capability and the manufacturability. We have been consistently demonstrating high yield on N7+ and N5 development lots. EUV source power is now operating at 160 watt to support our N7 and N5 development activities. EUV scanner with source power of 250 watt will -- has been installed in our fabs. Capability of in-house EUV pellicle making has also been established with low defect level and good transmission properties. So we are confident that our EUV technology will be ready for high-volume production for N7+ in 2019 and N5 in 2020. 
On the growth platform of our mobile high-performance computing, IoT and automotive. In 2017, last year, all our growth platforms, mobile, high-performance computing, IoT and automotive, registered double-digit growth -- revenue growth in U.S. dollars. Moving into 2018, growth of these platforms continue. We estimate that the high-performance computing platform will register the strongest growth in U.S. dollars. 
For smartphones, smartphones will continue to include new features, such as 3D authentication, 3D sensing, AI for face and voice recognition and 18:9 display. Our smartphone customers are taping out 7-nanometer for premium phone and 12-nanometer for mainstream phones, both are on track to ramp in 2018. 
In 2018, high-performance computing business will enjoy the most growth from GPU and cryptocurrency ASICs. The key technologies for high-performance computing are 16- and 12-nanometer and 7-nanometer together with our CoWoS technology. 
IoT business growth in 2018 mainly comes from smart voice assistant devices, application processor for wearables and wireless MCU for smartphones. Our 22 ULP, ULL, ultra-low-power, ultra-low-leakage technology, will be key to all these applications. 
Automotive business in 2018 will come mostly from increased IDM outsourcing to TSMC in new technologies. We have built automotive-specific design ecosystem on 16 FFC in 2017, and we'll complete that on N7 in 2018. TSMC's superior manufacturer -- manufacturing quality, sufficient capacity support and our long-term automotive supply commitment are the key enabling elements to expand this business.

Wei,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Mark. Let me talk about the near-term demand and inventory. 
We concluded our fourth quarter with 10% Q-over-Q growth in U.S. dollar, which was slightly above the guidance we gave 3 months ago despite a continuing inventory reduction by our customer. Fourth quarter's strong result was mainly driven by a major smartphone release, which is based on our 10-nanometer process with InFO and the strong demand in cryptocurrency mining. 
Concluding 2017, semiconductor, excluding memory, growth was 9%, while foundry grew 8%. TSMC's revenue grew 9% in U.S. dollars and accounted for 56% of the total foundry market segment share. 
Moving into first quarter 2018, our revenue in U.S. dollar is likely to decline by about 8%, as Lora just have guided. This is mainly due to smartphone seasonality, offset partially by continued demand for cryptocurrency mining. Fabless DOI exiting 2017 was a few days above seasonal level. Moving into 2018, we forecast fabless DOI to trend up but will attract seasonal pattern. 
Now let me talk about N7 and N7+. So far, we have already taped out 10 customers' product in 7-nanometer. And we are currently qualifying this product in 2 different fabs in preparation for volume production starting in second quarter this year. During first quarter 2018, we expect to tape out another 10 products. In total, we expect to have taped out more than 50 customer products in 7-nanometer by the end of 2018. Major application covered by these tape-outs are in mobile, game, GPU, at PTA, networking and AI. In essence, almost every area that requires high-performance and lower-power consumption will benefit from TSMC's 7-nanometer solution. 
In terms of performance, power, area density and schedule, we believe our 7-nanometer solution is leading in the foundry industry. We will introduce our N7+ technology later this year. Here, we plan to replace some immersion layers by deploying a few layers of EUV processes. Currently, we have already demonstrated the same level of 256 megabit SRAM yield at N7+ as compared to N7. 
Then let me move to N10 status. We successfully ramped up 10-nanometer in 2017. 10-nanometer contributed 25% wafer revenue in 4Q '17, up from 10% in third quarter. Full year 10-nanometer accounted for 10% of our total wafer revenue. Most defect density and device performance are meeting our targets. Despite that most of our current 10-nanometer mobile customer will start to migrate into 7-nanometer this year, we continue to expect a year-to-year growth of our N10 business in 2018, driven by application processor, cellular baseband and ASICs CPU.
Now let me touch about N16, in 12-nanometer demand outlook and competitive position. TSMC continues to enhance technology performance for every node, and 16-nanometer is no exception. We have moved from 16-FinFET to 16FF+ and then to 16FFC. Now we are moving into 12FFC. With 12FFC, we can improve the device by about 10% from 16FFC, will reduce the power consumption by about a 20%, all the while we expect to reduce the tight costs as well. 
It is the fourth year today that our N16, N12 enter into high volume production. And we still expect to see very strong demand for this node, which is supported by current plan of 120 tape-outs this year, covering a variety of mainstream smartphones, cryptocurrency, AI, DPU, and RF products. Although other foundries may have plan to enter into 12-nanometer node, TSMC achieved the lowest defect density and enjoys a very competitive cost structure. As a result, we expect our market segment share in this node will be increased.
Now let me move into 28-nanometer. Similar to 16-, 12-nanometer node, TSMC continues to improve the N28, N22 performance from 28LP to 28HP, to 28HPC and 28HPC+. 
And now to 22ULL and ULP, which stands for ultra-low leakage and ultra-low power. The newly introduced 22ULP, it will enhance performance by increasing speed by about 15%, will reduce the power consumption by about 25%, with an overall tight area shrink of 5% to 10% as compared with the 28HPC+. Both 22ULP and 22ULL are ideally suited for IoT and RF-related applications. 
Beyond continued performance enhancement, our excellent manufacturing capabilities and our significant investment in capacity are also important contributing factors for customer to choose TSMC as their primary foundry. Last year, we saw about 240 product tape-outs used in our 28, 22 node, which was a record high since 28-nanometer entered volume production in 2011. We expect that this tape-out activity to continue in this year, and we are confident that our high market segment share in the 28, 22 technology node will be maintained. 
Now we'll talk -- I will talk about advanced packaging. I will update toward our advanced packaging technologies: chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate, or CoWoS; and Integrated Fan-Out, or InFO. 
We have developed CoWoS to support the requirements of HPC applications, particularly in the area of AI, data server and networking. This is the sixth years that our CoWoS technology has been in production. We see more customers engaging with us on this technology, and we expect to receive more than 30 tape-outs in the next 3 years. Most of the products today are using 16-nanometer technology. We are actively developing CoWoS for 7-nanometer starting from this year. 
TSMC's InFO has entered into high volume production for the third year, with majority of the adoption by mobile products. Beyond mobile, we are working to expand InFO to automotive and the HPC-related applications. For example, we've developed the InFO on substrate, or InFO OS, for HPC product, and we'll qualify this technology in first half of this year and expect to enter production later this year. Today, we are working with various customers using InFO technology to cover their products ranging from N28, N16, N7 and N5 technologies. 
Last, let me talk about the '19 fab update. We expect to expand our business in China, and to enhance our support to local customer with the 19 fab. Planned capacity for this phase is 20,000 wafer per month 12-inch. Using 16-nanometer and 12-nanometer, we've broke ground for this fab in July 2016 and have now almost completed move in all production tools. We have already started initial engineering in wafer. More than 1,000 engineers are working in this fab to date. Customers at our Nanjing fab come from both China and the other regions. We saw a variety of products in the initial ramp. 
Due to the strong demand for our 16-, 12-nanometer technology node, we have pulled in the output schedule by a few months to May of 2018. We are confident that we will be able to report to you the good result of our 16- and 12-nanometer node in Nanjing. 
That's all I have. Thank you for your attention. Now turn the call into Lora.",1125,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Now let me start with CapEx. Our 2018 CapEx is expected to be between USD 10.5 billion to USD 11 billion, which is essentially flat with our 2017 CapEx. About 73% of the capital budget will be used for capacity buildup for the advanced technologies, mainly 7-nanometer, followed by 5-nanometer. Another 17% of the capital budget will be used for R&D, packing and mask.
As I stated in our last investor conference 3 months ago, in order to support our 5% to 10% growth in the next few years, we expect our CapEx in the next few years to stay a few percentage point more than USD 10 billion. This implies that our CapEx in the next few years will remain at a similar level to what we have spent last year and what we expect to spend this year. 
Although our leading node capital costs continue to increase due to increasing process complexity, we are able to offset its impact to our CapEx by further optimizing our capital planning and productivity improvements. 
With the flattish CapEx going forward and the revenue CAGR of 5% to 10%, we expect capital intensity, which is the ratio between CapEx and revenue, to gradually decline from the current 30% to 35% level to 20% (sic) [ 25% ] to 30% level in the next few years. However, if any special revenue growth opportunities comes along, we will certainly respond to it with appropriate CapEx.

First, some comments on the semiconductor market. We estimate the supply chain inventory at the end of 2017 to be still a few days above the seasonal normal level. We estimate that the total semiconductor market will grow 6% to 8% in 2018, 6% to 8% this year. The semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow by 5% to 7% this year, and total foundry revenue will grow by 9% to 10% this year. 
Now for TSMC, we expect 2018 TSMC revenue in U.S. dollars will grow by 10% to 15% over 2017, 10% to 15% in U.S. dollars over 2017. Our revenue seasonality will be similar to 2017, stronger in the second half than in the first half. Our revenue Y-o-Y, year-over-year growth rate now, however, will be stronger in the first half than in the second half. Basically, we expect the first half 2018 revenue growth rate in U.S. dollars will be slightly above 15% over the first half of 2017 and the second half 2018 growth rate to be slightly under 10% over the second half of 2017. All these are in U.S. dollars. So the slightly above 15% growth rate in the first half and the slightly under 10% growth rate in the second half make up the 10% to 15% total yield growth that I spoke about. Is that clear? Good. No worries [ around this ] -- everybody understands, okay. 
Our strong growth in 2018 is fueled by the growth of 3 of our growth platforms. Those 3 growth platforms that fuel our strong growth this year are the -- are high-performance computing, HPC, IoT and automotive. HPC will grow strongly due to continuing expansion of AI applications in all electronic devices and in continuing demand for cryptocurrency mining, GPU, et cetera. Mobile platform will be flat. And then, for the IoT and automotive platforms, there is considerable strength. You might describe this situation as the acceleration being enormous, but the velocity is still small. 
For the last 2 years, we've been planning 5% to 10% compounded annual growth rate in U.S. dollar revenue growth in the 2017 to 2021 period. We reaffirm that plan. In 2017, our revenue grew 9%.

You mentioned the wafer price impact. If you could give a broader picture on the other swing factors, a comment on depreciation, the 7-nanometer ramp; and FX, a view on that.

Number one is wafer price, we were just talking about that. The other one is the ramping of 7-nanometer. We expect ramping profile for 7-nanometer will be very similar to 10-nanometer at the same time, and that we expect the margin dilution for second half of this year will be 2 to 3 percentage point, which is also similar to 10-nanometer. Other than that, the foreign exchange is -- it can move positively or negatively. It's totally out of our control. I don't know what to say about that. Other than that, we have been doing all our effort trying to plan the capacity better, reduce the costs, improve the productivity, and that would hopefully we can offset some of the potential negative factors. But having said so, as we have said, TSMC's financial goal for revenue on the next few years will be 5% to 10%, and the gross margin will be about 50%. But of course, every quarter can be different. For example, the first quarter, as I just guided, actually included a -- about 2 percentage point inventory variations, which is a positive to first quarter.

Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter and followed by the guidance for the fourth quarter. 
Third quarter revenue in U.S. dollar reached $8.49 billion, which increased 8.1% sequentially, reflecting customers' new product launches using our 7-nanometer and a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Third quarter revenue came in stronger than the revised guidance that considered the impact from the August 3 virus incident as we were able to make up most of the delay in shipments. In NT dollars, revenue increased 11.6% sequentially. 
Compared with second quarter, gross margin decreased 0.4 percentage point to 47.4% as the unfavorable technology mix was partially offset by the profitability improvement in the back-end business, while the more favorable exchange rate offset the virus incident impact. 
Total operating expenses increased by TWD 1.7 billion. The increase was mainly for 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer-plus development. Thanks to operating efficiency, total operating expenses represented 10.8% of revenue versus 11.3% in the second quarter. So our operating margin improved 0.4 percentage point sequentially to 36.6%. 
On tax expenses, after a step-up in tax rate to 17.5% in the second quarter due to the accrual of retained earning tax, our effective tax rate fell back to 10% in the third quarter. We expect the full year tax rate to be about 12%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 3.44, and ROE was 23.2%. 
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the third quarter, Communication and Industrial/Standard increased 24% and 6%, respectively, while Computer and Consumer decreased by 35% and 1%, respectively. 
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology contributed 11% of total wafer revenue in the third quarter. 10-nanometer accounted for 6%, while the combined revenue from the 16- and 20-nanometer accounted for 25%. Advanced technologies, defined as 28-nanometer and more advanced technologies, accounted for 61% of the total wafer revenue. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 604 billion, a decrease of TWD 145 billion from last quarter, mainly as we paid out TWD 207 billion of cash dividend, while we borrowed TWD 43 billion short-term loans for hedging purpose. Correspondingly, current liabilities decreased by TWD 141 billion. 
On financial ratios. Accounts receivable turnover days remain at 38 days. Days of inventory decreased 1 day to 73 days due to stronger wafer shipment during the quarter. 
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 94 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 70 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 24 billion. After we paid out cash dividend and borrowed short-term loans, cash balance decreased by about TWD 143 billion to TWD 489 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, the capital expenditure spent in the first 3 quarters of 2018 totaled USD 6.7 billion.
I have finished my summary of financial. Now let me provide you the fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 9.35 billion and USD 9.45 billion, which is a 10.7% sequentially increase, at the midpoint of the guidance. Based on the exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 30.80, our fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be between 47% and 49%. Our fourth quarter gross margin -- our fourth quarter operating margin is expected to be between 36% and 38%. 
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about the near-term demand, inventory, capacity and CapEx. 
Now on the near-term demand and inventory. We conclude our third quarter with revenue of TWD 260.3 billion or USD 8.49 billion, which is above our revised guidance. According to the revised guidance, the computer virus incident on August 3 was estimated to have impacted our third quarter revenue by about 2% and gross margin by about 1 percentage point, respectively. However, we were able to make up about 75% of the affected shipments in the third quarter. So overall, our third quarter result was mainly driven by strong demand from product launches using our 7-nanometer technology.
Moving into fourth quarter, despite the current market uncertainties, our business will benefit from the continuous steep ramp of 7-nanometer for several high-end smartphones as well as the demand for 16/12-nanometer for the launches of new-generation GPU and AI. However, this growth will be partially offset by continued weakness in cryptocurrency mining demand and inventory management by our customers. 
Fabless DOI exiting third quarter '18 was several days above seasonal level, slightly higher than what we expected 3 months ago. We forecast fabless DOI to continue to stay at this above-seasonal level exiting 2018. 
Now let me make some comment about capacity and CapEx. At TSMC, we build our capacity according to customers' demand. We are continuing to increase 7-nanometer capacity to meet the strong customer demand. We reiterate our 2018 CapEx to be between USD 10 billion and USD 10.5 billion. 
In addition, as I have talked about before, although our leading [ Aegis ] capital cost continue to increase due to increasing process complexity, we are able to offset its impact to our CapEx by productivity improvements and further optimization of our capacity planning. Going forward, we expect annual CapEx needed to support our 5% to 10% revenue CAGR in U.S. dollar terms in the next few years will continue to range between USD 10 billion and USD 12 billion. 
I conclude my remarks. Let me turn the microphone to C.C.",950,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2018",2018-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5057.0,1574241.0,62105695.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with 2018 year's outlook. 
For the full year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow between 5% and 7%, while foundry is expected to grow between 6% and 7%. For TSMC, as Lora has just indicated, that our second half of 2018 business will be strongly supported by the 7-nanometer ramp-up, which is mainly driven by a few new smartphone launches. However, our business is also negatively impacted by further weakening of cryptocurrency mining demand. As a result, we estimate our 2018 growth rate will be about 6.5% in U.S. dollar term, which is close to the foundry industry's growth but slightly below our 7% to 9% guidance given in the last conference. 
Now let me update you about the August 3 virus incident. On August 3, TSMC experienced a computer virus outbreak, which affected a number of computer systems and fab tools. The infection was due to misoperation and insufficient firewall controls. We have since corrected this problem to ensure such viruses will not happen again in the future. Our remediate actions including the following: implementing an automated system to guarantee foolproof execution so that such misoperation will not happen again; enhanced firewall control for fab isolation; and network control to each individual computer. More enhancement now are ongoing, too, for further improved tool immunity against future infections. TSMC sets top priority for such security enhancement. 
Now let me talk about the N7 and N7+ and the EUV's progress. TSMC's N7 technology is now available for customers to unleash their innovations. This is the first time in the semiconductor industry the most advanced logic technology is available for all product innovations at the same time. We continue to work with many customers on N7, N7+ product design and expect to see more than 100 customer product tape-outs by end of 2019. We expect 7-nanometer to be a long node and check multiple waves of customer adoptions. 
N7+ is in risk production now. Since the N7+ has 15% to 20% better density and more than 10% lower power consumption, we are working with many customers for their second wave product design on N7+. Although the number of tape-outs today account for a small portion of the total 7-nanometer tape-outs, we expect the activity to pick up at a rapid pace in 2020 end of the year. Because the N7+ is using a few layers of EUV photolithography to have better cycle time and patent control, we have made a steady progress on EUV technology development towards high-volume production. Tool availability, EUV power, productivity, defect reduction, mask improvement, material and process optimization are all on schedule. A few customers has already made plans to adopt our N7+ in their 2019 products. 
Let me move to our N5 status. Our N5 technology development is on schedule. We have completed the design solution development and are ready for customers' design start. The N5 risk production schedule in first half 2019 stays the same. Compared to N7, TSMC's N5 deliver 1.8x to 1.86x logic area reduction and close to 15% to 18% speed gain and ARM A72 core. We expect to receive first customer product tape-outs in spring of 2019, followed by production ramp in first half 2020.
Now let me talk about the N28, N22 and mature node strategy. Due to faster-than-expected technology migration from 28-nanometer to 16-nanometer and below, 28-nanometer's overcapacity becomes an industry-wide phenomenon, and it's expected to last for a few years. TSMC's mature nodes' strategy is to work closely with our customers to develop specialty technology solutions to meet customers' requirement. For example, we continue to develop 22-nanometer for scaling benefit and better performance. We are also developing 22-nanometer for CMOS imaging sensor, MRAM and RRAM. For all mature nodes, TSMC will continue to develop a variety of special technologies, such as power management IC, Embedded Flash, imaging sensor, MEMS, to maintain output capacity loading rate and to increase our technology value to customers.
Now let me talk about advanced packaging update. TSMC has been developing advanced wafer-level packaging technologies to integrated advanced SoCs memories, integrate the passive device to enhance system performance. We believe our advanced packaging solutions will contribute to our business growth. We are now expanding the application of both cohorts and aim for -- especially for high-performance computing. Most of the cohorts products require integration of SoC with High Bandwidth Memory, HBM, in 3D stack. We are making good progress in qualifying multiple HBM sources through close collaboration with customers and the DRAM suppliers. We are also working with a few leading customer on SoIC, which stands for System on Integrated Chips, where multiple heterogeneous chip [ disk ] will be integrated with close proximity to deliver better performance. And we target to start production in 2021 time frame.

It does dilute our corporate margin level starting from the third quarter this year. Going to the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, the revenue contribution will be 20% -- more than 20% of our fourth quarter revenue. And the margin for 7-nanometer at the beginning stage is still below corporate average. So the dilution in the fourth quarter will be more severe than the third quarter. Our estimation is between 2 to 3 percentage point for fourth quarter gross margin.

So my second question is on N7 and N7+. Now TSMC appears to be in the best position to comment about the benefits of EUV given that you have N7 and N7+, one in production, one under production.

Wei,,Executives,97,"Okay, actually the question is about the EUV and how much of the benefit we can get from the EUV, right? Usually, if we are not using the EUV, sometimes for the very critical dimension on the N7, you have to -- or N7+, you have to use in the 4 layers of lithography to pattern one of the critical dimension. Now using the EUV, you're just using one layer so that you reduce the cycle time by 4x of photolithography, 4x of etch. Now you become 1 lithography, 1 etch. In total, how many layers we reduced? That depends on the customer's requirement, but usually I just give you a hint already, right, 4 layer can become 1 and we are replacing some of the 3 layers to become 1, and we have a few layers of that. So that give you a hint. Cycle time reduction, definitely because you do 4x into 1x, that's a big advantage. Productivity-wise, today, EUV is progress we will -- up to our expectation. And in fact, TSMC has turned on the 250-watt power and we believe we are the only one company continues to run the 250 watts EUV power so far today. Okay.",202,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And yes, a lot of specialty technology we are doing, I give you some example already, power management IC, CMOS, MEMS, everything. So that will help us to compete with our competitor. Actually, this kind of specialty technology particularly we have to work with the customer. And so that's why I say working with the customer to meet their requirement. And that, in turn, to keep TSMC's business. And that's a way that we migrate the technology -- pure logic technology to the more advanced node.

Because back end, the nature of back end is there's a very high asset turnover and lower margin compared with wafer. So the overall investment return is pretty good. If you look at ROIC, it's very good. So we don't compare back-end margin with corporate average. So if our back-end revenue continue to increase, it may dilute a little bit of corporate margin, but overall investment is pretty good, okay? And we have seen our advanced packaging.

Second follow-up is that I remember last quarter when, C.C., you talked about the 28-nanometer's outlook, you mentioned 2019 will come down and expect the recovery -- nice recovery in 2020 because of the 22-nanometer's adoption. So today, you just mentioned that you expect the overcapacity will be the norm for several years. So what I interpret is that it sounds to me, over the past 3 months, you've become more cautious, conservative on 28 compared to 3 months ago. Am I interpreting that right?",88,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

Wei,,Executives,171,"You may be right because recently, a lot of capacity has imbued on 28-nanometer as compared with 3 months, 6 months ago, right? So that mixed overcapacity a little bit more severe than previously predicted. However, I would like to stress again, I mean, that the TSMC developed shrink of the geometry for customer to gain the benefit of performance and better density. We also develop specialties. So that's why I say that we have confidence a couple of years later that our 28-nanometer will enter into a new era with a high inflation rate again.",96,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7
