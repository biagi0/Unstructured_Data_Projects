Wennink,,Executives,1,"Yes, let's start with the fourth quarter. Let's start with net sales. Net sales were -- came in about EUR 6.4 billion, which is at the midrange of our guidance. However, we were able to accelerate, what we call, fast shipments on deep UV also in Q4, which actually was quite a significant number because if you would add the fast shipments to the EUR 6.4 billion, then the normalized sales for Q4 would have been EUR 7.4 billion. 
Now for the total year, EUR 21.2 billion in sales, of which about EUR 3.1 billion of fast shipments went into 2023. So the net effect of the fast shipments plus the revenue of EUR 21.2 billion would give you a normalized revenue, if you would have booked the fast shipments as revenue, of EUR 24 billion, which is quite a significant increase as compared to last year. So that's on the system -- that's on the total sales. 
On Installed Base, about EUR 1.7 billion of Installed Base sales, which is higher than our guidance. That has to do with the fact that we had a pull-in of, what we call, field upgrades. And field upgrades from Q1 into Q4, which gave us an extra boost in sales in Installed Base. 
Now on the gross margin. The gross margin -- a good gross margin number, 51.5% in Q4. That is also the result of the pull-in of these field upgrades because they're high margin. And we had a one-off, which basically we got an insurance settlement on the Berlin fire which happened last year. So that was a one-off. So for the total year, 50.5% gross margin, pretty good. 
Net income, because that's a result of the gross margin and all the cost, EUR 1.8 billion in Q4 and EUR 5.6 billion for the year. On bookings, bookings were good in Q4. We booked over EUR 6 billion in terms of bookings, leading to a record backlog by the end of 2022 of over EUR 40 billion. We've never seen that before. So a record backlog. 
So if you peel it off and you look at the year and you look at the quarter that actually was quite a good year, good performance under some challenging circumstances.",377,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Yes, like I said, some challenging circumstances that we're currently facing. I mean, clearly, there's a fear of a recession, that's driven by high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical confrontations, discussions about export controls. On top of that, we see a weaker demand for consumer-related products such as smartphones and PCs. We see some lower growth rates in the data center domain, but strong demand and still in the industrial space, for instance, automotive. 
So all in all, if you look at the situation today, it's not a surprise that our customers are currently seeing inventories rise because we see a lower demand in some of these areas. So inventory for chips are going up. And also then the natural reaction, what customers are doing to actually swiftly turn that is to reduce the utilization of the machines in the installed base. This is what we're seeing. We're seeing that the utilization rates of our tools is going down. Our customers are swiftly adapting their output to reduce inventory. 
And by doing that, they hope and they expect that the industry will then recover in the second half of the year. Now that's being helped, potentially helped also by the recovery of the Chinese economy coming out of the COVID crisis. This is an expectation that the industrial activity and thereby semiconductors will actually go up again in the second half of the year. So all in all, customers are expecting a better second half of 2023. 
What does it mean to us? Basically, the situation for us is that the demand that we're currently seeing because of this is still much higher than what we can make. So why are we not affected then? Well, that's a very simple conclusion that the expectation of the duration of a potential recession in the minds of our customers is much shorter than the average lead time of our machines because they want to prepare, because of the strategic nature of our machines, for an upturn in the second half of the year and 2024. That means that the demand is still higher than what we can make. And that means that our plan is still to produce 60 EUV systems this year and 375 deep UV systems, about 25% immersion of that 375, which actually means that we will see a significant step up in the 2023 sales numbers. 
And if you split it out in -- over the different business sectors, then you'll see that EUV business will probably grow about 40%, the non-EUV business about 30%. Installed Base business will see some lower growth rates, it's logical. The utilization rates in the factories in the first half of this year will be down. So not a lot of field upgrades. It's about 5%. Now if we add all up, we think that 2023 could give us an increase in sales of more than 25% over 2022, which is a significant step-up from where we are today, which is under the circumstances, a pretty good foresight.",506,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,5,"Well, on Q1 -- basically, Q1 is also a reflection of a very strong Q4. And what I mean with this is that we expect sales between EUR 6.1 billion to EUR 6.5 billion, about EUR 1.5 billion of Installed Base sales. But like I said earlier, there has been, you could say, an acceleration of deep UV shipments from -- in Q4 that come from Q1. The same is true for field upgrades, so from Q1 2023 into Q4. So that is why we see the sales number not significantly higher than the fourth quarter. However, because we do see more than 25% increase for the total year, you could expect a growing quarterly sales numbers throughout this year. 
From a margin point of view in Q1, between 49% to 50%, that's basically the reflection of lower Installed Base business, basically because of the upgrades, which is high-margin business.",150,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I mean, we saw 50.5% for the total year 2022. Now there's a couple of building blocks for the gross margin in 2023. The first one is the volume, the higher volume. We have higher volume from '23 as compared to '22, which means that in EUV and in deep UV, we'll have a positive impact on the gross margin because of higher volume. 
On Installed Base, we see lower growth rates, as we explained. And we see then, I think, a lower level of field upgrades, which is high-margin business. So that could have a slightly negative effect on the gross margin for this year. 
Inflation, that's on people's mind. Now we do believe this year, we -- there will be kind of a net-zero effect because, yes, we'll have higher inflation costs, but also we have inflation compensation from customers. 
And then the last point, we do will see higher cost levels. It has to do with the build-out of the capacity that we need, not only for '23, but for '24 and '25. And that is the capacity build-out in EUV, in deep UV and in High-NA. That will lead to higher cost levels. 
So the year will start Q1 with gross margin between 49% and 50%, but that will gradually increase throughout the year. I'd like to add to that, that is, in fact, on the trajectory towards our gross margin that we gave as a guidance for '25 at our Capital Markets Day, which we believe by that time, 2025, will be between 54% and 56% and between 56% and 60% by 2030.

I think you said it's geopolitical. So we're business people. We're not politicians. So -- but I'd like to refer, I think there were some good comments made by our Dutch Prime Minister last week when he visited Washington and spoke to the U.S. President. Actually, a summary of his comments were, this is a multinational question that needs to be answered. It's an issue between several countries, not only the Dutch and the Americas, but several countries. 
And also, multiple companies are involved with a complex supply chain, upstream and downstream. It's a complex industry. In fact, what he said, ""It's a complex issue. It's a sensitive issue. There's a lot at stake. There's high economic stakes. So we have to find a balanced solution."" And that's I think where the politicians are. But I think it's a fair reflection of where we are. And I think there were some good comments made. 
Now of course, there have been media articles coming out that basically speculating and suggestions on what the potential outcome could be. But we just have to look at the facts. The facts are that nothing really changed since the October regulations that came out of the United States, which actually means that we can -- we will not ship EUV to China, for instance, but we can still ship deep UV and metrology and inspection tools. 
And any further speculation of what might the outcome be, I think, doesn't help. I mean we just have to wait for the governments and the politicians to keep talking and come to a reasonable solution. That's where we are today.",273,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Our capital allocation plans are actually quite consistent. We will generate a lot of cash because the company will grow quite substantially. And of course, we will first use our cash to build the business. And when we've done that, we'll use the cash to pay a growing dividend and any -- out of cash left, we will buy back shares.
Now on the dividend, we'll propose to the general meeting of shareholders, a closing dividend of EUR 1.69, which will bring the 2022 dividend to EUR 5.80. And for Q1, we're going to pay an interim dividend of EUR 1.37. Now that's for the dividend. 
On share buybacks, we've announced at the Capital Markets Day, our EUR 12 billion program for the next 3 years. And like I said, any excess cash when we use it for our business and pay the dividend, we'll use for the share buybacks.",151,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Wennink,,Executives,13,"Well, I think the medium- to longer-term future of the company is very bright. I mean, it has to -- it is driven by the fact that semiconductor applications are growing at a significantly accelerated speed. Think about the big societal problems, whether it's electrification, the digital revolution, it's the energy transition, everything you touch is semiconductors. 
And I think it's clear also the way that we look at the world, but also world analyst firms have looked into that this industry of our customers, the semiconductor industry, will grow to $1 trillion or $1 trillion-plus by 2030. It actually means that we need to be able to provide our customers with systems and with services that will help them to make that output. 
And that's also why, as we said at the Capital Markets Day, we will and we are continuously with our supply chain, investing for a capacity of 90 EUV systems and 600 deep UV systems by the 2025-2026 time frame and 20 High-NA systems, next-generation EUV by 2027-2028. So if we take it all together, that -- and then depending on whether we're in a high market or low market by 2025, we could be anywhere between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion in sales. And also depending on whether we will be in a lower or a higher market by 2030, we think we'll be between EUR 44 billion and EUR 60 billion sales by that time. 
So no matter how you look at it, semiconductors are positioned extremely well when it comes to growth, and helping some of the large and big solutions for the big problems that we all face. And I think so we are looking forward to a very bright future. And perhaps, yes, of course, there will be short-term issues that we have to deal with, but mid- to long-term, very bright future and very strong growth.",318,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the first quarter of 2023. 
Let me start with our fourth quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at EUR 6.4 billion, around the midpoint of our guidance. We shipped 18 EUV unit -- EUV systems and recognized EUR 2.3 billion revenue from 13 systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 4.7 billion, which was again driven by Logic at 64% with the remaining 36% coming from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.7 billion, which was higher than guided due to additional upgrade revenue. 
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.5%, which is above our guidance, primarily due to the pull-in of additional upgrade business as well as an insurance settlement from ASML Berlin fire, which occurred in early 2022.  
On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 906 million, above our guidance due to higher depreciation. SG&A expenses were EUR 280 million, higher than guided due to increased IT and recruiting spending as part of our headcount growth plan. 
Net income in Q4 was EUR 1.8 billion, representing 28.2% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.60. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 7.4 billion. 
Moving to the order book. Q4 net system bookings came in at EUR 6.3 billion, which is made up of EUR 3.4 billion for EUV bookings and EUR 2.9 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections. Non-EUV bookings are a combination of deep UV and metrology and inspection. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 66% of the bookings, while Memory accounted for the remaining 34%. 
Looking at the full year, net sales grew 14% to EUR 21.2 billion. EUV system sales grew 12% to EUR 7 billion realized from 40 systems while in total, we shipped 54 EUV systems in 2022. Deep UV system sales grew 13% to EUR 7.7 billion. Our metrology and inspection system sales grew 28% to EUR 660 million. 
Looking at the market segments for 2022. Logic system revenue was EUR 10 billion which is a 4% increase from last year. Memory system revenue was EUR 5.5 billion, which is a 34% increase from last year. Installed Base Management sales was EUR 5.7 billion, which is a 16% increase compared to previous year. 
At the end of 2022, we finished with a backlog of EUR 40.4 billion, an increase of 67% compared to the end of 2021. Our R&D spending increased to EUR 3.3 billion in 2022, as we continue to invest in innovation across our full product portfolio. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2022 sales were about 15%. SG&A increased to EUR 946 million in 2022, which was about 4% of sales. Net income for the full year was EUR 5.6 billion, 26.6% of net sales, resulting in an EPS of EUR 14.14. 
Improvements in working capital contributed to a free cash flow generation of EUR 7.2 billion for 2022, mainly driven by customer down payments following the very significant order intake this year. We continue to invest in support of our road map and planned capacity ramp. Excess cash will be returned to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2023. We expect Q1 net sales to be between EUR 6.1 billion and EUR 6.5 billion. Per customers' requests, we prioritized resources towards the acceleration of deep UV shipments at the end of 2022. As a result, we expect lower revenue in Q1 and higher revenue in the following quarters. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.5 billion. 
Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 49% and 50%. The lower margin relative to last quarter is primarily due to lower upgrade revenue and deep UV mix effect. 
The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around EUR 965 million, and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 285 million. The higher R&D guidance is primarily due to additional headcount and labor cost increases. These investments are in support of our continuous innovation as we further expand our deep UV, EUV and applications road map and, at the same time, work to improve our installed base performance. Higher SG&A is mainly due to additional headcount and IT spending. 
Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. In Q4, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of EUR 1.37 per ordinary share. The third quarterly interim dividend will be EUR 1.37 per ordinary share and will be made payable on February 15, 2023. Recognizing this interim dividend and the 2 interim dividends of EUR 1.37 per ordinary share paid in 2022, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of EUR 1.69 per ordinary share. 
In Q4 2022, we purchased around 0.6 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 300 million. ASML announced a new share buyback program during our Investor Day on November 11, 2022, to be executed by December 31, 2025. We intend to purchase shares up to an amount of EUR 12 billion. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",917,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. And as Roger has highlighted, we had a year of record sales in a dynamic environment. Demand remains strong and we finished the year with a record backlog. 
And looking to 2023,  there continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the market due to a number of global macro concerns around inflation, rising interest rates, recession and the geopolitical environment, including export controls. Customers are still seeing demand weakness in consumer-driven end markets, the most notable with PCs and smartphones, with some indication of softening or lower growth rates in data center demand, while the demand strength continues in other markets such as automotive and industrial. 
Customers are telling us they expect a rebalancing of semiconductor inventories over the first half of 2023, with business expected to rebound in the second half of the year. A potential driver of this recovery in the second half of the year could also be the post-COVID opening of China. This could have a positive effect on both supply and demand. 
To help rebalance inventory levels, customers are running their lithography systems at lower utilization levels and some have also lowered their CapEx plan for this year. 
Based on this, we concluded that most of our customers have made the assessment that the duration of a potential recession is significantly shorter than our average delivery lead time. On top of this, lithography investments are strategic in nature, which means that the demand for our systems remain strong. For instance, this year, demand still exceeds our capacity, and we enter the year with a backlog of EUR 40.4 billion, so our focus will still be on maximizing system output. 
We've experienced several quarters of very strong bookings, which now provides backlog coverage significantly beyond 2023, which is almost twice the expected 2023 system sales. Based on discussions with our customers and continued improvements in the capability of our supply chain, we are planning to increase our output capability this year. We're planning to ship around 60 EUV systems and around 375 deep UV systems in 2023, with around 25% of the deep UV systems to be immersion. We still plan a significant number of fast shipments this year, which under the current way of working will result in a similar amount of delayed revenue out of 2023 that came into 2023. 
Looking at the growth of the business for the full year 2023 compared to 2022. We expect EUV revenue growth of around 40% and non-EUV revenue growth of around 30%. And for the Installed Base Management business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of around 5%. And as we are coming off a strong growth year in 2022 and customers are adjusting their utilization levels, we currently expect to see a slightly lower demand in our upgrade business in 2023. 
In summary, for the full year 2023, based on how we see the world today, we expect another year of strong growth with a net sales increase of over 25% and a slight improvement in gross margin. On the geopolitical front, as it relates to export control, this continues to be a geopolitical discussion with different government entities, a process where ASML is obviously not in control although we continue the discussion with governments to make sure that consequences of proposals are well understood. 
As of today, export control policy related to lithography equipment has not changed. We are still not able to ship EUV systems to China, but are able to ship deep UV as well as metrology and inspection systems to China. As our Prime Minister recently stated, this is a multinational discussion, not only with the U.S., but with several countries. He reiterated that multiple companies in the semiconductor industry, including their supply chains, are involved and that the matter is complex and sensitive. It needs careful handling with precision. And he reminded us there is a lot of interest at stake, and it's important to find the right balance. We will therefore not speculate about the possible outcome but will have to wait for the outcome of ongoing government discussions. 
Looking longer term, we talked at our Investor Day last year about the global megatrends, where the broadening application space is fueling demand for advanced and mature nodes. Secular growth drivers in semiconductor end markets and increasing lithography intensity on future technology nodes are driving the demand for our products and services. ASML and its supply chain partners are actively adding capacity to meet future customer demand as confirmed at Investor Day, with our capacity plans of 600 deep UV, 90 EUV low-NA systems by 2025-'26 and 20 EUV high-NA systems by '27-'28. 
Also presented during our Investor Day last November, we see an opportunity based on different market scenarios to reach an annual revenue in 2025 between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion and in 2030, an annual revenue between EUR 44 billion  and EUR 60 billion. 
Part of our long-term growth opportunity, we also remain committed to our ambitious ESG sustainability goals. On February 15, 2023, our 2022 annual report will be published. As part of this report, we plan to provide you with an update on how we collaborate with our stakeholders to deliver on the ambitions of our ESG Sustainability strategy, which we can summarize as follows: our ambition is to achieve carbon neutrality with net zero emissions in our operations, Scope 1 and 2 by 2025; we aim to achieve net zero emissions in our supply chain, Scope 3, by 2030; and net zero emissions from the use of our products by our customers, Scope 3, by 2040.  In addition, our goal is also to have zero waste from operations to landfill and incineration by 2030. 
From a social perspective, our ambition is to ensure that responsible growth benefits everyone. To maintain our fast pace of innovation and ensure our long-term success as a company, we need to attract and retain the best talent and provide the best possible employee experience. We aim to be a valued and trusted partner, improving the quality of life for all people in our communities. 
In summary, while there's a lot of near-term uncertainty in the current environment, our customers' demand for our products continues to exceed supply. We're working to increase our capacity to meet our customers' future demand, and we're fully confident in the opportunity this provides for our future growth. 
With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",1078,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I mean we've not made that -- Joe, thanks for the question. We've not been explicit on that. We think that in the current environment, with all the dynamics and all the uncertainty that are out there and also the fact that we still look at 2023 as a year where we are supply constrained. We don't think that, that makes a lot of sense to guide around that. So that's why we said we're going to guide on [indiscernible] so EUV versus -- EUV and non-EUV, but we think it is not very constructive and meaningful to provide guidance on Memory versus Logic. 
I mean clearly, if you look at the recent order intake, you do see that Memory is far from that. As a matter of fact, you see Memory actually picking up in the quarter and quite healthy in the year. And that tells you that the Memory buyers are also making strategic investments because they recognize that if at a certain point in time, the market is going to come back, they need capacity. So that's what you see in the order intake. But again, for the full year, given an indication of the distribution over Logic and Memory, we thought it was a meaningless action in light of the dynamics that I just talked about.",221,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

As you know, we've been through this before. We're having good discussions with customers. As you know, legally, the way the backlog is construed, we've agreed on a price. So this is just a matter of discussions with customers about a fair distribution of the burden. 
We're fairly advanced in that discussion. A number of customers have already made commitments to us on how they're going to contribute, with most other customers who are fairly advanced and are -- we think that we're going to find a solution. It's only a minority of customers that are not open to this conversation. So the lion's share is open to the conversation.  But it really is in the spirit of finding a fair distribution of the inflation burden. So that has helped. And we're only putting into the backlog those inflation adjustments that have been explicitly agreed with customers. So more of that is to come because, as I said, we have a number of customers who are still in negotiations. So all of that is coming. 
I think the way it's going to pan out without really quantifying it, but just to give you an indication, as you know, last year, we said that we were having about 1.5% drag on the gross margin coming from inflation. I would say most of that is -- we expect to recover during the year. So most of the inflation that we incurred over 2022, I think most of that we will recover. But of course, there will be inflation in 2023, and that will remain a drag on the gross margin. So the gross margin impact of inflation will be less so than it was last year. But in comparison to 2021, you will still see a bit of a drag on the gross margin coming from inflation.",307,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Good question, C.J. Yes, I think in the discussion with customers, it's exactly what I said. It's very clearly, we concluded from the discussions that customers believe. And I think it's also you can corroborate those statements with their public statements and basically saying some of the customers feel that they see a recovery towards the second half of this year. And that actually means that they tell us, ""Listen, we know you guys are short of the demand we put on you.""  So that means that we don't want to risk our strategic investments, which go beyond the first half of 2023, moving into '24 and '25. So this is what that -- we're really having this midterm to long-term discussion with them of what's needed. And that's why they keep saying, ""No, we need those machine."" Having said that, of course, last year, we kept informing you that the demand on us significantly exceeded our build capacity, sometimes to 40%, 50%. 
Now that demand did come down. I mean that's also clear that some of that demand disappeared because of the market situation. But the end result is that the demand -- the cumulative demand is still higher than what we can make. So this is where we are. And I think that is driven by what I said that I think the average expectation on the duration of the downturn of, let's say, working through the inventory is significantly shorter than the average lead time of our tools. I think -- and that gives us a lot of visibility into 2024 also. Customers give us orders throughout the year, very significant levels of orders, which actually have over EUR 40 billion in the backlog, which is almost twice the system sales that we expect to have in 2023. 
So yes, we have the visibility. And it still means that the customer expansion plans on adding that capacity in 2024 are still very real. Otherwise, you wouldn't give us these orders with down payments. So this is the level of visibility that we have. Now all of course hinges on the macroeconomic situation. Finally, you could say the expectation that the duration of any recession, if it would come, would indeed be short. I mean that's the big question mark that is out there for all of us. But this is where we are today. And we're just telling you what the discussions with our customers are currently at, and they are exactly what I just told you. So this is the level of visibility that we have, and always just a matter of watching the macroeconomic situation.",441,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think there seems to be quite a lot of confusion around fast shipment. So maybe Peter or Roger, if you could set the record straight. Number one, is it fair to assume that your calendar year '23 guide does not include any fast shipments, either on revenue or on gross margins? And then number two, if that's correct, when do you think you could get clarification from your accountants that, that could become the norm? I mean is that something tied to the sign-up of the accounts for 2022? Or is that a completely unrelated decision? I've got a quick follow-up.",107,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Thanks for the question. I think this is helpful to indeed clarify that. So what you saw is that we're having -- that we had fast shipments for an amount of EUR 3.1 billion at the end of 2022. So the revenue for that will be recorded in 2023. However, we also assume that a similar amount will go from '22 to '23 -- from '23 to '24. And what that means, Didier, is that the guidance or the more than 25% growth over 2022 that we've given you, that in fact, treats the fast shipment effect as neutral, right? So we assume that, that will be neutral, i.e., the amount that comes in to '23, the EUR 3.1 billion, we also expect that to leave the year into '24. So it's neutralized for the fast shipment, so that's the way to look at it. 
The question on can you change the revenue recognition. As we mentioned before, there are 2 key elements in here. One is an accounting element, so to what extent can you get this done. But pivotal for the accounting treatment of fast shipments is that customers are actually upon shipments are going to accept the full risk on the tool. That's what is pivotal. So the conversation that we need to have with customers and need their final blessing on is that based on a far more limited testing protocol, because that's what fast shipment in essence is. It's a far more limited testing protocol where there's a couple of weeks of testing that we actually omit out of the sequence, that based on a far more limited testing sequence, they still assume the full risk of the tool upon shipment. So that's the conversation that we need to have. And you will appreciate that that's a conversation that, of course, customers need to really look into and become comfortable with. 
So that's not a 5-minute conversation. We're now done with the accounting analysis, so the accounting analysis in and by itself is clear, but it all hinges on the premise of being able to get to an agreement with customers on what I just told you. So those conversations were now starting. Cannot tell you when that is done. In all likelihood, I would say, by mid this year, we should have clarity on whether customers are willing to do that or not. It could also be that some customers are going to accept it, others could not. 
And then once we have that clarity, of course, we will share that with you, and we'll also clarify to you what that means. To the extent that we would be able to recognize revenue again upon shipment for these fast shipments, of course, that would be additional to the more than 25% revenue growth that we've mentioned.",475,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So if a customer says, ""Sorry, we want to reallocate, I want to push it back to 2024,"" then that slot will be taken by a customer that raises their hand and says, ""Ship it to me."" And that's what we will do. So that slot will be taken. 
And that means that the slot that the customer says, well, I have an order for -- okay, please pull it -- push it back. We just need to negotiate when that pushback is because that pushback could fall into a period which is already fully booked. So this is then fine, if you don't want to do it then. It actually means that it's a kind of a negotiation when it's the first open spot in 2024. That's how it works.

I think it's not only applicable to China, what I'm going to say. I mean it's applicable to all our Chinese customers and, as a matter of fact, non-Chinese customers also. You need to realize that -- and you actually know that, Francois, I mean, planning and building and executing a new fab is a matter of years. So that means that anything that we shipped this year has been planned in 2021, 2020. 
So these plans are there, and we just execute on those plans. Now having said that,  it's also clear that we have a demand -- we have a capacity shortage. So we have an over-demand that indeed, when we reallocate, which is true for Chinese and non-Chinese customers, where we have a bit more space to reallocate, then we will reallocate because the demand has been higher than our capacity. So yes, that's true for Chinese and non-Chinese customers. We treat all the customers the same in that way. 
So I think we haven't seen any acceleration with just the execution of the plans because those plans are planned for years. You cannot just think of as semi fab and it exists in 6 months' time. So this is why it's just planned. But yes, you will probably see open spots, if you could call it this way or pushbacks of it.

I understand last year and into this year, customers are scrambling to get litho tools and, therefore, they're willing to take fast shipments. In an ideal world, you'd like fast shipments, too. But if things do slow down a little bit, do customers really want fast shipment?

And that's whether it's fast ship or a regular ship, they don't care. Now we did the fast shipment because we're late, and we were late and the demand was higher than what they -- what we could make. And this actually is a driver for still the fast shipment this year because our demand is higher than what we can make. That has changed. 
So if the customer says you can ship the tool, as long as they know the date of which the tool will arrive, it can be installed and can be signed off. That's the date that they're actually interested in. And as we see it today, there is still a higher demand than what we can make. So it's the same situation.",155,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And then secondly, a housekeeping item, just on OpEx. You've guided for 1Q, which is perhaps a little bit higher than expected. Can you help us put in context what that means for full year OpEx?

I'll do the first part of the question, and Roger will take the second part. I think on the 30% excess, the amount of supply actually is more like 50%. So now that has come down, but it's still significantly double digit above our capacity. So -- and like I said earlier in an answer to an earlier question, yes, of course, we also see the reflection of the demand curve because of the weakness in, for instance, the consumer demand clearly. So some of that over-demand has gone away, but it's still there. And it was actually not 30%, it was more like 50%. And it's come down now to -- it's still significantly double digit.

Alexander, on the OpEx question, I think the numbers that we gave you are, I think, a pretty good proxy for the full year. I think what I -- if you take them together, it's close to 19% that I would model for OpEx, so for SG&A and R&D combined for the full year. 
Of course, we had significant hiring in the course of Q4. Those people are added to the year, if you like, in terms of headcount. Of course, we had increases in wages. And of course, that kicks in from Q4 to Q1. But that's the rate I would assume for the full year. In terms of what do we get for that, very good question. So on the SG&A side, obviously, this is in line with the growth of the company. So you continue to see us operate around 4%-ish SG&A percentage of sales. 
As you also would have seen, if you look at the 2025 and 2030 scenarios that we've talked about, you see it coming down a little bit, and that's clearly the intention to get some operational leverage there. But for the fast-growing company that we are, investments like these are necessary to make sure that the organization has run in a very professional way, that security is up to scratch, that the IT support for our professionals is up to scratch, et cetera, et cetera.  So that's what we're doing on the SG&A side. 
On the R&D side, this really is the very, very aggressive road map that we have on all cylinders. So this is deep UV. And as Peter mentioned earlier on,  this is not just a deep UV on the immersion side where we continue to drive immersion but also, this is on the -- on the dry side, KrF. So for KrF, we continue to drive road maps for smaller customers on the XT platform for larger customers operating large fabs on an NXT platform. We're looking at i-Line road maps. We have a very broad road map that we have on metrology and inspection. And obviously, we continue to drive both low-NA and high-NA. So it's a very extensive road map, more extensive than we've ever had before in the history of the company. 
And of course, all of this is conducive to the goals that we've been talking about and the scenarios that we've been talking about at the Investor Day for 2025 and 2030. So yes, definitely significant investment, but definitely rewarding if you look at the potential that we see in the market for those products.",433,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I think what we definitely see in the discussion with the customers, they are addressing the short-term challenges, it's just clear. I mean they basically say, ""No, we need to -- we see inventories rising. We need to rebalance the inventory. So how do you do that?"" So you just lower the utilization of the tools. That's short term, they're very clear. They're also very clear about their confidence in the long-term growth trajectory of the industry and of the need for significantly more semiconductors in all kinds of applications. 
I think it's without any exception, customers are talking about the medium- to long-term growth trajectory of the industry. That hasn't changed. It is also why, of course, there are short-term concerns like always short-term concerns. They say, ""What am I going to do short term that will not impact my long-term targets?"" That's basically the question, what they have. That's why, yes, some of them have adjusted their CapEx plans, but they say, ""What is absolutely essential to secure our long-term growth path?"" We will still do, which of course, this is why litho is a very strategic tool. This is why the litho orders keep coming. 
So in that sense, yes, things have changed short term, and they are reacting. But longer term, and in the CMD, the Capital Markets Day, we didn't talk about Q4 or Q1. We talked about 2025 and 2030. And that's exactly the discussion we're having with customers. I would even say that the longer-term road map this time with our large customers have intensified to a level we have not seen before. 
So like I said earlier, it's not getting easier, it's getting more complex. But it also means that the [ cooperation ] models that we have with our key customers are actually intensifying. And that just confirms not only the technology road map, but it also confirms the capacity plans that they have and the confidence we both have in the growth of this industry.

The significant growth that you have guided for in 2023, which admittedly is aligned with some of the points you made at the Capital Markets Day, but clearly, that's where I feel investors also need the greatest -- need to see the greatest level of comfort. 
So could you give us a sense on the DUV drivers, your level of confidence in the demand, the level of discussions you are having around lagging edge?

Yes, I think you have to realize, and it goes back to what I said earlier, that the biggest shortage in terms of demand -- or let's say, shortage in terms of capacity or shipment was in deep UV. So there is a backlog of deep UV investments that were planned by customers that we're now able to fulfill. You should not underestimate the size of the gap in deep UV, which is one element. And that's especially true for those geographic areas where we cannot ship EUV, but deep UV is the, as you could say, the workhorse for the mature and less critical semiconductors, i.e., China. So that space, let's say, is strong. 
On top of that, if you have more EUV sales, well, you don't make a chip for a semiconductor device with only EUV. I mean so if you grow the EUV base,  we need a lot of deep UV layers. While the layer growth, nodal node is there, as it's always been there. So this is also an extra driver against the background of the fact that we can't ship enough. So this is what is happening. There are very few customers, which by the way, when you look at the industrial domain and you look at, for instance, some of the smaller IDMs, smaller -- I don't need to -- but it's important customers, but have just simply don't buy the same quantities as the 3 or 4 large customers. 
There in the industrial domain, they still call me and tell me, ""Where is my deep UV tool?"" And up to tools, multiple, yes? That's also happening. So it's the shortage that's still there. And it's, of course, I fully understand from an investor point of view to say, yes, but we also see the weakness in the consumer markets, we see inventories going up. 
But in a specific domain, anywhere between 45- and 20-nanometer, it's still short. And definitely in certain  industrial domains like automotive and just industry in general. So this is still there. And this is why there are a couple of drivers. Like I said, it's, of course, China. It's -- EUV will need deep UV, and it's the deep UV OEMs that are in the sweet spot of where the shortage is. And then these are the reasons.",390,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Very helpful, Peter. And as a second question, if I may go back to the topic of the gross margin evolution over the course of 2023. You've talked about a gradual improvement over 2022. At the same time, looking at your top line guidance, it seems like your ASPs are going to rise over the course of 2023. You obviously have greater operating leverage. Is the mix effect so strong, that's triggering this incremental step-up in gross margin? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what that incremental step-up is going to be in '23? And what are the headwinds which are offsetting some of the tailwinds you have highlighted earlier?",115,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,55,"Yes, Amit, let me take that one. So many moving parts to the gross margin. We already alluded to one, which is the inflation one. So on inflation, it's important to recognize, yes, on the one hand, we will get some compensation. Yes, that will lead to an increase in ASP, but we're also getting inflation on the cost side, both on parts and on labor. So net-net, that will still be -- that will be an improvement over the 1.5% negative that we talked about last year, but it's still a drag on the gross margin in comparison to, for instance, what we had in 2021, but still an improvement over the year. So that's one element. 
The second element, of course, the fast shipment. Last year, we had a drag of 1.5% on the fast shipment. Of course, that drag is gone because as I mentioned, we expect the fast shipment amount coming into the year to also lose out of the year. So that 1.5% drag is gone. So that's also a positive in comparison to last year. 
Then volume goes up, both on the EV side and on the deep UV side, so that gives you a bit of a positive. Mix effect in the deep UV business is slightly negative because of the increase in the dry business that we also talked about. So that's a slight negative. And then there are 2 big ones to bear in mind. 
First off, as you would have seen, we're pretty cautious, if you want to call it that way, on the installed base business. And of course, you can assume that the service business will continue to grow. So then if we only guide 5% increase on the total installed base business, that implies that the upgrade business that we have in there is actually contracting. So that might -- that's up for speculation because that's the one that's hardest to plan for reasons that we talked about before. But we assume that the upgrade business will be lower and that, of course, is a big drag on the gross margin. 
And then the last element in the gross margin, and that's important to recognize, and we've been talking about this before, but I just want to emphasize it. We are incurring significant costs in our operations as it relates to preparing for both high-NA and preparing for the big step changes that we're making in our capacity. 
Do not underestimate that. That's a significant number. It's an even bigger number than it was last year. And of course, that continues until the point in time where the capacity is built and will be fully utilized or -- and/or high-NA is going to be utilized. So that's a drag that we continue to have, and it's bigger, as I mentioned, in '23 and -- than it was in '22. So those are the moving parts. 
That's why we say, if you add it all up, we're talking about a slight improvement over last year. I think it's important to note, Amit, that if you look at all of that, a number of the negatives will be gone, let's say, in the '25 time frame. And that's why Peter also reiterated in his video that we believe the 54% to 56% is still there because at that point in time, the capacity is there and should also be utilized. And the same high-NA at that point would be up and running. And also potentially, the installed base business at that point would be normalized.

What we said is there will be a point in time where you will also see EUV system gross margin getting closer and closer to the immersion business. There, I think the introduction of the 3800 is going to be a big one. So the introduction of the E model, the 3800E, by the end of this year even though, as we mentioned, it's only less than a handful this year. So the impact on the year will be small.

Thanks, Aleksander. So as I mentioned, gradually, over these calls, we've increased the ASP of the D model that we've given to you. So it started with EUR 160 million and we said use EUR 165 million, and I just said, use somewhere between EUR 165 million and EUR 170 million. You're right that if you just calculate the ASP in the quarters in 2022, sometimes you've got to some higher numbers. But the reason that, that was the case, as we've also explained on previous calls, those were one-offs as a result of revenue deferrals that were in there. So sometimes, that led to a remeasurement of those deferrals. And that then sometimes, because we're also looking at distributing those adjustments over a very limited number of tools, that could actually have quite a significant impact. But we've always said normalize that, don't take for granted that those numbers are the right numbers to use on a go-forward basis. 
So it's not that anything bad happened. As a matter of fact, something good happened because systemically, I think the ASP on the D has gone up. As it relates to the pricing of the E, yes, I mean, definitely, we're still sharing value with the customers. I mean that's a fundamental principle in the way we do business with our customers. We want to make sure that the incremental value that the tool provides over the predecessor tool is being fairly shared between the customer and ourselves. So that promise has not changed. 
If you look at the way that pans out because you need to recognize value is a whole bunch of things, value is better imaging quality, value is better overlay, value is higher productivity. If you add it all up, then in the past, you saw a pretty strong correlation between improvement in productivity and ASP increase. And that historically, on EUV, there was sort of a near 100% correlation there. 
As you know, ultimately, on the 3800E, we'll see an improvement in productivity, 160 wafers per hour to 220. That will be in stages, but ultimately the 220 is the stage that we'll get to. So that definitely means that we're going to have a pretty significant improvement of the ASP. And I think that, that also should play out in your models.",389,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,68,"And in addition to that, it doesn't mean that this goes without any cost increase. I mean it's not that go down straight down to the bottom line. Why? Because the 3800, as we mentioned in many occasions, actually sees the first introduction of technology that we are applying in the high-NA tool.  So there is also a sort of new stages, so it's also a cost element there. So it's not a one-to-one increase in ASP going to the gross margin. But yes, you'll see gross margin increase, but also a cost increase because we are using the latest and greatest technology out of high-NA backported into the 3800.

Net sales for the quarter came in at EUR 6.7 billion, higher than guided primarily as a result of higher EUV and deep UV revenue, both driven by faster insulation in the field of our systems and also driven by, in a number of cases, earlier acceptance of the tool by our customers. Included in the EUR 6.7 billion is EUR 1.4 billion of installed base revenue. That is lower than we guided and that is primarily as a result of lower upgrade demand from our customers. 
Fast shipment, obviously, a topic that we have been talking about quite a bit in previous quarters. As you might recall, we had EUR 3 billion of delayed revenue from shipments coming out of Q4 into Q1. At the end of Q1, we have about EUR 1.5 billion of delayed revenue that is going to be recognized in subsequent quarters. Why lower? Why EUR 1.5 billion versus the EUR 3 billion? A couple of reasons. One reason is actually what I discussed earlier on, which is the earlier acceptance of the customer and the faster installation. 
But also, as you might recall, we said that in Q4, we really prioritized shipment over system starts. And why was that?  A, because customers were asking for it. They wanted to have the tools earlier. And secondly, also for operational efficiency reasons. Gross margin for the quarter of 50.6%, again higher as a result of the things I just mentioned. So higher because of higher EUV revenue and higher immersion revenue. A little bit compensated by the fact that we had lower upgrade business. So that gets you to the 50.6%. 
Net income for the quarter, EUR 2 billion and the order intake for the quarter at EUR 3.8 billion. That is lower than what you would have seen in previous quarters. But quite frankly, that was expected, a, given the current business environment and also given the fact that we're still looking at an order book at the end of this quarter of EUR 39 billion which is give and take 2x the system sales that we expect for this year.",357,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,5,"We continue to see the macro trends that we talked about last time. So higher interest rates, inflation, fear of recession in some parts of the world and the geopolitical attention. So they continue to be there. If you then translate that to the semiconductor space, we do see in certain segments and certain end market segments and we do see that the industry is trying to manage the inventory levels down. 
So how does that translate into litho demand is then the question? Well, I think what we noticed is that some major customers are indeed delaying the timing of their demand for certain tools. So that happens whilst we see other customers actually picking up that shift. So in that sense, for us, we still end up in a situation that supply is still the main constraint that we have. So demand is still higher than supply, albeit at a slightly lower cushion level, if you like, than we had last quarter, but it's clearly still there. So the #1 objective for us is still to make sure that we optimize the supply and that indeed we can deliver and that we can live up to the expectations that are out there. 
If you then look specifically at a different segment. For both memory and logic customers, we do see customers making the strategic investments for technology transition. So that is clearly happening. For memory customers, we do see them limiting their CapEx, lowering their wafer output, which clearly is driving towards lowering the inventory level in the entire system. We see some of that behavior also in certain segments of logic. But quite frankly, we're also in logic, see that in certain segments, demand remains very, very strong, particularly, I would say, in the space of mature nodes and then particularly where that requires deep UV. 
Specifically as it relates to China, as you would have seen, China accounted for about 8% of system sales in Q1. We also told you last time that China accounts -- domestic China accounts for more than 20% in our backlog, and that continues to be the case at the end of the -- for the backlog at the end of Q1. So I think it's reasonable to assume that we will see a commensurate allocation to Chinese customers for the entire year. So that means that you will see a significant pickup of the sales into domestic China for the quarters to come this year.",415,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So as we said before, we expect that we are going to ship around 60 EUV systems, around 375 deep UV systems, of which about 25% immersion. And that continues to be our expectation. And that translates into the growth numbers that we gave you last time, which is 40% growth in EUV, 30% growth in the non-EUV business and around a 5% increase in the installed base business. And that all translates into a growth expectation for the year in comparison to 2022 of more than 25%. 
Underlying assumption there is that the fast shipment value that we received from 2022 and 2023 will be similar to what we see in getting out of the year -- out of '23 into '24, so about a EUR 3 billion number.

And our interpretation of advanced immersion tools would be for the NXT 2000 and subsequent versions.

Dassen,,Executives,11,"And that is what we said last quarter is the guidance that we would still provide, which is that we expect gross margin to end up slightly higher than what we had in 2022. Again, just as a reminder, the puts and takes to that. So on EUV, we expect a higher number of shipments. We mentioned the 60 -- about 60 shipments before. And we expect that to have a positive impact on gross margin. 
On deep UV, same story there. We expect a higher number of deep UV revenue in this year, and that would be a positive. A slight negative would be the mix within deep UV. But nonetheless, for deep UV, we expect the gross margin on balance to be slightly up from last year. 
Installed base business, there, we expect the gross margin to be going down a little bit, and that's because of, as we discussed earlier on that we expect the upgrade business to be a little less than last year. 
We also talked quite a bit about inflation.  We are getting from quite a few customers, we are getting inflation compensation. So that's a good thing, but inflation continues to be there. So I still expect a small drag, if you like, on the gross margin number as a result of inflation. And then very importantly, as you know, we continue to build towards increasing capacity. So we have the 90 EUV capacity looking for by the 2025 time frame and the 600 deep UV capacity that we're aiming for, so we continue to prepare for that. 
We also, as you know, are preparing for the introduction of High-NA. And all the preparatory work that is going on there, that continues to be a drag on the gross margin. So if you take all of those elements together, that leads to our expectation of a slight improvement of the gross margin in comparison to last year. And once again, I think that positions us very nicely for expectations that we guided earlier on in terms of gross margin by 2025, between 54% and 56% and between 56% and 60% by 2030.",359,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,13,"I mean we continue to expect significant generation of cash in the years to come and the policy hasn't changed. And the policy, just as a reminder, whatever cash is being generated, first off, we will apply that to the business needs, so whatever CapEx or whatever we would need that will be funded from the free cash flow that is being generated by the business. Whatever remains will be available to the shareholders, and that will be available through a combination of growing dividends and then whatever is available, would be allocated to share buyback. 
If you look at the current environment and the current environment in the semiconductor industry that we talked about earlier on, you do see that all the elements, all the players in the value chain, they're really managing their cash quite diligently. So I think it's fair to assume that, that will have some negative impact on our free cash flow generation in the year. And also, in the current environment, we believe it is prudent that we maintain a higher level of cash than you would typically see us do. So that's a combination, I think, that we're looking at. 
As it relates to dividends, we paid an interim dividend in this -- in Q1 of EUR 1.37 per ordinary share. And that was -- as it relates to 2020 -- to the year 2022, that was the third interim dividend that we paid for the same amount, so 3x EUR 1.37. And that means that we're going to propose to the AGM to pay a final dividend of EUR 1.69 per ordinary share.",272,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

That also means that we continue to drive the capacity expansions that we've talked about before, 90 EUV, 600 deep UV systems. So we continue to be on that track working very, very closely with our supply chain to get that done.

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the first quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2023. Let me start with our first quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at EUR 6.7 billion, which was above our guidance due to higher-than-expected EUV and deep UV revenue from faster installation and earlier acceptance of systems in the quarter. 
We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized EUR 2.9 billion revenue from 17 systems this quarter. Net system sales were at EUR 5.3 billion, which was again driven by logic at 70% with the remaining 30% coming from memory.
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.4 billion, which was lower than guided due to less upgrade revenue. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 50.6%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by additional EUV and deep UV immersion revenue in the quarter, which more than outweighed the impact of lower-than-expected upgrade business. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 948 million, which was below our guidance primarily due to exchange rate effects and some one-offs.  
SG&A expenses were EUR 260 million, also lower than guided primarily due to lower IT spending and timing of headcount additions. Net income in Q1 was EUR 2 billion, representing 29% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.96. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 6.7 billion. Moving to the order book.  
Q1 net system bookings came in at EUR 3.8 billion, which is made up of EUR 1.6 billion for EUV bookings and EUR 2.2 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 79% of the bookings, while memory accounted for the remaining 21%. Bookings are lower than in previous quarters, which is not unexpected given the current environment, particularly taking into account our backlog at end of Q1 of around EUR 39 billion, which is almost 2x this year's system sales.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2023. We expect Q2 net sales to be between EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 7 billion. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.3 billion. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around EUR 990 million, and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 275 million. The higher R&D guidance is primarily due to investments in support of our continuous innovation as we further extend our product road maps and improve our installed base performance.  
Higher SG&A is mainly due to additional headcount and associated infrastructure support. Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. In Q1, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of EUR 1.37 per ordinary share. Recognizing the 3 interim dividends of EUR 1.37 per ordinary share, each paid in 2022 and 2023, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of EUR 1.69 per ordinary share. This will result in a total dividend for the year 2022 of EUR 5.80 per ordinary share, which is a 5.5% increase compared to 2021. 
In Q1 2023, we purchased around 0.7 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 400 million. In the current uncertain market environment, it is prudent that we continue to manage higher levels of cash as the entire value chain will likely create some pressure on our free cash flow. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",625,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had a good first quarter, above our guidance in a very dynamic environment. And there continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the market due to a number of global macro concerns around inflation, rising interest rates, recession and the geopolitical environment, including export controls. Customers continue to see demand weakness in consumer-driven end markets, causing the industry to actively reduce inventory and lower the utilization of their production base. 
While demand in other end markets such as automotive and industrial remains relatively strong, specifically memory customers are more aggressively lowering CapEx and are limiting wafer output to reduce inventory to more healthy levels. Logic customers are also moderating wafer output for some market segments while demand continues to be strong in other markets, especially in markets requiring more mature nodes. Despite this, both logic and memory customers are still following their technology road maps and continue making strategic technology investments. As a result of this market dynamic, we do see customers making adjustments to demand timing relative to last quarter.  
However, we also see other customers more than willing to absorb this demand change, particularly in deep UV. For example, Chinese domestic customers focusing on mid-critical and mature applications, which make up over 30% of our backlog at the end of Q1 are now expected to grow to a similar allocation of our system revenue this year. After taking these demand adjustments over the quarter into account, our systems demand still exceeds our capacity for this year, albeit by a smaller margin in the last quarter. And as a reference, during 2022, the demand for deep UV was 50% higher than our build capacity, while this gradually reduced from 30% at the end of Q4 2022 to 20% at the end of Q1 2023.  
As Roger mentioned, we saw orders moderate in Q1 after several quarters of very strong bookings. A moderation in the rate at which customers are adding orders is to be expected in the current environment, especially considering the long period in which our backlog can cover shipments, which extends well beyond our normal order lead times. With regard to our total system capacity, we are still planning to ship around 60 EUV systems and around 375 deep UV systems in 2023 with around 25% of the deep UV systems being immersion.
We currently see no change in our full year outlook as provided last quarter. As a reminder, we expect EUV business growth to be around 40% over 2022 and non-EUV business growth of around 30%.  
For the installed base business, we still expect year-over-year revenue growth of around 5%. And in summary, based on our view today, we continue to expect a strong -- a year of strong growth with a net sales increase of over 25% and a slight improvement in gross margin. To summarize, our short- to medium-term business outlook is still very strong, supported by a backlog that represents almost 2 years of tool shipments, continuously pushing our output capacity to the maximum and further underpinning our plan to expand our capacity. On the geopolitical front, as it relates to export controls, we're still waiting for the Dutch government to publish further details on the export control restrictions.  
These new export controls focus on advanced chip manufacturing technology. Due to these upcoming regulations, ASML will need to apply for export licenses for shipments of the most advanced immersion deep UV systems. And as we have said earlier, we interpret most advanced to pertain to Twinscan NXT:2000i and subsequent immersion systems. And it will take some time for these controls to be translated into legislation and take effect. Based on the announcement last month, our expectation of the Dutch government's licensing policy, the current market developments and the way we model our longer-term scenarios, we do not expect a material effect on our 2023 financial outlook or on our longer-term scenarios as announced during our Investor Day in November last year.  
And despite the clear shorter-term cyclical concerns, the longer-term global mega trends we talked about at the Investor Day are broadening the application space and fueling demand for advanced and mature nodes. Secular growth drivers in semiconductor end markets and increasing lithography intensity on future technology nodes are driving demand for our products and services. In summary, while there is clear uncertainty in the current environment, our customers' demand for our products continues to exceed supply. We had a good start to the year, and based on our view today, we continue to expect another year of strong growth.
 ASML and its supply chain partners continue to work on the capacity ramp in support of our customers' demand, and we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",805,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,8,"Well, let me reverse it. I will answer that question, and perhaps Roger can answer the second one. So yes, I think you asked a question on 2024. I think we already mentioned it. The backlog is particularly strong, which, of course, is the result of very strong order intake over the last couple of quarters. Now -- and when we look at 2024 and we have our long-term discussion with our customers, the demand for 2024 clearly shows an increase in terms of tool shipments and therefore, sales as compared to 2023. Now a significant part of that is already booked. You could argue that the back half of the second half of next year still needs to be booked.  
And I'm pretty confident that, that will come in the course of this year. Now -- and although there are many uncertainties that we're currently seeing that the rate of inflation, interest rates, the geopolitical situation, we believe we are not looking at a massive recession, while our customers, of course, are dealing with the current circumstances by very diligently reducing inventory, adjusting their utilization rates and still very much planning for the demand for next year because they're building fabs. And those steps are real and have to take tools. Now not everything is booked yet for the 2024 demand.  
But in our discussions, as I said before, we very clearly see an increase of the number of tools that are needed because of the technology transitions and I also believe the confidence that our customers have in them, very diligently working off inventory against a macroeconomic situation that doesn't look like a massive recession. That gives us the confidence with the fact that these new fabs are opening that, yes, 2024 will be an up year as compared to 2023. And yes, we have not booked all those orders. And yes, I strongly believe that those orders will come in, in the course of this year. But if you ask me an exact date like June 12, 2023, I cannot give you this, but it will happen.

Very helpful, Peter. And I definitely won't ask for a specific date. And then as a follow-up for either you or Roger, there has been -- clearly, the cost of EUV is pretty high. And there have been some concerns that EUV intensity could slow down as we go beyond 3-nanometer, already some customers are using a low-cost 3-nanometer version. So I'm kind of curious how to think about EUV intensity as you go from 3 to 2-nanometer and beyond, do you feel comfortable EUV layers are going to increase? Or do you think it kind of stagnant or saturated?",102,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,10,"Well, okay, I'll answer that also. I think the -- it's also shown in our -- I think I can best refer to because you're talking about long-term road map questions. I think we tried to answer that during our Capital Markets Day. I think it was very clear in our Capital Markets Day, we gave you an overview of the litho intensity going up. And yes, that is also driven by EUV. It is driven by EUV for 2 reasons. One, I think we will see throughout the rest of this decade, a significant increase in EUV productivity but also in the shrink by the introduction of High-NA. So it's always going to be a combination. And what we are seeing today when we look at the chip designs, we see more EUV layers, not less.  
So that means that we see EUV intensity going up, and it's simply based on the very intense and deep discussions that we have with our customers' R&D people. And that's also the basis for our Capital Markets presentation that we gave you last year. And that still stands.

So the first one is on EUV demand, specifically, Peter. I mean you mentioned in the video, actually, Roger, some pushouts, but you reiterated the guidance for the full year. So obviously, your strong backlog is supporting your 2023 revenues and you said it's way more than one full year revenues, your backlog. But as net orders are weakening, I mean how should we interpret the trend in EUV demand for 2024 as the backlog is normalizing. I mean do you still expect EUV shipments to be up in 2024, especially given the visibility of 2 years you have for EUV specifically?

When we talk about a demand push out, you need to understand, and I think we said it before many times during our quarterly calls that the demand was far bigger than our build capacity. So we can talk about a demand push out without affecting our build capacity because the build capacity is lower than the demand. So this is what is actually happening and some of that demand that people wanted in 2023, they moved back to 2024. So when we look at the year 2024, and we look at the demand picture, and I just referred to the answer I gave on the first question, the demand picture looks at an increase of our shipments next year, which is true for the company, it's also true for EUV.  
So -- and I gave you the reasons in the answer to the first question. So the -- which is true for EUV is even more true for deep UV. We have a significant over demand in 2022, but now also in 2023, which is to a lesser extent, that buffer has actually shrunk, but it's the same situation. You can have demand changes, which do not lead to output changes because the output capacity is so much lower. I think that is what you need to keep in mind. And I can only refer back to what I said in the answer to the first question. We do pencil in the customer demand based on their expansion plans and based on what they believe their production capacity needs next year, which is a function of how they think about the duration of this current downturn.  
Now of course, if our customers start thinking about [Audio Gap] will be completely different, but they don't. They all think about basically work on diligently our inventory levels, we reduced the utilization to get a balance in supply and demand in the chip sector. That's what they're doing. And that just points to a shorter-term situation than a longer-term situation, which means that they keep the 2024 demand on us as is. Now part of it still needs to be booked, like I said, and it's particularly what I would call the back half of the second half of next year, yes, those orders we need to book, but I'm pretty sure that we will book them. And both on deep UV and EUV, we are both planning higher unit numbers.",410,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Wennink,,Executives,15,"Yes, I think it's not a surprising. We've said it before that the Chinese market is a market for mid-critical and mature semiconductor, so mid-critical and mature lithography systems. That's exactly what we are talking about. They say, who needs all those semiconductors because there's a significant -- and I think your math is about right. And that means that for our mid-critical and mature semiconductors, which are outside the realm of the export controls because that's on advanced immersion, yes. The demand for those semiconductors are significant. In the discussions I've had with one of the Chinese end customers, which is not a semiconductor maker, it's a product maker. So that in fact -- they make electrical vehicles.  
If you think about the increase of number of electric vehicles that will be produced in 3 to 4 years from now you need multiple 28- and 45-nanometer fabs, multiple, and it's more than a handful. Those steps are not there. They need to be built. So I think this is something people underestimate how significant the demand in the mid-critical and the mature semiconductor space is. And it will just grow double digit, whether it's automotive, whether it's the energy transition, whether it's just the entire industrial products area, where is the -- well, those are the sensors that we actually need as an integral component of the AI systems. This is where the mid-critical and the mature semiconductor space is very important and needs to grow. And this is where China is very strong. And this is why, yes, that could be 40% to 50% of our deep UV backlog, that's what it is.",275,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Two questions, if I may. My first question is with regards to the logic end market. You've talked about some moderation there. Could you give us a sense for, if anything that has changed in terms of discussions with customers, you talk about them sticking to their tech road maps. But do you see that as being uniform across customers, do you see any variations, but just a sense of if you've seen anything change with respect to the logic end market? 
And my second question is with regards to capital allocation. I believe in the annual report -- towards the end of the annual report, you have talked about your CapEx for this year being potentially EUR 2.4 billion, which would imply a capital intensity or a level that's higher than in the past, certainly highest in the last 10, 15 years that I can remember. Could you give us a sense for whether that's a one-off? And how should we think about capital intensity and broader capital allocation out this year and beyond?",179,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,18,"Roger will take the second question. On the first question, what do we see in change of in the logic end markets? What do we see in terms of change in road maps? And I would say the least change we see in the advanced road maps. I mean it's very clear that whether it's the 3 or the 2 or the sub-2-nanometer road maps, those are very clearly defined. There's only very few players. There's only 2 or 3 players that are -- actually 3 players that are actually looking into this. And I don't think those road maps are changing.  
I think they're pretty much the push that we get from the customers in that space is to keep our promises in terms of the shipment of the next-generation litho tool to meet their road map introduction requirements. I don't think that's a major change there. But I do see a change, and it refers back to the previous question, I do see a change in the road maps for the mid-critical and the mature systems. This is where I see customers that are in that space moving from mature to mid-critical from low mid-critical to high mid critical. There, you clearly see an acceleration of road maps. So it's more in the mature space, the mature and the mid-critical space than it is in the advanced space.  
And that is also driven by the things I just said is the whole EV transition is going to require a significant step-up in, let's say, 20, 28 and 45-nanometer capability. And this is where there is a big opportunity. So you also see road maps addressing that opportunity. And that's what I would see in the logic space is the biggest change.",293,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,19,"Amit, with regard to your second question, the -- indeed, the EUR 2.4 billion number that you referred to for the full year, that's very much in line with about 0.6 that you would see for this quarter. So that's very much in line. What is in there? Well, obviously, what is in there, first and foremost, is 2 things. It's the preparation for High-NA. And it's the ongoing activity to increase our capacity to the 90 and the 600. On High-NA, part of what is in there is prototypes that we're building. So we're building prototypes for High-NA. At a certain point in time, those prototypes will obviously also find their way or positive prototypes will find their way into the market.  
So at a certain point in time, there will be a bit of reversal in there. So that's part of the fairly high number that you see in there. But other than that, there's a lot of construction work going on around the globe in order to accommodate the capacity expansion that we've talked about. If you ask about what do you think in terms of the longer term, I think it is prudent to expect that for the years through 2025, I think it's prudent to expect something between, I would say, EUR 1.5 billion, EUR 2 billion in that neighborhood, I think it is prudent to assume that we're going to see these levels of CapEx because those will be the years where we continue to build the capacity that we have talked about before.",260,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And then indeed, the second dynamic that we talked about is that we believe it is appropriate in the current environment to sustain or to maintain higher levels of cash. What do I think is realistic. I think if you look at the cash level at the end of this quarter, if you look at the cash level that we had at the end of the previous quarter, I would say that -- those cash levels are definitely sufficient to weather any uncertainties that might be there.

And secondly, a question we received from investors is just on average selling prices.

Wennink,,Executives,27,"The upside on service. It's a good point. I mean what you generally see is that while the -- if there's an upturn, of course, we don't get the sufficient time to take down the machine and then do the upgrade -- software upgrades are, of course, easier. But any prolonged down of a machine in an upturn is a disaster for a customer, so they don't want to do that. So you're absolutely right, I mean in the downturn, we do have that because the utilization goes down. Well, in the beginning of such a downturn when the utilization goes down budgets that customers are going to allocate to do the upgrades are also going to go down.  
So what you generally see, and this is why there is an upside in H2, they were all right. And we are all looking at this as a shorter-term downturn, whereby towards the end of the year, you will see the signs of a recovery. Then customers will start scratching their head and we will push it and say, listen, you're still not at 100% utilization, but you're probably going to get there in 1 or 2 quarters. So you have to do this now because you can see the upturn coming. I mean this is the time when we actually push the -- basically the upgrades. And that's an upside. That is definitely an upside. So our customers work through this inventory glut today and they see this upturn coming. They see the utilization rates going up again. That's the time when they want those upgrades. And you can rest assured that we'll be there to actually remind them of this. So yes, and then the ASP, the limitation because of cost.",292,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think that in general has always been the case. I mean customers will use the tools for the nodes where they need to use them. So it all is a matter of how big is the node. I think if the 3-nanometer node or the 5-nanometer node is small or is big, that will drive the demand for EUV tools. And customers are like us, businesspeople, they will allocate their capital that they have on the balance sheet wherever they see fit. So -- but it's more a question of how big are those nodes?  
And we currently believe when we listen to the customers that they believe the 3-nanometer has a very big node. Well, what they don't sell on the 5, they can match it on the 3, then we will use those machines in the 3 node. But then it's the node size that really drives the need for the EUV tools. And this is what is reflected currently in the customer demand that we're currently seeing. And this actually is part of the answer to the questions I received on question #1 and 2 this afternoon.  
So we still see the demand, the overall demand EUV and deep UV to be up next year. And that is a reflection of what our customers believe their installed capacity needs to be. And that's based on how big they think the node is going to be. And that's driven by what they see from their customers as the end demand. I think -- and when I come back to your first question of pushing and pulling, that's particularly true for deep UV, not so much for EUV. I think we've seen in deep UV, we have seen, especially in the memory space, we have seen -- you can imagine 3D NAND, they don't use EUV but the market situation isn't optimal. So you see there pushbacks, but those tools are happily been taken up by the IDMs and by our customers in China, for instance. So it's -- particularly the pushing and pulling is a deep UV event.",352,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I think it's very sustainable. In my latest trip to China, I spoke to many customers and also some end customers, and the expansion plans, especially when it comes to issues like the EV transition, when it comes to the rollout of the communication networks, when you talk about the energy transition, that's all in that mid-critical to mature domain.  
And the number of end products that they are planning to produce is significant. And the semiconductor capacity base to support that is not there yet. It's being built. And this is why I think it's sustainable. I think we're underestimating. I can -- it sounds like a broken record, I suppose. I think we're all underestimating the end demand for mature and mid-critical semiconductors. The application space for those semiconductor is so wide. And every time you could say, well, I am not biased because I've been there now very recently, and I talked to those customers and those end customers.  
And I'm convinced that, that -- that is needed. And so I think it's very sustainable. Also, when I look at the expansion plans in the major centers in China, whether it's Beijing or Shanghai or Shenzhen, those fabs will be there. The end markets are there, and there's going to be a lot China for China. So yes -- so I think it's sustainable. But again, it's my view based on my latest visit.",275,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think, well, it's the NXT:2000, we don't make NXT:2000s anymore. We make 2050s and 2100s. But that's just a number. It's basically the NXT:2XXX. I think the 5% that we said in previous call had to do with the indirect effect of -- because it has to do with the October 7 rule, where basically we were able to ship lithography tools to China. You have to distinguish between the October 7 U.S. rules and these new trilateral rules, which are the Dutch export go through rules. The advanced immersion, which we interpret as NXT:2XXX, are the Dutch rules.  
Now the October 7 rules, we could ship every deep UV immersion tool to China only if there would have been a restriction on deposition and etch for instance, then we could be the indirect victim of this. And this was the 5%. Now currently, where we are today, I think almost all of the Chinese customers that I know have actually changed their road maps back from anything that potentially falls under this October 7 U.S. rules because they don't want to be blocked. So they basically are reverting back to 20-nanometer and above, which I just mentioned is a very significant market.  
The Chinese domestic market for that product is huge. So they're just reverting back. That means that they don't order 2050s or 2100s, they will order 1980s, yes, and that's what they're doing. So I think the 5% actually goes down to -- it's not relevant anymore. It is now -- it's basically governed by the potential Dutch rules, which mean that it's [ 1980 and up  ] which, by the way, is not under export control as we see it today. And that means that, that market is still open and there's significant demand.",300,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,47,"Yes, the operational consideration, first and foremost, was to make sure that cabins are empty, right, that you can -- that you really can -- that the systems that we're waiting for final parts were being completed and were being sent to customers in Q4. So that was it. We really wanted to make sure that both are based on customer demand and on getting cabins clean, getting all the inventory records clean. That was the reason why we did and then why we really prioritized the shipment over start.
[ R&D ] does have an impact then on the output and therefore the shipments in Q1, and that's what you see. I think in all likelihood, what you will continue to see is that in the quarters to come, you will see output go up again. And there, you will see output go up again, also commensurate with the increase in capacity that we're having.  
So that's what you -- that's in all likelihood what you're going to see in the quarters to come. So if nothing changes on the revenue recognition for fast shipment, we talked about that on prior calls that in all likelihood what you're going to see is that the EUR 1.5 billion that were now lower in terms of fast shipments carrying into -- from Q1 into Q2 versus what we received from Q4 into Q1. That EUR 1.5 billion, you might expect that we are going to over the next 3 quarters are going to build those.

If customers are fully accepting that shorter testing cycle upon shipments than actually we could for -- for those customers and for those tools, we could start recognizing upon shipment again.

I think if it's just the second half, it's -- yes, it's going to be the second half, we just are in this period for 1 or 2 quarters more. But as I said, ultimately, what drives their demand is the ultimate -- I believe our customers [ effort ] for 2024 and 2025, they need that capacity. Now this is all driven, like I said earlier, we are not looking at a massive recessionary environment. We're looking at a downturn, almost could say, it's a typical downturn situation in the semiconductor industry, which actually hasn't happened for a large number of years, where the supply just exceeds the demand. 
And we know the demand drivers, which are driven by the high inflation rates, the consumer confidence hit as a result of it, the geopolitical uncertainties. These are all the reasons why the end demand is now lower than what people expected. So [ with this ] classical semiconductor down cycle, whereby customers are working this off quite diligently, I mean they're all reducing their output, making sure that there is supply/demand balance for semiconductors. And that will be the point where you will see that turning and then it comes -- goes back up again. Now the big question is with what speed, at what slope is this recovery? That's your question. 
Well, I don't know. But what I do know is that nobody thinks about this massive recession. And we do see that elements like lower inflation rates will actually help the consumer confidence. We do see that growth rates in China are a bit better than we expected. So there all kinds of potential positives that will drive the 2024 demand. That's ultimately what we are looking at together with our customers. We just have to work through this a couple of quarters where we are today. 
And that could last for another 1 or 2 quarters longer but that in -- given -- well, when you look at our backlog, look at our longer lead times, that's not a major issue to us. We're just going to grow next year, the way do we look at it today. And I think nothing that I see today gives me high concerns that we will not grow.

And yes, they will be challenged by the fact that they cannot get advanced deep UV, a DRAM. That will be -- I'll just have to figure that out. I mean -- they still want what they can get, so mid-critical immersion, which I don't think is going to present them a problem looking where their road map is today. It's not going to give them a problem today. But if you have a road map where you want to go further in 3 or 4 years from now, yes, you do have a problem. You should not forget that the Chinese memory customers, especially DRAM, are absolutely not at the, let's say, road map execution phase as the leading DRAM makers. They are still behind. 
So what they can buy under the export go through rules will help them today. But yes, they have to find different solutions.

Wennink,,Executives,5,"Yes, I think you can say so. I think it's all driven by macroeconomics. -- macroeconomics, we still see relatively high inflation rates, high interest rates. So fear of recession in Europe and the U.S. geopolitical environment is also difficult from time to time. So yes, I think the macroeconomic situation has not improved. Now on the end markets, we see some first reports coming in that some end market seems to be bottoming out, which is good. But it means that our customers are still dealing with relatively high inventories, high levels. And how do you deal with that basically by reducing the wafer output. And wafer output means that, of course, the utilization of our tools is also less. What does that mean? I mean on our EUV business, we see some shift in demand timing. That is largely driven, I would say, predominantly driven by fab readiness.
The fabs are not ready. And why is that? There are skills issues. We've said it before, I mean whether it's in Taiwan or whether it's in the U.S., no skills issues, people who actually have the capability to build these very advanced fabs. There's a little -- there's also some element in thereof, of course, the macroeconomic situation where people have some concerns about the duration of this down cycle. I think that's what we're seeing for EUV. On deep UV, the demands are higher than what we can make. Now of course, deep UV also has been impacted by what I said on EUV because we've seen some pushbacks, some pushouts in terms of the demand across different segments in the industry. However, we also need to realize that our Chinese customers had over the last 2 years a so-called demand fill rate. So how much of your demand can we ship of [ signify ] less than 50%. 
So our Chinese customers say, yes, we're happy to take the machines that others don't want because their fabs are ready, they can take the tools. So when they become available, they will take the tools. So all in all, our deep UV business still looks pretty strong. And that has to do with the fact that what I just said that there is a significant demand, which is still higher than what we can make.",387,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

And I think that in itself was not a major surprise that will become effective for September 1, and it deals with our, what we call advanced deep UV immersion systems, which is our tool type NXT 2000 and subsequent numbers, so 2000, 2050, 2,100 and up. That's what it's all about. It's not about EUV. So -- but it's -- because EUV is already under export control. Now so we just have to wait to really get a final answer on your question. We also need to understand what the American government has done. The Japanese government has come out with their ruling end of May, the Dutch government a few weeks ago. 
So we're waiting for the American rules to come out. There have been some media reports that the Americans are contemplating some additional measures. Now because that's speculative. We don't know what it is. But what we understand will not have a major impact on what we said before. So I think all in all, when you look at export control measures in total, we don't expect a significant impact on our 2023 year, but also not on the longer-term outlook that we gave during the Capital Markets Day last year.",239,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,9,"Yes, we did. As a matter of fact, particularly on deep UV immersion. As you know, we do -- we fast ship deep UV immersion. and EUV. But on deep UV immersion we came to an agreement with customers where we basically have a reduced test protocol, which they now accept as good enough to basically recognize revenue when we ship the machine out of our factory in the Netherlands instead of taking revenue when we do the installation at the customer site. Now having said that, what does it mean? It means we're going to recognize more revenue in 2023. And we expect at about EUR 700 million worth of revenue now being booked in 2023, which we originally said was going to be pushed to 2024. 
So our revenue that we now defer to -- out of 2023 into 2024 is not the EUR 3 billion that we said last quarter, but this EUR 3 billion, less EUR 700 million is EUR 2.3 billion. And that's only EUV. So it actually means that deferred revenue because of fast shipments not only applies to EUV. Of course, there, we will book revenue when we get the final sign-off at the customer side for EUV systems.",206,5.0,8.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8

Wennink,,Executives,11,"This year, business outlook, like we said earlier, there is an impact on the macroeconomic situation. But if you then break that down into deep UV, EUV and installed base, they all have a bit of a different character. On deep UV, we expect to ship a bit more systems than the 375 units that we mentioned before, which is good. But on top of that, we also have the -- actually revenue recognition at shipment instead of at installation at the customer side for deep UV immersion systems, which all in all, gives us a higher sales number for deep UV immersion this year, where we originally anticipated that deep UV will grow with 30%, but now it will grow at 50%. So the deep UV business looks a lot more healthier than we actually said before. 
On EUV, we see some -- like we said before, some shifts in demand in terms of timing largely driven by fab readiness fabs are not ready yet, so we will ship the tools later. That means that the original quoted growth number of 40% for EUV revenue this year will go down to about 25%. And on installed base, there's a reflection of the macroeconomic situation and the cautiousness or the conservative way that customers look at doing upgrades. You don't need to do an upgrade when you're reducing the utilization of your installed base. So we now expect instead of a 5% growth in installed base that to stay flat for this year. But if you take it all together, higher deep UV or lower EUV, flat installed base then the total sales of the companies are now expected to grow towards 30% instead of the earlier 25% that we said last quarter.",293,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We said it before, macroeconomics show higher interest rates, the higher inflation numbers, some fear of recession here and there. And that actually means that what we all thought that we would see this year, it would be a recovery in the second half of 2023. I think that's going to be later. That's not a general view that that's going to be later. Now having said that, ASML has a very solid and strong and healthy backlog of about EUR 38 billion. On top of that, when we look at the firm demand that we -- that our customers put on us together with the good backlog for next year, I think we see a very clear opportunity for growth in 2024. However, given all the increased uncertainties, I think it's too early to give you a prediction of any forecast for 2024. It's quite normal when we are in these down cycles.
We have to take it quarter by quarter. We will look at it quarter-by-quarter, and we'll just keep our eyes out on the inflection points for recovery.",195,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,17,"Well, beyond 2024, it's really the solid belief we have in the mega trends that are not going to go away. You could even argue that some of these mega trends when you think about AI or even more important than we thought, let's say, at the end of last year. But it's not only AI, it's also the energy transition, it's the electrification of mobility. It's -- it's industrial IoT. It's everything that's driven by sensors and an actuator.
So effectively, we see very strong growth across the entire semiconductor space, whether it's mature or whether it's advanced. And that because of these mega trends, we have still has a very strong confidence in what we said at the end of last year. But by 2025, depending on what market scenario you are choosing higher or lower, we will have between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion of sales and gross margin by 2025 timeframe between 54% and 56%. And if you extend that then to 2030, we are still very confident that by that time, also dependent on a lower or higher market scenario. The sales will be anywhere between EUR 44 billion and EUR 60 billion with gross margin between 56% and 60%. 
So we have short-term cycles. This is what the industry is all about -- but we have a very strong confidence, even more -- even strong confidence in what the longer-term future is going to bring for this company.",246,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2023. Let me start with our second quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at EUR 6.9 billion, which is at the high end of our guidance. We shipped 13 EUV systems and recognized EUR 2 billion revenue from 12 systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 5.6 billion, which was mainly driven by Logic at 84%, with the remaining 16% coming from Memory. The net sales value of our fast shipments not yet recognized in revenue in the first half of 2023 amounts to EUR 1.4 billion. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.3 billion as guided.
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.3%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by additional deep UV immersion revenue in the quarter, partly related to starting revenue recognition upon shipment for immersion systems that are fast shipped. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 1 billion, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 281 million, both basically as guided. Net income in Q2 was EUR 1.9 billion, representing 28.1% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.93.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 6.3 billion.
Moving to the order book. Q2 net system bookings came in at EUR 4.5 billion, which is made up of EUR 1.6 billion for EUV bookings and EUR 2.9 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 69% of the bookings, while Memory accounted for the remaining 31%. At the end of Q2, we have around EUR 38 billion in our backlog.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2023. We expect Q3 net sales to be between EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 7 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.4 billion. Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be around 50%, a little below last quarter due to deep UV mix. The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR 1 billion and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 285 million.
Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. An interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share will be made payable on August 10, 2023. In Q2 2023, we purchased around 0.8 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 500 million. As mentioned last quarter, in the current environment, we expect to see ongoing pressure on our free cash flow. As a result, we will be prudent in managing our cash flows and maintaining relatively higher levels of cash.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",498,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, another solid quarter in a dynamic environment. Significant uncertainty remains in the market due to a number of global macro concerns around inflation, rising interest rates, recession and the geopolitical environment, including export controls. Although certain end markets seem to be reaching the bottom of the cycle, the semiconductor industry is running at very high inventory levels, leading customers to moderate wafer output as the supply chain works to reduce and rebalance inventory levels.
In order to limit wafer output, customers continue to run at lower litho tool utilization levels. Customers remain cautious due to the uncertainty around the timing, the shape and the slope of the recovery.
We had an increase in bookings this quarter, resulting in a backlog of around EUR 38 billion exiting the second quarter. In our EUV business, we have seen some shifts in demand timing. The majority of the shifts are due to fab readiness, with some elements of uncertainty around recovery. Deep UV demand still exceeds supply. While we have seen delays in deep UV demand from some customers, it has been compensated by strong demand for tools that mature and mid-critical nodes, particularly in China. The demand fill rate for our Chinese customers over the last 2 years was significantly less than 50%, so they now take the opportunity to receive and install systems in their fabs as the supply of tools becomes available.
Turning to our business, starting with deep UV. We're now planning to ship more than 375 deep UV systems with a mix of over 25% immersion. For immersion systems using the fast shipment process, we have come to an agreement with customers on a reduced acceptance test procedure that allows revenue recognition on shipment. As a result, we now expect additional revenue of around EUR 700 million in 2023. And this, in turn, reduces the amount of delayed revenue out of the year, and we now expect around EUR 2.3 billion of delayed revenue from 2023 into 2024 versus around EUR 3 billion of delayed revenue as previously communicated. This incremental deep UV revenue increased the expected year-over-year growth of our non-EUV business from around 30% as communicated last quarter to around 50%.
In EUV, due primarily to customer adjustments in timing -- in the demand timing related to delays in fab readiness as well as some remaining supply chain issues, we now expect to ship around 52 systems this year, translating to a year-over-year revenue growth for EUV of around 25% versus the previously communicated expectation of around 40%.
For the Installed Base business, with the current utilization rates, market uncertainty as well as timing of recovery, customers are delaying productivity and performance upgrades on their litho systems. Therefore, we now expect our Installed Base business this year to be similar to last year versus a growth of around 5% as previously communicated.
In summary, based on our view today, with higher deep UV revenue, offset somewhat by lower expectations on our EUV and Installed Base business relative to last quarter, we now expect net sales growth for the year to move towards 30% versus the previously articulated expectation of over 25%. We still expect a slight improvement in gross margin compared to 2022. No change relative to what we said last quarter, as the positive margin impact from increased deep UV immersion revenue is expected to be offset by the dilutive impact of lower upgrade revenue in 2023.
On the geopolitical front, as it relates to export control, the final Dutch regulations that were published at the end of last month are basically aligned to our expectations communicated last quarter and published on our website. Due to these export control regulations, ASML will need to apply for export licenses with the Dutch government for all shipments of its most advanced immersion deep UV lithography systems, which means the TWINSCAN NXT:2000i and subsequent immersion systems.
As a reminder, sales of ASML's EUV tools have already been restricted, and the business in China is predominately focused on mature and mid-critical nodes. The new Dutch export regulations will come into effect on September 1, 2023. There were also some reports in the media recently about additional U.S. export controls. Of course, we will and cannot respond to speculation. However, based on our current understanding, we do not expect to change our previously communicated view. Therefore, based on everything we have been made aware of as of today, we do not expect the Dutch and potential additional U.S. measures to have a material impact on our financial outlook for 2023 nor on our longer-term scenarios as communicated during our Investor Day in November last year.
Looking towards next year, our customers across different market segments are currently more cautious due to the continued macroeconomic uncertainties. Based on our view last quarter, customers were expecting a recovery in the second half of this year, but it now seems that this is moving towards -- more towards 2024. Also, the shape and slope of the recovery remains unclear. However, based on a combination of the current firm demand and a strong backlog of around EUR 38 billion, there are clearly still opportunities for growth in 2024. But given the mentioned uncertainties, it's too early to be specific about the forecast for next year. We will continue to follow the market developments and update you on our view of next year in the coming quarters.
Despite the near-term uncertainty, the longer-term megatrends we talked about at our Investor Day are broadening the application space and fueling demand for advanced and mature nodes. Secular growth drivers in semiconductor end markets such as electrification and AI, along with increasing lithography intensity on future technology nodes, are driving demand for our products and services.
In summary, while the current macro environment continues to create significant uncertainty, we are working through a strong backlog and expect growth this year towards 30%. In the near- to medium-term, customers remain cautious as they moderate wafer output to help lower inventory levels in the supply chain and to look to build confidence around the timing and the slope of the recovery. ASML and its supply chain partners are still actively adding and improving capacity to meet future customer demand as we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity.
And with that, we would be happy to take your questions.",1066,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,8,"Well, if I would know this, then I would probably give you some outlook on 2024. But I just refer back to what we call the firm demand from our customers, which -- and the strong backlog. And of course, as you understand, our full 2024 year is not fully covered by POs. So still POs need to come in, but we do have firm demand. Now that is a demand that for 2024, you cannot decouple from the outlook on 2025. And 2025 clearly shows the opening and the first ramp of some significant advanced fabs in the logic space, for instance, the 2-nanometer fabs, 3-nanometer for both the -- all 3 leading customers. That, of course, leads to the firm demand in what we currently see. And that means we see significant opportunities also, like we said, certainly, for growth in 2024. However, we also need to realize that the uncertainties as it relates to macroeconomic developments and particularly, I think, the slope of the recovery.
I think we will very likely as many analysts believe but also customers say, we will probably see, let's say, the [ thrust ] of this down cycle somewhere this year, and then we see a recovery coming. Then it's all about the slope of the recovery. And that's driven really by the macroeconomic uncertainty. So the extent to which they're going to add more capacity in 2024 due to, let's say, the macroeconomic situation, that's the uncertainty.
I think in 2024, there's a higher level of uncertainty of those fabs that will take those machines because they need to ramp in 2025, the next nodes. That's pretty certain. But it's that uncertainty on the macroeconomic demand that makes us a bit more uncomfortable to give you some specific guidance on next year. So in summary, the order book looks good. The firm demand looks good, but I'd love to see all of that being translated into orders over the next couple of quarters. So this is why we also said we're going to follow this very closely, and we're going to keep you abreast of what we're seeing and what our customers are telling us in the next 1 or 2 quarters to come.

So the backlog in terms of composition, we have around 85% of the backlog is for EUV and immersion  combined. So that gives you, I think, a pretty good indication there. EUV in total is around EUR 21 billion out of the total backlog of EUR 38 billion. So then you have, I think, the key parameters in there. We do not distinguish in terms of regions. I think we told you before that China is over 20% in the backlog, and that also drives our expectation for how you're going to see system sales develop in the next period. But I think that's the key composition of the backlog as we see it today.",116,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

That's a good question. I think this is also what we are, of course, internally discussing. But what we -- the capacity in 2024 is really a function of what we need in 2025. And the good thing about 2025 is when we look at the number of fab openings and the ramp profile of new fabs in '25 across our customer base, which also includes Memory, leads us to believe that we should be very careful in reducing our capacity in 2024. Because if you do that, you won't be able to ship in 2025, given the fact that our lead times in the supply chain are ranging from 12 to 15 to 18 months. So this means we will -- at this moment in time, we don't see any reason to reduce any capacity plans for 2024. Because -- and that's basically driven by our views on the 2025 time frame. So I don't expect any adjustments there, and we're not planning for it.",167,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And I'm just wondering if the ramp would look more like a step function in the latter part of '24 as you prepare for '25?",51,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,15,"Well, I mean, it's -- you talk -- it's the difference between the ramp and the capacity. I mean, the capacity is 600 units, but that's about 25% immersion. That's you could call expensive capacity. And the 75% is dry, which is less expensive capacity. We're just going to do that because we are currently -- this year plan to ship more than 375 systems. And I also feel that when we look at the firm demand, of course, for deep UV, we don't have all those orders, but the firm demand, then we actually need more capacity next year. So it's going to be -- capacity are step functions. It is not like a gradual function.
So it means if we want to have 600 units by 2025, 2026, but somewhere by the end of 2024, in 2025, we need to have that step capacity built in the supply chain, whether we're going to put all the orders in, that's dependent on the demand. But I think what we're putting in for 2025, 2026 is therefore the remainder of the decade. So we need to do this anyway because we are strongly convinced, as I said in the prepared remarks, that the long-term view that we have on this market is still very much intact. So you have to distinguish between a ramp as a result, as you know, as a result of the market demand and the capacity ramp because the capacity ramp is a step function and its -- and serves the purpose for the longer term.",260,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

In terms of bookings, of course, the bookings for the 3800 are coming in because if you look at next year, next year is going to show you a good blend of 3600 and 3800 tools. So obviously, quite some of the bookings for EUV, Mehdi, that are currently coming in are also for the 3800.
The 3800, we promise you that on this call, we would disclose we hit the ASP and the ASP is at least north of EUR 200 million. So that is a clear indication, I think, of how that indeed will also help in terms of revenue. It will also help in terms of gross margin ultimately because even though it's a more expensive machine to make because bear in mind, there are commonality, there is quite some [ commonality in parts ] between the High-NA tool and the 3800 tool. It's a more expensive tool to make, but it's also a very healthy uptick in terms of ASP. So it will help both on the revenue side and also on the gross margin side, starting in '24, but definitely in '25 when the lion's share of the tools there will be 3800s.",199,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Dassen,,Executives,20,"I think you heard our enthusiasm to share numbers on 2024 or lack thereof. So I'm not going to do that. The growth drivers for 2025 in terms of the gross margin, there's a number that I think are significant there. We just talked about one important one, and that's the 3800. Of course, that's an important driver of gross margin improvement, definitely also in 2025. So that's one.
The second one that I think is important in comparison to today. As you know, we are preparing both for capacity expansion on deep UV and Low-NA, but we're also preparing significantly and putting a lot of money into getting everything ready for High-NA, both the manufacturing capacity here, we're building up teams in the field, et cetera, et cetera. That currently is a significant drag on our gross margin as we have it today because all of the costs that we're incurring to prepare for that capacity ramp and for preparing for High-NA everywhere in the entire organization goes straight to the gross margin today. 
That effect should be gone by 2025 because at that point in time, you would hope that you're actually going to be in a position to utilize at least a significant part of that incremental capacity that you build. And also by that time, you would see meaningful numbers of High-NA. So those are really important drivers of gross margin. And the other one that I probably would give you is that -- is on the service side.
As you know, we see a continued improvement of the EUV service margin in particular, but also in deep UV. And on both, we are driving to get the service margin up, both as a result of what we're doing on the revenue side, but also in terms of trying to further control the cost. So those are the main drivers why looking at 2025, we believe the scenarios that we gave you there, the 54% to 56% is a tenable and reasonable aspiration for us to have.",341,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The majority is basically technology transitions out of the leading memory makers. They're just preparing for the next node transition, which is a technology transition, which need, of course, the type of machines and the type of technology that Roger just talked about, like, for instance, the EUV systems, the 3800s. And so this is what it is.

I mean you talked about the challenging macro environment at the moment. How do you see -- I mean, you can see how utilization is doing at your customer base. On average, where do you see utilization is at the moment? Because that will be clearly the driver of when the customers start to get more positive in terms of orders back to you in the next few quarters. And secondly, in terms of China, China clearly is a very strong driver of your sales this year. I mean when we look at utilized revenue, when we hear the data points in the supply chain, at least in the logic companies in China, utilization is as bad if not worse than what we are hearing in other parts in the industry. So maybe to try to understand how sustainable these orders from China are into next year given that the end markets even in China seem to be incredibly weak at this point.",168,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

Basically, the utilization question, good question [indiscernible] distinguish between Memory and Logic. I think in Memory, I don't think we see a lot of bottoming out there. Yes, it could be -- you could argue, it's bottoming out, but we don't see a kind of an inflection point. In Logic, though, it's very early, but we could see some of an inflection point today. But that's just over the last -- the short period. So see how sustainable that is. But I would think if you think about that, that's bottoming out and you could even say we've passed an inflection point, although it's still early.
Now on China, how sustainable is -- that's correct. I mean you see the same utilization trends in China as we see in the rest of the world. But you have to realize that the demand in China has 2 elements. One, of course, it needs to fulfill the current demand, and that's what we just talked about. I mean the current demand is, of course, weak. But the most important point is the strategic investments and the fabs are being built for a purpose. When you look at what's been made in China, it's mid-critical to mature semiconductors. And that's the sweet spot. When it comes -- when you look at the big megatrends around the globe where China is leading as a matter of fact, when you think about electrification of mobility, think about the energy transition, the IoT in the industrial space, the rollout of the telecommunication infrastructure, battery technology, that's all -- that's the sweet spot of mid-critical and mature semiconductor. 
And that's where China without any exception is leading. Now that means that the Chinese industry, the customers of the semiconductor industry need semiconductors of that kind. And I can just tell you in the discussions that we've had, the concern of many of our Chinese customers is that given the increase of the geopolitical tensions, they do not want to rely on supply that comes out of China. So it's very simple that they're going to build a significant amount of capacity in that space, in the mid-critical to mature semiconductors to actually fuel those megatrends where China is actually leading.
So if you then look at the big [ whole ] market and their desire because of the fear that they have on the increase in geopolitical tensions, they're going to build all those fabs themselves. And that's what's happening. Those fabs will be built. There are many new fabs and new companies that actually say we're going to provide those type of semiconductors to support these megatrends where China is indeed leading. And that's what's happening today. It's not so much the current macroeconomic or the market situation that drives the demand. It's the strategic investment that drives the demand because it's the dependence that part of the Chinese industry has on imports. And then I think it's very sustainable. That's very sustainable for the next couple of years.",505,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Francois, I think I was quite clear, I think, on the ASP for the 3800. So I said north of EUR 200 million. So I think that was clear. When it comes to ASPs in the deep UV landscape, of course, it's very widely distributed. And there, obviously, the mix effect is quite significant and that is true both within the portfolio of KrF of dry tools and also in wet tools. So you're absolutely right. I mean the new models that we're introducing, of course, give significant value to the customer, and therefore, command a significantly higher price than all the models. So that is clearly the case, but it is completely dependent on the mix within the dry business and the immersion business.",126,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

The second question is on the Installed Base Management. I mean if we look at the guidance of [ flat ], again, I understand that the level of upgrade is not as you maybe expect in the current environment. If we look at the guidance of [ flat ], it would imply a decline in H2 year-over-year, at least. So how should we think about the level of -- Peter, you mentioned a small sign of recovery. It's early days, but it's been a small size and the fact that the Installed Base Management, I would imagine would be very close to the demand in terms of recovery or utilization rates picking up. Just trying to reconcile that and how we should think about Installed Base Management into next year with your EUV as well going up and ASP per tool per year, I mean, business model?",148,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,44,"Let me first take the question on '23 and then maybe, Peter, you want to expand it further. But as it comes to '23, I think the right frame of reference, of course, is not half year over half year, but is the second half in comparison to the first half. In the first half, we had EUR 2.7 billion and [ flat ] would mean that we're going to have EUR 3 billion in the second half. So that would point at a recovery. And given the guidance that we've given for Q3, Q3, we indicated EUR 1.4 billion. So it doesn't take a lot of compute power to calculate it. That would mean EUR 1.6 billion for Q4. So that tells you that indeed, we are looking at a recovery there. That would be commensurate with the perspective of the recovery that Peter has been talking about.

And I think the slope of recovery is critical and very important because like I said, although it's very early, but you could argue and you look at the utilization graphs, you could think that there is an inflection point for Logic. We've had that. And then -- but it's still pretty early on. But if that would continue, then it's really important to look at the slope because for upgrade business, you -- basically, you could argue you have a relatively short period of time before you hit, again high utilization and then customers say, well, I don't have the time. I don't want to shut down the tool. So I think we will watch this very carefully together with our customers to say, okay, looking at the slope, if the slope accelerates, then we really need to start negotiating with the customer quickly to put in more upgrades. And that could be an upside when the recovery accelerates.
When it's a slower degree slope, they'll probably take a bit more time. But that's also where it's the same reason. We now have time to do upgrades because we don't have a full utilization of the installed base. So there is some upgrade there. But still, customers are currently saying market is not good. It's still CapEx because there are high value upgrades. So they're a bit cautious now. But yes, we have to start being very close to our customers in the next couple of quarters to say if we see an opportunity, let's go because before you know it, they don't have time.",267,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It's the Apples, the Qualcomms, the NVIDIAs of this world, [indiscernible] you have a very clear road map based on the 20- or the 3-nanometer designs, and they want those new products to be introduced at that time. So that's going to happen. We have little doubt there. And I think on the strategic fabs in China, I made that very clear. I think it's just a strategic, very clear focus area that they have because they want to hedge against any negative geopolitical repercussions that could come. So that's also strategic.

Or [ is it when ] they reported in the current quarter? And [ is in ] what proportions, please? And while we're talking of fast shipments, our discussions on a similar [indiscernible] the table for EUV? Or is that on the table now?",83,1.0,8.0,0.5555555555555556,0.8

Dassen,,Executives,50,"So the EUR 700 million is the expectation that we have for the end of the year, right? So of course, there will be a little bit of [ flux ] during the year, but the EUR 700 million is the expectation that we have for that in the year. Of course, we have some of that also in this quarter, but the EUR 700 million really is the expectation that we see for the full year.
As it comes to EUV, it's based on the conversations that we've had with the customers, they are very happy to take the risk of the tool for the immersion tools upon shipment and based upon a shorter testing program for EUV were not there yet. So the question will be also, based on how next year is going to pan out, I think that we're going to get the question of how much fast shipment are we going to see for EUV next year in comparison to normal shipments? I think that's the primary question that we have on EUV. So if you think about the -- to what extent could we have some tailwind from that -- in that regard, I think it will be heavily dependent on what we're going to do in terms of regular versus fast shipment.
And there are 2 considerations there for next year. One consideration is that as a standard procedure, when we introduce new technology, we want to test them more, right? So the 3800 clearly is a significant development in our EUV shop, and that means that at least for a number of tools, we want to do more testing and more elaborate testing and therefore, at least for a number of the initial tools, we wouldn't fast ship them. So we will do regular shipments and do the full testing program. And secondly, as I mentioned, it will be dependent on the utilization of our capacity, right? Because fast shipment is a way to get the tool earlier to the customer, but it's also a way to optimize our capacity. So it will be driven by those 2 considerations, what we're going to see there next year in terms of type of shipments, and that will tell you whether or not we're going to get any tailwind for EUV revenue as a result of that.",393,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

We need to realize it. If you look at the reasons, predominantly the [indiscernible] had to do with fab readiness. And that was basically driven by construction skills. And you think, well, how can that be? You just hire a couple of construction workers, and you just build a fab. We're just building a EUR 20 billion fab that's going to do a 5- or a 3- or a 2-nanometer product is a skill. And people don't seem to realize that when we start building those fabs across the globe now and now everywhere, that skill is -- has been refined over the last couple of decades in only a few places on the planet, predominantly in Taiwan and in Korea, and a bit in China. 
Now having to do that now and accelerate this will lead to all kinds of issues because we are still building those fabs in Korea and in Taiwan, but also in other places on the planet, also in the U.S., for instance. So getting access to the requisite skills and skilled workers to keep the construction plan on time is a challenge as at least what customers tell us. And this is the main reason. So you can easily look at a delay of a couple of months or a quarter.
Now -- and of course, like I mentioned earlier, we need those 2-nanometer fabs or 3-nanometer fabs in 2025. But it also means we need to resolve in, let's say, an 18-month period, yes, some of those skills gaps. And then -- but I think it might easily be a problem also at the end of next year, but let's see how quickly they can skill up the construction industry to help build those fabs. So that's the predominant reason for the timing changes or the demand timing changes. And of course, has also been in this particular year where there's a few supply chain issues that address 1 or 2 systems, but it was -- predominantly, it was just fab readiness and for the reasons that I just mentioned. And I hope they get reskilled quickly and at the end of 2024, we don't have those issues.",367,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

So yes, we will see some of that, but that will be taken up, the particular demand by the installed base. Now -- and that will further accelerate, I'm pretty sure. But that will definitely mean that, that will be, you could say, the shift to customer by 2025.

Wennink,,Executives,71,"No. I think it's the -- the number of customers in China is significantly higher than -- and I just talked about the spread of the customer significantly higher than anywhere on the planet. It has to do with the fact that it also goes back to where Chinese industry, I don't talk about the semiconductor industry, but the industry in general is actually growing. It grows in those areas which are covered by the big megatrends. And that means that specific requirements for semiconductors to support those trends actually ask for very significant and different applications that put the demand on this wide range of mid-critical to mature semiconductors. And there's a lot. And that also means that you see customers -- semiconductor customers now focusing on certain of those areas. It means you have many, many customers, yes? And that's -- so it's pretty widespread, whether it's memory, whether it's logic or foundry, it's almost everything, but many of them and very much focused on specific parts of the industry. So yes, it's on the contrary. I mean it's not specifically focused on 1 or 2 customers. It's a broad based.",193,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

You have to realize that when you ship an immersion tool and just do the math, which is the wavelength of the light over the numerical aperture of the lens. That's 193 over 1.33 [ times a K ] factor, which is the process factor, which is an absolute minimum of 0.26 because beyond that, you don't have any contrast. So if you do the math, do it on your calculator, you come to 38-nanometer. So whether it's in 1970 or 1980 or 2000 or 2100, it's 38-nanometer. So how do you get smaller sizes. That is where you start using double patterning, and that's basically determined by your capabilities of materials, which is deposition and etch. So It's, of course, the most advanced have one determining factor in that, it's the precision with which the tool works.
And this is where, if you look at the Dutch regulation, it doesn't mention a [ tight ] name. It just mentions a technical specification, which focuses on the precision with which the tool works. That's where the cutoff point is. But in terms of feature size, it's the same. But it's really the precision with which you can position the feature size on the wafer. That's where the cutoff point is. And that's determined in the regulation. So it's all deposition and etch.",223,5.0,8.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8

That was actually higher than we guided. Two reasons. One reason is the product mix, which was more on the immersion side. And then secondly, we had a number of one-off cost benefits in there. 
Net income for the quarter, EUR 1.9 billion and then order intake, EUR 2.6 billion, lower than what we had in previous quarters. But quite frankly, that was as was expected. Because in the current environment, we do see customers being very cautious with cash, being very cautious with CapEx and as a result of that, they're also very cautious with putting in orders. No High-NA orders in our POs for this quarter. And we're still looking at an order book of over EUR 35 billion. So quite a few orders still in the books and that's also reason why customers can actually manage to have quite low POs for this quarter.",179,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,4,"Yes, China percentage in our sales was quite high this quarter. Again, I think this is something that we communicated about before. I think a couple of things are important there. As we mentioned before, the shipments into China are really for mid-critical and mature nodes. I think it's also fair to recognize that most of the shipments that happened in this quarter are based on POs that we already had in '22 and even the year before. So it's really based on bookings that we had in '22 and before. And as we mentioned before, the order fill rate that we had for China in the past couple of years has been rather low. As a matter of fact, below 50%. 
What's happening right now, we see a number of other customers, we see some shifts in the timing of demand and that really allows for a higher fill rate, order fill rate of our Chinese customers and that's exactly what's happening right now. And so higher volume in China, lower volume of other customers. So that's why you see quite a high percentage there. And of course, all the shipments that were there very much within the limits of export regulation.",203,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

If you then look at the full year, then as to revenue, we're looking at growth towards 30% in comparison to 2022 and the gross margin would end up around 51%.

I mean there's quite a bit going on. First, if you look at the macro front, I think it's plain to see for everyone. It's a combination of a few things. There's still pockets of inflation. We still see interest rates at pretty elevated levels. We still see GDP growth in some economies that is not where people expected that to be. And then I think there are quite some geopolitical tensions. So all in all, on the macro front, it's quite dynamic and quite challenging. If you don't specifically look into the semiconductor -- in the semiconductor industry, I think it's plain to say that our customers are really going through the cycle trough. 
And if you just look at the number of characteristics there, what are some of the things that we are really looking at, we're looking at inventory positions. And there, what you see is that downstream, so let's say, with the end customers, we do believe that the inventory situation is starting to become more normalized. So I think there, we actually see a positive development. I think upstream, I think the inventory situation still needs to further normalize. So it's a bit of a mixed bag on the inventory situation. 
I think as far as utilization of our tools is concerned, I think the progress that we started to see also in the previous quarter on the utilization of logic, we do see that, that progress is there. So we do see that on logic utilization is starting to improve. I would say on memory, quite frankly, I think we still need to see our customers turn the corner on the utilization front. So what does it do with our customers? What does it do with their expectations? What do they express to us? I think they do expect an inflection point at the end of this year. That's with all the dynamics that is what they typically would be looking at. But then obviously, the question is, what's the shape, what's the slope of the recovery into 2024? And that's obviously a dynamic that they're watching and that we're watching as well. 
What we do see them do though is really prepare for continued ramp. So we do see quite a few fabs that are in the progress of being built and we do expect quite some fab openings in the '24 and '25 time frame. And obviously, that will require quite some tools.",412,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

So it just came in. The new regulations, so obviously still in the process of digesting it and making a full analysis of what the impact is. So I can share with you our preliminary assessment and our preliminary assessment would be that as it pertains to our business, we think it affects a limited number of fabs in China. We don't think it has a material impact on 2023. And we also believe that if you look longer term, so for instance, if you look at '25 or 2030, the scenarios that we've given there, we believe it might have an impact on the regional split but we do not believe that it has an impact on, let's say, the overall revenue numbers that we would be looking at in those scenarios for ASML. 
Main reason being, as you know, that we make those assessments not on the basis of the bottom-up demand in a country but really based on the worldwide demand for wafers. So that's the situation on that front. Obviously, we will fully comply with all the laws and regulations. So we'll diligently go through it but that is at least our preliminary assessment.",199,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,12,"We really think 2024 is going to be a transition year. And if you look at the 2 topics that we were just discussing, so we -- that we discussed, the macro environment, we talked about the situation within the industry. We talked about the industry and our customers navigating through the cycle trough on the one hand. On the other hand, the situation we just discussed on the export goals, our current view is that we're taking a more conservative approach. 
And what does that mean more conservative approach is that we're really looking at 2024 in 2 regards. On the one hand, we think revenue-wise, it's going to be similar, we believe, to 2023. And on the other hand, we believe 2024 is going to be a pivotal year in preparing us for what we think will be very significant growth in 2025. And there are a few building blocks why we truly believe that 2025 is going to be a significant growth year. First up, obviously, the secular trends, right? Everyone talks about the impact of electrification, of the energy transition, AI, et cetera. So those drivers are clearly there. The secular trends are very, very strong. 
Secondly, we do see our current perspective that 2025, we will find ourselves on the uptick, if you like, in the cycle. So that should be a positive. We're also looking at continued strong litho intensity in our business. And as I mentioned before, if we look at the fab openings that our customers have scheduled for '24 and '25, it's pretty significant and that should all come together and essentially make for a strong 2025. 
So that's why, if you take it all together, all the dynamics that we just talked about, we remain very, very confident in our expectations for the growth trajectory for ASML. And as also clarified in the expectations that we articulated on 2025 and 2030 in the Capital Markets Day of November of last year.",331,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the third quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance in the fourth quarter of 2023.  
Let me start with our third quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at EUR 6.7 billion, which is around the midpoint of our guidance. We shipped 10 EUV systems and recognized EUR 1.9 billion revenue from 11 systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR 5.3 billion, which was mainly driven by Logic at 76%, with the remaining 24% coming from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.4 billion as guided.  
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.9%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by DPV product mix as well as some one-off cost effects. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 992 million, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 288 million, both basically as guided.  
Net income in Q3 was EUR 1.9 billion, representing 28.4% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.81.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 5 billion. Moving to the order book. Q3 net system bookings came in at EUR 2.6 billion, which is made up of EUR 0.5 billion for EUV bookings and EUR 2.1 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections.  
Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 80% of the bookings while Memory accounted for the remaining 20%. As expected, we did see some moderation in orders this quarter. As the industry is working through a cycle, customers remain cautious in the current environment, managing cash flows and delaying purchase orders. In addition, there were no high-NA orders this quarter while our bookings were lower than in previous quarters, our backlog at the end of Q3 remained strong at over EUR 35 billion. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2023. We expect Q4 net sales to be between EUR 6.7 billion and EUR 7.1 billion. We expect our Q4 installed base management sales to be around EUR 1.4 billion. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The positive impact of higher sales volume is more than offset by the diluted impact from a change in DPV mix and one-off effects relative to last quarter.  
The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around EUR 1.03 billion and SG&A is expected to be around EUR 285 million. Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%.  
An interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share will be made payable on November 10, 2023. In Q3 2023, we purchased shares for a total amount of around EUR 100 million. As mentioned in previous quarters, in the current environment, we expect to see ongoing pressure on our free cash flow. As a result, we will be prudent in managing our cash flows and maintain relatively high levels of cash. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter.",528,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger, and I have a bit of a cold. So apologies. As Roger has highlighted, another good quarter, especially considering the current market environment. Uncertainty remains in the market, driven by global macro concerns around inflation, rising interest rates, lower GDP growth in certain economies and indeed geopolitical environment, including export controls.  
However, industry seems to be passing through the cycle trough. There has been some improvement in end market inventory levels downstream -- sorry I have to get a bit of water -- although inventory levels and upstream remain elevated. As a result, the customers continue to moderate wafer output by running at lower utilization levels.  
While lithography tool utilization are still running at levels lower than normal relative to last quarter, tool utilization in Logic and continues to show signs of improvement, while Memory has yet to turn. We concur with our customers but still expect to see an inflection point indicating the start of a recovery by the end of the year, although the shape and slope of the recovery remains uncertain.  
Looking further ahead to 2025, we expect a significant growth here since more than 50% of our EUV and DPV shipments will go to new fab projects. On top of this, we expect existing fabs will be adding capacity driven by a continued recovery cycle.  
Turning to our business. We now expect DPV revenue to grow towards 55% year-over-year, an increase from around 50% communicated last quarter, primarily driven by an increase in immersion revenue. China's demand for DPV systems continues to be strong and trends we talked about in previous quarters.  
For system shipment this year to Chinese customers, the majority of the orders were booked in 2022. The demand fill rate for our Chinese customers over the last 2 years was significantly less than 50%. So the Chinese customers, were in fact, receiving a much lower number of systems than they ordered. This was due to the fact that timing from other customers that -- sorry, this was due to the fact that the demand for our systems worldwide significantly exceeded supply.  
With current shifts in demand timing from other customers, we now have the opportunity to fulfill these orders to our Chinese customers. So the supply is, in fact, catching up to demand and we're shipping lithography systems for mature and mid-critical nodes to China, while, of course, complying with export control regulations. If you combine this with the fact that other customers are delaying their demand, this means indeed a higher sales percentage from China than we saw in previous years.  
In EUV for 2023, we continue to expect year-over-year revenue growth for EUV of around 25% as communicated last quarter. For the installed base business in 2023, the current utilization rates, market uncertainty, particularly as it relates to the timing of the recovery, customers continue to wait to perform productivity and performance upgrades on the litho systems. Therefore, we now expect our installed base business this year to be down around 5% from last year versus the flat growth previously communicated.  
In summary, based on our full year, with higher DPV  revenue, offset somewhat by lower expectations on our installed base business relative to last quarter, we still expect net sales for the year to grow towards 30%, with a slight improvement in gross margin compared to 2022. Overall, a very strong growth year, especially considering the industry being in the down cycle.  
On the geopolitical front as it relates to export controls, the U.S. government yesterday published updated export control regulations. A part of the regulations is an update from last year's October communication and part is the implementation of the U.S. regulation on the trilateral agreement between the Dutch, Japanese and U.S. governments. Given the length of the document, we need to review the final regulation thoroughly and make a detailed analysis, which will take some time. But based on our preliminary assessment, we do not expect these measures to have a material effect on our financial outlook for 2023. 
The export control measures could have an impact on the regional split of our shipments in the medium to long term, but we do not expect an impact on the global demand scenarios as communicated during our Investor Day in November last year, since the long-term growth perspectives for our industry remains clearly unchanged.  
Looking towards the next year. The semiconductor industry is currently working through the bottom of the cycle and our customers expect the inflection to be visible by the end of this year, as I mentioned before. Although there's an opportunity for some demand to be pulled back into the back half of 2024, we currently prefer to take a more conservative view for the full year 2024, especially considering the inherent nature of the macroeconomic uncertainties. Therefore, based on our current view, we expect revenue next year to be similar to 2023. As such, we see 2024 as a transition year, but also as an important year to prepare for the significant growth that we expect in 2025.  
Now based on discussions with our customers, we currently expect 2025 to be a strong year, driven by a number of factors. First, the secular growth drivers in the semiconductor end markets, which we have previously discussed, such as energy transition, electrification and AI. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes drives demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Secondly, the industry expects to be in the middle of a cyclical upturn in 2025, starting in 2024. And lastly, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for the significant number of new fabs that are being built across the globe. These fabs are spread geographically, are strategic for our customers and are scheduled to take our tools. It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity to be ready for this ramp.  
In summary, despite going through an industry down cycle, we still expect very strong growth in our business this year. And while there are still significant uncertainties, primarily driven by the macro environment, it appears that we're passing through the bottom of this specific cycle, and the shape of the recovery will ultimately determine the demand curve beyond 2023.  
In the near term, it's understandable that customers remain cautious as they moderate wafer output to help lower inventory levels in the supply chain and look to build confidence around the timing and slope of the recovery next year. 
In summary, we clearly view 2024 as a transition year. As we prepare for future growth and expect strong year in 2025 and beyond. We remain confident that we are well positioned for further long term growth as we discussed in the market scenarios for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November 2022.

Dassen,,Executives,8,"Yes, Joe, you're doing a very fine job in analyzing it all. Of course, we want to appreciate that we're not going to give guidance on -- quantitative guidance on the gross margin for next year. But I can give you some of the drivers of the gross margin. And I think you mentioned a few of them which are quite important.  
So I would say the 3800 ASP is clearly one, right? So 3800 is going to be an important part of the mix in next year for EUV. So obviously, as a higher ASP, we talked about more than EUR 200 million last -- on the call last quarter. So that comes with a higher ASP, but also drives the gross margin. So that's an important driver. I think service on EUV is one where we say we continue to make progress on that one. So that's another positive.  
I would say on the challenge side, so on the headwind that we're going to get in terms of gross margin for next year, it is, as you said, next year, we are preparing, obviously, for a big year in 2025 because that's the way we look at it, as we also mentioned -- as Peter mentioned and also said in the video it is going to be a big year and that means that we're going to add quite some capacity to actually allow that to happen. So that's going to going to have a headwind on the gross margins because those people will have to be trained in 2024, whilst primarily being productive only in 2025 and also on high-NA. 
The high-NA numbers next year, obviously, are very, very small in terms of revenue and also output, but we are obviously preparing our workforce, both in the factory but also in the field to accommodate the '25 and beyond ramp of high-NA. So obviously, that also same story. A lot of people that will be added there will be a drag on the gross margin for 2024.  
Question mark, obviously, is on the installed base business. We know that can go positively, again can go negatively on the gross margin, very much dependent on how the upgrade business will come back in 2024. And then finally, in light of all the puts and takes that you might think of in terms of revenue, also in light of what was -- what Peter just said, the China export controls, you could maybe see less immersion tools into China, also less on the high end. So that could also be a bit of a headwind on the gross margin. So that's it really, Joe. Those are all the puts and takes I would see today. And in the Q1 -- in the Q4 call in January of next year, I think, we will have a much better handle on how those -- all of those pan out.",488,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

I think on the DPUV, I think Roger said it in the answer to the previous call. In the DPUV, of course, we've had a great year for China because we were basically delivering out of the backlog. These guys ordered and the orders were there, they were pre-paid and we had the opportunity to ship. I don't think that will repeat itself in that volume so much next year. And on top of that, of course, there is a new export control regulation that will put, let's say, as a handful of Chinese fabs under the export control rules where we cannot ship immersion tools, just a handful of, but it's still -- it is still sales that we had in 2023 that we'll not have in 2024.  
So I think DPUV could see some reduction. Based on that now, if the sales stay the same or at a similar level than EUV grows. But the -- what Roger also said, as an answer to the previous question, we do expect that fast shipments going out of 2024 will be lower. So there's going to be, you could say, an accounting windfall on the top line. So I think, all in all, this is a bit of the picture. So somewhat lower DPUV units -- EUV units could be lower because of the fact that we actually have -- although we could see revenue increase as a result of the fast shipment move could indeed be also somewhat lower, but with higher sales prices. So this is what the picture is for next year.  
Now like Roger also said, probably January after the fourth quarter results is probably the better time to go into a bit more detail. But directionally, that's what you can expect.",297,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

I think you have to understand where these tools are being used for. The vast majority of our shipments to China is mid critical to mature. And that's really where our business is. Of course, like I said earlier, there's a handful of fabs -- not customers, fabs that have been identified as ready for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. So those will -- those are now excluded but the vast majority is mid-critical to mature.  
Will that level off? I don't think so. And why don't I think so? Because you need to realize where those chips are being used for. I mean China is, by far over 50% of all worldwide investments in renewable energy is in China. That's wind, that's solar, that's the buildup of the grid, the electrification, the buildup of the EV manufacturing capacity in China is significant. Industrial IoT is a significant driver. Next to that is also the continuous telecommunications infrastructure rollout. That's all mid-critical to mature stuff.  
And as it happens here, China invests a lot there. It's a big country of 1.4 billion people. So there is a lot of semiconductor need. And this is exactly when we look at the expansion plans of our Chinese customers, this is exactly what -- where they are putting their capacity at work in these areas. And if you look at the total consumption of semiconductors by the Chinese manufacturing industry, then China imports more semiconductors than they import oil.  
On top of that, you'll see the significant increase in these new transitions. That means that if China wants to come to a certain level of self-sufficiency, they have still a huge gap to cover to be completely self-sufficient. So it's also logical that they actually invest in this type of semiconductor technology because it's for internal use. And I think -- so it's -- I don't think we will see a peak this year. And actually, I think, there will be going forward the significant demand coming out of China for mid-critical and mature technology.

I mean it would still imply a significant recovery in 2025, but I just wanted to check if it's fair to assume, given the current [iteration] rate in the industry and the pushout that you are also seeing on your side, if you lean towards the low end of your guidance and I have a quick follow-up.",145,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,31,"Well, I mean, let me explain the following. I think our industry is cyclical, when we're in a downturn, and the deeper the downturn is the higher the upturn. And that's simply because the underlying trend, there's a secular trend of the capacity that is needed to support all these transitions that we all talk about and we all believe in. It has a downturn for whatever reason, it could be macro. It could be macroeconomic shocks. The deeper the downturn is, the higher the upturn. That has been -- if you just look at the 30-year cyclical behavior of our industry, that's exactly what is always happening. And it makes sense because the underlying trend is there.  
Now having said that, in my introductory comments, there are actually 3 reasons for why we believe 2025 is going to be a very strong year. One is these secular trends. They are there. And also it actually will -- it actually means that we need to build the capacity to support those trends. And if you don't build the capacity in 2023, 2024, and for Memory, it's even started earlier, it started in mid-2022, then it will have to be there to support those secular trends, which we all believe in. So -- and also going back to that, that's number one.  
Number two, in answer to the previous question, it feels like and also our customers keep telling us that they feel there is a trough. We're in the trough or we're very close. And that means they will see growth in 2024. You could argue about the slope of the growth because of macroeconomic uncertainty. But they all tell us, please prepare for 2025. So they strongly believe that growing in 2024 will probably start slow, but will accelerate into 2025. So they tell us, be ready. That's number two.  
Number three, when you look at the number of new fabs that are being opened geographically, fab extension that will need machines in Europe, in the U.S., across Asia, yes? Then that is already when we look at the demand, already more than 50% of our 2025 forecasted demand is on new fabs for DPV and EUV. So if you put it all together, also realizing that we actually look at 2024 and '25 together. Why is that? Because our lead times are more than 12 months. For EUV they are 1.5 years. So we need to have that very close connection with our customers. And we have these insights into these new fab expansions, not so much where they're going to add capacity for the existing fabs because that's basically -- that is a question of where the cycle is. If you take those 3 things together, and then we look at the demand that we're currently discussing with our customers, then 2025 is a very strong year and a very strong year doesn't jibe with your low end of the guidance.  
So it's -- again, it's the cyclical nature of this industry. We are now -- let's take Memory. If 2024 is not a full recovery year, then Memory is in a downturn of 2.5 years. Just look at it historically, always followed by a strong recovery. Same is true for Logic. And if we look at those building blocks -- of those 3 building blocks, that gives us the conviction at this moment in time, that 2025 is going to be -- is a very strong year. 
But then we need to prepare 2024, we can simply not wait until first quarter 2025. And then we start accelerating because the supply chain won't be there. Our lead times are simply too long. So we have to prepare that also in the year 2024. That's why it's a transition year. We look at '24, 2025 together. Why? Because the lead times of our tools and discussions with customers are actually supporting all of that. Sorry for the long answer.",662,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I think -- when you think about trailing edge, I mean, we did not see push out from many of our trailing edge customers because many of them are in China. But even ones that are not in China because they are supplying the mature market which for instance supplies the automotive industry and industrial IoT, they actually kept pretty strong. They were pretty healthy. So it is more in, you could argue, the leading edge than it was in a mature area. And don't forget, leading-edge doesn't only need high-end DPV or needs high-end immersion. It also needs mature, it's needs KrF, it needs i-Line. So -- but if you want to split this, then the demand shift was probably more in those areas where -- which is logical, look at the end markets, smartphone sales, PCs. The end markets where -- and that is where the inventory was. So this is also the area where you see the demand shifts.  
But healthy or actually relatively healthy was more in the mature space. And of course, China because we heavily undershipped these customers, which, of course, their orders in the order book and all -- and most of them were to a large extent pre-paid, of course, we will ship those tools to them if others don't want them.

And those advanced semiconductor manufacturing, we've been informed only applies to a handful of fabs. 
So that means that the 1980 for those handful of fabs is off limits, but not for the vast majority of our Chinese customers, for which we don't need an export control license either. We can just ship.  And those are for the mature and lower mid-critical chips that are needed for all the transitions that I just mentioned. So, yes.",142,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

As a matter of fact, the leading edge has been trending in half pitch and I was hoping that by next year, there will be a bigger demand for leading edge among foundry and your Logic customer. But what I get from you is probably EUV unit shipping is going to decline. 
What I want to ask you or get clarification, is this a kind of a pause as we insert a gate all around. Is this something that happened when we went from planar to FinFET and we're going to see a repeat of that next year. And then that would impact your EUV shipment?

So that -- so because of -- I say, the pause or a lower unit shipment of EUV next year is simply the cause of what we discussed earlier. I mean, we're in a cyclical downturn and our end markets that don't need that full capacity. So this is the reason. 
The R&D road maps are very much intact. And as a matter of fact, our leading customers keep telling us this, yes? So I would not expect -- I would even say, if you would see the HVM volume ramp on the gate all around architecture, it's just the reason -- one of the reasons why I think 2025, 2026 is going to be a good year. It's a very strong year. But everything that we see today, it's got nothing to do with that. It's got nothing to do with the road map. It's just got to do with the fact that we are in a down cycle, and we're climbing out of the down cycle, whereby the capacity utilization also at the leading edge is, of course, not at 100%.

On the R&D side, that's long term. And I think we would be ill-advised to now go cut our R&D road map and it's not what we're doing, right. So we are continuing to execute on the R&D road map. You might have seen that on the hiring of people, we slowed down a little bit this year. So part of that is in response to what I just mentioned in SG&A. It is also in response to the fact that in 2022, we hired 10,000 people. So on the 42,000 people that we have today, that's massive. So obviously, you want a certain level of absorption to happen there, and that's exactly what we're doing, right, making sure that people are well absorbed, but the growth also on the R&D headcount is nicely absorbed. 
So that's why you see this slowing down a little bit on hiring people. But no, I mean we continue to push down the accelerator on the R&D front because the opportunity is significant.

You do have a sizable backlog of over EUR 35 billion and over EUR 19 billion on the EUV side. So just referring to a previous question on pushouts. Do you see a risk? I mean, if you were to look out into 2024, especially on your EUV side, is your uncertainty more on do you get any pushouts on the existing backlog? Or is it a question of how many orders you can take in Q4 for shipment into 2024. My question is more -- you've said that it's -- that you've suggested that there is some conservatism in that. And I'm just wondering where the risk or the upside could come from? Is it more that there could be a risk of pushouts? Or is it just the amount of orders you could take in Q4?",150,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

I think it's a good question, Janardan. The way we look at this is we look -- one, of course, we are in close contact with our customers, and we are discussing in depth with them what they really need. But what they really need is also a function of where they are and what they see that they need going forward. And of course, where they are is they're in a clear -- many or all of them are in a down cycle where they feel it's about the trough or we might be seeing the inflection points that will take us out of the trough. So if you then think about the psychology of the customer and they look forward and they see these inflection points towards the end of the year changing positively, that means they will grow in 2024. That means what we discuss with them now is the -- because the minimum scenario. If everything happens the way that we think in terms of the inflection point, they will see growth, then I think this will be it. 
But that, of course, is -- that is -- and in their current mind, they don't give us a lot of orders. So their current mind is we have what we have. We look forward to what we need as a minimum in 2024. They better tell us -- they tell us you better prepare us for 2025. But the minimum in 2024 is what we call the conservative view because you could have a more positive view and say, well, it will turn in the second half of 2024. We don't have any indication that it's going to be that soon. So this minimum position that they see is what they have discussed with us, and seeing those inflection points, I think there is little risk to the downside, to answer your question. 
Now could there be an opportunity to the upside, that would effectively mean that what we see in 2025 for reasons of a faster recovery in the cycle will be pulled in into the back half of 2024. That could be an upside. But this is where we are. This is where our thinking is, and this is where the thinking of our customers is and this is how we reflect on our view of 2024.",394,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And just a small follow-up on China. As you referred to, the official regulations coming out of the U.S. government yesterday, if you look at the chuck overlay numbers of 2.4 nanometer, it seems to capture the 1980 as well and what you're saying is that because it's only the advanced manufacturing facilities will be covered by that, and that's a handful. But do you think that, that could be a moving target through the course of the year? I mean, could new fabs continuously be added to that? Or taken away from that. So does that sort of cloud the overall visibility on where China could actually end up just from a geopolitical standpoint over the next 12 months?",121,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,62,"I think that last word, geopolitical confrontation would end up is a billion dollar question, I suppose. But I think basically 2 answers. One, what -- how the regulations are currently structured is like the Japanese have also done the same thing. They basically say all immersion, but export controls will only apply to advanced manufacturing which is only those 5 fabs. Now could that grow? Yes. That has always been there. That particular risk in terms of export controls being enlarged to what it is today, that's a risk that we've always had. So that is basically a function of what you ended your question with, is how the geopolitical escalation will happen going forward. We don't know. 
I mean we just have to live with what the regulation is today, and you need to realize that this regulation, which is an amalgamation, a consolidation of the October 7 proposal of last year with the trilateral agreement between the Dutch, the Japanese and the Americans has led to this situation of this handful of fabs. So it's -- so this is also the result of, you could say, in-depth discussions, multilateral discussions between governments. 
Now I don't say that that's never going to change, but that's what you need to consider also. So we are where we are. I don't have a crystal ball to predict where geopolitics will go and how it will escalate but we need to work from where we are. And I can assure you that the results that are currently on the table in terms of regulation are the result of very deep discussions between governments that are not just on a lazy Sunday afternoon being prepared. This is very deep. So yes, it can change. But then also, I think the geopolitical situation first needs to change. And then of course, like I said, I don't have a crystal ball.",317,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,63,"And Janardan, a final element in the conversation, building on what Peter was just saying, and he said it before. Obviously, the regulation really aims at advanced semiconductor manufacturing. I think you simply have to recognize that most of the Chinese customers have gotten the message already last year. And as a result of that have really shifted to what we call mid-critical and mature manufacturing. That's what you see them do. 
So as a result of that, I would say the number of fabs that are still involved or number of our customers and fabs that are still involved in advanced manufacturing have gone down dramatically. And as a result of that, we can now talk about a handful of fabs that are associated with that. So if that's the objective, then that is completely achieved -- in line with -- exactly what now has been achieved.",148,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,64,"And that's a good point, Roger. When we do the road map discussions with our Chinese customers, they all moved back, not forward, they all moved back. And they do that because -- what was an answer to a previous question because if you look at the demand for mid-critical, low mid-critical and mature semiconductors, and you look at the significant transitions that also China is going through, and where -- in many areas, they're leading where it's electric vehicles or whether it's the energy transition, the square inches of silicon that is needed to support that are massive. So they actually need to build that capacity, which, by the way, they're not going to be self-sufficient because the demand, the local demand is simply too high. I mean, but they will be more self-sufficient, but not fully. And so there's no downside for our Chinese customers to actually move their road map in that direction.",157,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8
