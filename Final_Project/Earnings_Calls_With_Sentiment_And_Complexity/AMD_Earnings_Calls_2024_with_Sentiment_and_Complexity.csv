168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3653.0,3007457.0,109921649.0,Presenter Speech,Lisa Su,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We finished 2023 strong as data center sales accelerated significantly throughout the year despite the mixed demand environment. As a result, we delivered record data center segment annual revenue and strong top line and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp of Instinct AI accelerators and robust demand for EPYC server CPUs across cloud, enterprise and AI customers. 
Looking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, driven by significant double-digit percentage growth in our data center and client segments. On a full year basis, annual revenue declined 4% to $22.7 billion as record data center and embedded segment annual revenue was offset by lower client and gaming segment revenue. Importantly, Data Center and Embedded segment annual revenue grew by $1.2 billion and accounted for more than 50% of revenue in 2023 as we gained server share, launched our next-generation Instinct AI accelerators and maintained our position as the industry's largest provider of adaptive computing solutions. 
Turning to the fourth quarter business results. Data Center segment revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. Server CPU and Data Center GPU sales both set quarterly and annual revenue records as sales of our Data Center products accelerated throughout the year. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter, driven by significant double-digit percentage growth in fourth-gen EPYC processor revenue and demand for our third-gen EPYC processor portfolio. 
In cloud, while the overall demand environment remains soft, server CPU revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth-gen EPYC processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances. Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft and Oracle brought more than 55 AMD-powered AI, HPC and general-purpose cloud instances into preview or general availability in the fourth quarter. Exiting 2023, there were more than 800 EPYC CPU-based public cloud instances available. We expect this number to grow in 2024 based on the leadership performance, efficiency and features of our EPYC CPU portfolio. 
In enterprise, sales accelerated by a significant double-digit percentage in the quarter as we built momentum with Forbes 2000 customers. We closed multiple wins with large financial, energy, automotive, retail, technology and pharmaceutical companies, positioning us well for continued growth based on expanded production deployments planned for 2024. A growing number of customers are adopting EPYC CPUs for inferencing workloads where our leadership throughput performance delivers significant advantages on smaller models like LLaMA-7b as well as to power head nodes in large training and inference clusters. 
Looking ahead, customer excitement for our upcoming Turin family of EPYC processors is very strong. Turin is a drop-in replacement for existing fourth-gen EPYC platforms that extends our performance, efficiency and TCO leadership with the addition of our next-gen Zen 5 core, new memory expansion capabilities and higher core counts. Internal and end customer validation work is progressing to plan, with Turin on track to deliver overall performance leadership as well as leadership on a per core or per watt basis across a wide range of workloads when it launches later this year. 
Turning to our broader data center portfolio. Our data center GPU business accelerated significantly in the quarter, with revenue exceeding our $400 million expectation, driven by a faster ramp for MI300x with AI customers. We launched our MI300 accelerator family in December with strong partner and ecosystem support from multiple large cloud providers, all the major OEMs and many leading AI developers. MI300X GPUs deliver leadership generative AI performance by combining our high-performance CDNA 3 architecture with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. Customer response to MI300 has been overwhelmingly positive, and we are aggressively ramping production to support the dozens of cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers deploying Instinct accelerators. 
In cloud, we are working closely with Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and other large cloud customers on Instinct GPU deployments, powering both their internal AI workloads and external offerings. For enterprise customers, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and other server vendors are on track to launch differentiated MI300 platforms later this quarter with strong demand from multiple enterprise customers. In HPC supercomputing, we shipped the majority of AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators for the El Capitan supercomputer in the fourth quarter and expect to complete shipments this quarter for what is expected to be the world's fastest supercomputer when it comes online later this year. 
We also closed new Instinct GPU wins in the quarter, including the flagship system at the German High-Performance Computing Center, HLRS, as well as what is expected to be one of the world's most powerful enterprise supercomputers for energy company, Eni. On AI software development, we made significant progress expanding the ecosystem of AI developers working on AMD platforms with the release of our ROCm 6 software suite. The ROCm 6 stack significantly increases performance in key generative AI workloads, adds expanded support and optimizations for additional frameworks and libraries and simplifies the overall developer experience. 
The additional functionality and optimizations of ROCm 6 and the growing volume of contributions from the open source AI software community are enabling multiple large hyperscale and enterprise customers to rapidly bring up their most advanced large language models on AMD Instinct accelerators. For example, we are very pleased to see how quickly Microsoft was able to bring up GPT-4 on MI300X in their production environment and roll out Azure private previews of new MI300 instances aligned with the MI300X launch. 
At the same time, our partnership with Hugging Face, the leading open platform for the AI community, now enables hundreds of thousands of AI models to run out of the box on AMD GPUs, and we are extending that collaboration to our other platforms. Looking ahead, our prior guidance was for data center GPU revenue to be flattish from Q4 to Q1 and exceed $2 billion for 2024. Based on the strong customer pull and expanded engagements, we now expect data center GPU revenue to grow sequentially in the first quarter and exceed $3.5 billion in 2024. We have also made significant progress with our supply chain partners and have secured additional capacity to support upside demand. 
Turning to our client segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 62% year-over-year and flat sequentially. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 8000 Series notebooks and desktop processors in January, including our Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series that combine leadership compute performance and energy efficiency with an updated MPU that delivers up to 60% more AI performance compared to our prior generation that was already industry-leading. Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, MSI and other large PC OEMs will all offer notebooks powered by our Ryzen 8000 series processors, with the first systems expected to go on sale in February. 
To further our leadership in AI PCs, we launched our Ryzen 8000G series processors earlier this month, which are the industry's first desktop CPUs with an integrated AI engine. Millions of AI PCs powered by Ryzen processors have shipped to date and Ryzen CPUs power more than 90% of AI-enabled PCs currently in market. Our work with Microsoft and our PC ecosystem partners to enable the next generation of AI PCs expanded significantly in the quarter. 
We are aggressively driving our Ryzen AI CPU road map to extend our AI leadership, including our next-gen Strix processors that are expected to deliver more than 3x the AI performance of our Ryzen 7040 Series processors. Strix combines our next-gen Zen 5 core with enhanced RDNA graphics and an updated Ryzen AI engine to significantly increase performance, energy efficiency and AI capabilities of PCs. Customer momentum for Strix is strong, with the first notebooks on track to launch later this year. 
Looking at 2024, we are planning for the PC TAM to grow modestly year-on-year, weighted towards the second half as AI PCs ramp. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for our client business as we ramp our current products, extend our AI PC leadership and launch our next wave of Zen 5 CPUs. 
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $1.4 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections in the quarter. Going forward, we now expect annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year as supply caught up with demand in 2023 and we entered the fifth year of what has been a very strong console cycle. 
In Gaming graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by strong demand in the channel for both our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs. We expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series with the launch of new RX 7600 XT Series enthusiast desktop GPUs earlier this month that offer leadership price performance for 1080p gaming. We also launched new open source Fidelity FX Super Resolution 3 software that can deliver significantly higher gaming frame rates on both GPUs and APUs. 
Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.1 billion as customers focused on reducing their inventory levels. We expanded our embedded portfolio in the quarter with new leadership solutions for key markets. We launched new Versal Prime Adaptive SoCs for the aerospace, test and measurement, health care and communications markets that deliver industry-first support for DDR5 memory and increased DSP capability compared to our prior generation. 
In automotive, we launched new Versal SoC solutions that bring industry-leading AI compute capabilities and advanced safety and security features to next-generation vehicles. We also launched Ryzen embedded processors with unmatched performance and features for industrial automation, machine vision, robotics and edge server applications. 
Looking at 2024, we expect overall Embedded demand will remain soft through the first half of the year as customers continue to focus on normalizing their inventory levels. Longer term, we're very confident in the growth trajectory of our Embedded business as our expanded product portfolio drove more than $10 billion of design wins in 2023, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2022. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For 2024, we expect the demand environment to remain mixed, with strong growth in our data center and client segments, offset by declines in our Embedded and Gaming segments. Against this backdrop, we believe we will deliver strong annual revenue growth and expand gross margin, driven by the strength of our Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios. Taking a step back, we believe AI is a once-in-a-generation transition that will reshape virtually every portion of the computing market, starting in the data center and then expanding into PCs and across multiple embedded markets. 
We have built excellent customer traction based on the strength of our multiyear AI hardware and software road maps, and we see clear opportunities to drive our next wave of growth as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our portfolio. In the data center, we see 2024 as a start of a multiyear AI adoption cycle with the market for data center AI accelerators growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027. Customer deployments of our Instinct GPUs continues accelerating, with MI300 now tracking to be the fastest revenue ramp of any product in our history and positioning us well to capture significant share over the coming years based on the strength of our multi-generation instinct GPU road map and open source ROCm software strategy. 
In PCs, we are focused on delivering our long-term road maps with leadership Ryzen AI NPU capabilities to enable differentiated experiences as Microsoft and our other software partners bring new AI capabilities to PC starting later this year. At the same time, we are rapidly driving leadership AI compute capabilities across the full breadth of our embedded product portfolio. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry and even more exciting time for AMD as our leadership IP, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships position us well to deliver significant revenue growth and earnings expansion over the next several years. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?",2037,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2024",2024-01-30,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3653.0,3007457.0,109921650.0,Presenter Speech,Jean Hu,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. AMD executed well in 2023 despite mixed market demand environment, delivering revenue of $22.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.65. We drove year-over-year revenue growth in our embedded and data center segments. In addition, we successfully launched our AMD Instinct MI300 GPUs, positioning us for a strong ramp in 2024 in the AI market. 
For the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was $6.2 billion, growing 10% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segments was partially offset by the lower revenue in our Embedded and Gaming segment. Revenue was up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs across several leading customers and higher revenue from EPYC server processors, partially offset by the decline in Embedded and Gaming segment revenues. Gross margin was 51%, flat year-over-year, with higher revenue contribution from the Data Center and the Client segments offset by lower Embedded segment revenue. 
Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year as we invest in R&D and marketing activities to support our significant AI growth opportunities. Operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 23% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $163 million. For the fourth quarter of 2023, diluted earnings per share was $0.77, an increase of 12% year-over-year. 
Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $2.3 billion, up 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially, driven by strong growth of both AMD Instinct GPU and the fourth-generation AMD EPYC CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $666 million or 29% of revenue compared to $444 million or 27% a year ago. Higher operating income was primarily due to operating liability driven by higher revenue. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 62% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen 7000 Series CPU sales. Client segment operating income was $55 million or 4% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $152 million a year ago driven by higher revenue. 
Gaming segment revenue was $1.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by increase in Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $224 million or 16% of revenue compared to $266 million or 16% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $1.1 billion, down 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Embedded segment operating income was $461 million or 44% of revenue compared to $699 million or 50% a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $381 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $242 million. Inventory decreased sequentially by $94 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares and returned $233 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares and returned $985 million to shareholders. We have $5.6 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to our first quarter of 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.4 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment revenue to be flat, with the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong Data Center GPU ramp. Embedded revenue to decline as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Client segment revenue to decline seasonally. And in the Gaming segment, as we enter the fifth year of what has been a very strong gaming cycle and given current customer inventory levels, we expect revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. Year-over-year, we expect Data Center and Client segment revenues to increase by strong double-digit percentage given the strength of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities. Embedded segment to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. 
In addition, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.73 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. While we are not providing specific full year guidance for 2024, let me provide some color. 
Directionally, for the year, we expect the 2024 Data Center and the Client segment revenue to increase, driven by the strengths of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities. Embedded segment revenue to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. We expect to expand gross margin in 2024 and continue to invest to address the large AI opportunities while driving operating model leverage to deliver earnings per share growth faster than top line revenue growth. 
In closing, we delivered solid financial results in 2023, further strengthening our product portfolio and establishing ourselves as a leading provider of data center GPUs for AI. We are very well positioned to build on this momentum and deliver strong financial performance in 2024 and beyond.

I guess the first question is, can you help us on a relative basis, the $400 million of data center GPU revenue that you expected in Q4, what that ultimately kind of fell out to be? And then on the guidance into 1Q, can you help us appreciate what seasonal is defined as we think about the Server business into the 1Q guide?",77,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Let me start and then see if Jean has something to add. So relative to the data center GPU business, look, we were very pleased with the performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. It was always going to be a very sort of back-end quarter weighted as we were ramping the product. And we saw MI300A, our HPC product actually ramped very well. And then we saw MI300X, the AI product actually exceed our expectations based on the strong customer demand, the way the qualifications went and then the ramp -- manufacturer ramp. So we were over $400 million for that business in the fourth quarter. 
And then going into the first quarter, as we look at the business, server seasonality, call it, something around, let's call it, high single digit, low double digit. There are also some other pieces of the data center business. I think the key piece of it is, we had originally expected the ramp to be a little bit more shallow of our MI300X. And what we're seeing now is the supply chain is operating really well and the customer demand is strong. And so we will see MI300x increase as we go into the first quarter and things are going relatively well.",212,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Aaron, I'll give you some color about client seasonality and others. So Client is very similar to server. Typically, Q1 is high single digit to low double digit. That's consistent with the past. On the Embedded side, it's very consistent with what we said in the past and consistent with what you see in the industry is Embedded business is going through a bottoming process. And we think Q1, it will have a low double-digit sequential decline. That's Embedded. 
On the Gaming side, Lisa mentioned during her prepared remarks is we have the late stage of product cycle in the year 5 of gaming console. But at the same time, we're also having inventory at the customers. So the combination of those impact, we expect the Q1 gaming sequential decline probably more than 30%. So hopefully, that helps you a little bit.",143,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

Very helpful, Jean. And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious, the traditional server demand that you see, I know when we look at server CPU, shipments are down north of 20% year-over-year. Are you seeing any signals or how are you thinking about a recovery in that traditional, call it, non-AI general-purpose server market as we move through '24?",61,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So look, I think I agree with your characterization of the 2023 demand, although we did see some strong progress in the second half of the year, especially as customers in cloud and enterprise adopted our Genoa and our Zen 4 family. So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious. 
That being the case, though, we also see opportunities for us to continue to grow share in the traditional server business. I think our portfolio is extremely strong. The adoption of Genoa and Bergamo as well as our new Siena  product lines are getting a lot of traction. And then we also see Turin, our Zen 5 product, coming in the second half of the year. So even in a mixed demand environment, I think we're bullish on what traditional server CPUs can do in 2024.",171,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks, Tim, for the question. I would say a couple of things. First of all, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in our Data Center GPU business. I think the ramp that we've seen, the customer traction that we've seen even in the last few months, I think, has been great and that gives us a lot of confidence in the ramp of this business. I think the beauty of the AI market here is it's growing so quickly that I think we have both the market dynamic as well as our ability to gain share in that framework. 
The point I will make is, our customer engagements right now are all quite strategic, dozens of customers with multigenerational conversations. So as excited as we are about the ramp of MI300, and frankly, there's a lot to do in 2024, we're also very excited about the opportunities to extend that into the next couple of years out into that '25, '26, '27 time frame. So I think we see a lot of growth. I think It's a little early to make market share projections, but I would say it's a significant growth driver given the market demand as well as our own product capabilities.",208,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Is that a reasonable target?

Thank you for the question. Yes, we're not guiding a year. It's very early of the year, literally January. I think the way to think about it is, Lisa mentioned it during her prepared remarks, we feel pretty good about both our Data Center and Client business to grow in 2024. Of course, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center between both the server side gaining more share and the data center GPU side with a significant ramp of our MI300. I think that's how we think about it. 
We do have a headwind from Gaming segment, we do think year-over-year, we will see very significant double-digit decline on the Gaming segment. And at the same time, Embedded is going through the bottoming process. We do think the second half will see the recovery. So those are the puts and takes I can talk about it.",152,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

And I mean we've progressed over the last 6 months from, I think, some doubts in the investment community to software and your ability to ramp the product. And now you've proven that you're ramping it with, I think, you said dozens of customers, right, across different end markets. 
What I'm interested in hearing a little bit more about and you guys have been open about what some of the forward programs in your traditional server business look like from a road map perspective. I'd be interested to hear how you're thinking about the road map in your MI accelerator family? Is it going to -- they're going to continue to be parts that are CPU and GPU together? Is it primarily a GPU only road map? What kind of cadence are you thinking about? Just any kind of color you can give us on some of the forward road map trajectory for that program would be really helpful.",184,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Sure, Matt. So I appreciate the comments. I think the traction that we're getting with the MI300 family is really strong. I think what's benefited us here is our use of chiplet technologies, which has given us the ability to have sort of both the APU version as well as the GPU version, and we continue to use that to differentiate ourselves. And that's how we get our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages. 
As we go forward, you can imagine like we did in the EPYC time frame, we plan multiple generations in sequence. That's the way we're planning the road map. One of the things I will note about the AI accelerator market is the demand for compute is so high that we are seeing sort of an acceleration of the road map generations here, and we are similarly planning acceleration of our road map. I would say that we'll talk more about the overall road map beyond MI300 as we get into later this year, but you can be assured that we're working very closely with our customers to have a very competitive road map for both training and inference that will come out over the next couple of years.",204,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

Maybe you could give us a little look under the hood as to, I guess, the -- I've got 100 versions of the same question, which is how the heck did you come up with that number. So if you could give us a little bit more in terms of are we talking about systems and accelerator cards? Are we talking about just the silicon? Are we talking about full servers? And what kind of sort of unit assumptions, any kind of thing that you can give us on market sizing or what gives you the visibility so early into this generative AI trend to give a precise number 3 years out?

Well, Matt, I don't know how precise it is, but I think we said approximately $400 billion. But I think what we need to look at is growth rate and how do we get to those growth rates. I think we expect units to grow sort of substantial double-digit percentage. But you should also expect that content is going to grow. So if you think about how important memory and memory capacity is, as we go forward, you can imagine that we'll see acceleration there in just the overall content as we go to more advanced technology nodes. 
So there's some ASP uplift in there. And then what we also do is we're planning longer-term road maps with our customers in terms of how they're thinking about sort of the size of training clusters, the number of training clusters. And then the fact that we believe inference is actually going to exceed training as we go into the next couple of years, just given as more enterprises adopt. So I think as we look at all those pieces, I think we feel good that the growth rate is going to be significant and sustained over the next few years. 
In terms of what's in that TAM, it really is accelerator TAM. So within accelerators, there are certainly GPUs, and there will also be some ASICs that are -- or other accelerators that are in that TAM. As we think about sort of the different types of models from smaller models to fine-tuning of models to very -- the largest -- large language models, I think you're going to need different silicon for those different use cases. But from our standpoint, GPUs are still going to be the sort of the compute element of choice when you're talking about training and inferencing on the largest language models.",307,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So yes, look, we are really happy with how the MI300 has come up, and we've now deployed and working with a number of customers. What we have seen is certainly ROCm 6 has been very important as well as the direct optimization with our top cloud customers. We always said that the best way of optimizing the software is working directly on the most important workloads. And we've seen performance come up nicely, which is what we expect, frankly, with the GPU capabilities that we would have to do some level of optimization, but that optimization has gone well. 
I think to your broader question, the way I look at this is there are lots of opportunities for us to work directly with large customers, both on the cloud side as well as on the enterprise side who have specific training and inferencing workloads. Our job is to make it as easy as possible for them. And so our entire tool chain, all of our -- sort of the overall ROCm suite has really gone through significant progress over the last 6 to 9 months. And then we're also getting some nice support from the open source community. So the work that Hugging Face is doing is tremendous in terms of just real-time optimization on our hardware, our partnership with OpenAI on Triton and our work across a number of these open source models has helped us actually make very rapid progress.",246,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I mean, Joe, I think we updated our revenue expectations this quarter from our original number of $2 billion to $3.5 billion to try to give some bounding on some of the discussion out there. The way to think about the $3.5 billion is these are customers that we're working with who have given us firm commitments on what they need. As you know, the lead times on these products are quite long. So it's important to have those forecasts in early. And we have a strong order book. So that gives us good confidence to exceed the $3.5 billion. 
From a supply chain standpoint, our goal is always to build more supply. We -- and so from that standpoint, we have also worked with our supply chain partners and secured significant capacity. Think about it as first half capacity is tight and more comes on in the second half of the year, but we've certainly made more progress there. So we do have more supply, and we're going to continue to work with our customers on their deployments, and we'll update that number as we go through the year.",192,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Is it fair to assume kind of a straight line as we progress through the balance of the year? Or is it more second half skewed? How should we think about that? 
And I guess more importantly, some of the cloud potential customers that have yet to officially sign up for -- sign off on the MI300. I guess what's the sticking point? Is it just a function of time and you just need a little bit more time to go back and forth and tweak things? Or is there a software kind of concern?

Thanks for the question. So first, on the MI300 trajectory, I think you would expect that revenue should increase every quarter from now through sort of the end of the year, but it will be a bit more second half weighted. And part of that is just customers as they're finishing up their qualifications in their lines as well as sort of how our supply chain is ramping. So yes, it should increase each quarter, but be a bit more second half weighted. 
And then to your comment about customers. Look, we're engaged with all of -- sort of the large customers. These are all folks that know us really well, given our deep relationships in EPYC. I think people just have different adoption cycles as they consider what they're trying to do in their road map. But I view this as still very, very early innings for us in this space. And I think a question was asked earlier. I think the key is this is not just about an MI300 conversation, but it really is about sort of our long-term multigenerational road map. And so that's the context on which we're working with our largest customers as well as, as you know, there's a lot of demand coming from folks that are more AI-centric and not necessarily typical cloud customers, but more enterprise or, let's call it, AI-specific companies that we're also very well engaged with.",240,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

That's super helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side. You're guiding Q1 to 52%. Curious -- again, I'm sure you're not going to give quantitative guidance beyond Q1, but how to think about the trajectory for Q2 and beyond. I'm pretty sure you're working through some kinks as it pertains to the Instinct ramp. Hopefully, that improves over time. So that should be a tailwind. FPGAs, perhaps the second half turns for the better, and you've got server CPU volume growth throughout the year. So it feels like you've got multiple tailwinds as we think about gross margin progression on a sequential basis.

Yes, you're absolutely right. We have some puts and takes that impact our gross margin. We guided the Q1 120 basis points higher than Q4 sequentially, primarily because of the higher Data Center contribution actually more than offset the decline of Embedded business in Q1. 
Going forward, the way to think about it is, as you said, is the major driver is going to be Data Center business is going to grow much faster than other segments. That mix change will help us to expand the gross margin nicely. I think you also are spot on, on the Embedded coming back in second half, which will be a tailwind. With the Data Center GPU, we are at the very early stage of ramp. 
We are improving testing time yield and continue to expand gross margin, and we expect it to be accretive to corporate average. So those are all the tailwinds coming in the second half. I would say, the headwinds side continue to be in the first half where we see Embedded business not only in Q1, we see sequential decline. Q2 probably are going to be sequentially flattish versus Q1. That is a headwind for us because it does have a very nice gross margin.

So look, I think the environment for us is always competitive. So I think that has not changed. If I look at the Instinct side, I think we have -- I think we've shown that MI300 and our road map are actually very competitive. There are some places where, let's call it, it's more even like in the training environment. But as we look at the inferencing environment, we think we have significant advantages. And that's shown through in some of our customer work. So we think for both training and inference, we will continue to be very competitive. 
And then as you go into the CPU side, again, from our view, with each generation of EPYC, we've continued to gain share. I think we exited the fourth quarter at record share for AMD, and we're still quite underrepresented in enterprise. So I think there's an opportunity for us to continue to gain share as we go through 2024.

Let me start off with the accelerator side. The question we get a lot from our customers is they want to understand the value proposition of the MI300. So Lisa, I was hoping you could give us some understanding of price versus power comparison or compute power. And then today, are you seeing your customers that are buying the MI300, are they primarily buying it for inferencing today? Or are they using it primarily for tooling? And maybe for Jean. Jean, do you think is it possible for MI300 to finish the year at a run rate of about 1.5 billion?",105,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So let me start. Your question about the value proposition for MI300. Again, customers are using it for different reasons, but I presume that there is a performance per dollar benefit to using AMD. So that's one piece of it. The other piece of it, though, is we intrinsically have more free bandwidth and memory capacity on MI300X compared to the competition. And what that means is for large language models that are many tens of billions of parameters, you make -- you could potentially do the workload in fewer GPUs. So it's a substantial system savings and allows you to do much more work within the same system.
In terms of what customers are using MI300 for today, I would say there are a number of customers using it for large language model inferencing. And there are also customers that are using it for training. So I think the whole point is being a strong partner. When you put these AI systems in place, they are sometimes mixed-use systems, so they would be used for both training and inference.",182,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry as the widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets. Under this backdrop, we are executing very well as we ramp our data center business and enable AI capabilities across our product portfolio. 
Looking at the first quarter, revenue increased to $5.5 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 2 percentage points and increased profitability as Data Center and Client segment sales each grew by more than 80% year-over-year. 
Data Center segment revenue grew 80% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. The substantial year-over-year growth was driven by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct MI300X GPU shipments and a double-digit percentage increase in server CPU sales. We believe we gained server CPU revenue share in the seasonally down first quarter, led by growth in enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments. 
In cloud, while the overall demand environment remain mixed, hyperscalers continued adopting fourth-gen EPYC processors to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. There are now nearly 900 AMD-powered public instances available globally as Amazon, Microsoft and Google all increased their fourth-gen EPYC processor offerings with new instances and regional deployments. 
In the enterprise, we have seen signs of improving demand as CIOs need to add more general purpose and AI compute capacity while maintaining the physical footprint and power needs of their current infrastructure. This scenario aligns perfectly with the value proposition of our EPYC processors. 
Given our high core count and energy efficiency, we can deliver the same amount of compute with 45% fewer servers compared to the competition, cutting initial CapEx by up to half and lowering annual OpEx by more than 40%. As a result, enterprise adoption of EPYC CPUs is accelerating, highlighted by deployments with large enterprises, including American Airlines, DBS, Emirates Bank, Shell and STMicro. 
We're also building momentum with AMD-powered solutions powering the most popular ERP and database applications. As one example of the latest generation of Oracle Exadata, the leading database solution used by 76 of the Fortune 100, is now powered exclusively by fourth-gen EPYC processors. Looking ahead, we're very excited about our next-gen Turin family of EPYC processors featuring our Zen 5 core. We're widely sampling Turin and the silicon is looking great. 
In the cloud, the significant performance and efficiency increases of Turin position us well to capture an even larger share of both first and third-party workloads. In addition, there are 30% more Turin platforms in development from our server partners compared to fourth-gen EPYC platforms, increasing our enterprise SAM with new solutions optimized for additional workloads. Turin remains on track to launch later this year. 
Turning to our broader Data Center portfolio. We delivered our second straight quarter of record data center GPU revenue as MI300 became the fastest-ramping product in AMD history, passing $1 billion in total sales in less than 2 quarters. In cloud, MI300x production deployments expanded at Microsoft, Meta and Oracle to power Generative AI training and inferencing for both internal workloads and a broad set of public offerings. 
For the enterprise, we're working very closely with Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others as multiple MI300X platforms enter volume production this quarter. In addition, we have more than 100 enterprise and AI customers actively developing or OpenAI MI300X. 
On the AI software front, we made excellent progress adding upstream support for AMD hardware in the open AI Triton compiler, making it even easier to develop highly performant AI software for AMD platforms. 
We also released a major update to our ROCm software stack that expand support for open source libraries, including vLLM, and frameworks, including JAKs, adds new features like video decode and significantly increases generative AI performance by integrating advanced attention algorithm support for sparsity and FPA. 
Our partners are seeing very strong performance in their AI workloads. As we jointly optimize for their models, MI300X GPUs are delivering leadership inferencing performance and substantial TCO advantages compared to H100. For instance, several of our partners are seeing significant increases in tokens per second when running their flagship LLMs on MI300x compared to H100. 
We're also continuing to enable the broad ecosystem required to power the next generation of AI systems, including as a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, working to optimize the widely adopted Ethernet protocol to run AI workloads at data center scale. 
MI300 demand continues to strengthen. And based on our expanding customer engagements, we now expect data center GPU revenue to exceed $4 billion in 2024, up from the $3.5 billion we guided in January. Longer term, we are increasingly working closer with our cloud and enterprise customers as we expand and accelerate our AI hardware and software road maps and grow our data center GPU footprint. 
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 85% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our latest-generation Ryzen mobile and desktop processors with OEMs and in the channel. Client segment revenue declined 6% sequentially. 
We saw strong demand for our latest-generation Ryzen processors in the first quarter. Ryzen desktop CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, and Ryzen mobile CPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year as new Ryzen 8040 notebook designs from Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo and others ramped. 
We expanded our portfolio of leadership enterprise PC offerings with the launch of our Ryzen Pro 8000 processors earlier this month. Ryzen Pro 8040 mobile CPUs delivered industry-leading performance in battery life for commercial notebooks. And our Ryzen Pro 8000 series desktop CPUs are the first processor to offer dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators in commercial desktop PCs. 
We see clear opportunities to gain additional commercial PC share based on the performance and efficiency advantages of our Ryzen Pro portfolio and an expanded set of AMD-powered commercial PCs from our OEM partners. Looking forward, we believe the market is on track to return to annual growth in 2024, driven by the start of an enterprise refresh cycle and AI PC adoption. 
We see AI as the biggest inflection point in PC since the Internet, with the ability to deliver unprecedented productivity and usability gains. We're working very closely with Microsoft and a broad ecosystem of partners to enable the next generation of AI experiences, powered by Ryzen processors, with more than 150 ISVs on track to be developing for AMD AI PCs by the end of the year. 
We will also take the next major step in our AI PC road map later this year with the launch of our next-generation Ryzen mobile processors codenamed Strix. Customer interest in Strix is very high based on the significant performance and energy efficiency uplifts we are delivering. 
Design win momentum for premium notebooks is outpacing prior generations as Strix enables next-generation AI experiences in laptops that are thinner, lighter and faster than ever before. We're excited about the growth opportunities for the PC market. And based on the strength of our Ryzen CPU portfolio, we expect to grow revenue share this year. 
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 48% year-over-year and 33% sequentially to $922 million. First quarter semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle. In Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year and sequentially. We expanded our Radeon 7000 Series family with the global launch of our Radeon RX 7900 GRE and also introduced our driver-based AMD fluid motion frames technology that can provide large performance increases in thousands of games. 
Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $846 million as customers remain focused on normalizing their inventory levels. We launched our Spartan UltraScale+ FPGA family with high I/O counts, power efficiency and state-of-the-art security features, and we're seeing a strong pipeline of growth for our cost-optimized embedded portfolio across multiple markets. 
Given the current embedded market conditions, we're now expecting second quarter embedded segment revenue to be flat sequentially, with a gradual recovery in the second half of the year. Longer term, we see AI at the edge as a large growth opportunity that will drive increased demand for compute across a wide range of devices. To address this demand, we announced our second generation of Versal adaptive SoCs that deliver a 3x increase in AI tops per watt and a 10x greater scaler compute performance compared to our prior generation of industry-leading adaptive SoCs. 
Versal Gen 2 adaptive SoCs are the only solution that combine multiple compute engines to handle AI preprocessing, inferencing and post processing on a single chip, enabling customers to rapidly add highly performant and efficient AI capabilities to a broad range of products. We were pleased to be joined at our launch by Subaru, who announced they adopted Versal AI Edge series Gen 2 devices to power the next generation of their EyeSight ADAS system. 
Embedded Design win momentum remains very strong as customers adopt our full portfolio of FPGAs, CPUs, GPUs and adaptive SoCs to address a larger portion of their compute needs. In summary, we executed well in the first quarter, setting us up to deliver strong annual revenue growth and expanded gross margin, driven by growing adoption of our Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios. 
Our priorities for 2024 are very clear: accelerate our Data Center growth by ramping Instinct GPU production and gaining share with our EPYC processors; launch our next-generation Zen 5 PC and server processors that extend our leadership performance; and expand our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions. 
Looking further ahead, AI represents an unprecedented opportunity for AMD. While there has been significant growth in AI infrastructure build-outs, we are still in the very early stages of what we believe is going to be a period of sustained growth, driven by an insatiable demand for both high-performance AI and general purpose compute. 
We have expanded our investments across the company to capture this large growth opportunity, from rapidly expanding our AI software stack to accelerating our AI hardware road maps, increasing our go-to-market activities and partnering closely with the largest AI companies to co-optimize solutions for their most important workloads. We are very excited about the trajectory of the business and the significant growth opportunities ahead. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?",1747,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth in our Data Center and Client segments in the fourth quarter and grew 230 basis points of gross margin expansion. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segment was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segment. 
Revenue declined 11% sequentially as higher Data Center revenue resulting from the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs was offset by lower Gaming and Embedded segment revenues. Gross margin was 52%, up 230 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher revenue contribution from the Data Center and Client segment, partially offset by lower Embedded and Gaming segment revenue contribution. 
Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, as we continued investing aggressively in R&D and marketing activities to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us. Operating income was $1.1 billion, representing a 21% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $120 million. For the fourth quarter of 2024, diluted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 3% year-over-year. 
Now turning to our Reportable segment, starting with the Data Center. Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.3 billion, up 80%, a $1 billion increase year-over-year. Data Center accounted for more than 40% of total revenue, primarily led by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs from both cloud and enterprise customers and a strong double-digit percentage growth in our server process revenue as a result of growth across our sample products. 
On a sequential basis, revenue increased 2%, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs, partially offset by seasonal decline in server CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $541 million or 23% of revenue compared to $148 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up 266% year-over-year due to operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D. 
Client segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up 85% year-over-year, driven primarily by Ryzen 8000 series processors. On a sequential basis, Client revenue declined 6%. Client segment operating income was $86 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $172 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue. 
Gaming segment revenue was $922 million, down 48% year-over-year and down 33% sequentially due to a decrease in semi customer and Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $151 million or 16% of revenue compared to $314 million or 18% a year ago. 
Embedded segment revenue was $846 million, down 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially as customers continue to manage their inventory levels. Embedded segment operating income was $342 million or 41% of revenue compared to $798 million or 51% a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $521 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $379 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $301 million to $4.7 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of data center and client products in advanced process node. 
At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment was $6 billion. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing this June. Given our ample liquidity, we plan to retire that utilizing existing cash. 
Now turning to our second quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment revenue to increase by double-digit percentage, primarily driven by the Data Center GPU ramp; client segment revenue to increase; embedded segment revenue to be flat; and in the Gaming segment, based on current demand signals, revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. 
Year-over-year, we expect our Data Center and Client segment revenue to be up significantly, driven by the strength of our product portfolio; the Embedded and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage. In addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.8 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. 
In closing, we started the year strong. We made significant progress on our strategic priorities, delivering year-over-year revenue growth in our Data Center and the Client segment and expanded the gross margin. Looking ahead, we believe the investments we are making will position us very well to address the large AI opportunities ahead.

You're taking up the full year outlook from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. I'm curious what's driving that incremental $500 million in revenue? Is it new customers? Is it additional bookings from existing customers? Is it more cloud? Is it more enterprise? If you can sort of provide color there, that would be helpful. 
And then on the supply side, there's been headlines or chatter that CoWoS and/or HBM could be a pretty severe constraining factor for you guys. If you can speak to how you're handling the supply side of the equation, that would be helpful, too. And then I have a quick follow-up.",113,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thank you, Toshiya, for the question. Look, the MI300 ramp is going really well. If we look at just what's happened over the last 90 days, we've been working very closely with our customers to qualify MI300 in their production data centers, both from a hardware standpoint, software standpoint. So far, things are going quite well. 
And what we see now is just greater visibility to both current customers as well as new customers committing to MI300. So that gives us the confidence to go from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And I view this as very much -- it's a very dynamic market, and there are lots of customers. We said on the -- in the prepared remarks that we have over 100 customers that we're engaged with in both development as well as deployment. So overall, the ramp is going really well. 
As it relates to the supply chain, actually, I would say, I'm very pleased with how supply has ramped. It is absolutely the fastest product ramp that we have done. It's a very complex product, chiplets, CoWoS, 3D integration, HBM. And so far, it's gone extremely well. We've gotten great support from our partners. And so I would say, even in the quarter that we just finished, we actually did a little bit better than expected when we first started the quarter. 
I think Q2 will be another significant ramp. And we're going to ramp supply every quarter this year. So I think the supply chain is going well. We are tight on supply. So there's no question in the near term that if we had more supply, we have demand for that product, and we're going to continue to work on those elements as we go through the year. But I think both on the demand side and the supply side, I'm very pleased with how the ramp is going.",316,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

The other concern that we hear is your nearest competitor has been pretty transparent with their road map, and that extends into '25 and oftentimes '26. So -- and maybe this isn't the right venue for you to give too much, but beyond the MI300, how should we think about your road map and your ability to compete in Data Center?",83,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

So look, Toshiya, when we start with the road map, I mean, we always think about it as a multiyear, multigenerational road map. So we have the follow-ons to MI300 as well as the next, next generations well in development. I think what is true is we're getting much closer to our top AI customers. They're actually giving us significant feedback on the road map and what we need to meet their needs. 
Our chiplet architecture is actually very flexible. And so that allows us to actually make changes to the road map as necessary. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to be very competitive. Frankly, I think we're going to get more competitive. Right now, I think MI300x is in a sweet spot for inference, very, very strong inference performance. 
I see as we bring in additional products later this year into 2025, that, that will continue to be a strong spot for us. And then we're also enhancing our training performance and our software road map to go along with it. So more details to come in the coming months, but we have a strong road map that goes through the next couple of years, and it is informed by just a lot of learning in working with our top customers.",218,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think the -- our EPYC business has actually performed pretty well. The market is a bit mixed. I think some of the cloud guys are still working through sort of their optimizations. I think it's different by customer. We did see here in the first quarter, actually, some very nice early signs in the enterprise space, sort of large customers starting refresh programs. The value proposition of Genoa is very, very strong, and we're seeing that pull through across the enterprise. 
In the second quarter, we expect overall Data Center to be up strong double digits. And then within that, we expect server to be up as well. And as we go into the second half of the year, I think there are a couple of drivers for us. 
We do expect some improvement in the overall market conditions for the server business. But we also have our Turin launch in the second half of the year that will also, we believe, extend our leadership position within the server market. So overall, I think the business is performing well, and we believe that we're continuing to be very well positioned to gain share throughout the year.",204,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So I think, again, I think we're pretty excited about the AI PC, both opportunity in, let's call it, the near term and even more so in the medium term. I think the client business is performing well, both on the channel and on the MNC side. We expect clients to be up sequentially in the second quarter. 
And as we go into the second half of the year, to your question about units versus ASPs, I think we expect some increase in units as well as ASPs. The AI PC products, when we look at the Strix products, they're really well-suited for the premium segments of the market. And I think that's where you're going to see some of the AI PC content strongest in the beginning.

I guess the -- one of the questions that I've been getting from folks a lot is, obviously, your primary competitor has announced, I guess, a multiyear road map. And we continue to hear more and more from other folks about internal ASIC programs at some of your primary customers, whether they be for inference or training or both. 
I guess it'd be really helpful if you could just talk to us about how your conversations go with those customers, how committed they are to your long-term road map, multigeneration, as you described it, how they juxtapose doing investments of their internal silicon versus using a merchant supplier like yourselves and maybe what advantages the experience across a large footprint of customers can give your company that those guys doing internal ASICs might not get?",149,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think one of the things that we see and we've said is that the TAM for AI compute is growing extremely quickly. And we see that continuing to be the case in all conversations. We had highlighted a TAM of let's call it, $400 billion in 2027. I think some people thought that was aggressive at the time. But the overall AI compute needs, as we talk to customers is very, very strong. And you've seen that in some of the announcements even recently with some of the largest cloud guys. 
From my view, there are several aspects of it. First of all, we have great relationships with all of sort of the top AI companies. And the idea there is we want to innovate together. When you look at these large language models and everything that you need for training and inferencing there, although -- there will be many solutions. I don't think there's just one solution that will fit all. The GPU is still the preferred architecture, especially as the algorithms and the models are continuing to evolve over time. And that favors our architecture and also our ability to really optimize CPU with GPU. 
So from my standpoint, I think we're very happy with the partnerships that we have. I think this is a huge opportunity for all of us to really innovate together. And we see that there's a very strong commitment to working together over multiple years going forward. And that's, I think, a testament to some of the work that we've done in the past, and that very much is what happened with the EPYC road map as well.",285,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And I guess, having followed the company super closely for a long time, I think there's been -- there's always been noise in the system from whether the stock price is $2 a share or $200. There's been kind of always consistent noise one way or the other, but the last 1.5 months has been extreme in that sense. 
And so I wanted to just -- I got random reports by inbox about changes in demand from some of your MI300 customers or planned demand for consuming your product. I think you answered earlier about the supply situation and how you're working with your partners there. But has there been any change from the customers that you're in ramp with now or that you soon will be of what their intention is for demand?

Look, I think I might have said it earlier, but maybe I'll repeat it again. I think the demand side is actually really strong. And what we see with our customers and what we are tracking very closely is customers moving from, let's call it, initial POCs to pilots to full-scale production to deployment across multiple workloads. And we're moving through that sequence very well. I feel very good about the deployments and ramps that we have ongoing right now. 
And I also feel very good about new customers who are sort of earlier on in that process. So from a demand standpoint, we continue to build backlog as well as build engagements going forward.

We also see AI head nodes as another place where we see growth in, let's call it, the more traditional SSD market. Our sweet spot is really in the highest performance, sort of high core count, energy efficiency space, and that is playing out well. 
And we're also -- we've traditionally been very strong in, let's call it, cloud first-party workloads, and that is now extending to cloud third-party workloads, where we see enterprises who are, let's call it, in more of a hybrid environment, adopting AMD both in the cloud and on-prem.

I think at some point, there was a suggestion that the $4 billion number, right, that there are still supply constraints. But I think at a different point, you said that you have supply visibility significantly beyond that. 
Given that we are almost at the middle of the year, I would have thought that you would have much better visibility about the back half. So is the $4 billion number a supply-constrained number, or is it a demand-constrained number? Or alternatively, if you could give us some sense of what the exit rate of your GPU sales could be. I think on the last call, $1.5 billion was suggested. Could it be a lot more than that in terms of your exit rate of MI for this year?",147,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

Vivek, let me try to make sure that we answered this question clearly. From a full year standpoint, our $4 billion number is not supply capped -- I'm sorry, yes, it's not supply capped. It is -- we do have supply capability above that. It is more back half weighted. So if you're looking at sort of the near term, I would say, for example, in the second quarter, we do have more demand than we have supply right now, and we're continuing to work on pulling in some of that supply. 
By the way, I think this is an overall industry issue. This is not at all related to AMD. I think overall, AI demand has exceeded anyone's expectations in 2024. So you've heard it from the memory guys. You've heard it from the foundry guys. We're all ramping capacity as we go through the year. 
And as it relates to visibility, we do have good visibility into what's happening. As I said, we have great customer engagements that are going forward. My goal is to make sure that we pass all of the milestones as we're ramping products. And as we pass those milestones, we put that into the overall full year guidance for AI. 
But in terms of how customer progression, things are going, they're actually going quite well. And we continue to bring new customers on, and we continue to expand workloads with our current customers. And so hopefully, that clarifies the question, Vivek.",249,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I think the Embedded business declined a little bit more than expected, really due to the weaker demand in some of the markets, very specifically, communication has been weak. And some pockets of industrial and automotive, as you mentioned, it's actually quite consistent with the peers. 
Second half, we do think the first half is the bottom of Embedded business and will start to see gradual recovery in the second half. And going back to your gross margin question is, when you look at our gross margin expansion in both Q1 and the guide at Q2, the primary driver is the strong performance on the Data Center side. The Data Center will continue to ramp in second half. I think that will continue to be the major driver of gross margin expansion in second half. Of course, if Embedded is doing better, we'll have a more tailwind in the second half.",157,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Thanks for the question. For sure, look, our customers are engaged in the multigenerational conversation. So we're definitely going out over the next couple of years. And as it relates to the overall system integration, it is quite important. It is something that we're working very closely with our customers and partners on. That's a significant investment in networking, working with a number of networking partners as well to make sure that the scale-out capability is there. 
And to your question of do we have the pieces? We do absolutely have the pieces, I think the work that we've always done with our Infinity Fabric as well as with our Pensando acquisition that's brought in a lot of networking expertise. And then we're working across the networking ecosystem with key partners like Broadcom and Cisco and Arista, who are with us at our AI data center event in December.

I know you kind of held our hands at about this time last year sort of on what the full year could look like and how back-end loaded it could be. 
So I kind of wonder, could you give us some milestones in terms of how much server CPU could grow this year, how back-end loaded it could be?

If you look at the Gaming, the demand has been quite weak, that's quite very well-known and also their inventory level.

That's one of the major drivers for the operating income coming down slightly.

Because if you think about it, first of all, the ROCm stock has done really well. And the work that we're doing is hand in hand with our customers to optimize their key models. And it was important to get sort of verification and validation that everything would run well, and we've now passed some important milestones in that area. .
And then I think the other thing is, as you said, there is a huge demand for more AI compute. And so our ability to participate in that and help customers get that up and running is great.

By my math, it was down like 5%, 6% sequentially. Is that right? 
And that's less than half the decline of your competitor. And if so, like what drove the less-than-seasonal declines? I assume some of it was share gains. It sounds like Enterprise was also better.

We delivered strong second quarter financial results, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of guidance and profitability increasing by a double-digit percentage driven by higher-than-expected sales of our Instinct, Ryzen, and EPYC processors. 
We continued accelerating our AI traction as leading cloud and enterprise providers expanded availability of Instinct MI300X solutions, and we also saw positive demand signals for general-purpose compute in both our client and server processor businesses. 
As a result, second quarter revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $5.8 billion as significantly higher sales of our Data Center and Client processors more than offset declines in Gaming and Embedded product sales. 
We also expanded gross margin by more than 3 percentage points and grew EPS 19% as Data Center product sales accounted for nearly 50% of overall sales in the quarter. 
Turning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 115% year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. 
Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy 4th Gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to power a larger portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages. 
The number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected 4th Gen EPYC public cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission-critical customer-facing workloads. 
In the Enterprise, sell-through increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, health care, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than 1/3 of our Enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers. 
Looking ahead, our next-generation Turin family, featuring our new Zen 5 core, is looking very strong. Zen 5 is a ground-up new core design optimized for leadership performance and efficiency. Turin will extend our TCO leadership by offering up to 192 cores and 384 threads, support for the latest memory and I/O technologies and the ability to drop into existing 4th Gen EPYC platforms. 
We publicly previewed Turin for the first time in June, demonstrating our significant performance advantages in multiple compute-intensive workloads. We also passed a major milestone in the second quarter as we started Turin production shipments to lead cloud customers. Production is ramping now ahead of launch, and we expect broad OEM and cloud availability later this year. 
Turning to our Data Center AI business. We delivered our third straight quarter of record Data Center GPU revenue, with MI300 quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Microsoft expanded their use of MI300X accelerators to power GPT-4 Turbo and multiple copilot services, including Microsoft 365 Chat, Word, and Teams. Microsoft also became the first large hyperscaler to announce general availability of public MI300X instances in the quarter. 
The new Azure VMs leverage the industry-leading compute performance and memory capacity of MI300X in conjunction with the latest ROCm software to deliver leadership-inferencing price performance when running the latest frontier models, including GPT-4. Hugging Face was one of the first customers to adopt the new Azure instances, enabling enterprise and AI customers to deploy hundreds of thousands of models on MI300X GPUs with one click. 
Our Enterprise and Cloud AI customer pipeline grew in the quarter, and we are working very closely with our system and cloud partners to ramp availability of MI300 solutions to address growing customer demand. Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Super Micro all have Instinct platforms in production, and multiple hyperscale and Tier 2 cloud providers are on track to launch MI300 instances this quarter. 
On the AI software front, we made significant progress enhancing support and features across our software stack, making it easier to deploy high-performance AI solutions on our platforms. We also continued to work with the open source community to enable customers to implement the latest AI algorithms. As an example, AMD support for FlashAttention-2 algorithm was upstreamed, providing out-of-the-box support for AMD hardware in the popular library that can increase training and inference performance on large transformer models. 
Our work with the model community also continued accelerating, highlighted by the launches of new models and frameworks with day 1 support for AMD hardware. At Computex, I was joined by the co-CEO of Stable Diffusion to announce that MI300 is the first GPU to support their latest SD 3.0 image generation LLM. 
Last week, we were proud to note that multiple partners use ROCm and MI300X to announce support for the latest Llama 3.1 models, including their 405 billion parameter version that is the industry's first frontier-level open source AI model. Llama 3.1 runs seamlessly on MI300 accelerators. And because of our leadership memory capacity, we're also able to run the FP16 version of the Llama 3.1 405B model in a single server, simplifying deployment and fine-tuning of the industry-leading model and providing significant TCO advantages. 
Earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Silo AI, Europe's largest private AI lab with extensive experience developing tailored AI solutions for multiple enterprise and embedded customers, including Allianz, Ericsson, Finnair, Korber, Nokia, Philips, T-Mobile, and Unilever. The Silo team significantly expands our capability to service large enterprise customers looking to optimize their AI solutions for AMD hardware. Silo also brings deep expertise in large language model development, which will help accelerate optimization of AMD inference and training solutions. 
In addition to our acquisitions of Silo AI, Mipsology, and Nod.ai, we have invested over $125 million across a dozen AI companies in the last 12 months to expand the AMD AI ecosystem, support partners, and advance leadership AMD computing platforms. 
Looking ahead, from a road map perspective, we are accelerating and expanding our Instinct road map to deliver an annual cadence of AI accelerators, starting with the launch of MI325X later this year. MI325X leverages the same infrastructure as MI300 and extends our generative AI performance leadership by offering twice the memory capacity and 1.3x more peak compute performance than competitive offerings. 
We plan to follow MI325X with the MI350 series in 2025 based on the new CDNA 4 architecture, which is on track to deliver a 35x increase in performance compared to CDNA 3. And our MI400 series powered by the CDNA Next architecture is making great progress in development and is scheduled to launch in 2026. 
Turning to our AI solutions work. Broadcom, Cisco, HP Enterprise, Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, all joined us to announce Ultra Accelerator Link, an industry standard technology to connect hundreds of AI accelerators that is based on AMD's proven Infinity Fabric technology. By combining UALink with the widely supported Ultra Ethernet consortium specification, the industry is coming together to establish a standardized approach for building the next generation of high-performance data center AI solutions at scale. 
In summary, customer response to our multiyear Instinct and ROCm road maps is overwhelmingly positive and we're very pleased with the momentum we are building. As a result, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the $4 billion we guided in April. 
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 49% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our prior generation Ryzen processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 5 processors. 
In PC applications, Zen 5 delivers an average of 16% more instructions per clock than our industry-leading previous generation of Ryzen processors. 
For desktops, our upcoming Ryzen 9000 series processors dropped into existing AM5 motherboards and extends our performance and energy efficiency leadership across productivity, gaming, and content creation workloads. 
For notebooks, we announced our Ryzen AI 300 Series that extends our industry-leading CPU and GPU performance and introduces the industry's fastest NPU with 50 TOPs of AI compute performance for Copilot+ PCs. The first Ryzen AI 300 Series notebooks went on sale over the weekend to strong reviews, and more than 100 Ryzen AI 300 Series premium, gaming, and commercial platforms are on track to launch from Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, and others over the coming quarters. 
Customer excitement for our new Ryzen processors is very strong, and we are well positioned for ongoing revenue share gains based on the strength of our leadership portfolio and design win momentum. 
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 59% year-over-year to $648 million as semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections. Semi-custom demand remains soft as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle, and we expect sales to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In gaming graphics, revenue increased year-over-year, driven by improved sales of our Radeon 6000 and 7000 Series GPUs in the channel. 
Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 41% year-over-year to $861 million. The first quarter marked the bottom for our Embedded segment revenue. Although second quarter revenue was flattish sequentially, we saw early signs of order patterns improving and expect Embedded revenue to gradually recover in the second half of the year. 
Longer term, we are building strong design win momentum for our expanded Embedded portfolio. Design wins in the first half of the year increased by more than 40% from the prior year to greater than $7 billion, including multiple triple-digit million-dollar wins, combining our Adaptive and x86 compute products. 
We announced our Alveo V80 accelerators that deliver leadership capabilities in memory-intensive workloads and entered early access on next-generation edge AI solutions with more than 30 key partners on our upcoming 2nd Gen Versal Adaptive SoCs. 
Last week, we also announced Victor Peng, President of AMD, would retire at the end of August. Victor has made significant contributions to Xilinx and AMD, including helping scale our Embedded business and leading our cross-company AI strategy. On a personal note, Victor has been a great partner to me, ensuring the success of our Xilinx acquisition and integration. On behalf of all of the AMD employees and Board, I want to thank Victor for all of his contributions to AMD's success and wish him all the best in his retirement. 
In summary, we delivered strong second quarter results and are well positioned to grow revenue significantly in the second half of the year driven by our Data Center and Client segments. Our Data Center GPU business is on a steep growth trajectory as shipments ramp across an expanding set of customers. We're also seeing strong demand for our next-generation Zen 5, EPYC, and Ryzen processors that deliver leadership performance and efficiency in both Data Center and Client workloads. 
Looking ahead, the rapid advances in generative AI and development of more capable models are driving demand for more compute across all markets. Under this backdrop, we see strong growth opportunities over the coming years and are significantly increasing hardware, software, and solutions investments with a laser focus on delivering an annual cadence of leadership data center GPU hardware, integrating industry-leading AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, enabling full stack software capabilities, amplifying our ROCm development with the scale and speed of the open source community, and providing customers with turnkey solutions that accelerate the time to market for AMD-based AI systems. 
We are excited about the unprecedented opportunities in front of us and are well positioned to drive our next phase of significant growth. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?",2008,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter. 
We are very pleased with our overall second quarter financial results that came in above expectations. On a year-over-year basis, Data Center segment revenue more than doubled, Client segment revenue grew significantly, and we expanded the gross margin by 340 basis points. 
For the second quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segments was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segment. Revenue increased 7% sequentially primarily driven by growth in the Data Center and Client segments revenue. 
Gross margin was 53%, up 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher Data Center revenue. 
Operating expenses were $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year as we continue to invest in R&D to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us and enhance go-to-market activities. 
Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. 
Taxes, interest expense and other was $138 million. 
Diluted earnings per share was $0.69, an increase of 19% year-over-year. 
Now turning to our reportable segments, starting with Data Center. Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115%, a $1.5 billion increase year-over-year. The Data Center segment accounted for nearly 50% of total revenue led primarily by the steep ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs and a strong double-digit percentage EPYC server revenue growth. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 21% driven primarily by strong momentum in AMD Instinct GPUs. Data Center segment operating income was $743 million or 26% of revenue compared to $147 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up more than 5x from the prior year driven by higher revenue and operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D. 
Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven primarily by AMD Ryzen processor sales. Client segment operating income was $89 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $69 million a year ago. 
Gaming segment revenue was $648 million, down 59% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to semi-custom inventory digestion and the lower end market demand. Gaming segment operating income was $77 million or 12% of revenue compared to $225 million or 14% a year ago. 
Embedded segment revenue was $861 million, down 41% year-over-year, as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. On a sequential basis, Embedded segment revenue was up 2%. Embedded segment operating income was $345 million or 40% of revenue compared to $757 million or 52% a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $593 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $439 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $339 million to $5 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of Data Center GPU products. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $5.3 billion. 
In the second quarter, we returned $352 million to shareholders, repurchasing 2.3 million shares, and we have $5.2 billion of authorization remaining. During the quarter, we retired $750 million of debt that matured this past June, utilizing existing cash. 
Now turning to our third quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow approximately 15% primarily driven by strong growth in the Data Center and Client segment. We expect Embedded segment revenue to be up and the Gaming segment to decline by double-digit percentage. 
Year-over-year, we expect revenue to grow approximately 16% driven by the steep ramp of our AMD Instinct processors and a strong server and client revenue growth to more than offset the declines in the Gaming and the Embedded segment. 
In addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.9 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. Also during the third quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Silo AI for approximately $665 million in cash. 
In closing, we made significant progress during the quarter toward achieving our financial goals. We delivered record MI300 revenue that exceeded $1 billion and demonstrated solid traction with our next-gen Ryzen and EPYC product. We expanded gross margin significantly and drove earnings growth while increasing investment in AI. 
Looking forward, the opportunity ahead of us are unprecedented. We'll remain focused on executing to our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence.

Lisa, I wanted to ask you about MI300, how you see it playing out sequentially for the rest of the year. I guess there's about $2.8 billion left to hit your annual target. So I'm wondering if you see things picking up in the fourth quarter and how that's going sequentially.
And if you don't mind, I wanted to also ask about next year, if you see potential for rapid growth. You're probably aware of some of the chatter out there, and I just was wondering if you're already seeing signs that you can grow significantly given your road map for next year.",107,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Great, Ben. Thanks for the question. So first of all, on sort of MI300 and the customer evolution, we're very happy with how MI300 has progressed. When we started the year, I think the key point for us was to get our products into our customers' data centers, to have them qualify their workloads, to really ramp in production and then see what the production capabilities are, especially performance, and all of those things. And I can say now being sort of more than halfway through the year, we've seen great progress across the board. 
As we look into the second half of the year, I think we would expect that MI300 revenue would continue to ramp in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to expand both current deployments with our existing customers as well as we have a large pipeline of customers that we're working through that are getting familiar with our architecture and software and all that stuff. So I would say overall, very pleased with the progress, and really continuing right on track to what we expected from the capabilities of the product. 
As we go into next year, I mean, one of the important things that we announced at Computex was increasing and expanding our road map. I think we feel really good about our road map. We're on track to launch MI325 later this year, and then next year, our MI350 Series, which will be very competitive with Blackwell solutions. And then we're well on our way to our CDNA Next as well.
So I think, overall, we remain quite bullish on the overall AI market. I think the market continues to need more compute. And we also feel very good that our hardware and software solutions are getting good traction, and we're continuing to expand that pipeline.",308,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thanks for the question. So we're very pleased with the progress that we've made with EPYC. I think a couple of things. First of all, in terms of competitive positioning and just the traction in the market, our 4th Gen EPYC between Gen 1 Bergamo is really doing very well. We've seen broad adoption across cloud. And then we've been very focused on enterprise as well as third-party cloud instances. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're starting to see very nice traction in enterprise with both new customers as well as existing customers, and then for third-party cloud adoption, also a good pickup there as well. So I think overall, I think our EPYC portfolio has done well.
Going into the second half of the year, I think we also feel good about it. There are a couple of positives there. First of all, the market looks like it's improving, so we have seen some return to spending in both Enterprise and Cloud. And so I think those are positive market trends. And then in addition to that, we are in the process of launching Turin. So we started production here in the second quarter and we're on track to launch broadly in the second half of the year. We'll see some revenue of Turin in the second half of the year contributing as well.

As you said, 325 is launching later this year, so I guess I had two questions. Does the greater than $4.5 billion, does that include any revenue from 325? And can you talk a little bit more about 350? Obviously, we're seeing a big rack scale -- or a shift toward rack-scale systems for the competition's product, and I'm wondering if that's what 350 is going to look like. Is it going to have liquid cooling? And is it going to have a rack-scale aspect to it?",99,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So let me start with your original question. I mean I think, looking at 325X, we are on track to launch later this year. From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities. And 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year.
And then as we look at the 350 Series, what we're seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled. In spending time with our customers. I think there are people who certainly want more rack-level solutions, and we're certainly doing much more in terms of system-level integration for our products. You'll see us invest more in system-level integration.
But we also have many customers who want to use their current infrastructure. I think the beauty of the MI350 Series is it actually fits into the same infrastructure as the MI300 Series. And so it would lend itself to, let's call it, a pretty fast ramp if you've already invested in 300 or 325. So we see the range of options, and that's part of the expansion of the road map that we're planning.",225,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Sure, Ross. So first, we're very pleased with our Client business results. I think we have a very strong road map, so I'm very pleased with the road map. The Zen 5-based products, we're launching both notebook and desktop in the middle of this year. What we've seen is actually very positive feedback on the product. So we just actually launched the first Strix-based notebooks over the weekend. They went on sale. You may have seen some of the reviews. The reviews are very positive. Our view of this is the AI PC is an important add to the overall PC category. 
As we go into the second half of the year, I think we have better seasonality in general, and we think we can do, let's call it, above-typical seasonality given the strength of our product launches and when we're launching. And then into 2025, you're going to see AI PCs across sort of a larger set of price points, which will also open up more opportunities.
So overall, I would say the PC market is a good revenue growth opportunity for us. The business is performing well. The products are strong. And we're working very closely with both the ecosystem partners as well as our OEM partners to have strong launches here into the second half of the year.",222,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And I remember when the Naples product launched, there was a lot of, I would say, reaction, positively and negatively, and sort of sentiment around where your road map might go to relatively small perturbations in what the volumes were. Super early, but if I remember back to that, what was the most important was that was the toehold into the market for long-term engagement, both on the software side and the hardware side, with your customers 2, 3, 4 generations forward. So is that an accurate parallel to where you guys are with MI300? And maybe you could talk about the level of engagement, the intensity of engagement, the breadth of it across the customer base with 350 and 400.",152,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So look, as I said earlier, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on the Instinct road map. This is absolutely a long-term play. So absolutely, you're correct, it has a lot of parallels to the EPYC journey, where you really have to -- you gain more opportunities, broader workloads, larger deployments as you go from generation to generation. So we are playing the long game here.
Our conversations with our customers, so I would start with, first, in the near term, we had some very key milestones that we wanted to pass this year. And as I said, they related to getting hardware in volume in multiple hyperscalers as well as large Tier 2 customers. We've done that. We've now seen our software in a lot of different environments, and it's matured substantially. ROCm is in very -- from a standpoint of features, functions, out-of-box performance, getting to performance with customers, we've gained a lot of confidence and learned a lot in that whole process. The networking aspects of building out the rack scale and the system-level items are areas that we're continuing to invest in. And then the point of having long-term conversations across multiple generations is also really important. 
So I think all of those things have progressed well. We view this as very good progress for MI300, but we have a lot more to do. And I think the various road maps will help us open up those opportunities over the next couple of years.",254,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And today, they have these three options, right? They can buy GPUs from your largest competitor with all the software bells and whistles and incumbency, or they can do custom chips or they can buy from AMD. So how do you think this plays out next year? Do you think your customers, given all this concern around monetization, does it make them consolidate their CapEx around just the other 2 suppliers? Just how is your visibility going into next year given this industry debate?

The potential of AI is so large to impact the way enterprises operate and all that stuff. So I think the investment cycle will continue to be strong. 
And then relative to the various choices, for the size of the market, I firmly believe that there will be multiple solutions. Whether you're talking about GPUs or you're talking about custom chips or ASICs, there will be multiple solutions. In our case, I think we've demonstrated a really strong road map and the ability to partner well with our customers. And from the standpoint of that deep engagement, hardware, software co-optimization is so important in that. And for large language models, GPUs are still the architecture of choice.

Thanks for the question, Joe. So as we said on MI300, there are lots of great characteristics about it. One of them is our memory bandwidth and memory capacity is leading the industry. From that standpoint, the early deployments have largely been inference, in most cases, and we've seen fantastic performance from an inference standpoint.
We also have customers that are doing training. We've also seen that, from a training standpoint, we've optimized quite a bit our ROCm software stack to make it easier for people to train on AMD. And I do expect that we'll continue to ramp training over time. As we go forward, I think you'll see -- the belief is that inference will be larger than training from a market standpoint.

So on the supply side, we made great progress in the second quarter. We ramped up supply significantly, exceeding $1 billion in the quarter. I think the team has executed really well. We continue to see line of sight to continue increasing supply as we go through the second half of the year. 
But I will say that the overall supply chain is tight and will remain tight through 2025. So under that backdrop, we have great partnerships across the supply chain. We've been building additional capacity and capability there. And so we expect to continue to ramp as we go through the year. And we'll continue to work both supply as well as demand opportunities.

On your second question about the profitability, first, our team has done a tremendous job to ramp the product MI300. It's a very complex product, so we ramped it successfully. At the same time, the team also started to implement operational optimization to continue to improve gross margin. So we continue to see the gross margin improvement. Over time, in the longer term, we do believe gross margin will be accretive to corporate average.
From a profitability perspective, AMD always invests in platforms. If you look at our Data Center platform, especially both the server and the Data Center GPU side, we are ramping the revenue. The business model can leverage very significantly. Even from GPU side, because the revenue ramp has been quite significant, the operating margin continued to expand.

That was mainly Q4 and a bit in Q1. So if you think about our Q2 revenue, think about it as almost all AI. So it's MI300X, it's for large AI, hyperscalers as well as OEM customers going to enterprise and Tier 2 data centers. So that's the makeup of the customer set.
And then in terms of the various pieces of what we're doing, I think first on your question about memory, I think there's a lot of noise in the system. I wouldn't really pay attention to all that noise in the system. I mean this has been an incredible ramp. And I'm actually really proud of what the team has done in terms of just definitely fastest product ramp that we've ever done to $1 billion here in the -- over $1 billion in the second quarter and then ramping each quarter in Q3 and Q4.
In terms of memory, we have multiple suppliers that we've qualified on HBM3. And it's a tricky -- memory is a tricky business but I think we've done it very well, and that's there. And then we're also qualifying HBM3E for future products with multiple memory suppliers as well. 
So to your overarching question of what are the things that we're doing, the exciting part of this is that the ROCm capability has really gotten substantially better because so many customers have been using it. And with that, what we look at is out-of-box performance, how long does it take a customer to get up and running on MI300. And we've seen, depending on the software that companies are using, particularly if you're based on some of the higher-level frameworks like PyTorch, et cetera, we can be out-of-the-box running very well in a very short amount of time, like, let's call it, very small number of weeks. And that's great because that's expanding the overall portfolio.
We are going to continue to invest in software, and that was one of the reasons that we did the Silo AI acquisition. It's a great acquisition for us. 300 scientists and engineers. These are engineers that have experience with AMD hardware and are very, very good at helping customers get up and running on AMD hardware. And so we view this as the opportunity to expand the customer base with talent like Silo AI, like Nod.ai, which brought a lot of compiler talent. And then we continue to hire quite a bit organically. 
So I think Jean said earlier that we see leverage in the model, but we're going to continue to invest because this opportunity is huge, and we have all of the pieces. This is just about building out scale.",480,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

You kind of said above-seasonal for September, December. You're obviously launching a new notebook, desktop product, but you're also talking about AI PC. Could you just break down where you're seeing those above-seasonal trends? Is it the ASP uplift you're getting from the new products? Is it the unit assumption that's coming with AI PC? Just any kind of breakdown between those two and why you're seeing it a little bit better.",94,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So I think you actually said it well. We are launching Zen 5 desktops and notebooks with volume ramping in the third quarter, and that's the primary reason that we see above-seasonal. The AI PC element is certainly one element of that, but there is just the overall refresh. Usually, desktop launches going into a third quarter are good for us, and we feel that the products are very well positioned. So those are the primary reasons.",79,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So if we look at your guidance, it seems like the incremental gross margin is dropping a little bit for Q3. Why is that happening? And then just a follow-up on another part of the gross margin angle. Have you changed your gross margin expectations for the MI300? Has the accretion point moved out a little bit?",63,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

I think, first, we have made a lot of progress, as you mentioned, this year to expand our gross margin from 2023 at a 50 percentage point to, we actually guided 53.5% for Q3. The primary driver is really the faster Data Center business growth. If you look at the Data Center business, as a percentage of revenue from 37% in Q4 last year to now close to 50%, that faster expansion really helped us with the gross margin.
When you look at the second half, we'll continue to see Data Center to be the major driver of our top line revenue growth that will help with the margin expansion. But there are some other puts and takes. I think Lisa mentioned the PC business actually is going to do better in second half, especially typically, seasonally, it tends to be more consumer-focused. So that really is a little bit different dynamics there.
Secondly, I would say Embedded business, we are going to see Embedded business to be up sequentially each quarter. But the recovery, as we mentioned earlier, is more gradual. So when you look at the balance of the picture, that's why we see the pace of the gross margin changed a little bit, but we do see continued gross margin expansion. 
As far as MI300, we are quite confident, over the long term, it will be accretive to our corporate average. We feel pretty good about the overall Data Center business to continue to be absolutely the driver of gross margin expansion.",261,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5
