Our fourth quarter and full year numbers provided us with several financial records, including record sales profits, cash flow and system bookings.  I would like to take a moment to highlight some of these along with some other details and observations on the fourth quarter and on the full year.
Our fourth quarter sales came in above our guidance and set a record EUR1.5 billion.  Sales versus the third quarter grew in favor of NAND memory and foundry customers as they began to add further wafer capacity in these sectors.
The number of dry shipments, mostly KrF, represented well over 50% of the total.  As a result of this, the system mix new system ASP dropped slightly from around ERU24 million in the third quarter to around EUR22.4 million in the fourth quarter.
Our service and field option sales came in just over EUR200 million, driven in part by further adoption of several of our new holistic lithography products and continued demand for various other system performance, enhancement products and service products.
Q4 net bookings came in at a remarkably strong 117 systems valued at EUR2.3 billion.  Let me mention here a slight change in a definition of our book systems and backlog.  Over the course of the last several quarters we have been closing an increasing number of long-term contracts that involve not only the lithography systems but other sales-related items such as system options and certain services that will create sales after the tool ships.
Through the third quarter of 2010 we did not include these additional items in our systems bookings.  However, due to the growing size of these additional purchases and the growing importance of our holistic products and in order to better represent the future sales potential, we have started to do so in Q4 and will continue to do so in the future.
In reviewing the impact of this new bookings definition on the previous five quarters, we see a high-single digit percentage as a positive difference.
I'd like to refer to slide 15 of our Q4 results presentation to see where the strength on our Q4 bookings came from.  We see significant increased demand from NAND manufacturers, representing an increase of over 200% in booked value versus the third quarter.
Foundry customers showed even greater strength with a 300% increase in the booked value Q4 versus Q3.  Our IDM customers reduced their order values versus Q3 by approximately 50%.  But notably is also that the DRAM sector that reduced their orders versus Q3 by 40%, likely a reaction to a current supply demand imbalance in the DRAM devices.
Strength in NAND, foundry and IDM should be considered largely in support of new fab projects as identified on slide 18 of our fourth quarter presentation.  It's important to realize that customers often commit purchase orders for critical lithography systems for new and major fab projects as early as possible in order to ensure timely system deliveries against factory expansion plans.
Notably, for the first time in many years, total memory backlog, which is DRAM and NAND, represents less than 50% of our total backlog.  Our near-term demand outlook firmly indicates support for another strong year.
Our existing backlog plus our normal annual [server] sales and our expected bookings in Q1, while, of course, less than Q4, justifies the expectations of net sales above EUR5 billion in 2011.
As a quick final comment on cash, as reported, we are building a strong gross cash balance and expect to grow our cash balance further in the coming quarters.  Therefore, we announce the implementation of a share buyback program whereby we will purchase up to an equivalent of EUR1 billion of our own shares within a maximum period of 24 months.
In addition, and thanks to also our strong financial position and operating cash flows, we intend to propose to the AGM a doubling of the current dividend of EUR0.20 per share to EUR0.40 per share for 2010 and this dividend increase reflects our confidence in our prospects for a sustained, long-term profitability and growth.
With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Eric for more on our view of the coming year.

388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2011",2011-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,,108528.0,7355484.0,Presenter Speech,Eric Meurice,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Peter.  We look back on a year of sales growth and financial performance for ASML that confirms our earlier view that the semiconductor recovery cycle was, in fact, strong and sustained.
I think it's good to recognize that we had a good understanding of our drivers a year ago and that we managed to this expectation.
We now have a backlog of orders to be delivered in 2011, which, with the expected bookings to be received in Q1, justifies expectations of further revenue growth in 2011 versus 2010.  The fundamental question is whether these orders will remain if the end demand suddenly collapses or whether the current demand trend will continue into 2012.
It is fairly common in the history of semiconductors to see two to three years of an up cycle.  This time, we are encouraged by the following factors: first, the memory lithography capacity buildup in NAND and DRAM at this moment is fairly measured and the backlog that we have, that we showed you, does not yet support the analyst expected end product growth for 2011.  Namely, the analysts are expecting 59% bit growth for DRAM and 84% bit growth for NAND.
The second factor, which is positive for the future after 2011, is that the logic capacity buildup, which occurs currently at foundries, is certainly ahead of pure semiconductor market unit demand.  But as we noted in the past, it is needed in order to put strategic capacity in place for the new 40 nanometer nodes.
We estimate that the overall capacity built will sustain about 40% logic unit growth versus an expected 8% unit demand growth expected by analysts for 2011, so 14^ capacity built versus 8% demand growth.  So in a sense, if the analysts are correct, the foundries are building ahead of the need by some six to nine months, which is real but measurable.
The third positive aspect about the trend is that all semiconductor segments are accelerating the technology transition with all transition being more lithography intensive.  We mentioned two or three times about the numbers of lithography layers, in particular immersion.  Of course, this is continuing.
DRAM vendors are targeting one new node per year now like the NAND manufacturers from 18 months per year -- 18 months every generation, leading respectively to 30 nanometer and 20 nanometer RAMs in 2011.
Logic transitions to 40 nanometer in volume and 30 nanometer in prototyping and processors ramping 20 nanometer in 2011 and 2012.  So this is a third positive trend.
The fourth positive trend is that none of these favorable litho forecasts include assumptions of potential lower yield and process control difficulties that will likely accompany these technology transitions.  This has formed a potential upside for us if the industry takes a bit more time to reach the same level of field maturity and stability that they have been accustomed to with less aggressive technologies.
So these are all the positive trends that we see and all this capacity being built is also supported by a very rich, leading-edge technology content in the end products themselves.  The drive for affordability and power thriftiness device are certainly not awaiting.
But additionally, there isa  wide area of new internet connected device like the tablets, e-readers, the high-end smartphone connected TVs and also the solid state hard disk drive, which are biasing the demand for high volume, high-end, high-content semiconductor device.
Assuming the continuation of this technology trend into 2012, we will have to support another huge technology transition as the new technology nodes by then will require EUV development to start in earnest with significant investment in lithography capability only to support, not manufacturing, but only to support R&D development and qualification.
We will have shipped six NXE.3100, our second generation extreme EUV system, by the end of 2011 with revenue recognition earliest in 2012.  We have received, as you know, nine orders to date for our third generation EUV tool NXE.3300 and this system will start being delivered in 2012.
The  industry still requires a number of months, of course, to confirm the EUV performance, the plans and the roadmaps, but it is encouraging to think, to envision, this as another engine of growth for 2012 and beyond.
In addition and in parallel to all this, we are continuously expanding our product differentiation and immersion in particular with our continuously evolving NXT performance and the addition of Holistic Lithography suite of products.
We're also improving our KrF product lines with unique throughput and overlay performance, all this necessary for sustaining the new node specification and for maintaining our market share.
With all this, Peter and I would be very pleased to take your questions.

This is not going to happen immediately into 2011.  It will go well into 2012 ad even 2013.  But, of course, when we bring EUV back in, we are going to bring machines which goes towards 120 or 125 wafer per hour.

Many of those bookings were focused on fulfilling the needs of our customers, looking at their fab expansion requirements for 2011.
Now, clearly, we were surprised.  Hence, we gave the pre-warning on the orders early December.  But it also creates a situation where we think Q1 will just be a bookings quarter which will enable us to, let's say, fill up 2011 from a, let's say, shipment point of view.  The rest of the year we'll really be looking at order momentum, which will be focused on 2012.
I can hear you thinking of the next question, which we'll probably not allow because it will be question number three but I'll give you the answer anyway.  On 2012, really, the way that we look at it, we don't see any negatives for the year 2012.  We do see positives.  WE do see measured investments in NAND in 2011.
We definitely see Logic.  There's a lot of people think there's a lot of Logic budget there but the speed with which this Logic ramp-up will take place in 2011 will be measured also and will be largely towards the second half of 2011 and will extend into 2012.  That's number one.
Number two, as Eric talked about in his introduction, there is a technology trend that is continuing continuously which will drive the need for technology upgrades at our customers.  Last, but not least, that is also driven by EUV.  So in 2012 we will see the EUV introduction with very high price tools.  We'll be starting the new generation.
So in short, Q1 will see a finalization of our shipment pattern and our shipment expectation for the year 2011.  The rest of the year will be in the eye of 2012 and, like I said, we see a lot of positives.

Also, if you look at the spend pattern for the Foundries, don't forget that everything that is leading edge investments today and built out of any capacity, which is 65 nanometers, is only by a very, very few customers, only three.  So those customers are the Logic industry with the exception of the big microprocessor maker.
So in that sense, to look at that number in the context of what happened 10 years ago is a bit difficult and, at least, we are not looking at it in that way.

We only think that it will create, if you add 2010, 2011, just 14% capacity growth.
Remember that in this Logic business, when you go to a 40 nanometer or so you go towards the very large numbers of critical layers, so you need a lot of machine to do not so many wafers.  So this capital intensity in dollars doesn't mean that we create a lot of capacity.
So our calculation is indeed that this 14% unit growth is higher than what analysts talk about, 8%, but, as you know, difference between 14% and 8% is a six months or nine months digestion time, which in the environment where things have significant yield issues and timing capacity management difficulties, et cetera, is not abnormal.
So in other terms, yes, indeed, there is on paper an over investment but it is not material such at this moment and that it will be eaten up into 2012 by the ramp of these new products which will happen even if the volume of the total macro economy is not there, the mix will be there to pick them up.

We did EUR1.5 billion in sales in Q4.  There is about EUR50 million, EUR60 million in there on billable service, which was in the fourth quarter also bit of a surprise to us.  It was really customers making up their budget for that year, which included system refurbishments at customer sites, which we normally did here in Veldhoven.  Now we did it at the customer site.
Customers are trying to monetize some of their assets that they had.  They used to sell those tools to us and then we would refurbish and we would resell.  That's not what we do now.  So basically we do those refurbishments at their site and we can charge a nice and good price rate.
We had system relocations.  Customers are shifting around systems because they need to make place for their new leading edge tools and we had a lot of fast installs.  Customers want those tools to be working fast and they are willing to pay nice service sums to get those tools installed.  So we had, you could say, windfall sales of EUR50 million, EUR60 million in Q4.
On top of that, there are about EUR75 million worth of system sales that were actually a few evaluation tools that we shipped to customers in previous quarters that we agreed with them they could use for a few months or one or two quarters and then they would buy them and that happened in Q4.
So you could say that the shipment was, in fact, if you peel it all off, it was about EUR130 million worth of business, EUR125 million, EUR130 million worth of business.  It was a bit of a windfall business.  If you take that out then the guidance of EUR1.4 billion is not conservative.  It's actually, you could say, equal but even a bit up.

Positive milestone is that the customer themselves have been able to make an exposure that we've published at 27 nanometer.  Positive milestone is this exposure looks good.
There is a line roughness and the process parameters, in fact, looks very, very encouraging that the process issues or a lot of process issues are, in fact, going to be acceptable.  In fact, it's pretty good that immediately after the machine is delivered that they can even show such good line roughness capability and exposure.  So all this is good.
Next items is, we do have, indeed, five more of those machines and you can see them, touch them, et cetera.  All of them are being qualified at this very moment and they are reaching a level of overlay, which is now near the target spec and this is, again, difficult because this is in vacuum, so this is -- we've passed another test at the level of the machine.
So on the machine side, it now seems to be fairly much under control.  The negative part is we're still late in proving 60 wafer per hour.  At this moment we are nearer to 10 to 15 wafer per hour than we would be to 60.  This is not yet concerning level because the customers do not need 60 wafer per hour clearly to do R&D.  But it would be better if we were to prove as fast as possible that we could reach this.
So the positive news there is that there is now a much more detailed action plan to resolve every problem of the stage of a laser basically to get it to the power necessary.  So there are issues on the pre-laser -- sorry, not issues.  There are solutions on the pre-laser.  There is solution on the droplet performance and stability.  There are solutions about debris mitigations.  There are solutions about catching some of rays, which are -- how should I call this -- negative influence power rays.
So all this is well defined and there is work to be done.  So I would estimate that we could probably open a bottle of champagne in the Q3 timeframe, by which we would say this I now past the proving time and going into just executing time.

I have a different -- the point is I would say there are four conceptual things that have to be proven but everything else is very difficult, of course.  It's not easy to make the machine.
So making one machine is a complex task.  But it is a task that you can -- that are deterministic.  So all the deterministic tasks will take time and energy and cost.  The one which are less deterministic is -- what we've done here to improve, for instance, stability of droplet -- is it going to improve it by 50%, by 755 or by 40% only and these are things you have to prove.
So I would guess there is another six months of work on two or three things that have to be proven to know exactly where you are on the specification.

The second question is actually if you go back seven, eight years when your order book was quite foundry intensive and then it became more memory intensive in the latter part of -- in subsequent years but foundries had a propensity to cancel orders once their capacity utilization level fell much more so than IDMs or the memory companies did.
Today your foundry orders have gone up quite sharply.  Would you say that is such a risk as we come to the second half of the year when some of these tools are due for delivery and if something happens in the demand cycle and the utilization levels fall?
Would you say that there is a bigger risk that some of these orders may not materialize or is that more contained because of the competitive environment and the requirement for technology transition?

Clearly, at this moment, you've noticed that we have reached nearly our target of 5 billion sales which we set our selves for over five years ago or so and it is now time to set ourselves another target for the future 2015 and at this very moment we are still calculating exactly what that number could do because, again, we have now a success of meeting our target.  We'd like to do this again.
So in other terms, the way I say it is to say lithography is still our fundamental market and we still think there is growth to it.  I just will not be able to say it today whether it's 6 billion, 7 billion, 8 billion, nine billion or whatever.  But it is still the area of privilege for ASML because there is growth opportunity.
But it is in parallel.  We are always looking at potential expansion to a second leg which is a leg which will create growth opportunities and, yes, it has to be in the area that we are good at, which is equipment, precision, high R&D, long lead time, et cetera, and we have been on a regular basis looking at different options and we're continuing.  I think nothing has changed on this.
The acquisitions themselves will not be large in the sense that we don't think we can buy a company that exists today and we can easily create growth out of it.  But we think we can probably buy a smaller entity which has a leg in technology or a leg into an application that our size and expertise could multiply by a factor.  But, again, it's not a short-term item at this moment.  We're continuing to invest.
Regarding the Foundry behavior, well, every segment would cancel orders if they didn't have needs for the machines.  We all know that.  It's a fact of life.  So I would not say the Foundry's worse or better than others.  So if there is business, it will use it; if there is no business, it will ask us to delay deliveries and everybody will do it.
What has changed from seven years ago is that at the time the industry was more I need a fab and I will find a customer later or this is what year 2000 or year 2001 or 2002, they are years of people got crazy about there is no limit to applications and we just need the fabs.  We don't know where it is but we need the capacity.
I think this you don't see anywhere at all in this industry, so where we've got the point about Globalfoundries, TSMC and Samsung, Logic who are trying to set themselves as space in this business, so they have to have critical mass size.  But I would say the smallest possible critical mass so that they can have customer.
So that's what they do today.  None of them have come up and said we think the market is going to be triple what its historical trend is.  In fact, when I was able to articulate 14% growth versus 8%, it's also based on mix and it's, of course, based on technology and I know exactly each products, et cetera, in which technology and they are all based on the, I would say, historical ramp of new products.
You add to this my famous 14% versus 8% and this is the overspend.  So I didn't say that if there is a major catastrophe in the macroeconomic environment all those customers including DRAM and NAND would not come back to us and say you have a nice backlog.  We are contractually -- we have to keep it of course but could you please delay deliveries?
This will always happen, could happen, in any circumstances where the economy would push it.  But at this moment, again, I do not see significant over-investing compared to the end product needs.

There is a difference of probably your question, which is PO lead time, which is a sort of administrative decision about when you put legal requirements and when you want the machine, and then there is a lead time, which is a manufacturing lead time, how much time does it really take to make machines.
With the new machines, like NXT, we are getting into a lead time of assembly and test which is more in the three months timeframe as we go now.  So we are getting our manufacturing systems under control with this type of activity on the assumption, of course, that you have all the spare parts available so that you can assemble the machine.
So if you are smart and you have been able to accumulate enough spare parts you can do three months of manufacturing lead time.  PO lead time absolutely depends on the structure of the company.
You have some very large IDMs who know so much about their business and control it very well that they would put a PO lead time of nine months and they will continue -- even nine months to a year --  and it will continue like clockwork and you have PO lead times more in the memory of this nice particular DRAM where the PO lead time could be less than a month.

We suppose that our competitor will be able to place certain numbers of immersion machine to certain numbers of customers, I would say, which would make it a natural place to be.  So we assume that the EUR5 billion includes this possibility.  So it's a share loss compared to 2010.
In terms of volume and ASP, at this moment, the EUR5 billion is based on higher ASP than 2010 because in 2010 there was, in Foundry, a certain number of 65 nanometer capacity built, which required less expensive machinery.
We shipped this mainly in Q2 and Q3 2010.  This is not planned in 2011 at this moment.  So, therefore, you are going to -- at this moment, the plan for the EUR5 billion is higher immersion mix than in 2010.
In addition, the NXT will represent a higher share of the immersion.  As you know, NXT was above 50% in Q4 but used to be 20% of immersion in Q2 and Q3 and lower.  I think it will be more like 70%-ish in 2011.

In the foundry world at this moment there is an over investment, probably to your point because most of these players are trying to go after the same account but the amount of overspend is only make the difference between 14% capacity growth to an 8% capacity growth.  So, in other terms, 14% minus 8% equals 6%.  6% is this capacity which is double counted or whatever actually that is for quoting our customers.
So two things can happen.  One, they all succeed and the industry may have to live with 6% too much capacity.  So you start hearing this [on the wall] that is that the customers themselves are so keen in having multiple sources for reasons of technology and for reasons of price that they may have to sustain two partners and this may make the two partners less efficient than they used to be and you could discuss with those people whether that means they will have less profitability or the prices will be higher because at the end it's a higher service.
This could happen and it could be that, in fact, the industry goes towards a less efficient model in using capacity and that less efficient model will allow them, in fact, to manage peaks, which today they don't.
In the newspaper you see TSMC at this moment is at capacity on critical nodes and I think it is public in the newspapers that some of their customers are looking for other areas to have their chips made and this is a bit of a scramble at this moment, which I am sure the industry of foundry will have to address.  So this famous 6% of spend may, in fact, be here to stay as a new feature.
To your next question, last question, is are we going to be impacted if one of the key players have a higher market share than the other or succeed more than the other.  No, I repeat, we are going to make machines for the square meters of silicon by the end products and by the NVIDIAs, by the TIs, by the STs, so we're not fundamentally impacted by who wins.

The first one was, you alluded to pretty strong orders already from one of your larger microprocessor makers already early in 2010.  So I was just wondering were you implying that most of the CapEx raise for 2011 was essentially reflected in your order book in 2010?  That would be my first question.
Then my second was on EUV, also just a clarification.  I think you also mentioned the quite different throughput rates in terms of wafers power for EUV, which will be even at target 60 is probably materially below the current 150 to 200 range of most fab lines.  So I'm just wondering.  Does that mean that EUV will really only be deployed in brand new fab extensions or lines or can they actually be used with the existing installed capacity?

It's their data, so I will not say anything on that.  Regarding the EUV, now, don't misunderstand me.  The generation two, which is used for R&D, is targeted for 60 wafer per hour.  Generation number three, which is the 3300, which is the targeted for production, is targeted at 125 wafer per hour, which is still lower than the 150, which is the current standard of immersion.
But it is irrelevant.  The question is that in the buildup of a new chip -- and I'm going to take, how we guess an obvious example -- in the 2, low 2X DRAM, you will need a certain number of EUV layers, probably four, five.
These layers will be done by EUV because they probably -- the customer my not cost effectively -- the customer may not achieve the criticality of the designs.  So no matter what the cost or the speed is of EUV, they may be forced to make a 20 nanometer DRAM using an EUV machine, no matter what the speed is, the throughput.
Then the next layers, layer six, seven, eight, nine, 10, et cetera, will be done by immersion and next layer by KrF and probably some layers by i-Line and that's [natural].  So that's how it would work.
However, on some other segments, we need to take an example of NAND.  IN the NAND, say sub 20 nanometer, if EUV is cheap, meaning if EUV is at 125 wafer per hour, then they will all run into it and say this is good stuff and they will put probably four layers on EUV.
If EUV doesn't run at 125 but runs at lower than 60, they probably will not use EUV in NAND for the (1XI) and it will go on EUV on probably 1X like 15 nanometer or under. So, in other terms, there are some areas of the world which is cost effectively impacted by EUV.  EUV gets in when it's cost effective.
Then in some parts of the world, some layers, where you have no choice.  So in order to know how big EUV will be, we have to be sure that we achieve 125.  If we achieve 125 per wafer, it's going to be enormous.
If we achieve 120, it's going to be also enormous.  But if we achieve 60 it would be smaller.  But 60 is still okay.  So we're going to have to manage the introduction of this technology in different years and catch the different layers in this one.

Clearly you've seen very strong orders in the fourth quarter but outside the official order book I'm just wondering what level of visibility some of your key customers are giving you and perhaps what that means for lead times, in particular, given that you have been capacity constrained for the last few quarters and we've seen bookings well ahead of shipments.
Are some of these key customers coming to you even earlier than before in terms of providing visibility through 2011 and maybe even beyond that?

We expect some more bookings in Q1 but basically EUR5 billion is clearly identified and virtually booked.
So you can -- if you are cynical you'll say, well, that means we are worried about you and they put some orders and they plan to cancel or push out in case because these are all machines which you need to reserve.  But, fortunately for us, that's not the case for multiple reasons.
The first reason is that I think we hinted this at the beginning and Peter hinted it also.  The NAND and DRAM business, which usually would do this with reserve and then to be sure and, in fact, we, at this moment, know that they are under booking.  They are under booking compared to what analysts expect them to deliver in terms of RAMs, DRAMs and Flash.
So if we expect something is not a cancellation or a push out of these machines, it's more the opposite just because they need the machines to do the chips.
On the Logic side, we expect -- we told you that it was more of a building up of a fab with critical mass, so normally a line, a typical line in the logic arena should have eight immersion tool or -- I don't remember -- it depends on the technology, so immersion eight tool.
They will not go for six because it's not a critical mass; it's not efficient.  So they will go for a limited critical mass and all this is well understood by our engineers and being installed.
The third piece of data that I think is important to know is, at this moment, all of our customers are negotiating specifications and slotting priorities per quarter.  So it is a normal thing we do and it means you have an order and you say we're going to ship in July.  Do you need this machine or that machine; do you need this in first week or the second week or the third week; when do you have the pedestal prepared; when is the truck coming; what sort of plane we put it in?
All of this is being discussed with the blood and sweat in a very normal way where you can imagine that this is not the purchasing guy discussing; it's a production guy building up his logistics to it.
So we're talking about real activities.  We're not talking about paper work.  So for this reason we have the highest visibility, I think, ever that this company has ever had.

As Eric mentioned, I would like to take a moment to have some observations on the events of last quarter and we'll share also some details on the Q1 results.
The first quarter sales as you will have read came in at €1.45 billion, which was just above our guidance and sales continue to be driven by Foundry and IDM customers, as they continue to add further wafer capacity at the leading edge. The number of dry systems, which were mostly KrF, again represented well over 50% of the total number of systems shipped. NXT shipments increased to almost 70% of our total immersion system sold, and our service and field option sales came in close to €170 million. The net income for the first quarter was €395 million or 27.2% of sales.
The net bookings for the first quarter came in at 40 systems valued at €845 million. These included advanced immersion systems for critical levels as well as additional KrF systems for less critical layers, and those were mainly ordered by Foundry customers for capacity additions. The total average selling price of the Q1 bookings was €21.1 million.
Looking from where the strength came in the first quarter bookings, the demand from NAND manufacturers represented almost half of the booked value 46%, followed by DRAM 23%, and Foundry 26%. Our order backlog existing the first quarter was €3.3 billion and included 134 systems with an average selling price of close to €25 million.
For the second quarter of 2011, we expect net sales to be about €1.5 billion, with a gross margin for the second quarter expected to be about 45%, R&D expenses at €150 million, which is an increase, giving a growing focus of second generation EUV systems deliveries and third generation EUV system development. SG&A is guided at €55 million. Our near-term outlook, firmly indicate support for another strong year. We expect bookings in Q2 between €900 million and €1 billion, justifying again our expectation of net sales in 2011 clearly above €5 billion.
As part of the share buyback program announced last quarter, ASML has purchased 4.6 million shares for a total consideration of €142 million, which includes purchases up to and including March 27th. ASML intends to cancel the repurchased shares and at the end of the first quarter we maintained just close to €2.7 billion in cash.
With that short summary, I would like to turn it back to Eric for more on our view of the coming year. Eric?

So when we convened here three months ago, we were able to confirm that this semiconductor recovery cycle was strong and sustained. Our backlog had grown to €3.8 billion a very, very large number and the business drivers justified our expectation for revenue growths well about €5 billion in 2011.
Today the business sentiment is challenged by increasing oil prices, global conflicts, sovereign debt issues, rising interest rates. The Japanese disaster also adds up to uncertainty, although direct impact to the electronic industry worldwide appears limited at this point. The uncertainty is causing some of our customers to review the existing equipment delivery and order plans.
However, none of this requires us to adjust our revenue expectations for 2011, which is still clearly, clearly above €5 billion. These limited adjustments that we have seen are in fact only affecting litho system demand, which was potential upside. And in any event, which was above the analyst revenue consensus for us.
As said last quarter, the reason for the demand for lithography system to be so robust is that it is both, one, critical layer growth-driven, and two, a strategic capacity addition driven. On one hand, the NAND and DRAM memory lithography capacity built-up plans have been measured so far. And the backlog and plan bookings appear not to threaten oversupply to analyst expectation for 2011, as manufacturers drive aggressively for node transition, but not so much for wafer start growth.
On the other hand, the Logic and the Processor capacity built-up is still driven by a hugely growing number of critical lithography layers from zero up to 18 critical layers per chip and by an overall process complexity. It is also driven by the customer business need to put minimum as we call it critical mass of strategic capacity in place for the 40 nanometer and the 30 nanometer nodes and to offer this capacity level to their end-customers long time before they have to ramp.
So beyond 2011, we are preparing the industry's next significant imaging technology EUV, in which we lead a vigorous development effort as you know, and we are making significant progress. As of today, we have delivered three EUV pilot production system, the NXE:3100, which are now demonstrating imaging an overlay results, that meet the device production specifications requirement. And additional three systems are still to be delivered within a few months and the qualifications of these systems are currently underway.
Point two, the aggressive customer process development effort are accelerating on our other tools and have begun on the 3100 tools we just shipped. The general EUV infrastructure, including mask writing, mask inspection, mask cleaning, photoresist etcetera, is now effectively transitioning into a phase of optimization.
Point number three, the energy source is still the gageing factor. We are making progress, as we have identified the issues and have a roadmap to reach the planned 100 watt corresponding to about 60 wafer per hour by the end of this year.
And point number four, we are starting the industry (utilization) phase at this time, with the completion of our new factory planned for this year and with the production start of the new machine, the NXE:3300, our new next generation tool for which we have now ten commitments.
Revenues for the NXE:3100 shipped this year, we'll be recognizing 2012 at the same time we begin to ship the 3300. And often of this tool will provide ASML another engine of growth for 2012 and beyond. So in summary, we are very confident that our leadership position in leading edge is again enabling us to reach our business objective for 2011, as we articulated at the beginning of the year.
With that, Peter and I would be pleased to take your questions.

All of us, ourselves of course, our suppliers and our costumers have looked into the potential first level impact of Japan, and there is no real second level of impact, which is the next supply level. Again they don't see much et cetera, et cetera. So most of the reaction at this moment is feeling a reaction that in view of such dramatic situation, ""has to have a cooling effect of some sort."" It's more of a feeling a sentiment that it is anything quantitative.
My analysis, and this is a personal opinion, is in fact it allows most of our customers to digest, to think. So we are more in a thinking mode than in a very obvious reaction to a known problem. This is why, what we've seen is in fact very limited and if it were to even be a bit bigger than what we've seen, we are still prepared, because we have enough buffer demand in front of us to cover for any even potential more negative news. So this is why we are still bullish with the same numbers as we had three months ago, which is we will be well above the €5 billion target that we issued then. So macroeconomic-wise it's just a sentiment, no specific.
On the competitive side, indeed we think that our NXT is doing very well. That slowly, but truly the customers is now going from one version of the NXT to a second version with better performance in overlay and in throughput, which then potentially put our competition in more difficulties to catch up if and when the product would be qualified. So yes, at this moment, we are still managing the company to a large market share and we see this has sustained as we go.

Whereby, the way that we do this is that at the day of the conference call we give an assignment or an order to a bank that will help us to buyback a certain number of shares and we give them a euro number for this quarter. That's what we have done today and we're not going to disclose that in a number. But clearly that number will be a reflection of how we see the market and what we feel.
So during this quarter, the bank is going to execute what we tell them today and that's what they did last quarter. And actually last quarter what you will then see is that throughout the quarter we are buying back at the average price of the shares during that particular quarter. But any additional disclosure about the size of what we have instructed the bank today we are not going to give, but clearly we are looking at the current situation wisely.

The Foundries have decided as we can take examples like, Global Foundries when they decide to make a new fab in New York, do not have a quarterly type approach to taking decisions and putting orders to us. So you will have some quarter, which were larger, when there is a phase of development.

We have an agreement with the Dutch tax inspector under the new legislation, which benefits innovative companies and companies that are highly R&D intensive, and that is for the next four years. So clearly, the level at which we can attribute income that is related to R&D spending to let it be the taxable income, in alliance we have to make a separation between income that can be derived from.
You could take patterns and the other way income, that particular division that is up for a discussion annually. But that has a marginal difference on the overall tax rates. So the tax rate would be anywhere between 12% and 14% over the next couple of years, because of this agreement and this legislation that we expect to stay in place.
So depending, it already is 12%, it will be lower when we are at the high ends of our quarterly sales range, it will be at the 14% level where we are at the more low-end of the sales level. So higher the sales level the lower the tax rate that's basically how it works. But if you stay within the 12% to 14% benefit for the next couple of years, that will be good.

When you are in DRAM, you do not know how to do sub a 20 nanometer without EUV. So those guys, even if we delay day-by-day, knowing that they have no alternative technical alternative we would in fact delay the node if we continue delaying machine. So these ones would be, I would say, not having choices.
In the NAND arena, they do have choices. They can develop complicated triple or quadruple patterning NAND up to 15 nanometer, after 15 nanometer they will be in the situation of DRAM where they have no choice. However they would gladly go to EUV, if EUV is cheaper. So NAND is for us to win. If you quote the price and you give the machine with a right throughput, which hit the right level of cost, then they go. If you don't, then they wait. So NAND is in that sense, what you call, is progressive.
Logic is in between; it's between DRAM and NAND. On one hand, Logic would absolutely need EUV on some layers like DRAM does; but on the other hand, you can design in Logic less aggressive layers which makes your chip bigger and not as good in power consumption. But you can go around it, which is what you hear some players saying, well, if push comes to shove, they can go beyond 15 nanometer node. What they really mean by this is, they can compromise the performance lower if EUV is not available. 
So NAND is economics; Logic is performance; DRAM is, you've no choice. So at this moment we are delaying without delaying, and we are, as you see, delivering our machines as we plan to ship them. But we haven't yet proven the performance that the machine will run at.
We were planning to prove that performance in Q4 timeframe, I think we made it clear. Now we still have more work to do to prove that performance. And as I said, proving the performance is important, because then you will determine which node you take. And then your customer will align to that node.
So we are in this situation where customers are developing the nodes anyway, but there is a bit of uncertainty as to exactly how many layers we are going to catch and when.

And a second question if I may is, on your Q2 order visibility, your backlog right now is quite heavily memory intense; quite a lot of both DRAM and NAND is in the backlog.

We will recognize bookings and the billings probably (vary) at the same time in 2012 as a way to have all the data with us when we do that. Because again, we will recognize revenue only when we are sure the machine has real performance. So we will wait until the last moment where we recognize bookings and billings.
But the target is probably to ship. And this is why we have I would say, when I say ""wonder month"" in 2012, starting in June or so, 2012, we could, on paper ship 6 or 7. I think we have going to see our target of 10 in 2012. This is pretty hard to do, but we owe that to the customers; in fact all the customers wanted us to do so. So we are going to try to do the full 10 in 2012.
Regarding the orders for Q2, as I said before, the bookings at this moment and the bookings in Q2 will probably not give any information on 2012. I mean, I would be highly surprised if there would be appetite for any of our customers to already call some capacity in Q1 2012.
We don't see this; it would be not natural. So therefore, the whole Q2 bookings, and we have given a range of €900 to €1 billion would be for shipment in 2011.

Just trying to get a sense as to what your own assumptions are based on. I know you have your own very specific modeling as it relates to the memory industry and so on. But any color as to what your assumption is for overall wafer fab equipment? Would be very helpful.

So in DRAM they would not have enough capacity to do 55%, bit gross; just be sure I said the right thing. So they would not be able to do the 57 from Gartner. At this moment our forecast, which is well above five, would not guarantee 57; it would be guaranteeing under 50.
For Flash it would not guarantee the Gartner 83% NAND; it will guarantee nearer to 70, 75. But the logic will be higher than the poor Gartner unit growth expectation, which I think is 70%. So in the logic arena, we would expect to build more than 7, but as we said 7% unit growth equivalent. But as we said, this is natural because their new fabs strategically have to be ready before they can garner some new customers.
So in other terms, it is very clear that TSMC, Samsung logic, Global Foundries and now UMC is in and SMIC is starting building up capacity to try to attack certain numbers of similar businesses. And as we said before, there will be duplication in this business. This is not to say that there is overheating, but there is duplication in this business because there is more competition.

I know it's kind of theoretical, but can you give us some kind of quantitative numbers in terms of how the Litho capital intensity is going to change? And I have a follow up.

CapEx intensity for us is a dangerous thing in particular that we can't really correlate to the past, because the past doesn't make any more sense. But the two or three numbers we kind of follow, because in the foundry environment the possibility of being a total CapEx intensity is 50% of the total revenue of foundry, is not a ridiculous number.
And then on the 50%, we own, of this, 20% to 25%. So you could say that the term spend to 15% of the revenue of Foundry could be given to lithography. And if you block those numbers into what Global Foundries and TSMC and SMIC and UMC and Samsung Logic would tell you, they are expecting sales in 2012, 2013 and 2014. These are good numbers; in fact these are higher numbers than what we already ended.
In the memory business, we usually in fact do not talk about capital intensity because it's so widely dependent on the ASP of the memory chip. Sometimes you have a chip that goes down in price by 70% in a year. So the capital intensity basically doubles, and therefore we can't follow that one. So we really follow mostly our own model per unit and per bit for more (inaudible). Sorry if I did not answer your question.

I think, historically, ten years ago was around 12%. We are currently now between 18% and 20%. And giving the trends that we are seeing, and also like to refer to Slide 17 and Slide 18 of Q1 that is on the website where we basically show the number of Litho (immersionally) as that is going up, which is just a function of the complexity that our customers are trying to deal with.
If you add also the introduction of EUV in 2013 and beyond, it is clear that the long term secular litho diffusion rate will go up. And that will be clearly above 20%. And when it's going to be 24%, 25%, 26%, we'll just have to see. But it's very difficult to make this particular comment from one year to the other. We just look at the minimum long term trend, and that clearly shows that Litho CapEx, in intensity will go up.

If I take your Q4 bookings and your Q1 bookings, you are probably running close to say €1.5 billion run-rate in bookings.

Remember that if you do also calculation you see the current bookings are €3.3 billion. Is a very large number as to justify a run-rate of €5.5 billion sales. If you look at our historical backlog to billings, sometimes you could multiply by two. So €3.3 would be a run rate of €6.6 yearly billings. This is high; this is on the high side of the equation at this moment.
So you could expect a natural reduction of that backlog to the normal level, and then a pick-up to $1.5 per quarter is pretty natural. So yes, definitively, we should expect this.
Now what we don't know is, would it happen in a continuous fashion; would it happen a bit bigger on one quarter and not on the other; or, would the customer remain at the historically high backlog, because we are now so strategic for them and the products are so strategic that we maybe now in situations where we manage a higher backlog than we ever did before.
So, sorry, at this moment we can't really gage this. And I don't think any analyst would not try to read anything again in this backlog trend; they do not really correspond to a business trend; they correspond to another way of doing business with us.

Now, on the 3100, that revenue recognition will take place on final acceptance. On the 3300, we have agreements with our customers that the minimum requirement that the 3300 has to fulfill are of such nature that we believe that we can have revenue recognition upon shipment because those are really minimum requirements that we have set as minimum for the 3100s, which we think we will definitely achieve when we ship the 3300. And even (it's) 125 wafers per hour, we have an agreement with the customers that they will take the full risks and rewards of ownership at that moment in time.

First is, there is a chance that we have three suppliers with three different ways of doing some things. So there is just risk of the total industry. And as I said before, EUV is so important to this industry, they need it, everybody needs it, that it is the duty of the industry to have multiple ways of trying to find solutions.
And we are part of it. Of course it costs us more money because we support all the compatibility and its not a small amount of money. But we need to do this to reduce the risk of our customers. All of them are within their, I would say original roadmap plus one year. So they are all guilty of the same crime, all for a delay of about the same amount of time. But for a while now they have been stabilizing a roadmap of improvement with Cymer, Ushio and Gigaphoton showing us to their own speed certain numbers of progress.

So the financial impact for a new product - EUV is one of them, and of course it's a big one, is always negative in the first two years. So the margin is not going to be as good because the way we price the machine is, we price a machine at the target price.
So at the beginning, the machine has a warranty impact. And also on our side has a multiple obsolescence in terms of parts, where we improve parts, so we cannot use what we had planned before etcetera, etcetera. So the first two years is bad news. But of course the next years we enjoy what we have been enjoying now for a while, which is leadership in high technology, and therefore we will be more happy financial wise if we stayed in the commodity business.
So we do this because it's necessary for the industry. But we also do this because it is going to be in due point a profitable business of course.

But you would have to think of new systems that we ship with gross margins in the mid to the high 20s. And that in a three-year period, generally we have a three-year learning curve that brings us to the corporate gross margin.
Now, luckily, at the introduction of a new tool, as a lot of those tools is going to be (a few) tools, and the bulk of our shipments will of course be our bread and butter product that we know how to make and where we are constantly looking at improving the gross margins on it.
So really, if you want a number, think about this. Although we are still a year-and-a-half away from the first shipment, so still a lot can be done to focus on this gross margin issue. But like I said, there's not going to be a lot of tools in the first 12 to 18 months, and that gives us an ample opportunity to start working on the gross margin.

In fact, a very large part of the improvement of throughput between 60 and 100 is really within our own responsibility, it's not even a laser boost. So this, for instance, we will do pretty easily.
For instance, imagine that we get the laser people to stabilize a number in three months; then we can still do 2012 easily. But if we don't, then we are going to have some delays. So again, at this moment I would still keep the target of ten in 2012.

As Eric mentioned, I would like to take a moment to share observations on the events of the last quarter as well as some details on the second quarter results. The second quarter sales came in at a record of over EUR1.5 billion.
Second quarter sales were driven firstly by NAND customers followed by Foundry and then DRAM as all our customers continue to add wafer capacity at leading edge as indicated by the almost equal number of unit shipments of KrF systems and ArF immersion systems. I might also highlight that we now have shipped more than 80 TWINSCAN NXT immersion systems.
The average selling price of all those systems here in the second quarter was EUR22.7 million and that was roughly the same as those in, of the first quarter. Service and field option sales came in at close to EUR200 million, EUR196 million to be precise, which is around 60% higher than the previous quarter Q1. Our second quarter net income sets a record of EUR432 million, which is 28% of net sales, which also creates a record EPS of over one euro for the quarter.
As an update on our previously announced share buyback program, as of June 26 of this year ASML has repurchased 13.2 million shares. As we said before ASML intends to cancel these repurchased shares. At the end of second quarter, we still had EUR2.7 billion in cash. The second quarter net bookings, excluding EUV, came in at 34 systems, and they were valued at EUR840 million, which is roughly equivalent to what we ordered, what we received as orders in the previous quarter, but this was a couple of system short of our guided range. Booked ASPs rose significantly however from EUR21.1 million in Q1 to EUR24.7 million in Q2 and this was due to a product mix shift towards the higher ASP immersion tools and that included more options.
Booking strength clearly came from the logic sector, 50% from foundries and followed by IDMs at 31%. So memory sector bookings in Q2 were less than 20% of the total. With NAND bookings accounted for more than 75% of those memory bookings.
Our order backlog exiting the second quarter was healthy EUR2.76 billion, which did not - which does not include EUV, totals about 105 systems with an average selling price of EUR26.2 million, which by the way, is almost exactly the same backlog we had 12 months ago. For the third quarter of 2011, we expect net sales to be around EUR1.4 billion, which includes two NXE:3100 EUV systems and this represents our first revenue recognition on EUV of about EUR80 million. These systems will be recorded with zero profit margin. All other sales will be about 44% gross margin such that the combined margin on total net sales in Q3 will be about 42%.
R&D expenses are expected at EUR150 million, which shows the continued support we give to our strategic investments in the third generation EUV system development and SG&A will be at EUR56 million in the third quarter.
Now for the near term outlook, given a growing uncertainty in the near term device end amount, our outlook for the third quarter orders is at the level likely not to exceed EUR500 million. This indicates a significant customer hesitance to commit already today to any significant capacity planning for 2012.
We think this pause by our customers is logical given that we are coming off a two year period during which we witnessed a gradual increase in the litho systems deliveries where significant feature shrinks have continued and capacity has been added. The growing uncertainty in end amount now prompts an ordering pause. It is not atypical that pauses like this occur under such conditions and this could last several quarters before a reinitiation of wafer capacity buys will take place.
However in the meantime all buying sectors clearly indicate that they will continue with their aggressive shrink roadmaps for new product development and lowering their manufacturing costs. And with that I would like to turn over back to Eric for more on our view of the coming year.

Let’s put some business perspective into this current market situation. As we already guided, we are enjoying in the second year of an up cycle, basically, in 2011. This up cycle is strong. It has brought us to record sales level. We grew to EUR4.5 billion of sales in 2010 and we, as we’ve guided, expect to grow to clearly above EUR5 billion in 2011.
Moreover, this up cycle was, in fact, relatively easy to call. If you remember, we were able to guide very much ahead of it, as the engine, the engines of growth behind it is - was rich semiconductor content of products like smartphones, PCs, servers and tablets. So the question today is whether these favorable trends of end products is - will impact 2012 and if 2012 will be continuation of this trend, stable euro, down year, the key question.
Recent uncertainty I would call it microeconomic uncertainty about smartphones, PCs, tablet demands are eroding our short term customer confidence in general. The growth run rates of these key segments are being readjusted down due to inventory corrections, PC, tablet cannibalization, tablet growth rate maturing etc., etc. It is therefore natural that our customers are taking time at this moment to assess whether this end demand product trends for 2012 before they clarify their overall lithography capacity plan.
A number of positive news regarding renewed interest in PCs like the super slim PCs or the tablet with keyboards, high server growth for clouds due to our consumption and transaction speed, accelerated solid state drive conversions are not materializing yet in clear demand numbers at this point as no customers are issuing solid forecast for 2012. We expect this uncertainty to last until Q4 at least, thus our views that bookings in Q3 will not likely exceed EUR500 million.
In the lithography arena, however, we remain fairly confident in the future as we will have - still have to support a significant unfinished production ramp on the new products like the 3x-nanometer DRAM, the 2x-nanometer NAND and the 2x-nanometer logic technologies. And we, in addition to these production ramps, we will have to support a fairly aggressive and extremely litho intensive R&D effort for those next generation node sub 20-nanometers which will start well into 2012.
In the past we have suggested that this growth was sustained, will be sustained by the numbers of critical layers, mainly immersion layers, which are in fact booming. This is also true today. We confirm this trend with average numbers of layers due to double or triple due to the double and triple patterning technology to grow by an estimated 20% across all applications in 2012 versus 2011.
In addition, these processes, which are very complex processes of the future, will likely see lower yields and lower utilization than the current nodes which are easier to manufacture. These will create a sustained demand pressure for new lithography systems with an extreme overlay specification that is higher ASP whether for immersion tools themselves of course but also for ArF dry and even KrF dry.
The introduction and the delivery of the first NXE the EUV machine NXE:3300 production tools for 2012 are necessary for the process recipe development of the future, will further strengthen the lithography demand due in 2012. Regarding this EUV development itself, we are showing some progress. As of today we have shipped five EUV pre-production tools called the NXE:3100 system with three of the five already running wafers at their customers.
One final system, six in total, is to be delivered within a short period of time. The energy source or the light source remains in fact the gating side factor for throughput of these units. We are making progress because we have identified key issues and have now a strong roadmap for continuous improvement to reach the planned power which will correspond to about 60 wafers per hour on these machines.
We are in parallel continuing the industrialization phase with the completion of our new factory planned by the end of the year. So in summary, we are, like the whole industry, confirming that there is a customer pause at this moment while they read 2012’s end product trend. However during this pause we are still fairly confident that the leading edge lithography intensity, technical intensity required for the next step productions will serve as a key driver for the next year is somewhat adding potential microeconomic lull in the semiconductor end markets or if in fact these end markets prove to be sustained with new products in 2012, these technology difficulties will enhance the growth potential of ASML.
So with this perspective, Peter and I would be very pleased to take your questions.

So, the normal digestion of the situation will take at least three to four months or so, so you could, you do not expect - we do not expect a crisis situation to pop up in during the summer by which they would commence heavy orders and books would be pushed out because we know something new.
No, what we expect is the foundries, or even everybody, to say we now need to build up the capacity for 5% growth, 12% growth, 10%, 6% or whatever of the different product and therefore, we will adapt our bookings forward to some numbers, so at this moment a pause, definitively; a crisis, not at all.

What’s the run rate level of just, say, technology spend?

So, the - if you remember at the time we said to you, we think a run rate of about EUR500 million of sales, which would correspond therefore to bookings, would sustain this technology transition.
But as I said in my little script, you - we expect those technology nodes to be worse than before which would probably translate into a very bare minimum need for machine at 750 or so. Actually, so please I do not guide for 750 and I don’t see this at all because we see a volume anyway but the good news is technology intensity for just R&D is huge. And I can even add one more comment to this is that, you’ve got in fact two problems one is the numbers of layers are so complicated, the process control is so complicated that they need more time to do R&D and they need more tools to get to the yield that they want.
And then secondly you have EUV coming in, which doubles the R&D to a - on a certain number of layers for longer time. In other terms, UV is - requires recipe, recipe requires new registry, requires new mask, requires inspection and this creates 2 to 3 years of hard R&D which usually would have been done in 1.5 years, so now you have 2 more years to go. So we with all this confirms that the technology content of our demand for 2012 will probably be very much.

So regarding the very short term DRAM situation, yes you’ve seen the backlog today represent 20% DRAM only in units, so that’s fairly small. And we expect this to continue bad. We think DRAM is the weaker segment at this moment with the potential going up next year because DRAM, although today is impacting first, I mean first because of the PC reduction, at this moment DRAM players are working harder to get into the tablet and portables, there are much more DRAM now activity for these DRAMs with less power consumption.
There is also activities to work out the - I’d say new DRAM JEDEC specs to make them more akin to a scratch pad into all these, I’d say, new platforms. So there is going to be a pick-up of DRAM sometime in 2012, so but not in the next six months at all, where the business will be driven by NAND, by IDM and foundry.
Regarding EUV, I would, what can I say? I could say to you that - I would say the following: in the node, depending on the customer, between node called 20-nanometer or the node called 14-nanometer which is the industry type discussion item, you could see up to 15 layers of EUV, which is enormous, but if you don’t do EUV, if we’re late on one of those, the 15 layers of the EUV would translate in 30 to 40 layers of immersion.
So, there is even a higher factor than two. So indeed if EUV is delayed, this will require on some node, by our customer, an inflation of immersion layers.

So I will let Peter talk. I think the beginning of your question was cut, so I could not hear fully but if you say where are we in immersion with the competition; we have, at this moment, in fact, still progressing the NXT with current high end machine every year with a set of options, which get it to the next level.
So at this moment our competition started in the business a bit later than we have, have not yet, if I understand correctly, qualified in any significant numbers of layers, but the next generation layers are even more complicated. We’re adding overlay throughput and CD performance improvement to them.
The customers are starting to see extreme difficulty to process control. So their appetite to take risk on another architecture, which may not even be cheaper than ours, just for the sake of diversification, does not make business sense. So you do not diversify, when you do not get value. At best our competition could match us. But we’re installed base with so much R&D process, R&D invested by our customer that we probably are in a secured situation at this moment.

And regarding the light source the status, so clearly we recognize that we made a business error with our suppliers Ushio, Gigaphoton and Cymer in misunderstanding the level of complexity behind those sources. So most of our suppliers were not investing or didn’t have the size, basically, to address all the difficulties in parallel.
This was discovered at the end of last year and since the end of last year we have increased our cooperation with all of them, putting our own people into the different sub-projects, adding more sub-projects, parallelizing the different issues and therefore augmenting, I would say, the knowledge of each of those sub-issues and making all those sub-issues basically run in parallel with multiple trial and error opportunities.
So now we feel much stronger in understanding exactly how to do things and when to do things. Thus the more comfort level that we have on the roadmap to getting to our 60 wafer per hour which corresponds to about 100 watt. I would like to illustrate it by the fact that there are four major developments at this moment on the sources and four paths have each an improvement from today and if you add the four you will even get yourself above 100 watts.
So we are fairly comfortable to get there and we really feel concern or know that we made the mistake of underestimated the complexity of the deal and the fact that we needed to have more people invested into it.

The 40% growth, 40%, 45% growth of bit in DRAM really correspond to about 0% growth in wafers and mainly grows due to the technology transition. If you remember, customers has converted from 55 type nanometer to 35 type nanometer where they had two transitions in one. So, the creation of bit has been enormous without having to have wafers. So, these are the two numbers we believe are reasonably conservative.
Regarding EUV at the current run rate, so yes indeed, we have a single digit type run rate in the field. We have proven in the lab more than that, obviously, and the lab is always ahead to - from the field by about three months, so we are a bit better than what you suggest in the lab.
We have, as I said, taken over much more responsibility on the management, the introduction of experts and, project management per say, of each of our suppliers. So we see no reason at this moment, to go further than that. We think we have enough control of the situation by having enough of our people in the different place.

Thanks. Just wanted to tie up a few questions on the model and how you are running the factory. I think you were saying that 750 is sort of the minimum order level that you think the industry needs to do from a technology perspective. Just wanted to clarify if that includes EUV or not?
And secondly, if we get this low order level for a few quarters like you said, the first half of next year we could be looking ahead of revenue run rate of - call it maybe - EUR900 million plus or minus. The manufacturing capacity, I recollect you were talking about ramping it closer to EUR2 billion in Q4. So I was wondering if you were thinking about ratcheting down some of the fixed costs or manufacturing capacity as you plan for early part of next year.

I said, I was asked what would be the technical minimum billings number to make technology transitions and we said 750. I never said the bookings number. As I said, bookings can be EUR0 to EUR1.5 billion because one quarter they will buy it and two quarters they would not, and so, no.
Second point, I didn’t say that 2012 would be 750 per quarter, EUR1 billion or anything, we said we do not know at all. There is no hint. No - there is only positiveness due to the fact that we know we get into technologies which are litho intensive and litho intensive will save us from disasters if there is a macroeconomic disaster. That’s all we said. But we didn’t say we expect a macroeconomic disaster, in fact, we have no idea, in fact, I will push that back on you.
However, Peter said, because of this uncertainty we have to prepare, we have to be flexible with our OpEx and as you know, we have been pretty good at having a very highly leveraged OpEx based on flex workers on one hand and contractors on the other. We use a lot of suppliers, which allows us to swing quarter-to-quarter our OpEx level so that we can adapt to any numbers. But I prefer at this moment not to comment on the 2012. We don’t know, I don’t think. There could be scenarios low and scenarios fairly high.

But the tablet of the future is probably very near. So in terms of non-processor compatibility you could get DRAM plus some plus baseband plus NAND to be about the same in the tablet of the future in the tablet of Q1, 2012.
The processor, as you know, is a big deal difference between an ARM processor or an Intel processor, so you at this moment you could see a small litho into a processor from standard Intel processor architecture versus an ARM architecture.

So you are going to have a blurred position in the future. I would think the PC will become in fact richer than the tablet. The new PC will be richer than the tablet but the tablet itself will grow yes there will be more DRAM into it, more scratchpad and the more you put, in fact, graphics in tablets and things then it would get the DRAM to be a fairly large number. So both applications will grow. It’s nearly impossible for me at this moment to understand and track which products are coming. So, but we’re comfortable on the both applications.

Well, at this moment, let me answer it differently. About six months ago, the customer relationship on EUV was driven by the fact that EUV would be cost effective and easier to manufacture. And that there would be a transition period where the customer would hesitate between EUV and triple patterning for cost reasons.
That was about six, nine months ago. Today we have much more pressure by customers and all of them Logic, NAND and DRAM, to say that they absolutely need EUV because there are critical layers which are impossible to do in triple patterning or quadruple patterning. So, we are now getting into situations where you have significant criticality in each of the segments which drives people to say whatever the throughput of the EUV is, you’d better make EUV work.
And so how does that answer your question? Well it basically says that every one of them today have a critical layer which is pretty hard to execute and for which they are forcing the NXT to its most effective performance which is mainly overlay, then all of them will push for an NXT with a better focus control when the CD becomes a significant problem and again NAND, DRAM and Logic will ask for that and those guys have even asked that the machines that goes with the immersion NXT would also be extremely precise in overlay because the next layers will have also very aggressive specifications.
So in other terms what could happen to us in 2012 also would be that a lot of fabs are renewed also in the non-critical layer KrF and ArF just because the old machinery cannot adopt to the new NXT or to the new critical layer performance requirement. So this inflation of complexity plays in our favor.

I just had a follow up on the particularly on the H1 revenue question clearly the bookings level is pretty low now and you will ship 85% so the bulk of your backlog in the second half of this year which means that if there are no follow on orders and we have let’s say two quarters of less than 0.5 billion in bookings then the backlog that’s say at the beginning of 2012 could potentially be very small. So I mean, is it really unthinkable given the technology migration and other plans that, let’s say, Q1 revenues could be below 700 million for example? That would be my first question.
And then the second question was just on the gross margin profile for the NXE:3300, so the next generation EUV tool, should we think about that as being higher than the 3100? Should it generate closer to group gross margins? Thank you.

So you’ve got whole bunch of, I’d say, short term impacts. Of course you have the macroeconomic questions about the Greeks and Italians and the Americans going bankrupt at the same time.

And secondly, based on your conversations let’s say with the NAND flash companies, I mean, how do you see, I mean, NAND built out in the next few years. Will that be the main driver of your orders or are we still looking at upgrades on DRAM, Logic, etcetera, to be a key driver?

I think, first of all, we can’t answer, again, 2012 easily. But, it is true that 2011 was not the greatest year on memory and that there is a high chance that memory including DRAM coming back and NAND being a fundamental sector would be the big guys of the next cycle. NAND is definitely driven by these new storage elements, so the solid state drive and those server drives which are kind of hybrids.
NAND will also develop sales which have much higher access time which will then allow them to be used in such scratch pad type memory in servers. There is a case that says that NAND will eat up into the DRAM business. So people in the NAND arena are going to invest a lot. So yes, we could - you could bet that this is an engine which has a high chance to be of the level of 50% to even 100% higher than DRAM in the future.
But, on the other hand, we have heard that the DRAM guys are saying if you really go 3D in your graphic processing and your video and if you want to have all this in a platform which is mobile, you are talking about a doubling here of the bits easily and then you are back into good business and if you do this into a with the technologies which have fairly low power consumption, you are creating a need.
So in other terms today those people NAND and Flash haven’t really created - and DRAM, haven’t really created a lot of wafers so you could see them coming back. But if on the other part, the Logic part you could say they would, they would, they have invested significantly for the past two years and they may go now into a mode of maintaining.
But these people are getting into numbers of layers, which are enormous. I mentioned during the call that I took an example in fact on the 14-nanometer you can go as far as a 17 layers of EUV or 40, 45 layers of immersion. This is huge technology lithography impact.
So you may not have such volume requirement but you may have a lot of technology requirements. So those guys can in fact not so much go down. So my best bet is - would be to say 2012 you would see less Logic and more Memory and then in 2013, 2014 you could see again Logic back in because of the technology.

Your first question is, am I having happy customers with a low throughput. Well at this moment our customer would tell you that if we succeed to do 100 wafers per day, it is sufficient to do a recipe. And at this moment, we are not there yet, this is annoying them.
So they we’re not exactly giving them the throughput that allows them to have a comfortable recipe building and we are trying to get there and we think we can get there before the end of the year.
Regarding now committing a number - a throughput which then allows them to take a decision whether they will put EUV into 1 layer, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 17 is a sort of committed throughput. So at this moment we have a roadmap easily defined up to in fact 205 watt which is 125 wafers per hour. And we have this roadmap is committed between roughly 20 wafers per hour, 40 wafer per hour, 60 wafer per hour, 90 wafer and 120. And this has been given to customers but of course we need to have proof now that we’re going to make it, before decisions are taken. And the decisions will be taken, as a combination of when they have to be taken, that is, the customers has no choice, they have to jump into the swimming pool.
And secondly, we have enough facts. So these decisions are going to start, I would say, around the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter the customers are going to say, I have now no choice, you have to commit here, ASML about how big. So, when are you going to ship and at what speed and that has to be a firm commitment.
We expect that to be in Q4 and, with our response they will say okay, based on that I am going to buy 2 tools or I am going to buy 10 tools, because I will do one layer or I will do 100 layers okay. So that’s the decision. So they today they are not comfortable that we don’t know, but they are not uncomfortable. They can still wait another six months before they commit to production I guess.

So, if you said to yourself, if you’re an optimist, you say, at least we have proven more than 30 for two seconds and a half in a dark room, okay? And the question is, can you lighten the room. So, you - there are parallel paths between different things. What I can tell you however is, we feel much more comfortable now regarding the level of engineering difficulties and discoveries.
The discovery is much less and the amount of work is enormous, but the amount of work is - by proving for one second that something works at 30 watts or something or 20 wafers per hour, is already a very large positive impact, because we say, okay, now we know how to do it. We just need now to do the engineering around it to ensure that it lasts more than a second and it can last for a week. And then you are in business.

So the EUV project, per se, is important for us strategically and for the future, but during the period of transition, a delay would, in fact, be positive for the financials, not negative.

They are actually using the tool and they have accepted at least two for the third quarter, the full ownership of the tool which, if you have the signed document, you have to recognize the revenue and they are using the tool and they are running the wafers and they are running the recipes. So that is the reason and we do expect with the developments that are currently underway in the program that the remainder of those tools will be recognized over the next two to three quarters.

I was wondering whether you would give - hazard a view on how the state of those projects and overall market looks given the uncertainty?
And then the follow up was the degree to which some of these project steps or even the uncertainty in general is also engendered by the lack of clarity whether they need EUV for one machine or ten machines as you’ve set the different layers at this stage rather than just purely being a macroeconomic discussion?

So the big decisions about which node and which sort of layers and which technology is not impacting, I would say, seriously, the capacity build plan. So we are not guilty through EUV of not having the bookings.
So this is not the point, however you’re correct in saying that at this moment all the foundries, like the DRAM, like the NAND people, are looking at those fab projects that they have and try to understand what they really need to do and accelerate or decelerate in 2012. So whether you’re talking about Samsung, Globalfoundries, TSMC, UMC, SMIC all of those are saying, well, we need to be sure that we’re next tranche is done based on the 2012, 2013 year which justifies it.

Now there is - if you wanted to have one more facet for your information, there is more questions regarding some of the customers’ capability to yield the current process before they get to a next batch of fab. So in other terms, as I mentioned to you, which I think is good for litho is the processes are more and more complicated to build, so it’s more and more difficult to yield and with difficult to yield then the customer would say let me delay a bit until I get at least five tools working before I get to buy the other - the next five.
This is, by the way, playing in our favor, because remember what we always said, we didn’t want people to have too many tools too early. We would prefer to spread tools for longer period which this issue plays in our favor. We sell a critical set of tools, then there is some work to make them work and then after that we sell another batch and we sell another batch. So this currently is also being looked at by logic people who say well it is indeed difficult to yield new nodes.

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. As Eric mentioned, I would like to take a moment to share some observations on the events of the last quarter as well as some details on our third quarter results.
Our third quarter sales came in over EUR 1.4 billion and were evenly distributed across all sectors. Again as in the second quarter, they included roughly equivalent unit shipments of non-critical KrF and Island systems and critical level ArF immersion systems. I would like to highlight that we have now shipped more than 100 TWINSCAN NXT 1950 immersion systems, bringing the total number of ASML immersion systems sold to over 320.
The average selling price of all systems in the third quarter was EUR 23.2 million, that’s an increase of EUR 2 million per unit, verses second quarter with an average selling price of new systems of EUR 27 million, which is EUR 4.4 million increase over the second quarter.
Service and field option sales for the quarter came in at EUR 185 million, which is not substantially different than the second quarter. We also recognized sales for the first time of EUV systems for a total amount of EUR 80 million.
Our third quarter net income was EUR 355 million, which is 24% of sales, creating an earnings per share of EUR 0.84 for the quarter, excluding the margin EUV business, net income would have been 26% of sales.
Updating our previously announced share buyback program. As of September 25, 2011 ASML has repurchased roughly 21 million shares for EUR 560 million giving an average buyback price of around EUR 27. As stated before ASML intends to cancel the repurchased shares. And at the end of third quarter, we had about EUR 2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
Third quarter net bookings, excluding EUV, came in at 23 systems valued at EUR 514 million, which is essentially one system above our guided level. Booked ASPs declined from EUR 24.7 million in the second quarter to EUR 22.4 million in third quarter, which is due to a product mix shift towards some lower ASP non-critical tools, especially KrF.
Bookings strength was in the foundry sector, 41% of total booking followed by NAND Flash, 30% with 18% from DRAM and the rest came from IDM.
Our order backlog, exiting Q3 was EUR 2 billion, excluding EUV, which totaled 74 systems with an average selling price of nearly EUR 27 million per unit. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect net sales to be above EUR 1.1 billion, includes revenue recognition of one EUV system and NXE:3100 at EUR 40 million. This system will be recognized again with 0 profit margins. And resulting in a gross margin of the total expected sales for the quarter of about 41%, but excluding this EUV system, the gross margin that would be about 42%.
R&D expenses are expected to be EUR 150 million, giving support to our dual product leader, to our dual product leadership strategy with focus on the EUV system development and also on immersion platform enhancements. SG&A will be at EUR 56 million in the quarter.
We expect fourth quarter bookings to be at level above the third quarter, reflecting customer’s clear and continuing need for new technology capability in support of the aggressive shrink roadmaps for new product development and lower manufacturing costs. However, it’s too early to understand how overall semiconductor demand will contribute to our business in 2012 and to what extent our business will benefit from what appears to be a solid technology transition year.
At this point, our customers are starting to place orders for these next generation technology upgrades but are currently not yet capable of calling the total capacity needs for 2012. They will most certainly wait for macroeconomic and industry specific market developments before confirming the full extent of their investment plans for next year.
And with that, I would like to turn back over to Eric.",663,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So, Peter has addressed our short-term and mid-term perspective. I would like myself to focus my introduction on the next four to five years which we will see one of the industry’s most extensive technology transition. The transition for critical layers from immersion, lithography and it’s multiple versions, spacer, double patterning, double-double patterning et cetera to EUV. This next generation technology has been chosen unanimously by the industry. It is based on EUV light, the wavelengths of which is not limited, not a limiter to further geometrical shrinks up through 2020 or even longer.
As  immersion lithography, which is currently the leading edge technology will not be able to carry the industry’s geometric scaling on critical layers beyond say, 15 to 20 nanometer in the DRAM segment and beyond 10 to 15 nanometer in the NAND and the Logic segment, even by stretching immersion lithography with self-aligned or double-double patterning or any of these techniques.
These immersion technologies will have a hard stop for use in critical layers. But of course immersion will however be used for many non-critical layers well into the 2020s along with KrF technology. The transition from immersion to EUV on the critical layers will, however, and this is important, this is our key message, will be gradual. First, customers with a huge installed base in immersion lithography systems in the fabs and other dedicated process equipment will use amortized equipment for as long as possible. And we’ll bring EUV system in only after maximum technically u-feasible utilization of the installed base first.
The second question is that each layers at each new node will have more or less complexity for which EUV transition will be more or less economically and technically obvious. So, it’s not a question of node, it’s a question of layers per node. And each of the layers have, I would call, its personality. So, for instance, key enabling VIUS [ph] or contact layers for Logic DRAM and even NAND are currently the most insertion layers for EUV. The EUV helps manufacturing control yield while providing the possibility of better shrink factors. Dye on the EUV could be as small as 10% smaller than dye made by an alternative technology and also making use of less design restriction.
The third point, third aspect which explains gradual is that the suppliers providing EUV systems and infrastructure like us, will provide continuously improved equipment adapted first to the most complex challenges until a time when the product capacity and the product development allows the shipment of larger number of system at improved specifications and cost for all critical layers. So, in other terms, our machines will improve as we go and as it improves, its economics are better and better and as they are better and better, they will move into different set of layers.
So these 3 factors, the use of current installed base, ever more technically challenging image requirement and progressive availability of EUV system is better economics will make EUV transition gradual. Most customers are proceeding today on this with the development of some layers to be either processed with immersion and/or with EUV, thus having the security of a known technology as a backup. But the full use of EUV and its enabling capability if and when it works.
ASML will support this gradual ramp with an aggressive dual product strategy, of course. We continue innovation on our immersion platform concurrent with the huge development of EUV platform.
Regarding critical layers which will use immersion, we are developing the next generation machine, the next generation NXT, which will set new throughput and overlay standards. And we are also in parallel, strengthening our suite of holistic lithography software and hardware products which enable the process window enlargement. And improve the process drift management and the capability of matching the machine which becomes more and more a requirement.
Our customer’s processed complexity and our associated product solution will contribute to ASML revenue growth of course. But also will ensure leadership as, for instance, machine matching and compatibility is becoming ever, ever growing requirement. So, if you have an installed base of ASML machine, it becomes natural and necessary to adopt more ASML machines for this important compatibility.
Regarding EUV, we have shipped 5 EUV pre-production NXE:3100 at this moment, with the sixth shipping in fact as we speak. Integration has become on the first NXE:3300, which is a new generation product tool, slated for delivery on the second half of 2012.
Our current EUV throughput roadmap has been updated. So, we indeed incurred a cumulative 1.5 year delay on this development. In large part, due to the investment in the EUV source development area which was not commensurate with the complexity of the task.
After several months of heavy involvement with the 3 potential source suppliers, we now clearly understand the key issues to be addressed and are intensively cooperating with the suppliers on sub programs, on numbers of sub programs to drive execution of this roadmap. We now plan to achieve commercially viable throughput of our target, 60 wafers per hour in the field, in the summer of 2012. And we will achieve our target 125 wafers per hour on the 3300 a year later.
We are currently building capacity for 1 system per month from mid-2012 out through end of 2013 ramping to 2 per month in 2014 and then 3 per month in 2015 in anticipation of the gradual demand curve which I described before.
So, in summary, in the perspective of the development of, on one hand multi-patterning immersion and on the other hand the gradual insertion of EUV, we see the next 4 to 5 years as the path to good secular growths.
So, with this, Peter and I would be pleased to take your questions.",972,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I think the question is actually for Eric. And the question is basically that in Q2 conference call you kind of pointed out that the minimum spend by industry for technology upgrade will be about EUR 750 million per quarter which was excluding EUV. Now if I add about 5 EUV tools to that I get to about a EUR 3.35 billion or EUR 3.4 billion of sales for 2012 which is kind of the minimum spend you were pointing to. I was wondering that looking at the famous fab model, where do you see the semiconductor industry today. I mean, is it looking purely as a tech upgrading happening in 2012 or is there some capacity addition as well? And I have a quick follow-up.",132,5.0,8.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8

We usually report to you facts, meaning, when our customers are ready to put orders for our machines which have long lead time. And we usually give those facts. This time we don’t have facts. So, we cannot really guide on 2012. What we said however, what Peter said is that there is a good technology transition wave in 2012.
As we also mentioned before, a lot of our partners in the DRAM business and in the Logic business are improving or reducing their usual cycles of transition. We see DRAM now every year. And we see Logic even better than the usual 2 years going to 18 months. So, we know this is positive.

And I guess my follow-up is looking at the current capacity. I mean, in the beginning of this year, you were talking about building up the capacity at ASML to suffice EUR 2 billion per quarter of revenue. But looking at the order pattern right now, it looks like, 2012 you would have much lower sales.

But indeed as you say, we also have such a large market share that we need to provide for the customers if there is short term demand. So, we are playing between this maximum flexibility up, in terms of output and the possibility of always providing a P&L which creates value. So, we do have this variability ET on OpEx. We can exercise it between 3 to 6 months. And we can go to what’s a very low OpEx if necessary.
Most of the activity on OpEx would be the reduction of contracted work, which will be because we leverage a lot of activities, R&D as well as development or I mean the support with companies. But we also have a large flex workforce. So, again today, we are still running our business to have in 2012 a good year because we need to be capable of delivering.

I wanted Eric, what really gives you the additional confidence that in terms of the EUV, the customers will take EUV for,  the 1X node and DRAM and NAND. And just as to two quick follow-ups. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how many layers you see as being critical with EUV?

We believe that further NAND business around 18 nanometer will have a contact layer which is extremely, extremely, extremely difficult to manage without EUV. As usually in light source we’ve done differently. But we have huge push on NAND 18 nano one layer contact in NAND. In the DRAM arena, we have 2 layers in the 20ish, 20-22 nanometer environment which has same opportunity. So, to be clear on this one, it’s for us to take. So, if the machine runs well enough, we will take those layers. And they will justify fairly ramp up by the way. If we delay this indeed and there will be a significantly difficult process using double patterning, triple patterning or whatever, which also we will contribute with about the same level of with lead source spend. So, we’re not considering the EUV introduction as being an economic issue for us but it is for our customers because EUV is more cost effective. So, we are working extremely hard to get this, to happen on time. The R&D effort in EUV at this moment is, I would say about simplify more than 1/3 of our business, of our spend. We are building up a bit more than that again for another year or so. And after that, we could stabilize. But again, as we’ve noticed in this business, the R&D curve can go down if we only go to maintenance but good for us. We always see another opportunity, so in other terms, if I’m right with the secular growth options which we’re starting to see, we will need in fact to upgrade our EUV machines to new generations for the good of creating growth. And so, on one hand I see the possibility of going down in R&D if and when the business matures. But if the business doesn’t mature as we could start-in now between 2015 and 2020, then we would probably maintain the current level of R&D.",327,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

On 450, so, clearly we believe that the top 4 to top 6 largest manufacturer semiconductors will develop, will push for 450 transition in due time. We think at this moment, the due time is probably a real prototyping around 2016, 2017 and potential production around 2018. Before that, there could be some demonstration units and you’ve seen and heard some reports on consortium in particular, in the New York state, discussing the possibility of demonstration and feasibility.
But I would say, this is minimum investment, this is more demonstration than it is industrialization. So, I would think at this moment, the whole industry would agree with what I said, which is in the best case, CIS prototyping beyond 2016, serious production beyond 2018.
On these dates, I guess, most suppliers, equipment suppliers, are working and discussing with the largest customers to confirm that there is an insertion point and obviously to share the economics. This is not yet, we haven’t yet reached an agreement on that. The whole industry hasn’t yet reached to an agreement on that. But we’re very, and we’d say, open book on these questions.

On the question on the, qualitative statement on the order intake on Q4 and question on whether there is any seasonality there. Now, we did mention on previous occasions that what we normally see is indeed, that in Q4, customer budgets are actually set. And the whole and purchase agreements are signed with us. And that means that the purchasing people then have a proxy to start negotiating and placing the orders. But I want to make it quite clear that what I said also in the opening statement that we are of course focusing on the next generation technology upgrades for next year, which customers have taken their decisions on. And as just what we see as a start of placing the orders for that next generation technology upgrade. And having said that, that it is logical that we would see that that’s a next generation upgrade order coming in Q4. But it’s hard to imagine that it would stop in Q4 because that would mean customers would place everything that they need for 2012 in only 3 months’ time, which they won’t. So I don’t think there is any seasonal trend.

No, it’s clear that timing of those bookings we would indeed expect when the EUV program delivers the results that we are currently planning for. Like we said, we will see the upgrade to the mid-teens as we have said that will actually drive clearly the needs for our customers to take into account the fact that order lead times for EUV tools are beyond 12 months. They are actually quite a bit longer.
So that means that bookings for the 3300s, beyond what we currently see need to come in clearly I would say in the first half of next year, taking into account that the first 10 tools have already been ordered. And we have about the capacity to do 18 units until the end of 2013 that’s about 1 per month starting from July 2012 onwards.

I mean, like we said, we actually have viewed the EUV systems as the R&D systems for the 3100 series. And clearly, these are the production series. So, this would be a time -- and we are considering internally to say ""when are we going to show them in the backlog?"" Everybody knows it’s about EUR 70 million EUR 75 million average, and we have 10 units, so it’s EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million of EUV orders that we currently have that is not reflected in the backlog yet. Where we anticipate that we will start shipping in the third quarter of next year with, you could say, with a speed of 1-2 per month going forward for the next 18 months. So, this is clearly a time when we need to start considering, taking them into the regular backlog. Like I said earlier, they are orders that we take for EUV, that have a somewhat longer time because the order lead time that we actually need for a total chain for our supply chain and our own bill time goes beyond 12 months. So, we always said that we want to show the order backlog actually reflecting what we think we can sell over the next 12 months so we need to decide in what is the right moment to starting putting the EUV orders in, but it won’t be far away.",238,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So, that means that’s taking into account on the EUR 2.8 billion we have about EUR 800 million of prepayments on EUV for which clearly we still need to invest. We are actually starting to invest in work in process we will have a receivable balance sheets that we need to finance. So, the EUR 2.8 billion, that’s about EUR 800 million of currently prepayments in there. But clearly, we will, given that the 2012 profitability profile, we will generate cash. So we have said clearly that about our cash balances we will keep returning cash back to the shareholders. And which would be in the form of dividends and of share buybacks.

Actually, it’s another question on EUV if I might. You said that you’re getting a new light source which will take you up to the mid-teens of wafer throughput in Q4. I was just wondering, going forward from there up to about 50 to 60 wafers per hour by the second half of next year and then to 125 wafers per hour in second half of 2013. What are the milestones and what are the expectations you have from light source suppliers or any other and how you expect to ramp that up? If you could give a little bit of color to give us a feel on how that’s going to happen.
And just to clarify, if a leading DRAM manufacturer says he is going to go to say, a sub -- to a low 20 nanometer production on DRAM by the second half of next year, I was a bit confused. Do you think that he will use EUV for at least 2 layers or is EUV for commercial production clearly going to be pushed into 2013?",185,5.0,8.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8

So, on the reason why we feel now that more comfortable about the roadmap is and the understanding of what we need to do is, as we have identified that there are a number of things that are difficult to do and a number of things which are not that difficult to do. They are more deterministic, they just take time. So, today, you see us showing good body language because there are 2 or 3 things of difficulty that we have to prove by December. They are in, I would say, the critical areas of generation of the radiation. But then, there is a lot of activities which is just multiplying. I would say the results of this radiation by improving effectiveness of the delivery of this radiation to the wafer.
And this is, I would say, just work. So, we see a step by step approach by which, at the end of December as we said, we will get between say 15, 20 wafers per hour proven. And then from there, we will have those multipliers coming in on a regular basis into 2012. So that we achieve what I just said, the 60 wafers per hour by mid-year and then, going further with even more efficiency move towards the 120, 125 wafers per hour. So, in other terms, the separation now of complex stuff from less complex things is giving us this confidence level that we are now much more under control of the development of these efforts. Regarding market timing, the machines that are used today, the 3100s will be used only for recipe. And that is starting, in fact started this year. And will continue until the end of 2012. And the 3300s are the preproduction machines that could be used on some layers. So, you could see them being delivered in mid-2012 on and starting to ramp production of some layers in first half of 2013.",323,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And as you know, there is more and more excitement about the product, the end products and, the creation of more opportunity of NAND in PCs as well as in tablets. So, as you know, NAND was driven by tablets and mobile phone. Tomorrow it will be driven by mobile phone and again by tablet but also by PCs with SSDs and more effective user facilities. So, indeed NAND is going to be a growth business I would say in 2012. DRAM wasn’t so bad today in 2011. We think there is an opportunity to create a good litho business, not so much because of the wafer starts. It is possible that the wafer starts in 2012 will not be so good. But the technology is a big user of lithography. So, we could expect a growth of DRAM from a fairly low base 2011. Foundry is in fact the key segment which will make 2012 a good year or an average year. And this is what we have a bit more difficulty to cope.",183,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Yes, indeed we have in 2008, ‘09 a freeze of 6 months because the world was stunned by the banking crises. Remember this was the time when people thought that the whole economy would implode. And this created the sense of, ""we don’t need to take a long-term decision now. And we can delay decisions."" So it was not a rational view of life, it was an absolute life stop until things become normal. So today, indeed we have a crisis, which is not yet obviously consumption driven. It’s a crisis on of confidence due to the too high leverage and of the world in general, deficits, management, foreign debt credibility et cetera. But we do not have yet a feeling at all at our customer that there is a freeze of decision. Indeed this is why Peter mentioned that we expect more bookings in Q4. Because in fact the customers are saying, well, at least we can take the decisions which are the obvious decisions, which are the technology decisions. And we need these numbers.

And EUV is going to be a key factor to this lithography intensity. So, no matter what the macroeconomic picture is, we have an underlying rich opportunity here. And EUV again will underline that. And as a measure of this performance, you can see 2011. 2011 has been already shaken since April, as we all know. Since April, the market has started to be concerned about the total need for semiconductors. But 2011 for us will, one, be a record year. And two, even our guidance early into the year has not really wavered. We are able to make that number.

While the EUV 3300 has significantly higher lead time, it could be 1 year longer. So, that you could say, if you look at the order time when do they need to place the orders and when would they need to get the shipment of the tool, then the order placement could be about the same time.

This model is, in fact, what we all want to be proven. If indeed, the customers see an application push to do these transition faster and go and ramp immediately in production. Then we are going to see a sustained logic business and the foundry business. And if it is sustained 2012, is in fact, and indeed a very good year because as I said at the beginning, DRAM and NAND will probably be higher in 2012. Therefore Logic, if it would be sustained, would make 2012 a good year. But again, this is a theoretical question.

Because as we said the ramping of the new nodes in DRAM are complicated, they require these new machines. So, we’re shipping these new machines. We know, I mean, there are no other machines on the install base that are capable of doing this. So, therefore on these critical layers, we have no concern at all that there is excess capacity. Of course you could always have excess capacity on some non-critical layers on the installed based. But I would say this is a bit irrelevant to sales. These are old machinery and things.

In fact, this is one of the confusion that we will all have, you will all have in the press and different communications. There are so many factors that yield throughput that you can, for a period of time, have on one experiment achieving 60 wafers per hour. And another, you’re not, you had half this. And another experiment you are you know a bit better. So, you are going to have a, I would say, a continuous gradual set of positive data coming in towards the 60 and in fact real number is 25 [ph] I want to give you the truth. I think, we calculated number 69 wafers per hour and then we’ll go from there. So, you will see that every quarter. I think we will be able to report a gradual improvement towards those targets and then beyond.",149,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,69,"Well, I think I can repeat what Eric said earlier. The situation between now and 2008 and ‘09 is different, it’s quite different. In 2008 and ‘09, we were all surprise taken by a surprise. And there was an absolute freeze for at least 6 months where doing nothing was the best option. That’s absolutely not the case today. Customers have very clear cost reduction roadmaps and the technology node transitions are also very clearly, actually quite strong in every segment. So they talk to us about the latter, they talk about what they need to do to get to the next nodes to get the cost down. And they seem all to be quite firm on that particular transition. And that, of course, against the background that we are currently not in a situation whereby we have to, doubt the viability of the whole financial industry like we did in the first few months of 2009, despite the fact that clearly we have issues and that bears on, I think, the overall uncertainty. But, no, I don’t think there is, that the customers act the same. As a matter of fact, they show a high level of confidence in what absolutely the need to do.",206,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I mean, in terms of I mean, there have been some investors worried about, the foundry spending, well, foundry spending in 2011 is the highest it has been for 10 years. Is it because, I mean, there is a change in capital intensity in these new generation processes, 28 nanometers. Or is there a real, I mean, underlying, you’ve said previously that there is no underlying issue. So, are you suggesting, clear changes in capital intensity in the business?",84,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

And so first of all, there was a sort of catch-up. Clearly the foundry business has under-invested for a period of time. So, 2011 includes a bit of a catch-up. Secondly, as I said, the Logic business seems to have accelerated from a 2 year to an 18 months transition, so you get that to be done. The third aspect is that you are now getting to nodes which have significant amount of critical layer increase. So, for instance, when you are in the DRAM business, the next node would force you to do say, 2 to 3 layers which are very, very complicated, which are, what you call the EUV critical. And these are the layers which drive, in fact, the buy of new machines.
Well, in the Logic arena, when you go to 22-nanometer, from 22 days, 28, so you get to 22, 20, 14, then you have the numbers of critical layers. You’re talking about 10, 15, so you’re 5 times bigger than memories. So, these transitions are hugely litho-incentive. And that helps us consider that the foundry could in fact become foundries. And Logic, in general, would become a continuous engine in the next few years. But again, there will be digestion as we go on some periods, 6 months, 1 year, indeed. But the secular growth on foundry is probably significant.",229,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

But the critical layers, as I explained to Sandeep, represent a bigger share. So, indeed, so we go from 70 to 80-ish. But I would not venture that this would go above 80.
