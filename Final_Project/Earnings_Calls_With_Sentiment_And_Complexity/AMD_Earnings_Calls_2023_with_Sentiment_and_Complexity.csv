Before discussing our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments about our CFO transition. I'd like to start by thanking Devinder for all of his contributions to AMD over the last 39 years. During his tenure as CFO, we built a strong financial foundation that has enabled AMD's significant growth and success. On a personal note, his partnership and expertise have been invaluable to me. I know I speak for all of AMD when I say we appreciate all he has done for the company and wish him the best in his upcoming retirement.  
I also want to welcome our new EVP and CFO, Jean Hu, to our first AMD earnings call since joining us earlier this month. Jean's more than 14 years of public company CFO experience and proven track record of financial leadership make her an excellent addition to our team. I look forward to working closely with her as we continue to transform and scale our business.  
Now turning to the business results. 2022 was a strong year for AMD as we navigated the challenging macro environment to deliver best-in-class growth and record profitability driven by our Embedded and Data Center segments. We also transformed the company. We accelerated our Data Center business and closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and Pensando, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financial model as our Data Center, Embedded product sales grew from $3.9 billion in 2021 to $10.6 billion in 2022.  
Looking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded and Data Center segments, which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue 44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment revenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.  
Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led by increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now power more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others in the quarter.  
In Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expanding our pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and aerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest top 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.  
To build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in cloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. We are seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and capabilities.  
Initial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.  
For Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of 40% compared to the prior generation.  
Now looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by strong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand. We are very pleased with the customer reception of the Pensando technology with good long-term growth opportunities as DPUs become a standard component in the next generation of cloud and enterprise data centers.  
Data center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had shipments supporting the build-out of multiple Instinct MI250 accelerator supercomputer wins. In January, we previewed our next-generation MI300 accelerator that will be used for large model AI applications in cloud data centers and has been selected to power the 2-plus exaflop El Capitan exascale supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. MI300 will be the industry's first data center chip that combines a CPU, GPU and memory into a single integrated design, delivering 8x more performance and 5x better efficiency for HPC and AI workloads, compared to our MI250 accelerator currently powering the world's fastest super computer. MI300 is on track to begin sampling to lead customers later this quarter and launch in the second half of 2023.  
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth quarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased sequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our Ryzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated on-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of AMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.  
We also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance than the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks planned to go on sale in February.  
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher semi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming graphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon RX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new RDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design. 
In January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and others that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023. 
Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number of our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In communications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with Tier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple customers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicle equipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can improve the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.  
We also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter, driven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.  
Taking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely well, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our business. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and 6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.  
In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming businesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with the second half stronger than the first half. In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect to continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.  
In our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of our competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and more differentiated set of products to drive future growth.  
Over the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry service and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our broad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can address the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.  
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?",1727,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2023",2023-01-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3625.0,2726208.0,102177068.0,Presenter Speech,Jean Hu,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we generated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying our business portfolio.  
Fourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.  
Operating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income was $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client operating income.  
Now turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors. Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.  
Client segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million a year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.  
Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customer product sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue.  
Embedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was $443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year. 
Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.  
Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data Center and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022 pro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. 
Operating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56% from a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion. Net income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior year, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx. 
Full year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term supply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.  
Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and Gaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected to decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers. 
In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the macro environment. However, let me provide some color. 
Directionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected share gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.  
In closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our business. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. We believe our leadership of products, growing customer momentum and strong financial foundation position us well for long-term profitable growth.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for a Q&A.

I mean the last 5 years of the company have been remarkable, but I remember all the work you and your finance team did 6 or 7 years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement.  
My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023. You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of going on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the Data Center space and obviously, what's going on in the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year 2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year.",156,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Our largest growth driver is certainly the Data Center. We are very positioned well with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa 4th Gen EPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well. 
When we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our road map. And we have an opportunity to move more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning.  
As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with Data Center. Also on the Embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's a diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so we think that's also a grower for AMD.  
On the other side, our Client and Gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in the second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory, and I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to ship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity for growth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, client will decline just given the TAM.  
And then on the Gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022. And so console demand has been actually quite strong. And given where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, I think lots of puts and takes, but we're positive on what we can do in terms of the Data Center and the Embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on the Client and Gaming and see how that plays out.",409,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

The margin, I guess, sequentially down a little bit into March. But I kind of wanted to focus on the drivers of the longer-term margin that's down, I guess, 3 or 4 points from where you were a few quarters ago despite more mix of the revenue coming from Embedded and Data Center. So if there's any way that you guys could try to quantify maybe how much of the margin headwind is from just lower client revenue. How much of it might be from any programs that you're working through to clear the channel? And how might we model? What are the drivers that we should think about in terms of the margin recovering?",130,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Maybe -- so on the overall margin, the way to think about our business, Matt, is -- and our margin is primarily driven by product mix. So as the Embedded and Data Center businesses are -- grow, so the margin expansion grows with it. In terms of the sequential question that you had from Q4 to Q1, that's just a product of the mix. So with Data Center being lower sequentially, that's that. We are also working through our client inventory clearing. What we're seeing in the PC business is, as we're going through this sort of normalization of inventory, especially on some of the older products, we do have more marketing programs and pricing incentives in place. We do expect that to normalize as we go through the first half of the year. And so as Jean said in the prepared remarks, we would expect margin expansion as we go into the second half with the growth in Data Center, Embedded and some normalization of the client business as well.",172,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Is it a 2-quarter issue? Does it impact the pace of your January ramp?

In terms of where we believe the -- as the inventory normalizes, each customer is different, so they have what they're trying to achieve in terms of inventory levels. Our expectation is that sort of the first half softness for cloud and then second half strength as that's worked through. But like I said, it's different for each customer.

But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, right, year-on-year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one? 
Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering. And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers?",133,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

So maybe just to make sure that we're just correlating the numbers. So my comment about PC TAM being down 10% was assuming if you take a look at sort of what IDC just published for 2022 at about 290 million units, and that's more of a sell-through TAM versus a sell-in TAM. So we have been under-shipping sort of the sell-through or consumption for the last 2 quarters in an attempt to renormalize that as soon as possible.  
In terms of do I think it's -- I think it's in the ZIP code. I think it's in the ZIP code. So if you imagine 2023 sell-through TAM of about 260 million units, plus or minus, seems to be about the right number. We have made good progress in inventory normalization. We want to be cautious, obviously, heading into the year just given the macro environment. First quarter we said would be roughly seasonal for PCs. I think second quarter -- first quarter should be the bottom for us in PCs. We -- and then grow from there into the second quarter and then into the second half.  
And I should note also, Vivek, I mean, we just launched our Ryzen 7000 series with sort of our AI capabilities, both from a notebook and desktop standpoint. So we feel good about the product road map in PCs. Obviously, we have to get through this normalization. Most of the focus is on continuing to differentiate our products and working with our customers to offer sort of very strong platforms.",259,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Let me take this question, then Lisa can add. As we talk about it, it's both our Embedded and Data Center segment have strong gross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half. 
We continue to have the growth of both Embedded and Data Center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really Client side, which if you think about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction, which impact the gross margin in the Client segment. 
So going into second half, the normalization of the Client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the Client segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall, we feel pretty good. Once we normalize the Client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand.",173,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I guess for my follow-up, maybe it follows up on that a little bit more just around the mix. I get how Data Center and Embedded should be growing in the second half versus the first half. But presumably, Client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are under-shipping, it sounds like by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the 4 businesses of the second half versus the first half? 
Do you think your Data Center plus Embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first half?

I think the way to think about it is, I think our Data Center grow -- growth in the second half versus first half, we expect that to be significantly stronger. As it relates to clients, we would also expect it to be stronger. Again, depending a bit on macro and sort of how the TAM actually evolves. I think for the Embedded businesses, I would say that we expect to grow over the full year 2023 versus 2022. What we see right now is a fairly strong backlog and good visibility into the first half of the year. I'm not ready to say that Embedded will grow in the second half versus the first half, though, because we're coming off very strong growth already.

Thanks for the question. We believe that AI is a huge driver of compute growth. And given our portfolio, it should be a driver of our growth as well. I think if you think about the product sets that we are putting sort of AI content in, you should expect MI300, of course, on the GPU training side. We just launched Ryzen AI in our PC portfolio. You can expect additional AI acceleration coming in our server portfolio as well. So you're going to see AI broadly across our road maps. 
In terms of when -- we've talked before about sort of our Data Center GPU ambitions and the opportunity there, we see it as a large opportunity. As we go into the second half of the year and launch MI300, sort of the first user of MI300 will be the supercomputers or El Capitan, but we're working closely with some large cloud vendors as well to qualify MI300 in AI workloads.

And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I think a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little bit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode, and then in the second half, things normalizing.

Sure. So I think on the Client segment, it's fair to say that we believe, given where we are with the client inventory levels, the first half will certainly be lower.

So Aaron, we started shipping Genoa in the third quarter that ramped into the fourth quarter and will continue to ramp through 2024. The way I think about -- or the way you should think about the Genoa ramp is that it is a new platform for our customers. So they'll be introducing it -- introducing first-in-cloud sort of internal workloads and then going to external workloads and then enterprise. So I think it will be throughout 2024. We have -- I'm sorry, throughout 2023. 
We do have higher core counts on Genoa. So you would expect that, that will give us some ASP uplift as we go through to some of those higher core count products. Bergamo will launch in the first half of the year. We are on track for the Bergamo launch, and you'll see that become a larger contributor in the second half.

I know it's within the Embedded largely. But your self reporting, I think if I read the filings correctly, growing 40% plus on a like-for-like basis for Xilinx.

So Aaron, that business has done very well. So the Xilinx business, I think our overall Embedded business continues to do well. When we look across the subsegments, there are puts and takes in the subsegments. But what we see is content is going up. So we had records in communications, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, automotive. We have the Embedded processor content that's also going into automotive. So we feel very good about that business. 
I think as we look into 2023, I mentioned this in the question with Stacy, we have a very good visibility to the first half just given the lead times and the backlog. And the first half looks strong, so we expect to grow sequentially in the first quarter. As we go into the second half of the year, we're monitoring the overall demand environment. And just given how strong it's been, we are looking at whether there'll be some puts and takes in some of the end market segments there.

Joe, we view that the opportunity -- so first of all, I would say that in general, the PC market share numbers are probably a bit noisy right now, just given all of the sell-in, sell-through and the inventory dynamics that are being worked through. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we believe we gained a little bit of share in the PC market. As we go forward into 2023, we think our product portfolio is very strong. As we look at Ryzen 7000 and where it goes and where we are positioned in the commercial as well as the high-end consumer segments, we're not changing our strategy on PCs. Quite -- a few years ago, we really focused on sort of the more premium segments. We have less penetration in the low end, which I think is helpful. And as we go forward, we're continuing to focus on commercial PCs and getting a larger footprint in there.

I would say, Joe, the total cost of ownership benefit of Genoa, particularly in some of the larger cloud workloads, is very, very significant. So I wouldn't say that, that's necessarily slowing the pace of adoption. It is a new platform though. So if you think about when we went from Rome to Milan, it was basically similar platforms. So I would say that, that ramp was a bit faster. 
But as it relates to Genoa, we had always expected that Milan and Genoa would coexist through 2023. And that we would have -- we still have Milan instances that are just ramping now, and we expect that will continue through 2023. And so I really view this as the natural thing when we introduce Genoa at sort of the higher core count, that both will coexist. And as some of the platform costs come down, you'll see the Genoa cutover, and that's what I mentioned towards the fourth quarter of 2023.",163,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So maybe let me separate Data Center and Client because they're a little bit different. I think on the Data Center side, we would -- we do see that, in general, the performance, the power performance, the total cost of ownership, selling the solution is the most important piece of it because the solutions are actually quite different in terms of what you can do between sort of 4th Gen EPYC and sort of other solutions. The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that we bring to both cloud and enterprise customers. 
I think on the Client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think that normally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing, our OEM partners are working on rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so there are more incentives and more -- a more aggressive pricing environment. 
I view that, that's primarily on, let's call it, older products, let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that, there will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products, where there's more capability added. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes. 
And in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see -- expect that to normalize, too, as everyone is sort of optimizing their CapEx spending.",262,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Two questions, if I may. First, on the PC side. Can you give us a sense about roughly how far under consumption, you believe, you're shipping on the PC side, either in Q4 and Q1? 
And Lisa, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client just to grow into second quarter. So does that suggest that 1Q, you think, is the bottom on the PC? And then I had a follow-up.",94,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So we -- so the first -- the second question, yes. We do believe the first quarter is the bottom for our PC market -- for our PC business, and we'll see some growth in the second quarter and then a seasonally higher second half. 
In terms of the under shipment, I mean, I think we're -- we under-shipped in Q3, we under-shipped in Q4. We will under-ship, to a lesser extent, in Q1. So I think you can infer that from our guidance of single-digit down. And then we'll be back to a more normal environment. 
Now just as a reminder, though, the first half is not usually a -- the first half is usually a seasonally weak client time anyways. So we would expect more lift in the second half, not so much in the second quarter.",141,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And then a follow-up, if I may, on the -- China is lifting, as they're lifting the COVID restrictions, I guess I would imagine that you would expect that ultimately, at some point, to translate into higher demand. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of share with us your thoughts about how that might play out. And could you remind us, to the extent that you can help us understand the risk to the supply side for you in the event that the COVID spreads rapidly as they lift the restrictions and impacts what you have on the supply side there.",109,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So we've done a very good job in our supply chain in terms of risk mitigation. So we have -- we don't believe that we have a significant risk as it relates to COVID future outbreaks, if there are any. As it relates to China recovery, I think we would benefit from a China recovery. It's very difficult to call. I mean we've seen, certainly in our Data Center business, we saw in the second half of the year and last year in the first half of this year that the China Data Center business has been weak for us. If there was a recovery, I think we would benefit from that. Similarly, some of the other consumer patterns as well. But it's very difficult to call.

I think the Data Center business, we have again, our -- we're heavily weighted towards cloud, and we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favor in the Data Center is our workloads are expanding. And so we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting both Milan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so I think that gives us good confidence. 
And frankly, the Data Center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023. So there is an adjustment in the first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up production in the second half as some of the demand resumes. And I think the overall factor of compute in the cloud being a very important long-term driver is definitely there.

So let me make a couple of points. I think all of us, as we participate in the PC industry, there are various parts of the ecosystem that we work with. We work with our OEMs, we work with our retail partners, we work with our distribution and channel partners. And we're all working together to work through sort of the elevated inventory levels. As I said, I think we've made good progress on that. And I think we have much better visibility into the various pieces. 
As it relates to the pricing environment, I do believe that the pricing environment is -- particularly when you're clearing older inventory or older-generation products, is a bit more competitive. And we see that. As we look forward, the way we're modeling the Client business is that we are modeling gross margins to be less than corporate average. That's different than our previous modeling. 
So previously, Client was more like at corporate average. And I think given the -- I think the nice thing is our business is quite a bit more diversified now. And so with our Data Center, Embedded businesses really being strong growth drivers, I think Client continues to be a good market overall.

We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings in a mixed demand environment, launched multiple leadership products across our businesses and made significant progress accelerating our AI road map and customer engagements across our portfolio. 
First quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Sales of our data center and embedded products contributed more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter as cloud and Embedded revenue grew significantly year-over-year. 
Looking at the first quarter business results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.3 billion was flat year-over-year with higher cloud sales, offset by lower enterprise sales. In cloud, the quarter played out largely as we expected. EPYC CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year but declined sequentially as elevated inventory levels with some MDC customers resulted in a lower sell-in TAM for the quarter. 
Against this backdrop, we were pleased that the largest cloud providers further expanded their AMD deployments in the quarter to power a larger portion of their internal workloads and public instances. 28 new AMD instances launched in the first quarter, including multiple confidential computing offerings from Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud that take advantage of the unique security features of our EPYC processors. In total, we now have more than 640 AMD-powered public instances available. 
Enterprise sales declined year-over-year and sequentially as end customer demand softened due to near-term macroeconomic uncertainty. We continued growing our enterprise pipeline and closed multiple wins with Fortune 500 automotive, technology and financial companies in the quarter. We made strong progress in the quarter, ramping our Zen 4 EPYC CPU portfolio. All of our large cloud customers have Genoa running in their data centers and are on track to begin broad deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances in the second quarter. 
For the enterprise, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and other leading providers entered production on new Genoa server platforms that complement their existing 3rd Gen EPYC platforms. We are on track to launch Bergamo, our first cloud-native server CPU and Genoa-X, our 4th Gen EPYC processor with 3D chiplets for leadership in technical computing workloads later this quarter. Although we expect server demand to remain mixed in the second quarter, we are well positioned to grow our cloud and enterprise footprint in the second half of the year based on the strong customer response to the performance and TCO advantages of Genoa, Bergamo and Genoa-X. 
Now looking at our broader data center business. In networking, Microsoft Azure launched their first instance powered by our Pensando DPU and software stack that can significantly increase application performance for networking intensive workloads by enabling 10x more connections per second compared to non-accelerated instances. 
We expanded our data center product portfolio with the launch of our first ASIC-based Alveo data center media accelerator that supports 4x the number of simultaneous video streams compared to our prior generation. In supercomputing, the Max Planck Society announced plans to build the first supercomputer in the EU, powered by 4th Gen EPYC CPUs and Instinct MI300 accelerators that is expected to deliver a 3x increase in application performance and significant TCO improvements compared to their current system. 
Our AI activities increased significantly in the first quarter, driven by expanded engagements with a broad set of data center and embedded customers. We expanded the software ecosystem support for our Instinct GPUs in the first quarter, highlighted by the launch of the widely used PyTorch 2.0 framework, which now offers native support for our ROCm software. In early April, researchers announced they used the LUMI supercomputer powered by 3rd Gen EPYC CPUs and Instinct MI250 accelerators to train the largest Finnish language model to date. 
Customer interest has increased significantly for our next-generation Instinct MI300 GPUs for both AI training and inference of large language models. We made excellent progress achieving key MI300 silicon and software readiness milestones in the quarter, and we're on track to launch MI300 later this year to support the El Capitan exascale supercomputer win at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and large cloud AI customers. 
To execute our broad AI strategy and significantly accelerate this key part of our business, we brought together multiple AI teams from across the company into a single organization under Victor Peng. The new AI group has responsibility for owning our end-to-end AI hardware strategy and driving development of a complete software ecosystem, including optimized libraries, models and frameworks spanning our full product portfolio. 
Now turning to our client segment. Revenue declined 65% year-over-year to $739 million as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. As we stated on our last earnings call, we believe the first quarter was the bottom for our client processor business. We expanded our leadership desktop and notebook processor portfolio significantly in the quarter. In desktops, we launched the industry's fastest gaming processors with our Ryzen 7000 X3D series CPUs that combine our Zen 4 core with industry-leading 3D chiplet packaging technology. 
In mobile, the first notebooks powered by our Dragon Range CPUs launched to strong demand, with multiple third-party reviews highlighting how our 16-core Ryzen 9 7945HX CPU is now the fastest mobile processor available. We also ramped production of our Zen 4-based Phoenix Ryzen 7040 series CPUs in the first quarter for ultrathin and gaming notebooks to support the more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins on track to launch this year from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo. 
Looking at the year, we continue to expect the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023 to approximately 260 million units. Based on the strength of our product portfolio, we expect our client CPU sales to grow in the second quarter and in the seasonally stronger second half of the year. 
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $1.8 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was offset by lower gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for premium consoles remained strong following the holiday cycle. 
In gaming graphics, channel sell-through of our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs increased sequentially. We saw strong sales of our high-end Radeon 7900 XTX GPUs in the first quarter, and we're on track to expand our RDNA 3 GPU portfolio with the launch of new mainstream Radeon 7000 series GPUs this quarter. 
Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.6 billion. We saw strength across the majority of our embedded markets, led by increased demand from industrial, vision and health care, test and emulation, communications, aerospace and defense and automotive customers. Demand for our adaptive computing solutions continues to grow as industrial vision and health care customers actively work to add more advanced compute capabilities across their product lines. 
We also released new Vitis AI software libraries to enable advanced visualization and AI capabilities for our medical customers and launched our next-generation Kria platform that provides a turnkey solution to deploy our leadership adaptive computing capabilities for smart camera, industrial and machine vision applications. 
In communications, we saw strength with wired customers as new infrastructure design wins ramped into production. We also launched Zinc RF SoC products to accelerate 4G and 5G radio deployments in cost-sensitive markets and formed our first telco solutions lab to validate end-to-end solutions based on AMD CPU, adaptive SoCs, FPGAs, DPUs and software. 
In automotive, deployments of our adaptive silicon solutions for high-end ADAS and AI features grew in the quarter, highlighted by Subaru rolling out its AMD-based EyeSight 4 platform across their full range of vehicles. In addition, we expanded our embedded processor portfolio with the launches of Ryzen 5000 and EPYC 9000 embedded series processors with leadership performance and efficiency as we focus on growing share in the security, storage, edge server and networking markets. 
Looking more broadly across our Embedded business, we are making great progress in bringing together our expanded portfolio and scale to drive deeper engagements with our largest embedded customers. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our operational and financial performance in the first quarter. In the near term, we continue to see a mixed demand environment based on the uncertainties in the macro environment. Based on customer demand signals, we expect second quarter revenue will be flattish sequentially with growth in our client and data center segments, offset by modest declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments. 
We remain confident in our ability to grow in the second half of the year, driven by adoption of our Zen 4 product portfolio, improving demand trends in our client business and the early ramp of our Instinct MI300 accelerators for HPC and AI. 
Looking longer term, we have significant growth opportunities ahead based on successfully delivering our roadmaps and executing our strategic data center and embedded property priorities, led by accelerating adoption of our AI products. We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history. 
And as the recent interest in generative AI highlights,  bringing the benefits of large language models and other AI capabilities to cloud, edge and endpoints require significant increases in compute performance. AMD is very well positioned to capitalize on this increased demand to compute based on our broad portfolio of high-performance and adaptive compute engines, the deep relationships we have established with customers across a diverse set of large markets, and our expanding software capabilities. 
We are very excited about our opportunity in AI. This is our #1 strategic priority, and we are engaging deeply across our customer set to bring joint solutions to the market, led by our upcoming Instinct MI300 GPUs, Ryzen 7040 Series CPUs with Ryzen AI, Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, LVO V70 data center inference accelerators and Versal AI adaptive data center and edge SoCs. I look forward to sharing more about our AI progress over the coming quarters as we broaden our portfolio and grow the strategic part of our business. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?",1707,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, first quarter 2022 results included the only partial quarter financial results from the acquisition of Xilinx, which closed in February 2022. 
Revenue in the first quarter was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year as Embedded segment strength was offset by lower Client segment revenue. Gross margin was 50%, down 2.7 percentage points from a year ago, primarily impacted by Client segment performance. 
Operating expenses were $1.6 billion, increasing 18% year-over-year, primarily due to inclusion of a full quarter of expenses from Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $739 million year-over-year, and the operating margin was 21%. Interest expense, taxes and other was $128 million. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.60 due to better-than-expected revenue and operating expenses. 
Now turning to our reportable segment for the first quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, flat year-over-year, driven primarily by higher sales of EPYC processors to cloud customers, offset by lower enterprise server processor sales. 
Data Center segment operating income was $148 million or 11% of revenue compared to $427 million or 33% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to product mix and increased R&D investments to address large opportunities ahead of us. 
Client segment revenue was $739 million, down 65% year-over-year as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. We expect an improvement in second quarter Client segment revenue and a seasonally stronger second half. Client segment operating loss was $172 million compared to operating income of $692 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue. 
Gaming segment revenue was $1.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Semi customer revenue grew double-digit percentage year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming segment operating income was $314 million or 18% of revenue compared to $358 million or 19% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower gaming graphics revenue. 
Embedded segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up $967 million year-over-year, primarily due to full quarter of Xilinx revenue and the strong performance across multiple end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $798 million or 51% of revenue compared to $277 million or 46% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Xilinx. 
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $486 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong financial model despite the mixed demand environment. Free cash flow was $328 million. In the first quarter, we increased the inventory by $464 million, primarily in anticipation of the ramp of new Data Center and Client product in advanced process node. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and such short-term investment were $5.9 billion, and we returned $241 million to shareholders through share repurchases. We have a $6.3 billion in remaining authorization for share repurchases. In summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the AMD team executed very well, delivering better-than-expected top line revenue and earnings. 
Now turning to our second quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 19% year-over-year and approximately flat sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect the Client, Gaming and the Data Center segments to decline, partially offset by Embedded segment growth. Sequentially, we expect Client and Data Center segment growth to be offset by modest Gaming and Embedded segment declines. 
In addition, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion. Effective tax rate to be 13%. And the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. 
In closing, I'm pleased with our strong top line and bottom line execution. We have a very strong financial model, and we'll continue to invest in our long-term strategic priorities, including accelerating our AI offerings to drive sustainable value creation over the long term.

And I'm curious, what is your confidence and visibility and some of the assumptions that go into that view? 
Is it -- do you think there is a much bigger ramp in the new products? Is it enterprise recovery? Is it pricing? So just give us a sense for how we should think about the confidence and visibility of the strong ramp that is implied in your second half Data Center outlook?",109,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So Vivek, thanks for the question. Maybe let me give you some context on what's going on in the Data Center right now. First of all, we have said that it's a mixed environment in the Data Center. So the first half of the year, there are some of the larger cloud customers that are working through some inventory and optimization as well as a weaker enterprise. 
As we go into the second half of the year, we see a couple of things. First, our roadmap is very strong. So the feedback that we're getting working with our customers on Genoa, it's ramping well. It is very differentiated in terms of TCO and overall performance. So we think it's very well positioned. Much of the work that we've done in the first half of the year -- in the first quarter and here in the second quarter is to ensure that we complete all of that work such that we can ramp across a broader set of workloads as we go into the second half of the year. 
And then I would say, from an overall market standpoint, I think enterprise will still be mixed with the notion that we expect some improvement. It depends a little bit on the macro situation. And then as we go into the second half of the year, in addition to Genoa, we're also ramping Bergamo. So that's on track to launch here in the second quarter, it will ramp in the second half of the year. And then as we get towards the end of the year, we also have our GPU ramp of MI300. So with that, we start the ramp in the fourth quarter of our supercomputing wins as well as our early cloud AI wins. So those are all the factors. Of course, we'll have to see how the year plays out, but we feel very good about how we're positioned from an overall product and roadmap standpoint for Data Center.",332,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And for my follow-up, Lisa, how do you see the market share evolve in the Data Center in the second half? Do you think that the competitive gap between you and your competitors' products, has that narrowed?

Well, I mean, we've gained share nicely over the last 4 years. When you look at our Data Center progression, it's actually been pretty steady. As we go into the second half of this year, I think we continue to believe that we have a very strong competitive position. So we do think that positions us well to gain share. 
In the conversations that we're having with customers, I think they're enthusiastic about Zen 4 and what it can bring into cloud workloads as well as enterprise workloads. I think actually Genoa is extremely well positioned for enterprise where we have been underrepresented. So we feel good about the roadmap. I mean, obviously, it's competitive, but we feel very good about our ability to continue to gain share.",131,8.0,5.0,0.9444444444444444,0.5

So first, thanks for the question. I mean I think the Embedded business has performed extremely well over the last 4 or 5 quarters. Q1 was another record for the Embedded business. When we look underneath it, there is a broad set of market segments that we have exposure to, and the majority of them are actually doing very well.
Our thought process for sort of modest decline into Q2 is that we did have a bunch of backlog that we're in the process of clearing and that backlog will clear in Q2, and then we expect that the growth will moderate a bit. We still very much like the positioning of sort of our aerospace and defense, our industrial, our test and emulation business, our automotive business. We expect wireless trends to be a little bit weaker as well as consumer trends. So those are the kind of the puts and takes in the market.

Thank you for the question. Our gross margin is primarily driven by mix. If you look at the first half -- first quarter performance and second quarter guide, we are very pleased with the strong gross margin performance in both the Data Center and the Embedded segment. We haven't been seeing headwinds from the Client segment impacting our gross margin. 
Going to the second half, we do expect gross margin improvement because Data Center is going up and the Embedded continue to be relatively strong. The pace of our improvement in the second half actually will be largely dependent on the Client segment. We think the Client segment gross margin is also going to improve. But overall, it's going to be below corporate average. So the pace of improvement of gross margin could be dependent on the pace for the Client business recovery in second half. But in the longer term, right, when we look at our business opportunities, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center and Embedded segment.

I guess the first question going back on just like the cadence of the server CPU cycle with Genoa and Bergamo. And I think it's great to hear that you guys are on track to launch Bergamo here. But there's been some discussion here throughout this last quarter around some DDR5 challenges. I think there's PMEC issues. I'm just curious of how you -- if those issues have presented themselves or how you would characterize the cadence of the ramp cycle of Genoa at this point?,92,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Sure, Aaron. So yes, look, I think Genoa, we always said, as we launched it, that it would be a little bit more of a longer transition compared to Milan because it is a new platform. So it is the new DDR5, it's PCI Gen 5. And for many of our top customers, they're also doing other things other than upgrading the CPUs. 
So from that standpoint, I would say the ramp is going about as we expected. We've seen a lot of interest, a lot of customer engineering work that we're doing together in the data centers with our customers. We feel great about the set of workloads and we see expansion in the workloads going forward. So overall, our expectation is, particularly as we go into the second half, we'll see Genoa ramp more broadly. But Genoa and Milan are going to coexist throughout the year, just given sort of the breadth of platforms that we have.",160,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

Sure, Aaron. So back to the DDR5 question, we haven't seen anything specific on DDR5. And it's just normal platform bring up that we're seeing. Now as it relates to your question about MI300, look, we're really excited about the AI opportunity. I think that is success for us, is having a significant part of the AI overall opportunity. AI for us is broader than cloud. I mean it also includes what we're doing in Client and Embedded. But specifically, as it relates to MI300, MI300 is actually very well positioned for both HPC sort of supercomputing workloads as well as for AI workloads.  
And with the recent interest in generative AI, I would say the pipeline for MI300 has expanded considerably here over the last few months, and we're excited about that. We're putting a lot more resources. I mentioned on the prepared remarks, the work that we're doing, sort of taking our Xilinx and sort of the overall AMD AI efforts and collapsing them into 1 organization that's primarily to accelerate our AI software work as well as platform work. So success for MI300 is for sure, a significant part of sort of the growth in AI in the cloud. And I think we feel good about how we're positioned there.",214,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It occurs to me that a big percentage of your Data Center business, particularly in server in the second half of the year is going to be driven by U.S. hyperscale. 
And I guess my question is the level of visibility you have to unit volumes, to pricing, to timing of ramps. If you could walk us through that a little bit, given it's customer concentrated, I imagine you have some level of visibility. And you mentioned growth for the year in Data Center. If you could be a little bit more precise there, that's -- I understand there's market dynamics, but it's a bit of a big comment and folks have just pushed me to ask about quantifying the growth for the year.",165,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Matt, thanks for the question. So look, I think as we work with our largest cloud customers in the Data Center segment, particularly with our EPYC CPUs, we have very good conversations in terms of what their ramp plans are, what their qualification plans are, which workloads, which instances. So I feel that we have good visibility. Obviously, some of this is still dependent on overall macro situation and overall demand. But our view is that there is a lot of good progress in the Data Center. 
Now in terms of quantification, as I said, there's a lot of puts and takes. My view is that enterprise will improve as we go into the second half, and we're even seeing, I would say, some very early signs of some improvement in China as well. So our view is, I think, double-digit Data Center growth is what we currently see. And certainly, we would like to ramp Genoa and Bergamo as a large piece given the strength of those products, again we'd like to see them grow share here over the next couple of quarters.",185,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

For my follow-up question, I think in the prepared scripts, we're obviously undershipping sell-through to clear the channel in the Client business in the first half of the year. And I think the language that was used was seasonal improvements in the second half. So are you guys expecting to come back to shipping in line with sell-through, so to stop under-shipping demand?

So we've been undershipping sort of consumption in the Client business for about 3 quarters now. And certainly, our goal has been to normalize the inventory in the supply chain so that shipments would be closer to consumption. We expect that, that will happen in the second half of the year, and that's what the comment meant that we believe that there will be improvements in the overall inventory positioning. 
And then we also believe that the Client market is stabilizing. So Q1 was the bottom for our business as well as for the overall market. From what we see although it will be a gradual set of improvements, we do see that the overall market should be better in the second half of the year. We like our product portfolio a lot. I'm excited about having AI-enabled on our Ryzen 7000 series. And we have leadership notebook platforms with Dragon Range. Our desktop roadmap is also quite strong with our new launch of the Verizon 7000 X3D products. 
And so I think here in the second quarter, we'll still undership consumption a bit. And by the second half of the year, we should be more normalized between shipments and consumption, and we expect some seasonal improvement into the second half.",212,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think, Joe, this is a bit harder because every customer is different. What we're seeing is different customers are at a different place in their sort of overall cycle. But let me say it this way, though. I think we have good visibility with all of our large customers in terms of what they're trying to do for the quarter, for the year. Obviously, some of that will depend on how the macro plays out. But from our viewpoint, I think we're also going through a product transition between Milan and Genoa in some of these workloads. 
So if you put all those things into the conversation, that's why our comment was that we will -- we do believe that the second quarter will grow modestly and then there will be more growth in the second half of the year as it relates to the Data Center business. So there are lots of puts and takes, every customer is in a bit of a different cycle.

I would say, Joe, we've been at this for quite some time. So AI has been very much a strategic priority for AMD for quite some time. With MI250, we've actually made strong progress. We mentioned in the prepared remarks about some of the work that was done on the LUMI supercomputer with generative AI models. We've continued to do quite a bit of library optimization with MI250 and software optimization to really ensure that we could increase the overall performance and capabilities. 
MI300 looks really good. I think from everything that we see, the workloads have also changed a bit in terms of -- whereas a year ago, much of the conversation was primarily focused on training.

Thanks, Harlan. It's a great question. The Xilinx portfolio has done extremely well with us. Very strong, I would say, we continue to get more content attached to the FPGAs and the adaptive SoCs. We have seen the beginnings of good traction with the cross-selling and that is opportunity to take both Ryzen and EPYC CPUs into the broader embedded market. I think the customers are very open to that. I think we have a sales force and a go-to-market capability across this customer set that is very helpful for that. 
So I do believe that this is a long-term opportunity for us to continue to grow our Embedded business. And we've already seen some design wins as a result of the combination of the Xilinx portfolio and the AMD portfolio, and I think we'll see a lot more of that going forward.",144,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And the more -- the broader point is, I think we have a very complete IP portfolio across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, DPUs and a very capable semi-custom team. And so beyond hyperscalers, I think when we look at sort of higher volume opportunities, we think there are higher volume opportunities beyond game consoles, that there are custom opportunities available.

You guys have done a great job of increasing the benefits to your customers and being able to raise prices, pass along cost increases, those sorts of things. But the competitive intensity and the weakness in the market, at least currently seems to -- that it could work against that.

I think, Ross, what I would say is a couple of things. I think in the Data Center market, the pricing is relatively stable. And what that comes from is -- our goal is to add more capability, right? So it's a TCO equation where as we're going from Milan to Genoa, we are adding more cores, more performance. And the performance per dollar that we offer to our customers is one where it's advantageous for them to adopt our technologies and our solutions. So I expect that. 
I think in the Client business, given some of the inventory conditions in there, I think there's -- it's a more competitive environment. We're all -- from my standpoint, we're focused on normalizing the inventory levels. And with that normalization, the most important thing is to ensure that we get the shipments more in line with consumption because I think that's a healthier business environment overall. And then, again, it's back to product values, right?

I just wanted to know what you would describe as your competitive advantages? Everybody knows it's a market that's exploding right now. There's tons of demand. You guys have all the IP to be able to attack it. But there's a very large incumbent in that space as well. 
So when you think about what AMD can bring to the market, whether it's hardware, software, heterogeneity of the products you can bring, et cetera, what do you think is the core competitive advantage that can allow you to penetrate that market successfully?",104,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

There's a couple of aspects, Ross. And since we haven't yet announced MI300, all of the specifications will -- some of those will come over the coming quarters. MI300 is the first solution that has both the CPU and GPU together, and that has been very positive for the supercomputing market.
I think as it relates to generative AI, and we think we have a very strong value proposition from both a hardware and again, it's a performance per dollar conversation, I think there's a lot of demand in the market. And there's also -- I think given our deep customer relationships on the EPYC side, there's actually a lot of synergy between the customer set, between the EPYC CPUs and the sort of 300 GPU customers. 
So I think when we look at all these together, our view is that demand is strong for AI. And I think our position is also very strong given there are very, very few sort of products that can really satisfy these large language model sort of needs.

I think we have made significant progress, even over the last year in terms of our software capabilities. And the way you should think about our AI portfolio is it's really a broad AI portfolio across client sort of edge as well as cloud. And with that, I think the Xilinx team brings a lot of background and capability, especially in inference. We've added significant talent in our AI software as well. 
And the beauty of particularly the cloud opportunity is it's not that many customers, and it's not that many workloads. So when you have sort of very clear customer targets, we're working very, very closely with our customers on optimizing for a handful of workloads that generate significant volume. That gives us a very clear target for what winning is in the market. So we feel good about our opportunities in AI. And I'd like to say that it's a multiyear journey.

The way to think about it is if you look at our Q1 gross margins and the Q2 guide around 50%. And as you know, both our Data Center and Embedded have a very strong gross margin performance. And so what the headwinds that impact our gross margin is really PC client on the side, which, as we talked about, is we are shipping significantly under the consumption and also to digest inventory in the downstream supply chain. 
As you know, typically, that's the time you get a significant pressure on the ASP side and on the funding side, that's why our gross margin in the Client segment has been challenged. In second half, we know it's going to be normalized. That's very important fact is when you normalize the demand and the supply, and we continue to plan a very competitive environment, so don't get us wrong on that front. But it will be better because you are not digesting the inventory, the channel funding, everything, those kind of price reduction will be much less.

So the ASPs were down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis, if you're talking about the overall Client business. And what that is, is that's also the Client ASPs were higher in the first half of '22, if you just think about what the supply environment was or the demand environment was in that.

And then I just wanted to ask you on the Data Center business, the operating profit is down a ton sequentially. And you talked about enterprise being down, I think that's part of it. But it's a big drop, and it looks like gross margin probably is down a bunch, too. Can you just comment on why that drop in profitability in Data Center?",66,-7.0,5.0,0.1111111111111111,0.5

I think when you look at the year-over-year, you're absolutely right. Revenue is largely flattish, but operating margin dropped significantly. There are 2 major drivers. The first is that we have increased the investment significantly, especially in networking and AI. As you may recall, we closed the Pensando last May or June. So this is the full quarter for Pensando expenses versus last year. Plus we also increased GPU investment under AI investment. That's all under the Data Center bucket. 
Secondly, I mentioned about product mix. Lisa said year-over-year cloud sales grew double digits significantly and enterprise actually declined. So in Q1, our revenue in Data Center is heavily indexed to the cloud market versus last year in Q1. Typically, cloud gross margin is lower than enterprise. We do expect, even in Q2, it will be balanced -- more balanced and going forward, we do think the enterprise side will come back.",158,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

CPUs are used a lot for inference. Now where the demand is highest right now is for generative AI and large language model inferencing, you need GPUs to have the horsepower to train sort of the most sophisticated models. So I think those are the 2, as you say, crosscurrents. I think inference becomes a much more important workload just given the adoption rate of AI across the board.

So as we said earlier, we've done some really good work on MI250 with AI and large language models. The example that is public is what we've done with LUMI and the training of some of the Finnish models. We're doing quite a bit of work with large customers on MI300.

We executed well in the second quarter, launching multiple leadership products, significantly expanding our AI engagements and ramping our latest Zen 4 EPYC and Ryzen product families. 
Second quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. Sales were flat sequentially as client and data center segment growth was offset by expected declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments. AI customer engagements grew by more than 7x sequentially as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of instinct MI250 and MI300 hardware and software at scale.  
Looking at the second quarter business results. Data center segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 11% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Although market demand remains mixed, the fourth gen EPYC CPU adoption accelerated in the quarter with revenue nearly doubling sequentially as cloud providers expanded deployments to power their internal infrastructure and public instance offerings. In cloud, 30 new AMD instances launched in the second quarter with multiple Genoa instances announced by AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft and Oracle.  
Genoa delivers up to 1.9x more performance in enterprise and cloud applications and 1.8x more performance per watt than the competition, making it by far the industry's highest performance and most efficient server processor. As an example, AWS announced its M7a Genoa instance, which is the highest performance and best price performance, general purpose x86 instance they offer.  
In total, there are now more than 670 AMD-powered cloud instances publicly available. And we expect that number to grow 30% to nearly 900 by the end of the year, driven largely by new Genoa deployments. We also expanded our Zen 4 server product portfolio in the quarter with the launches of Bergamo and Genoa-X.  
Microsoft Azure announced the first Genoa-X HPC instances that offer more than 5x higher performance in technical computing workloads compared to their prior generation. With Bergamo, we delivered more than double the performance than competitive offerings for cloud-native applications while offering full x86 software compatibility.  
We were excited to be joined at our launch event by Meta, where they announced plans to deploy Bergamo broadly across their global data center infrastructure to power applications, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Looking ahead, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro and other large server providers are on track to begin launching their new Bergamo platforms in the third quarter.  
In enterprise, while macroeconomic uncertainty resulted in weaker demand year-over-year, sales of EPYC processors for enterprise servers grew sequentially as we closed multiple wins with large energy, technology, financial services and health care companies. Overall, pull from large enterprises continue to grow. For example, Banco do Brasil, BNP Paribas, Petronas, Uber and other large enterprises all adopted EPYC processors in the quarter, and SAP selected EPYC processors to power RISE with SAP applications hosted on Google Cloud.  
We expect EPYC revenue to grow by a double-digit percentage sequentially in the third quarter, led by the expanding 4th Zen EPYC CPU ramp. In addition, Ciena, our first EPYC processor optimized for leadership, edge server and telco infrastructure, is on track to launch this quarter.  
Turning to our broader data center business. In networking, the largest cloud providers expanded their adoption of Pensando DPUs in the quarter, highlighted by new deployments with Alibaba and Oracle Cloud. In supercomputing, EPYC and Instinct processors continue to be the solutions of choice for the most powerful supercomputers in the world, powering 121 of the fastest systems on the latest top 500 list and 7 of the 10 most efficient systems on the Green500 list.  
In AI, we made strong progress in the second quarter as we met key hardware and software milestones to address the growing customer pull for our data center AI solutions. Our AI strategy is focused on 3 areas: First, deliver a broad portfolio and multigeneration road map of leadership GPUs, CPUs and adaptive computing solutions for AI inferencing and training; second, extend the open and proven software platform we have established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and easily; and third, expand the deep and collaborative partnerships we have established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale.  
We delivered on all 3 fronts in the second quarter. On the software and partnership side, Hugging Face announced plans to optimize thousands of their models for AMD Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon Versal and Alveo platforms. To make it easier for developers to tap into the full performance and features of our AI hardware, we delivered a significant performance and feature update in our latest ROCm software and expanded support for AMD silicon across the leading frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX and technologies like OpenAI Triton.  
We are receiving positive feedback on the improvements and the new capabilities of our latest ROCm software stack from our AI customers and ecosystem partners. As an example, leading AI software company, MosaicML recently highlighted that our Instinct MI250 accelerator delivers competitive training performance with minimal or no changes to the underlying AI software.  
On the hardware side, we announced our new Instinct MI300X GPUs designed to be the world's most advanced accelerators for generative AI. MI300X combines our next-gen CDNA 3 architecture with the industry's largest memory footprint and fastest memory bandwidth. These are critical factors in AI inferencing performance.  
Customer interest in our Instinct MI300A and MI300X GPUs is very high. Engagements with top-tier cloud providers, large enterprises and numerous leading AI companies significantly expanded in the quarter. We are providing early system access and sampling both products with our lead AI, HPC and cloud customers now and remain on track to launch and ramp production in the fourth quarter.  
Turning to our client segment. Revenue declined 54% year-over-year to $1 billion. Client segment revenue increased 35% sequentially as Ryzen 7000 Series CPU sales grew significantly, led by the launches of new notebooks from the largest OEMs. We also launched new commercial offerings with our first Ryzen PRO notebook and desktop processors powered by our leadership Zen 4 architecture. More than 100 AMD-powered commercial PC platforms are on track to launch this year from HP, Lenovo and other leading OEMs as we grow this important part of our client business.  
We expect our client segment will grow in the seasonally stronger second half of the year based on the strength of our product portfolio and increased adoption of our Ryzen 7000 CPUs, including the ramp of our Ryzen 7040 mobile CPUs that deliver leadership performance and energy efficiency and are the industry's first x86 processors with a dedicated AI engine.  
Going forward, we see AI as a significant PC demand driver as Microsoft and other large software providers incorporate generative AI into their offerings. We are executing a multigenerational Ryzen AI processor road map, which, together with our ecosystem partners, will fundamentally change the PC experience.  
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was more than offset by lower gaming graphics sales. Sequentially, segment revenue declined 10%. The Semi-custom SoC sales were strong in the quarter as Microsoft and Sony had healthy console demand based on improved retail availability globally and the launches of new AAA games.  
In gaming graphics, we expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series in the second quarter with the launch of our mainstream RX 7600 cards for 1080p gaming. We are on track to further expand our RDNA 3 GPU offerings with the launch of new enthusiast class Radeon 7000 Series cards in the third quarter. 
Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 7% as solid demand with industrial vision and health care, automotive and broadcast customers was offset by softness with communications customers as some operators slowed their infrastructure upgrades.  
We expanded our leadership adaptive computing product portfolio in the quarter, launching our new Versal premium VP1902 adaptive SoC with advanced chiplet packaging, the industry's largest and most performing solution for emulating and verifying next-generation ASICs and SoCs.  
In the low end, we announced our Spartan Ultrascale+ FPGA family to address a new range of cost-optimized industrial, computer vision, health care and robotics applications. We also released enhanced versions of our Vivado and Vitis software platforms that make it easier for customers to develop highly performing applications for our Versal adaptive SoCs.  
Embedded CPU sales grew in the quarter with the launches of new AMD-powered security, storage and networking solutions from HPE, Fortinet and other leading vendors. Looking into the second half of the year, after delivering 6 quarters of very strong year-over-year growth, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline in the back half of the year as lead times normalize and some customers reduce their inventory levels. We continue to be very pleased with our embedded design win momentum and, in particular, the growing revenue synergy opportunities we see based on our combined adaptive and embedded processing product portfolio. 
In summary, we executed well in the quarter against our strategic priorities. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect the PC market to grow seasonally with more normalized inventory levels across the supply chain. In the data center market, we see a mixed environment as AI deployments are expanding. However, cloud customers continue optimizing their data center compute and enterprise customers remain cautious with new deployments.  
Against this backdrop, we expect strong growth driven by higher 4th Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processor sales and initial shipments of our Instinct MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter. Longer term, while we are still in the very early days of the new era of AI, it is clear that AI represents a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity for AMD across cloud, edge and an increasingly diverse number of intelligent end points.  
In the data center alone, we expect the market for AI accelerators to reach over $150 billion by 2027. We have increased our AI-related R&D, ecosystem enablement and go-to-market investments to capture a significant share of this emerging market. The strong progress we are making executing our AI road maps and the rapid pace at which we are expanding our ecosystem of AI hardware and software partners makes us very confident we can deliver leadership training and inference solutions powered by our Instinct, EPYC, Ryzen AI, Versal and Alveo platforms for our customers and partners.  
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our second quarter results and our outlook for Q3. Jean?",1750,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2023",2023-08-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3704.0,2988208.0,109473256.0,Presenter Speech,Jean Hu,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We are pleased with our second quarter results with revenue of $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.58. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 18% as growth in the Embedded segment revenue was more than offset primarily by lower client segment revenue. 
Revenue was flat compared to the first quarter as growth in both the client and the data center segments was offset by expected declines in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Gross margin was 50%, down approximately 4 percentage points from a year ago, primarily driven by lower client segment performance, partially offset by strong embedded segment performance.  
Operating expenses were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher R&D investments. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $940 million year-over-year, and the operating margin was 20%. Interest expense, taxes and other was $120 million. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.58 compared to $1.05 in the same period last year.  
EPS declined on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to client segment performance. Now turning to our reportable segments for the second quarter. Starting with the data center segment. Revenue was $1.3 billion, down 11% year-over-year mainly due to lower third-generation EPYC processor sales as enterprise demand was softer and the inventory levels were elevated at certain MDC customers.  
Data center revenue grew sequentially with strong sales of our fourth-generation EPYC processors, specifically Genoa, partially offset by decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Data Center segment operating income was $147 million or 11% of revenue compared to $472 million or 32% a year ago.  
Lower operating income was primarily due to lower revenue and increased R&D investment to support future growth. Client segment revenue was $998 million, down 54% year-over-year due to reduced process shipment resulting from a weaker PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain.  
On a sequential basis, revenue grew 35% as we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series processors and the PC market conditions improved. Client segment operating loss was $69 million compared to operating income of $676 million a year ago primarily due to lower revenue. We expect the client segment to return to profitability in the third quarter. Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Semi customer revenue grew year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue.  
On a sequential basis, gaming revenue declined 10%, in line with our expectations. Gaming segment operating income was $225 million or 14% of revenue compared to $187 million or 11% a year ago, primarily due to higher semi customer revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in the industrial, vision, health care, automotive, test and emulation market.    
On a sequential basis, Embedded segment revenue declined 7%, primarily due to weaker communication market demand. Embedded segment operating income was $757 million or 52% of revenue compared to $641 million or 51% a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. 
During the quarter, we generated $379 million in cash from operations. Free cash flow was $254 million. Inventory increased by $332 million to support the continued ramp of advanced technology products. We expect inventory to decline as we ship this product to customers in the second half of the year. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $6.3 billion. 
Now turning to our third quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 2.5% year-over-year and approximately 6.5% sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the client segment to be up, data center segment to be flattish and the Gaming and Embedded segments to decline. Sequentially, we expect the client and the data center segment to each grow by a double-digit percentage and the Gaming and Embedded segments to decline. 
Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.65 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. 
In closing, I'm pleased with our second quarter top line and bottom line execution. We expect our new product ramps across the data center and client segment to drive sequential growth into the third quarter. Importantly, our leadership product portfolio, data center and AI investment priorities and the financial strength position us well for long-term growth.

I guess Lisa, my first question is around the data center business. I think we're all, across the industry, observing a shift in workload and spending patterns like maybe we've arguably never seen. And your company is in a great position to participate on both sides of that on the CPU strength and, obviously, in the AI space. Last quarter, you had given us some metrics around potentially being able to grow your data center business by 50% in the second half of the year versus the first half. And maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about that milestone and the drivers of growth across CPU and accelerator for the back half.",125,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So you're absolutely right. It's a very dynamic market right now in the data center. We certainly see -- let me go through some of the pieces. 
So on the positive side, we certainly see that acceleration of AI demand. From our standpoint, we see it in a couple of ways. We have a number of design wins in AI deployments as sort of the CPU that goes with GPUs as well as other accelerators. So in the headnotes that we've seen that positive on the CPU side. We've also seen some strong interest in our MI250 accelerator, which is currently shipping right now. And we see very strong pull on the MI300 accelerators that are starting production in the fourth quarter. So those are the positive market dynamics as we go into the second half of the year. 
We also see some of the softer cloud spend that is happening outside of AI as some of the cloud vendors are optimizing sort of their CapEx. And enterprise, I would say, is still on the weaker side. But with all of that in place, we are expecting a large ramp in the second half for our data center business and weighted towards the fourth quarter. 
And we are still looking at a ZIP code of, let's call it, 50%, plus or minus, second half to first half. So it's a lot of -- it's a big ramp, but when we look at all the components, I think the customer pull is certainly there, and it's exciting to be in this part of the industry.",271,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Your company is aggressively trying to ramp both the hardware and the software side of the MI300 programs to support AI. There's been some conflicting reports as to whether all of those deployments are on time. I think you've, in the prepared script, said what you guys think about that. I guess my question is really around the software work and the hardware itself that you're doing with your lead customers. 
Maybe you could give a little bit about, I guess, firstly, how the customer feedback has been on the performance of the hardware itself. And secondly, how you think the software work you're doing with your lead customers will translate into other customer deployments as we work through next year.",134,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So if I give you just some color on sort of how the customer engagements are going, there's very strong customer interest across the board in our AI solutions. That includes, let's call it, multiple Tier 1 hyperscalers that we're engaged with. It includes some large enterprises  and it also includes sort of this new category of some of these AI-centric companies that are sort of very forward-looking in terms of how they're deploying and building AI solutions. 
So from that aperture, we made a lot of progress with our ROCm software stack. I'm actually -- there's a lot more to do, but I would say the progress that we've made has been significant. We're getting lots of feedback from those lead customers. 
We're seeing the benefits of the optimization. So working also on the higher level model framework, the work that we're doing with the PyTorch Foundation, the work that we're doing with ONNX, with Triton. And the key is we're getting significant real-time feedback from some of these lead customers. 
So we're learning at a very fast pace. In terms of the feedback on performance, a number of companies have now been able to look at MI250 across a broad range of workloads. And that's a good translation as you go to MI300, and the feedback has been quite positive. We have customers sampling either on our sort of lab systems, they're accessing the hardware or sampling in their labs. And I would say, so far, very positive. The pull is there. There's a lot of work to be done, but we feel very good about the progress of our overall AI solutions for the data center.",282,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Just kind of building on Matt's comments or questions. I just want to go back to kind of the implied revenue for the data center business for the back half of the year. Jean, I think last quarter, you had alluded to, for the full year, the expectation is still growing 10% or double digits, I should say, for the full year in the data center business. 
Just confirming that and I guess what I'm really trying to ask is, I guess, given the guidance of flat year-over-year growth in data center in 3Q, it would seem if my math is correct, you're implying a 50% or so increase sequentially into 4Q. I'm just trying to frame exactly how you're thinking about the cadence of what 4Q looks like underpinning that expectation.",133,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I think as Lisa just mentioned earlier, it's a very dynamic market. There are puts and takes. We have a tremendous strong momentum with our product portfolio, but there's continued softness in enterprise market and also cloud optimization is still ongoing. 
So overall on balance, we think year-over-year probably more like high single digit. It's a really strong ramp not only in Q3, right? Sequentially, it means double digit, strong double digit. And the Q4, of course, we're going to see continued sequential, strong ramp.",90,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

That's helpful, Jean. And then just kind of following up on that as well. I mean how are you guys -- how have you guys kind of managed through with that ramp in mind, the supply chain side?

So we have been really investing in our supply chain, sort of the data center growth is so strategic to us that this has been part of the strategy. So if you look at all aspects of the supply chain from the wafers to the back-end capacity to some of the specific components that you need to do something of the class of MI300. 
We've worked with the entire supply chain. We feel that we have ample supply for an aggressive ramp in the fourth quarter and into 2024. But this is certainly one of the areas that we spent quite a bit of time to ensure that we do have that confidence.",116,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I just wanted to follow up on sort of the Q3 to Q4 dynamic. And I do apologize if I missed this, but in the implied growth rate in data center in Q4, can you speak to what percentage of that is supercomputing? I think there's a big project that's slated to ship in Q4. And is there any contribution from the Instinct series outside of supercomputing as well? Or is it primarily your server CPU franchise?",88,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So as Jean Hu said, into the third quarter, we expect double-digit sequential growth in data center that's primarily EPYC. So that's primarily the Zen 4, let's call it, the combination of Genoa, Bergamo as that continues to ramp. 
As we go into the fourth quarter, there is an implied, a significant ramp in revenue. I think there are multiple components to that. So there is -- the server CPU side will continue to ramp as we see Zen 4 ramp. There is a sort of large, call it, lumpy supercomputer wins, so our El Capitan win will be in the fourth quarter, primarily with a little bit in the first quarter. 
And then we will have contribution from both MI300X going to large AI customers as they start their initial ramps as well as MI250s with a number of customers, who have now view that as a very good option for some of the workloads that are not necessarily the largest language models or the largest parameters, but let's call it more sort of the other AI workloads. So those are the components of the fourth quarter sort of implied growth, lots of pieces to it. But clearly, a big piece of it is the MI300 ramp.",215,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And then shifting gears a little bit, follow-up question on the client side. You talked about the business returning to profitability in Q3, which is great, but you're still well below where you were in '21 and '22 from an operating margin perspective. Can you speak to the competitive landscape in the client business? Is there a path back to call it, 20%, 30% operating margins there?

Maybe let me start and then maybe Jean can add some comments. So look, I think the PC business has been sort of very volatile over the last number of quarters from the pandemic highs to some of the inventory digestion that we were all dealing with. I can say that I'm pleased to say that I think the growth that we're seeing, that we saw here in the second quarter and that we see in the second half is the strength of our product portfolio. 
I think the Ryzen 7000 series is doing well. There's good customer pull. I think from a competitive dynamic standpoint, the business is always competitive, but we feel good about -- the most important thing that was a little bit of a drag on operating margins was the revenue being low as well as some of the -- we had a case where the sell-in was below consumption as we were normalizing inventory loads in the supply chain. 
As we get past that, what we see is, I think the client business continues to grow. We believe that client will grow into 2024 as well in terms of some of the cost initiatives we have been, let's call it, optimizing sort of the overall R&D footprint.

On the OpEx side, the team has done a great job during this process to really optimize the investment in client segment to be more efficient and effective. If you look at the overall company level, our OpEx has been largely flattish, but we are investing in AI, data center and strategic priorities we have, which generate a much higher return on investment. 
So we have optimized it. We feel pretty good about this level of operating expense to continue to invest in client segment. As Lisa mentioned, it's really about revenue. The model will leverage it to generate profitability. We should be able to get back to 20%.",110,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Thanks for the question, Harlan. Look, the enterprise business is very strategic to us. We feel that we're underrepresented.

So we're pleased to see the growth in the second quarter. We do believe that we're on a path to continue to grow into the second half of the year and beyond.

I mean Vivek, I don't know that I would go into quite that granularity. What we will say is the GPU sales in the first half of the year were very low. As we were sort of in a product transition timing as we go into the second half of the year, in particular, the fourth quarter, we'll have MI300 ramp. 
I think your number may be a little bit high in terms of the GPU sales. But overall, in general, I think our expectation is that, as Jean said, the data center business, given all of the market dynamics, we see it up high single digits year-on-year.

So I think maybe let me take a step back and just talk about sort of our investments in AI. So our investments in AI are very broad. And I know there's a lot of interest around data center, but I don't want us to lose track of the investments on the edge as well as in the client. 
But to your question on what is our value proposition in the data center. I think what we have shown is that we have a very strong capability with supercomputing, as you've mentioned. And then as you look at AI, there are many different types of AI, if you look across training and inference, sort of the larger language models and what drives some of the performance in there. 
When we look at MI300, MI300 is actually designed to be a highly flexible family of products that looks across all of these different segments. And in particular, where we've seen a lot of interest is in the sort of large language model inference. So MI300X has the highest memory bandwidth, has the highest memory capacity. 
And if you look at that inference workload, it's actually a very -- it's very dependent on those things. That being said, we also believe that we have a very strong value proposition in training as well when you look across those workloads and the investments that we're making, not just today but going forward, with our next-generation MI400 series and so on and so forth. 
We definitely believe that we have a very competitive and capable hardware road map. I think the discussion about AMD, frankly, has always been about the software road map. And we do see a bit of a change here on the software side. Number one, we've put a tremendous amount of resource on it. So bringing together our former Xilinx software team, together with AMD sort of base software team. We've dramatically increased the resources. 
And also, the focus has now been on sort of optimizing at these higher-level models. So if you think about the frameworks around PyTorch and Triton and ONNX, I think many of the new AI-centric companies are actually optimizing at a different level, and they're working very closely with us. 
So in this place where AI is tremendously exciting, I think there will be multiple winners, and we will be first to say that there are multiple winners. But we think our portfolio is actually fairly unique in the sense that we do have CPUs, GPUs. We have the accelerator technology with Ryzen AI on the PC side as well as in the Embedded side with our Xilinx portfolio. So I think it's a pretty broad and capable portfolio.",457,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And given the lumpiness of the El Capitan piece, what does that imply for the potential seasonality into Q1 as most of it rolls off?",66,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

So it is a large ramp, Stacy, into the fourth quarter. I think the largest piece of that is the MI300 ramp, but there is also a significant component that's just the EPYC processor ramp with, as I said, the Zen 4 portfolio. 
In terms of the lumpiness of the revenue and where it goes into 2024, let me give you kind of a few pieces. So I think there was a question earlier about how much of the MI300 revenue was AI-centric versus, let's call it, supercomputing-centric. The larger piece is supercomputing, but it's a meaningful revenue contribution from AI. 
As we go into 2024, our expectation is, again, let me go back to the customer interest on MI300X is very high. There are a number of customers that are looking to deploy as quickly as possible. So we would expect early deployments as we go into the first half of 2024. And then we would expect more volume in the second half of '24 as those things fully qualify. 
So it is going to be a little bit lumpy as we get through the next few quarters, but our visibility is such that there are multiple customers that are looking to deploy as soon as possible, and we're working very closely with them to do the co-engineering necessary to get them ramped.",226,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So my follow-up, just gross margins, you're coming up in the back end of the second. I mean they still kind of missed in the quarter.

I think the gross margin for us, the primary driver, as we discussed in the past, is really mix. And if you look at our guidance or outlook of Q3 gross margin of 51%, it's more than 1 percentage point improvement sequentially despite of a very significant headwind from Embedded business declining in Q3. 
So the data center and the client business are expected to grow double digits sequentially and provide a positive impact on the gross margin, which actually more than offset the headwind from Embedded business. So going into Q4, again, we're not guiding Q4 and it's going to depend on mix. 
I would say one thing is you will have a similar dynamics, right? Data centers, we expect to grow very significantly. At the same time, we're going to have the same headwind from Embedded business declining sequentially. So overall, we do expect the gross margin to improve from this level going forward.",157,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. So look, when I look at the Embedded business, I think we should start by remembering that we're coming off of 6 quarters of very strong growth. I mean this business has performed extremely well and very pleased with the overall momentum in the business. 
To your exact question of what we're seeing in the markets, we're actually seeing the core markets hold up pretty well. So let's call it, aerospace and defense, strong; industrial vision and health care strong; test and emulation is strong. We are seeing communications weakness. 
So that is the primary driver of the second half commentary. And there's also some inventory optimization, as you might expect, since our lead times have come down over the last several months. So in terms of ZIP code, I would say, think of it as double-digit down sequentially in the third quarter, and that's the current view that we have. But overall, the business has been extremely strong for us. So I think this is  an expected decline as we come off the cycle.",182,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

You said it's going to come down a bit as you ramp into the Q4. Obviously, you have a big Q4. Can you sort of shape that out for us?

I think as we ramp those product lines in Q3 and Q4, you will see inventory come down first in Q3 and in Q4, again. I think the inventory -- base of inventory probably will be around 110 to 120 days. 
The key thing is, right, is if you look at a lot of our product, they are like advanced process technology, 5 nanometer or 6. The manufacturing cycle tend to be long. So in the longer term, you should expect us from a days of inventory be more around 100 to 120 days versus traditionally like 80 days or 75 days.

So I mean if you kind of add up the units, the customer interest, I mean, you can easily get to several hundred thousand units, it seems to me, for the MI300X next year. So the question really is on the supply chain and particularly CoWoS. Do you think that's going to be a bottleneck for you? I know that they've been expanding capacity. I know you've been trying to procure more there. Can you sort of talk about that?

So I'm not going to comment on the exact units. But what I will say is that we've been focused on the supply chain for MI300 for quite some time. It is tight. There's no question that it's tight in the industry. However, we have sort of commitments for significant capacity across the entire supply chain. So CoWoS is one piece of it, high bandwidth memory is another piece of it and then just the general capacity requirements. 
And look, our goal is to make this a significant growth driver for AMD. I think it's a great market opportunity. We love the engagements with customers, and it's our responsibility to provide the supply for the demand. And so that's what we've been working on.",126,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So there were a lot of aspects to that question, Chris. So let me try to give you some framework here. I don't think we're ready to talk about timing yet of revenue numbers. What we will say is we do believe it's a multibillion-dollar opportunity. I think 2024 is a very important year for us. Ramping MI300 in multiple customers is sort of, over the next several quarters, is very important. 
I think I mentioned earlier in the Q&A that the customer interest is actually diverse, which is great. It includes sort of what you would expect in terms of the large Tier 1 hyperscalers. But I think the -- sort of these new class of sort of AI-focused companies have been working very closely with us. And then some of the large enterprises are also looking at ramping up their efforts. 
The performance that we see is strong. I think the large language model work that we've done, we've done a lot of it on MI250, and we've seen very good results. That's on both training as well as inference. I think as we go through MI300, again, the early results are strong. The -- for AI applications, what we're seeing now is MI300X, so let's call it the GPU-only version is the one that is sort of most prevalent in the AI customer engagements. 
But the MI300A actually, which is sort of where we have the CPU and the GPU more closely coupled together, is also of interest. So I think the key is, I think we've built a platform that does allow people to kind of choose what is best for the models and for the workload that they're trying to enable.

We're excited about Ciena. I think Ciena fits -- again, it's as you said, it's a niche that we haven't previously been focused on. I think our interactions with the telco suppliers are they're anxious to have Ciena be a part of their portfolio. Ciena is also one that we'll use for other edge applications or, let's call it, lower end applications that need the performance of Zen 4, but perhaps not the heavy platform that we have on the Gen 1 Bergamo.

Thanks, Chris. So I think for the -- let me just make sure I get the statement clear. So both MI300A and MI300X will be part of the ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year. For the AI-specific applications, we are more heavily weighted towards MI300X just given sort of the -- where the software is written. 
And to your question about gross margins at the corporate level, so you would -- we would expect that our AI business will be accretive to gross margins at the corporate level.

So maybe your question is, do we have other customers who are committed to MI300 other than El Cap? The answer is yes. We have a number of customers who are actually committed. And the way these things go, actually, it's not different, not very different than how a server ramp goes, right? 
I mean one starts with an initial deployment ensures that the software works, ensures that we have all of the reliability and capability in the data center and then they ramp from that. I will say the difference in AI deployments is I think customers are willing to go very quickly. 
There is sort of a desire and an agility because we all want to accelerate the amount of AI compute that's out there. And so the speed in which customers are engaged and customers are making decisions is actually faster than they would in sort of a normal sort of regular environment. And that's great.

And we've been building that sort of working model, that road map and that trust over the past 4 or 5 years. 
So I don't think there's any theoretical cap on AMD share. I would say, if we look today, there are multiple customers who have us deployed in their data centers at more than 50% share. And from our view, the place where we have perhaps been a bit more underrepresented is in the enterprise, and that's just a matter of sort of the breadth of enterprise customers and the breadth of enterprise software.

So that would take us to $150 billion market by the time you get to 2027. Now that's all accelerators in the data center. So that includes GPUs, that includes other ASICs and other accelerators. 
But I think we have an opportunity to address a large portion of that market. So that makes it a very clear priority for us. It's our #1 strategic priority. And we'll continue to work closely with our customers as they optimize between CPU and GPU spend.",172,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

We executed well in the third quarter, delivering strong top line and bottom line growth, achieving multiple milestones on our AI hardware and software road maps and significantly accelerating our momentum with customers for our AI solutions. In PCs, there are now more than 50 notebook designs powered by Ryzen AI in market, and we are working closely with Microsoft on the next generation of Windows that will take advantage of our on-chip AI Engine to enable the biggest advances in the Windows user experience in more than 20 years. 
In the Data Center, multiple large hyperscale customers committed to deploy Instinct MI300 accelerators, supported by our latest ROCm software suite and the growing adoption of an open hardware-agnostic software ecosystem. 
Looking at the third quarter financial results, revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $5.8 billion, driven by record server CPU revenue and strong Ryzen processor sales. 
Turning to the segment results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.6 billion was flat year-over-year and up 21% sequentially as solid demand for both 3rd and 4th Gen EPYC processor families resulted in record quarterly server processor revenue. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter as 4th Gen EPYC CPU revenue grew more than 50% sequentially, crossing over to represent a majority of our server processor revenue and unit shipments. 
In cloud, while the demand environment remained mixed in the quarter, EPYC CPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially as hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal workloads and public instances while optimizing their infrastructure spend. Nearly 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent and others, including multiple general instances that deliver leadership performance for general purpose, HPC, bare metal and memory optimized workloads. 
In Enterprise, while overall demand remained soft, we are seeing strong indications that the significant performance and TCO advantages of Genoa and our expanded go-to-market investments are paying off as enterprise revenue grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple new wins with leading automotive, aerospace, financial services, pharmaceutical and technology customers, and the number of Enterprise customers actively testing EPYC platforms on-prem increased significantly quarter-on-quarter. 
We also expanded our 4th Gen EPYC processor portfolio with the launch of our Siena processors that deliver leadership energy efficiency and performance for intelligent edge and telco applications. Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others launched new platforms that expand our EPYC CPU TAM to address telco, retail and manufacturing applications. With the launch of Siena, we now offer the industry's most performant and most energy-efficient portfolio of server processors across cloud, enterprise, technical, HPC and edge computing. 
I am very pleased with the momentum we have built for our EPYC CPU portfolio. We are building on this momentum with our next-gen Turin server processors based on our new Zen 5 core that delivers significant performance and efficiency gains. Turin is in the labs of our top customers and partners now, and customer feedback has been very strong and we're on track to launch in 2024. 
Looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, we made significant progress in our Data Center GPU business in the third quarter as the multiyear investments we have made in our hardware and software road maps resulted in significant customer traction for our next-generation Instinct MI300 accelerators and particularly our Instinct MI300X GPU that delivers leadership inferencing and training performance. 
On the hardware side, bring-up and validation of our MI300A and MI300X accelerators continue progressing to plan with performance now meeting or exceeding our expectations. Production shipments of Instinct MI300A APUs started earlier this month to support the El Capitan Exascale Supercomputer, and we are on track to begin production shipments of Instinct MI300x GPU accelerators to lead cloud and OEM customers in the coming weeks. 
On the software side, we further expanded our AI software ecosystem and made great progress enhancing the performance and features of our ROCm software in the quarter. In addition to ROCm being fully integrated into the mainline PyTorch and TensorFlow ecosystems, Hugging Face models are now regularly updated and validated to run on Instinct accelerators and other supported AMD AI hardware. AI start-up, Lamini, announced they achieved software parity with CUDA for LLMs running on Instinct MI250 GPUs, enabling enterprise customers to easily deploy production-ready LLMs fine-tuned for their specific data on Instinct MI250 GPUs with minimal code changes. 
We also strengthened our AI software capabilities with the strategic acquisitions of Mipsology and Nod.ai. Mipsology is a long-standing partner with proven expertise delivering AI software and solutions running on top of our adaptive SoCs for data center, edge and embedded markets. Nod.ai adds a highly experienced team with a track record of substantial contributions to open-source AI compilers and industry-leading software already used by many of the largest cloud enterprise and AI companies. Nod's compiler-based automation software can significantly accelerate the deployment of highly performant AI models optimized for our Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Versal and Radeon processors. 
Based on the rapid progress we are making with our AI road map execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter and exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue ramps throughout the year. This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at our December AI event. 
Turning to our Client segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year and 46% sequentially to $1.5 billion. Sales of our Ryzen 7000 processors featuring our industry-leading Ryzen AI on-chip accelerator, grew significantly in the quarter as inventory levels in the PC market normalized and demand began returning to seasonal patterns. Revenue for our latest-generation client CPUs powered by our Zen 4 core more than doubled sequentially as we saw strong demand for our Ryzen 7000 Series notebook and desktop processors that deliver both leadership energy efficiency and performance across a wide range of workloads. 
In commercial, we launched our first Threadripper PRO workstation CPUs based on our Zen 4 Core that deliver unmatched performance for multi-threaded professional design, rendering and simulation applications. Dell, HPE and Lenovo announced an expanded set of workstations powered by new Threadripper PRO processors as we focus on growing this margin-accretive portion of our client business. 
Looking forward, we are executing on a multiyear Ryzen AI road map to deliver leadership compute capabilities built on top of Microsoft's Windows software ecosystem to enable the new generation of AI PCs that will fundamentally redefine the computing experience over the coming years. 
Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $1.5 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Although semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections for this point in the console cycle, overall revenue for this console generation continues tracking significantly higher than the prior generation based on strong demand for Microsoft and Sony consoles. 
In Gaming Graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by increased demand in the channel. We expanded our Radeon 7000 series with the launch of new RX 7000 Series enthusiast desktop GPUs that offer leadership price performance for 1440p gamers. 
Turning to our Embedded segment. As we expected, revenue decreased 5% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 15% as lead times normalized and customers focused on reducing inventory levels. We expanded our leadership Versal SoC portfolio in the quarter with the launches of our first adaptive SoCs with on-chip HBM memory that deliver significant performance and efficiency for memory-bound data center, network, test and aerospace applications. We also announced our next-generation space-grade Versal SoC that integrates an enhanced AI Engine and is the industry's only solution that supports unlimited reprogramming during development and after deployment. 
For the fintech market, we launched our latest Alveo Accelerator card that delivers a 7x improvement in latency compared to our prior generation and has already been deployed by multiple trading firms in their ultra-low latency training platforms. Since closing our acquisition of Xilinx a little over 1.5 years ago, our Embedded business has grown significantly, driven by our leadership products. 
Looking ahead, based on our current visibility, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline sequentially as customers continue working through elevated inventory levels through the first half of 2024. Over the medium term, we see strong growth opportunities for our Embedded business based on our significant design win traction and our broad and differentiated portfolio of embedded FPGAs, CPUs, GPUs and adaptive SoCs that can address a larger portion of our customers' compute needs. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our third quarter financial results, driven by the significant acceleration of Zen 4 server and client processor sales. Looking at the next couple of quarters, we expect strong growth in our Data Center business, driven by both EPYC and Instinct processors. This growth will be partially offset by softening demand in our Embedded business and lower semi-custom revenue, given where we are in the console cycle. As the PC market returns to seasonal patterns, we believe we are well positioned to gain profitable share in the premium and commercial portions of the market based on the strength of our product offerings. 
We are focused on accelerating our leadership AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, executing on our hardware and software road maps and expanding our enterprise computing footprint. I look forward to sharing more details on our AI progress in a few weeks at our Together We Advance AI event. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our third quarter results and our outlook for Q4. Jean?",1640,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2023",2023-10-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3628.0,3019841.0,110337435.0,Presenter Speech,Jean Hu,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We delivered better-than-expected third quarter results with revenue of $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.70. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% as growth in the Client segment revenue was partially offset by lower Gaming and Embedded segment revenue. 
Revenue was up 8% sequentially, driven by growth in both the Client and the Data Center segment. Gross margin was 51%, up approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year primarily driven by stronger Client segment revenue and product mix. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher R&D investment to support our significant AI growth opportunity. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $141 million. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.70 compared to $0.67 in the same period last year. 
Now turning to our reportable segment. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in the EPYC processor sales was offset by a decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Data Center revenue grew 21% sequentially, primarily driven by strong sales of our 4th generation EPYC processors to both cloud and Enterprise customers. Data Center segment operating income was $306 million or 19% of revenue compared to $505 million or 31% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to increased R&D investment to support future AI revenue growth and product mix. 
Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen mobile processors. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 46% as PC market conditions continued to improve, and we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series to meet strong demand. Client segment operating income was $140 million or 10% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue and a disciplined OpEx management. We are pleased that the Client segment returned to profitability in the third quarter. 
Gaming segment revenue was $1.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by increase in Radeon GPU sales. On a sequential basis, Gaming segment revenue declined 5%, in line with our expectations as we are now in the fourth year of the console cycle. 
Gaming segment operating income was $208 million or 14% of revenue compared to $142 million or 9% a year ago, primarily driven by higher Radeon GPU revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower sales to the communication market. On a sequential basis, embedded segment revenue declined 15%, primarily due to inventory correction at customers in several end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $612 million or 49% of revenue compared to $635 million or 49% a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $421 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $297 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes, primarily due to previously deferred taxes from California disaster relief efforts made available by the IRS. Inventory decreased sequentially by $122 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. We returned $511 million to shareholders, repurchasing 4.8 million shares and we have $5.8 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the Data Center and the Client segments to be up by strong double-digit percentage, the Gaming segment to decline, given where we are in the console cycle, and the Embedded segment to decline due to additional softening of demand in the embedded market. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment to grow by strong double-digit percentage, Client segment revenue to increase and the Gaming and Embedded segment to decline by double-digit percentage. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.74 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. 
In closing, I'm pleased with our execution in the third quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue, gross margin and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, we expect to benefit from strong Data Center and Client momentum, driven by MI300 AI accelerated ramp and the strength of our high-performance leadership Zen 4 family of products despite lower sales in the Gaming segment and additional softening of demand in the embedded market. 
Looking ahead, the investment we are making in AI across our Data Center, Client, Gaming and the Embedded segment enable us to offer one of the best industry's broadest portfolio, targeting the most compelling opportunities and positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.",867,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

My first one is on the Data Center GPU business. You talked about '24 revenue potentially exceeding $2 billion. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color. What percentage of this is AI versus supercomputing your other applications? Within AI, maybe talk about the breadth of your customer lineup. And how should we think about which workloads you're addressing, again, within the context of AI? Is it primarily training or inference or both?",81,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2023 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2023",2023-10-31,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3628.0,3019841.0,110337439.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,7,"Great. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So look, we've made significant progress on the overall MI300 program. I think we're very happy with how the technical milestones look. And then also, we've made significant progress from a customer side. Your question as to how the revenue evolves, so the way to think about it is, in the fourth quarter, we said revenue would be approximately $400 million, and that's mostly HPC with some -- the start of our AI ramp. 
And then as we go into the first quarter, we actually expect revenue to be approximately similar in that $400 million range. And that will be mostly AI so with a very small piece being HPC. And as we go through 2024, we would expect revenue to continue to ramp quarterly, and again, it will be mostly AI. Within the AI space, we've had very good customer engagement across the board from hyperscalers to OEMs, Enterprise customers and some of the new AI start-ups that are out there. 
From a workload standpoint, we would expect MI300 to be on both training and inference workloads. We're very pleased with the inference performance on MI300, so especially for large language model inference, given some of our memory bandwidth and memory capacity. We think that's going to be a significant workload for us. But I think we would see a broad set of workloads as well as broad customer adoption.",237,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

You talked about Genoa growing really nicely in the quarter. I think you talked about both units and volume being bigger than its predecessor. Is the growth that you're seeing or the growth that you saw in Q3 and the growth that you're guiding to for Q4, is this primarily a function of share growth or are you actually seeing a pickup in the overall market? And I ask the question because, obviously, year-to-date, there's been a significant shift away from traditional compute to accelerated computing, but are you actually starting to see signs of stabilization or even improvement on the traditional compute side?",117,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So the way I would frame it is we're very pleased with our third quarter performance as it relates to EPYC overall. I think the 4th Gen EPYC, so that's Genoa Plus Bergamo actually ramped very nicely. We got to a crossover in the third quarter, which is a little bit ahead of what we had previously forecasted. 
And when I look underneath that, I would say with a strong growth in both cloud. Cloud was strong so strong double digits. The adoption is pretty broad across first-party and third-party workloads and new instances. And then on the enterprise side, we've also seen some nice growth across our OEMs. And so from the standpoint of, is it the market recovery or is it share gain? I think it's some of both. 
From a market standpoint, I would say it's still mixed. I think enterprise is still a little bit mixed depending on sort of which region from a macroeconomic standpoint. Cloud depends a bit on the customer set. But overall, I think we're pleased with the progress and the leadership of EPYC has ended up allowing us to grow substantially in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter.",201,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Jean, I think last quarter, you kind of endorsed the notion that your Data Center business would grow. I think it was in the high single-digit range. I think you started the year thinking like [ 10 ]. So I guess the question is, do you still see that kind of growth rate setup? And how has that $400 million evolved underneath of that? Has that -- was it $300 million now going to $400 million?

We will start, let's call it, more concentrated in cloud, sort of several large hyperscalers. But we're also very engaged across the enterprise and there's a lot of interest.

But just to help you with some of the color. As Lisa mentioned earlier, we said the Data Center GPU revenue will be flattish sequentially. That's the first thing, right? The mix will shift from El Capitan majority in Q4 to predominantly more for AI in Q1. So that -- because of the long lead time manufacturing cycle, we feel like it's going to be a similar level of revenue with the Data Center GPU.
But in general, if you look at our business, we do have a seasonality. Typically Q1, the Client business, server business, Gaming business seasonally is down. Of course, right now, we definitely have a little bit more than seasonality, given Embedded and the Gaming dynamics we are seeing right now. Server and Client typically were down sequentially, seasonally too. But overall, I think we are really focused on just execution.

And then a question, Lisa, on just this interplay between AI and traditional computing. It seems like especially when it relates to ASPs and units. Seems like server CPU makers are kind of holding the line on price per core. But at the same time, the cloud players are extending the depreciation and replacement cycle of traditional server CPUs. So I'm just curious to get your take. What do you think is the interplay between units and ASP, right?
If you were to take a snapshot of what you have seen in '23 and how it kind of informs you as you look at '24, that is it possible that maybe unit growth in servers is not that high but you are able to make up for it on the ASP side. So just give us some color on, one, what is happening to traditional computing deployments?

I think it's a good point, Vivek. So I mean, if I take a look at 2023, I think it's been a mixed environment, right? There was a good amount of, let's call it, caution in the overall server market. There was a bit of inventory digestion at some of the cloud guys and then some optimization going on with enterprise, again, somewhat mixed. I think as we go forward, we've returned to growth in the server CPU market. Within that realm, because these -- like for example, 4th Gen EPYC, somewhere between 96 and 128 cores. I mean, you just get a lot of compute for that.
So I do think there is the framework that unit growth may be more modest, but ASP growth, given the core count and the compute capability will contribute to overall growth. So from a traditional server CPU standpoint, I think we do see those trends. 2023 was a mixed environment and I think it improves as we go into 2024.",169,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So I think when we look at end markets, I think communications was weak in sort of last quarter and it certainly continues to be weak. We see 5G sort of CapEx just down overall. On the other market where we see a little bit of, let's call it, soft end market demand would be industrial and that's a little bit more geographic, so a little bit worse in Europe than in other geographies. 
The other end markets are actually relatively good. And what we just see is that inventory is high, just given where we were with lead times coming into the sort of through the pandemic and with the high demand that was out there. As the lead times have normalized, people are drawing down their inventories and they have an opportunity to do that, given the normalization. So from an overall standpoint, we think demand is solid.
And what we view is that we have a very strong portfolio in Embedded. We like sort of the combination of the, let's call it, the classic Xilinx portfolio together with the Embedded processing capabilities that we add. Customers have seen sort of that portfolio come together, and we've gotten some nice design win traction as a result of that.

We were building up for a holiday season that is a strong season for us overall.
When I think about the size of the market, I think from a consumption standpoint this year is probably somewhere like 250 million to 255 million units or so.

Thanks, Matt. I think it's an important point. What we're seeing with these AI systems is they are truly complicated when you think about putting all of these components together. We are certainly working very closely with our partners in putting together sort of the full system, CPU, GPUs as well as the networking capability.
Our Pensando acquisition has actually been really helpful in this area. I think we have a world-class team of experts in this area, and we're also partnered with some of the networking ecosystem overall. So going forward, I don't think we're going to sell full systems, let's call it, AMD-branded systems. We believe that there are others who are more set up for that.

Sequentially, gross margin if we, I guess, rewound the clock back to the beginning of the year and the Embedded segment would be down from the peak to where you're guiding the fourth quarter, maybe down by 1/3. I wouldn't have thought gross margin would have hung in as well and grown sequentially each quarter through the year. Obviously, Client margins got better.

Yes, there are a few puts and takes, especially in a mixed demand environment. So let me just comment on Q3 first. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion sequentially, 140 basis points. As you mentioned, the Embedded segment, revenue actually declined double digits sequentially.
There are 2 primary drivers. The first one is definitely Data Center grew 21% sequentially, which should provide a tailwind to our gross margin. Secondly, as we go through the inventory correction in PC market, we did encounter some headwinds in the Client segment gross margin. And in Q3, we saw very significant improvement with our client segment gross margin. I think going forward, the pace of Client segment improvement will moderate, but it will continue to drive incremental gross margin improvement in Client segment.
So that really is why we are able to drive sequential growth in Q3. And in Q4, I would say the major dynamics is with a very strong double-digit growth in Data Center business, we definitely have the tailwind, which more than offset the Embedded segment decline sequentially double digit again. I think going forward, it's really mix, primarily mix, is driving our gross margin, but we feel pretty good about second half next year when we can expand the Data Center significantly and especially Embedded segment start to recover, we should be able to drive more meaningful gross margin improvement in second half.",243,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think there's a couple of different things, Ross. I mean, if we start with, it's just a very capable product. The way it's designed from a chiplet standpoint, we have a very strong compute as well as memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In inference, in particular, that's very helpful. And the way to think about it is on these larger language models, you can't fit the model on 1 GPU. You actually need multiple GPUs.
And if you have more memory, you can actually use fewer GPUs to infer those models, and so it's very beneficial from a total cost of ownership standpoint. From a software standpoint, this has been perhaps the area where we've had to invest more and do more work. Our customers and partners are actually moving towards an area where they're more able to move across different hardware so really optimizing at the higher-level frameworks. And that's reducing the barrier of entry of sort of taking on a new solution.
And we're also talking very much about, going forward, what the road map is. It's very similar to our EPYC evolution.

Our team has done an absolutely great job in reallocating resources within our budget envelope to really invest in the most important areas in AI and the Data Center. We are actually in the planning process for 2024. I can comment on a very high level, given tremendous opportunities we have in AI and the Data Center, we definitely will increase both R&D investment and go-to-market investment to address those opportunities.
I think the way to think about it is our objective is to drive top line revenue growth much faster than OpEx growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth. And we also can leverage our operating model to really actually expand earnings much faster than revenue. That's really how we think about running the company and driving the operating margin expansion.",138,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

On the strategic side, as your key competitor is sort of getting their act together on the manufacturing technology and the nodes, would it not be feasible to think that their manufacturing cost could be significantly better, let's say, than that of yours? And so if that's the case down the line 1 year or 2 years out, I'm curious what kind of value-add offerings would AMD have to provide to a customer to keep the market share that you have in the server space, data center space and then keep that growing as well?",110,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

When we think about sort of the EPYC portfolio and what we've been able to build over the last few generations and what we have going forward with Zen 5 and beyond. Process technology is only one piece of the optimization. It's really about process technology, packaging. We're leading sort of the usage of chiplets and 2.5D and 3D integration and then when you go to architecture and design. So it's really the holistic product.
And from a pricing standpoint, actually, price is only one aspect of the conversation. Much of the conversation is on how much performance can you give me at what efficiency. So from a -- from an overall efficiency standpoint, I think we've developed fantastic products. We are working closely with our customers to ensure that we continue to evolve our overall portfolio. So I think from a value-added standpoint, it's providing the best TCO is what our customers are looking for, and that's where our road map is headed.
Going forward, I think having the CPU, the GPU, the FPGAs, the DPUs, I think it gives us actually a nice portfolio to really optimize not just on a single component basis but on sort of all of the different workloads that you need in the data center.",238,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

And then for my follow-up, a lot of folks that we talk to think that compute game is shifting completely from CPUs to GPUs. So it was actually very encouraging to hear you talk about your core EPYC CPUs and the traction that you're seeing with the new generation of CPUs. So I'm curious, if I was to ask you how you think the long-term growth prospects for the next, call it, 2 to 3 to 4 years are for your CPU business, not the GPU, the CPU business, I'm curious what the answer would be.",99,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So look, I'm a big believer and you need all types of compute in the data center, especially when you look at the diverse set of workloads. There's a lot of excitement around AI, and we are very much clear that, that is the #1 priority from a growth standpoint going forward. But the EPYC CPU business, we feel like we've consistently gained share throughout the last few years.
And even with that, we're still underrepresented in large portions of the market, right? We're underrepresented in enterprise. We've seen some nice sort of sequential growth and nice prospects there, but there's a lot more we can do in enterprise. And we're still underrepresented in cloud third-party workloads, which, again, it's a -- you have to sell through the cloud manufacturers. So I think overall, we feel good about our EPYC leadership and also our go-to-market efforts that will help us continue to grow that business in 2024 and beyond.",160,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

If you are going to grow Data Center 50% half over half and I assume Client is up sequentially, it implies Gaming and Embedded both likely down sequentially in the 20% range. I know you said double digits. But is that right? And if that is true, especially for Embedded, what does that mean going forward into next year? I know you said it's going to be weak in the first half. Does that mean -- I mean, is it stable at these levels or does it continue to decline through the first half until things stabilize? Just how do I think about that in the context of the guidance that you've given for Q4?",126,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Sure, Stacy. Let me take that and then Jean might add a few comments. So without getting very specific, I would say I think your comments about Data Center and Client are correct. And then from an Embedded and Gaming standpoint, we would say Embedded, think about it down similar levels sort of in the teens compared to sort of Q3 was down in the teens and Q4 will be down in the teens. And then Gaming, from a console standpoint, we do expect that to be down a bit more than that.
And then as we go into Q1, again without being -- there are lots of things that need to happen. We would expect that both gaming and embedded would be down into Q1 as well and sort of the other comments would be more around seasonality. Does that help?",143,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

For my follow-up, again, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So I know that they've been expanding through the year, but for the full year, they're actually down. And I get the mix things and everything else. But as I look into next year, like how do I think about this because it sounds like Embedded is going to be pretty weak next year. Client is what it is. Data Center is growing but it does feel like even if the GPUs are accretive, they're not accretive yet, and it's going to take them a while to get to be accretive.
Like how much do you think you can expand gross margins year-over-year like in '24 versus '23, given the trends that we have entering the year?",131,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

It's one of the worst down cycles during the last 3 decades. So during that kind of a down cycle, definitely, we had headwinds on gross margin side, on our Client business, which we have made significant progress in Q3 and Q4 in second half.
Going into next year, the mix primarily is the driver of our gross margin. The way to think about it is Data Center is going to be the largest incremental revenue contributor next year. And then [ with ] both Gaming and Embedded facing continued sequential decline, I think it's all about the mix. We do expect next year will improve gross margin versus 2023, especially second half.

Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So look, the way we think about ARM, ARM is a partner in many respects so we use ARM throughout parts of our portfolio. I think as it relates to PCs, x86 is still the majority of the volume in PCs. And if you think about sort of the ecosystem around x86 and Windows, I think it's been a very robust ecosystem.
What I'm most excited about in PCs is actually the AI PC. I think the AI PC opportunity is an opportunity to redefine what PCs are in terms of productivity tool and really sort of operating on sort of user data. And so I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward. And I think that's where the conversation is going to be about.
It's going to be less about what instructions that you're using and more about what experience are you delivering to customers. And from that standpoint, I think that we have a very exciting portfolio that I feel good about over the next couple of years.",200,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I mean, Chris, the way I think about sort of FPGAs and the data center, it's another compute element. We do use FPGAs or there are FPGAs in a number of the systems. I would say from a revenue contribution standpoint, it's still relatively small sort of in the near term. We have some design wins going forward that we would see that content grow but that won't be so much in 2024, that will be beyond that.
And part of our value proposition, I think, to our data center partners is, look, whatever compute element you need, whether it's CPUs or GPUs or FPGAs or DPUs or -- we have the ability to sort of bring those components together.
