32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-17-2010",2010-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3360.0,54669.0,4124319.0,Presenter Speech,Michael Hara,,Executives,1,"Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investors Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until February 24, 2010. And the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal 2011. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be duly reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended October 25, 2009, and the reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.All of our statements are made as of today, February 17, 2010, based on information available to us today and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to research market and market-shared numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website. One final note, we have announced the date of our Financial Analyst Day, which is set for April 7. With that, let's begin.GPU demand increased throughout the quarter with GeForce and Quadro revenues going to combine 22% quarter-on-quarter, and 97% over the same quarter a year ago. We were supply-constrained from the beginning to the end of the quarter and expect the condition to persist. We continue to invest to drive market growth at share gain. NVIDIA innovates around the basic PC platform to create differentiated solutions and experiences, and in GeForce, gives the PC great graphics for video games and multimedia.Quadro transforms the PC into a workstation for designers. Adding Tesla will turn the PC server into a supercomputer. ION brings snappy graphics and multimedia to netbooks. And Tegra is filling the mobile computing revolution. Each of our product lines enable a rich experience through architecture and ever-growing composition of software. Momentum for Tesla and CUDA continues at the strong pace ahead of the new Tesla 20. In November, CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation], Australia's premier supercomputer center officially opened a GPU supercomputing cluster. Researchers in Australia will use GPUs to address emerging science that challenges in astronomy, medical imaging and water resource management. The Tesla group also had its biggest show of the year this quarter at Supercomputing '09. The most significant news of Supercomputing '09 was the GPU cluster in Japan that won the prestigious Gordon Bell award. In the category of Price/Performance, a team led by Tsuyoshi Hamada of Nagasaki University, in collaboration with the researchers at the University of Bristol and RIKEN, conducted simulations used to study the evolution of star clusters with unprecedented efficiency. Supercomputing '09 was not a GPU conference, yet 12% of the papers presented and half of the posters used GPUs. 75 booths, which is one out of four featured CUDA, compared to 33 booths and one booth at SC08 and SC07 respectively. HPCwire Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards were presented at the conference, and NVIDIA received an unprecedented five awards.There are now approximately 3,500 CUDA citations on Google Scholar. Nearly 1,000 CUDA videos on YouTube, and 1,000 applications featured on CUDA Zone. Over 300 universities now teach CUDA, up from 40 just 18 months ago, that's a new university teaching CUDA every other day.For Notebook PCs, users face an impossible choice between performance and battery life. GPUs give the PC great graphics and snappiness, but consume more power. That's why we invented Optimus, a powerful combination of software and hardware innovations that provide the performance of discrete graphics while still delivering great battery life. Unlike earlier attempts at hybrid solutions, Optimus is seamless and transparent to the user. Notebookcheck reported, ""We are excited about Optimus, switchable graphic solution will finally grow up and offer to end-users in all laptop classes with distinct advantages."" Engadget stated, ""We've always thought switchable graphics made a lot of sense on laptops, and NVIDIA's new Optimus technology looks like it's going to bring it to the mainstream in a serious way.""Seven models are available now and we expect more than 50 systems will be available by summer. Optimus is unprecedented and unique to NVIDIA. We believe Optimus has the potential to expand the overall footprint for discrete GPUs by increasing the GPU attach rate in the Notebook segment.Mobile computing will be the next personal computer evolution and it's just at the beginning. This was clearly evident at this year's Consumer Electronics Show. The undeniable trend of computing is surely smaller and more mobile. CES will be coming out of that per tablets, and the perfect venue for us to unveil our next-generation Tegra mobile processor. It is the world's first processor for the mobile web, specifically designed for the high-resolution needs of tablets. Tegra combines lightning-quick browsing, streaming 1080p video and Flash 10.1 on acceleration with an immersive 3D user interface and days of battery life. The combination gives tablet access to the whole web, just as if you were at your desk. The entire Internet is an App Store when you have a native web experience. Facebook alone is hosting more than 500,000 applications. And uncompromised browsing experience is what makes Tegra so disruptive. For the typical consumer, a Tegra tablet will meet all of their computing needs in a more convenient form factor that's instant on, always connected and offer days of battery life. OEMs and carriers alike are equally excited about the potential of the tablet platform. NVIDIA, Motorola and Verizon privately demonstrated streaming 1080p video, highlighting the combined capabilities of Tegra and the Motorola 4G wireless modem operating over the Verizon LTE pre-commercial network. We have multiple Next Gen Tegra [Next Generation NVIDIA Tegra] design wins and tablets, smartbooks and smartphones with the first of these expected to ship in Q2. 3D stereo was the other big story at CES. 3D Blu-ray was everywhere and 3D TV is ubiquitous. ESPN announced the first 3D network. NVIDIA has been a pioneering force in 3D stereo, and this was clear at the show, where we took 3D Vision to the next level with 3D Vision Surround. 3D Vision Surround is the world's first consumer multi-display 3D solution. It allows user to expand 3D content across three high-definition monitors or projectors for a truly breathtaking and immersive gaming experience. 3D Vision is a great pit for high-end notebooks. ASUS launched its first 3D notebook at CES with more OEMs following suit in Q2. Over for 420 games now support NVIDIA 3D Vision. SLI defined high-end gaming and we believe that 3D stereo will do it again. We are very excited about Q1, Fermi is in production and we plan to launch many new GPU products in the coming months, but we'll save the details for later.  With that, let me handle the call over to David.",1228,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Q4 was another good quarter, driven by an improving PC market and better mix. Revenue was $982.5 million above guidance and up 9%, sequentially marking the fourth consecutive quarter of strong results. GAAP gross margin was 44.7%, significantly higher than guidance, GAAP OpEx was $304.4 million in line with guidance, and GAAP net income was $131.1 million or $0.23 per diluted share.The core GPU business had another strong quarter. Within that, our Desktop GPU business was up 19%, Notebook was up 27% and Workstation Graphics was up 25% in the quarter. Demand was strong but we were again, constrained by supply across the board.Gross margin improved sequentially as a result of several factors. Cost reductions due to yield improvements and reduced waste, favorable mix from our Professional business, better mix within the PC GPU business and increased revenues. Inventories at the end of the quarter were up 19% to $330.7 million. Inventory days on hand was 60 at the end of the quarter. Inventory in the channel remains low at around five weeks.Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.73 billion, up approximately $94 million from the third quarter. Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, revenues expected to be flat, constrained by supply. GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 44% to 45%. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be flat. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll now take questions.",249,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

The seasonality in the PC industry like Q1 is generally a down quarter. And if you look at what most companies have guided, they've guided down sequentially. We're guiding flat, and if we had a sufficient supply to support the ramps of the products that we're going into production with right now, we would guide further up. Our company is currently in a growth phase. There's new products in many new markets, as well as going into a new product generation. And so there's a lot of different reasons why we're expecting to grow. And our suppliers are working as hard as they can for us and their yields are improving.

It's probably on the order of a hundred million, a couple of hundred million dollars. But the big picture is that 40 nanometer supply is constrained for the world. You know that the market snapped back a lot more quickly than people expected in the beginning of the year. And it surely appears that Windows 7 is doing very well, and I think it surely appears on top of that, that GPU adoption is increasing. People are -- we've always believed that, as you know -- that we think that more and more people are enjoying their PC experience with GPUs, and more and more PC manufacturers recognize the benefits of adding GPU to their system. And so, we're seeing a pretty strong demand across the board whether it's Desktop PCs or Notebook PCs. We're seeing increased demand in our Workstation business. And on top of that, we're in the process of ramping a new architecture called Fermi that everybody is really excited about. And Fermi is going to sweep across GeForce, and our Quadro business and across our Tesla business. And so we just have a lot of growth drivers going right now and we can surely use more supply.",213,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But can you help us understand what the trajectory of that product by itself is? Or should we think of it as more being truly folded into the GPU in terms of forward revenues?",47,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

The first thing is that, MCP business was down quarter-to-quarter, and we're expecting it to grow quarter-to-quarter for Q1. And we're in the process of ramping, what is internally codenamed, MCP89, a 40 nanometer chipset which we're really excited about that. So next year, Chipset businesses is going to do nicely for us. On top of that, we have created two new technologies that overtime, will supplement the MCP business that we're transitioning out of. One of them is called the ION. ION will do for netbooks what GeForce does for PCs. We today have the, I think Acer announced today, while I'm pretty sure it's going to be announced today at the Mobile World Conference, our first second-generation ION design win. And so, my sense is that overtime, the Netbook market will segment just as the PC market has. There will be basic netbooks based on Atom, and then there will be premium netbooks that are designed to deliver the best possible experience and those, people are calling, ION netbooks. And so, we can capture 10%, 25% of that market place, a market that is currently 40 million units and also the fastest-growing segment in the PC industry that should -- ION should be a nice business for us. And then the second technology Mike was talking about earlier, called Optimus, is really a game changer for us. And it solves the single largest issue that has kept GPUs from growing further into the notebook marketplace and that's powered the station or battery life. And so Optimus allows us to automatically, completely, invisibly from the user to switch off to completely zero-power state, and consume absolutely no power when it is not in use. And whenever the user uses an application that can benefit from the GPU, we instantly turn on and the user never knows the difference. So you now have the best of battery life, as well as the benefits of a GPU, the performance of the GPU without any compromise. And so those two technologies, I think, not only will help us grow our opportunities in the marketplace and hopefully make up more than plenty to get the MCP business that will be planned a couple of years from now.",388,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Just on the gross margin, you've expanded it pretty nicely over the last few quarters. As I look at some of your new products such as Tesla and Tegra, Tesla ramping over the next few quarters. It seems like you have a nice tailwind with mix.

But as we've talked about previously, we expect our Quadro, our Tesla and our Tegra business to become a greater part of our mix overtime as those businesses ramp. Those three businesses all carry a gross margin that is above even our current corporate weighted average. And so, as those products ramp become a richer part of our mix, we would expect to see further lift in our gross margins. And we've indicated in the past that we expect Tegra to ramp substantially in the second half of the year. We would reiterate our belief of that and hopefully with that, we'd see some margin expansion with it.",128,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

My sense is that supply will remain constrained for at least the first half of the year. And as we ramp up further new products into the market place, I surely hope that the supply situation would be there to support it. In terms of pricing, we increasingly are shifting our focus towards products and markets where we have a great differentiation, and if you look at the products that we offer today in the mass market, GeForce, for example. Increasingly, CUDA brings unique capabilities to it. We're the only supplier of 3D stereo in the PC market. And 3D Vision only works with GeForce, and so we're increasingly developing capabilities that are very differentiated on top of our processor brands. And so hopefully, those differentiations will be valued in the marketplace and accordingly reward us with a price premium overtime.",161,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And so, I'll review the numbers again but my last look at the numbers, it was relatively stable. If anything on the Notebook side had increased just slightly as my recollection. And so, yes, there you go. So Chris just showed me some numbers on the Desktop side they were flat and on Notebook side, they were up about five points. So my guess is that people are increasingly recognizing the importance of the GPU. And there's so many things that you do now that the GPU adds value to. And the video game market is obviously still very large, the Online Game market is very, very large and people who are enjoying high-definition movies on their PC or just want snappy graphics, where two processors simply does a better job than one for their PCs. They're just increasingly recognizing the benefits of GPUs. The other thing is that in the consumer market, the GPU attach rate is just much higher and the Consumer segment is really the fastest-growing segment right now. And so, our sense is that the GPU attach rate is going to continue to grow. The separation between the integrated graphics whether it's on a chipset or on a CPU, integrated is integrated, that compares into a discrete GPU. In fact, the technology is growing further and further apart. The GPU is in fact, becoming more and more advanced relative to integrated graphics versus the previous years.

And I think as we talked about last quarter, our quarter, the quarter just ended was a 14-week quarter. And so, we had more expenses in that quarter than what we typically carry. We got it flat, because as you'll recall, last year we had a number of temporary cost reduction measures in place, which we're restoring. Some of those are which related to wage reductions and so forth, that a lot of our employees were carrying. So those tended to offset one another. And as you see, we got it flat in Q1. I would expect that we would be roughly flat in the first half of the year, and we'll just have to wait and see how revenue shapes up for the second half. But I won't give any further guidance beyond that.",140,-2.0,4.0,0.3888888888888889,0.4

That channel inventory has been roughly stable throughout the year. It's been teetering in the three-to-four-week range. We had a one-week uptick in that in the fourth quarter, which is probably the first sign we've seen of any uptick in channel inventory now this year. While we still consider that pretty modest, it's certainly well below where it's has been historically. And as a result of even though it's low levels, we continue to have stock out situations, which we try to obviously avoid. So right now, I don't think we've got really any indicators that would tell us that we've got an inventory build going on either in the channel or even at the OEM companies that we sell to. So at some point, we know that supply will catch up with demand.

At the highest levels the last couple of years, we've invested in R&D pretty aggressively, and we invested in R&D and so that we could drive our top-line growth. And so if there's anything at all -- and because as we go into this year, we have so many new products, whether it's Tegra or the Fermi architecture or the Tesla product line or some exciting new products that we're planning for Quadro.

When you are talking about the supply constraints, you're saying that the order of the supply constraints, if you didn't have the supply constraints, you could've done another couple hundred million dollars in revenue. First question, did I hear that correctly? And second of all, can you help us understand a little bit, was that really just focused in GPU where you could've had that extra revenue? And can you help give us any color on who's not getting parts? Is it Notebook? Is it the channel?

Let me tell you what we do know. We knew that during the quarter, channel inventory was too low. When David said that channel inventory was five weeks average, in fact, means gap outs in many regions around the world. And you can only measure channel inventory, really, in the final analysis through its averages. But we know that certain regions are much hotter than other regions. And it's hard to keep them from stocking out. And the second thing is OEMs. Without exception, notebook OEMs were hand-to-mouth the whole quarter. And we were fighting hard to keep them from gapping out throughout the quarter, and we weren't successful most of the time.

So seasonality, I don't think is going to have a significant bearing on what revenue we're going to put up on the topline. Our top line is going to be more dictated by allocation than it is by a normal end-user seasonality. Second half is anyone's guess. If you look at the moving parts, it kind of boils down to this: Fermi is going to be a growth driver for us. We're in mass production now at Fermi. And Fermi not only ships into the GeForce market and brings incredible new capabilities to that market, Fermi also grows into two other markets. One is Tesla and OEMs are lined up and designing servers and high-performance Supercomputers dedicated to Tesla. Supercomputers are being built around the world, waiting for the new Tesla. And so as its Fermi architecture grows into new markets, it also creates new types of products for our Quadro family, and so those are the new growth drivers. So the Fermi architecture is really important to us. The second is 3D vision. 3D is going to be really big and it's going to redefine, as Mike says, what a gaming notebook is going to be, just as -- or gaming PCs are going to be. Just as highlighted, a few years ago, to find what a gaming PC is, 3D vision will now. And so you've already seen the Asus tech notebook. Acer has a product out, Dell has just announced their product today, and we're expecting 3D Vision to be adopted by nearly every PC OEM in the world. It will also be adopted by the workstation market. So 3D Vision is going to be important. And then lastly, Tegra is a brand-new product line for us. And so those are all the growth drivers. And then I think I said last time and I think this time, I would reinforce that statement that the MCP product line will do well this year. Although it's our last chipset for Intel processors, we're expecting MCP89 to be far, far superior to what you can get on an Arrandale or any integrated CPU from Intel today. And so we think we're going to see it do quite nicely.",383,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Is that because you are foregoing sales in this quarter in order to build the right inventory for next quarter? And then the question is just on the workstation side of the house, not withstanding your points made on Fermi just now, how sustainable do you think the workstation strength that you're seeing is, as we look beyond the current quarter?",81,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And so the back-end process includes sort and test, and with the complexity of the GPUs these days, requires quite a substantial battery of test to go along with it. So we just couldn't get it through the back-end to ship to customers. Customers were clamoring for parts all the way through the end of the quarters, so we'll ship it to them as soon as we can, we just couldn't get it through the back-end. Your second question is about workstation. I think the workstation market is going to continue to improve from this point forward. The vast majority of the world's industries held back on spending towards the latter part of the year before and the early part of this last year. And technology has really, really moved forward. And unless they invest in tools, unless they invest in computing, they really can't build products. And so the Quadro business has improved, quarter-on-quarter. I think it was some 20% or so. My guess is that, and it's still off of its historical highs. And this historical highs, I think is going to be ultimately beaten. We'll exceed that in some period of time, because back when we had the historical high about two years ago, I think a year and a half ago, before the recession, the end of the world wasn't nearly as globalized from an industrial design standpoint. China wasn't nearly as progressed from a design perspective. It was a manufacturing powerhouse, but now it's turned into a design power house as well. And so you're going to see that projects are being worked on by teams on that same project around the world. And so it'd be people working in Europe, working with engineers in the United States, working with engineers in China. And to do that, you'll have to use the same database, and you have to use the same architecture. And so my belief is that the workstation market is going to do quite nicely for the next several years.",369,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If you look at the last three quarters, we have opened each of the last three quarters with a fairly healthy shippable backlog at the start of each one. In fact, that has been at near-record levels, at least as far as I can tell. And that has helped significantly with linearity of product deliveries, linearity of collections, for example, et cetera. And has made our business a little bit more predictable than what it has been as well, because we've had less turns business to actually generate within the quarter.

And we're trying to finance it the best we possibly can. For the entry level products, the truth is that the new architectures, the very, very entry-level GPUs are probably not extremely well appreciated anyhow. And so the reasons why people buy the new architectures are tend to be early adopters and they tend to be game enthusiasts, or workstation designers or creative artists. I mean, there are very specific reasons why it really enhances their experience. Our current generation GPUs are fabulous at all of the things that mainstream consumers use the computer for. Although the high-definition videos even plays 3D Blu-ray, we're the only GPU that processes 3D Blu-ray completely in the GPU. All of them have CUDA and they're all compatible with the Fermi architecture. And now all of them have Optimus. Right, so I think the mainstream GPUs are really fabulous and have been enhanced recently with some really great features.

We're currently working on quite a few tablets, and some are tablets and some are tablets with keyboards. And there's all kinds of different form factors. There's 5-inch versions, there's 7-inch versions, there's 10-inch versions. And some are being created by computer companies, some are being created by consumer electronics companies, and some are being created by mobile companies. And everybody has a slightly different perspective on how do we take it to market. So I'm really excited about that. Today, I think it's just literally today, in Barcelona, Adobe and NVIDIA demonstrated the world's first interactive reader on a mobile device, and a magazine reader on a mobile device. And the Wired magazine demonstrated an interactive version of wired, and if you get a chance to see it on the Web, it's just really stunning, just completely stunning. The experience of reading a magazine that comes to life when you touch it on a Tegra tablet, it's just really something else. And so now we have the full Internet on Tegra, the Flash 10.1 is completely accelerated on our GPU, so the 100 million websites around the world now just work. You have multitasking, so you could read a magazine, close it, go look up something on the Web, close that and then come back to read your magazine, exactly where you left off.

And if you look at from August when we first started ramping to now, the yield improvement that they've done and the executions their teams have gone through is just fabulous. This is a really extraordinary company, and what they've done with 40 nanometer yields over the last several months is really fabulous. And so, if the trend continues, things are going to look a lot better. And so we're hoping for it to continue. We're working hard together to make it improve, and so I'm hoping that supply will abate.

And when we don't have very much inventory at all in the grand scheme of things, considering the velocity in our business. And so there's not much buffer and everything is hand-to-mouth.

First of all, I don't think, this is a record. And secondarily, it's not at the internal targets. Our business is increasingly moving from a great shift business to much more of a software-rich business. If you look at our Quadro business, it's nearly all software. The enormous R&D that we invest in Quadro and the technology we create for Quadro is all software. Because in the final analysis, it's still built on NVIDIA GPUs. So you see the same thing with GeForce now. The work that we did in 3D Vision, tons of software. The work that we did with 3D Blu-ray, tons of software. So the work that we do with CUDA, the work that we do with PhsyX, tons of software. So I think increasingly, that's going to become the nature of our business. Tesla is just all software, right? Software tools and software compilers, libraries, and these are profilers and debuggers. It's a software that's become increasingly a software-oriented type of business. And that's where our differentiation really is. And that's where NVIDIA has historically been really, really excellent. And so in order for us to differentiate the basic commodity PC platform and turn it into an extraordinary experience for gamers or scientists, or digital creators, or for clouds, or for netbooks, or for tablets, it's increasingly a software business. And so that's where a lot of our differentiation becomes. And I think if you think about our business from that perspective, our gross margin of the 44.7% that we had this quarter should be far from our expectations.",268,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

Because Q2 is going to be the quarter when Fermi is hitting full stride. And it won't be just one Fermi product, there'll be a couple of Fermi products spanning many different price ranges. But also the Fermi products will span GeForce and Quadro and Tesla. And so we're going to be hand-to-mouth on Fermi architecture products through Q2 and we're building a lot of it. And so I'm really excited about the upcoming launch of Fermi, and I think that it will more than offset the seasonality that we usually see in Q2. And then the question about Tegra, our focus on Tegra is initially on the markets where high resolution and snappy performance is really important. What NVIDIA is really great at is multimedia and great snappy performance, high-performance computing. And so, if you want a great experience with a touch tablet and the resolution is high, and it's in high def, choosing NVIDIA, choosing Tegra is really your best choice. And so we're going to focus our energy on the marketplaces, where we could add the most value. And initially, those are tablets. We're seeing a lot of over-the-top TV opportunities, and engaged in a few of those. And you also heard that Audi has standardized some NVIDIA graphics starting this year in America and then in year 2012 everywhere around the world. And we're just expanding from there. I think the Tegra opportunity is quite large for us, and we're just going to focus on where to start from where we have the most value for it.",273,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

One final note, our annual shareholders meeting is next week on May 19. For the first time, shareholders will be able to vote and ask questions online during the meeting, and please see our website for more information. With that, let's begin.
We are back in the high end of the Enthusiast segment. In April, we shipped our GeForce GTX 480 and 470 GPUs, the first products based on our next-generation CUDA GPU architecture code named Fermi. The GeForce GTX 40 and 470 GPUs were designed from the ground up to excel at tessellation, the defining the feature of DirectX 11.
Geometric fidelity is one of the most important new looks for the next-generation graphics. So instead of just being compatible with DX11, we created a DX11 tessellation monster. GTX 480 is 8x faster than the competition. Reception for the new GeForce 400 series amongst gamers and press has been phenomenal. Just last week, the GTX 480 was validated as the fastest GPU on the world when KIngpIn and Shamino, two world-class overclockers, used the 480 to break world records on the Futuremark 3DMark Vantage Hall of Fame. 
GTX 480 is DX11 done right. Bjorn3D stated, ""The GTX 400 lineup eats tessellation and ray tracing for breakfast, and has the advantage in every benchmark in game using those technologies so far as it's not a hard call."" Futurelooks.com wrote, ""There is no question that the NVIDIA GTX 480 is the king of tessellation. The GTX 400 series GPUs also provide a significant higher computational capability, which will allow game developers to increase the level of physx realism via our PhysX API. With our leadership position in DX11, combined with the incredible experience in the PhysX and 3D Vision provide, we expect to take back share in the Enthusiast segment. 
In the first quarter, we shipped a few hundred thousand units as yields have exceeded our expectations. The 480 and 470 are widely available worldwide and continue to sell out on a weekly basis. More importantly, being back in the Enthusiast segment is a positive driver of revenue and profitability growth. 
We began shipments of the new GeForce 320M integrated chips at the Apple for the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 320M delivers up to an 80% performance increase over the previous GeForce 9400M integrated chipset. In addition, the new 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro both come standing with the new GeForce GT 330M, the fastest graphics ever in a Mac notebook. In addition, the 15- and 17-inch notebooks come with switchable graphics. It's another powerful example of how switchable graphics is quickly becoming a standard requirement in notebooks.
We now have approximately 70 Optimus design wins, in which 11 are in production today and 50 are expected to be available in the market and ready for this year's back-to-school cycle. We continue to believe that Optimus has the potential to expand the market for discrete GPUs by increasing the GPU attach rate in notebooks.
Our Quadro business continues to recover and in fact, is ahead of where we anticipate it would be at this time. The recession delayed the upgrade in 2009, and with the significant enhancement made in both hardware and software within that timeframe, we believe it will drive a more aggressive upgrade cycle. 
For example, Adobe CS4 penetration was well behind CS3 due to the recession, creating meaningful pent-up demand for CS5. We are anticipating that the combination of a healthy upgrade cycle and the addition of new markets will take our Quadro business to a higher level of growth.
During the first quarter, we announced that the range of NVIDIA Quadro Professional graphics solutions are certified for Adobe, for Adobe Creative Suite 5 software, which provides realtime video editing and effects processing with Adobe Premiere Pro CS5. This version of Adobe Premiere Pro leverages the parallel processing architecture of NVIDIA GPUs via the new Adobe Mercury Playback Engine to allow users to create compelling, multi-layer projects and preview them in realtime.
Tesla achieve record revenue, and Q1 should be the first of many record quarters to come. Fermi has unlocked new demand for Tesla. We are experiencing heightened activity in a number of areas such as supercomputing, energy and finance. The most significant leading indicator of Tesla's long-term success is the adoption of Tesla as a standard OEM SKU. A number of OEMs including Supermicro, Apro, Tyan, Cray and Bull have already announced OEM servers with more Tier 1s to follow.
Finally, we achieved a major milestone this quarter. We completed and qualified our first commercially available smartphone. Today, Microsoft is shipping the industry's first phone based on Tegra. We are now the first PC technology company in history to cross the chasm from computing to mobile computing.
We continue to watch this space. We have multiple next-gen Tegra designs within smartphones and tablets coming which should be announced later this year. Our core profit drivers, high-end GPUs and professional solutions, are performing well. And with evidence from a number of key early indicators for our growth businesses discussed today, we continue to be optimistic of our prospects in 2010 and beyond.  
With that, let me turn the call over to David.",1158,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Q1 was another good quarter, driven by the ongoing recovery of enterprise spending, the shipment of Fermi-based products for desktop GPU and high-performance computing, new product ramps at Apple and a very strong notebook market.
Revenue was $1.0 billion, up 2% sequentially. Our GAAP gross margin was 45.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $309 million and GAAP net income was $137.6 million or $0.23 per diluted share.
The core GPU business was flat quarter-over-quarter. Supply constraints are finally easing. In particular, yields of our high-end, Fermi-based GPUs were much higher than expected, leading to good availability of our new GeForce GTX 480 and 470 GPUs and Tesla high-performance computing products.
Quadro grew strongly once again and is now approaching pre-recession levels. Tesla had a record quarter, which together with our Quadro business, contributed to higher overall gross margin in the quarter.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.76 billion, up $36.7 million from the fourth quarter.
Our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2011: Revenue is expected to be down seasonally, 3% to 5%; GAAP gross margin is expected to increase to 46% to 47%; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be flat; our tax rate of 12% to 14%, assuming a renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit and otherwise a tax rate of 14% to 16%.

You'll recall that back in the fourth quarter and earlier times of last fiscal year, when we were ramping other products and the 40 nanometer node, we had many challenges with yields and our ability to supply the market with adequate product. And we really hit kind of a turning point, somewhere at around the December, January timeframe where we began seeing predictable improvements, and those improvements continued throughout the first quarter. And this being the first quarter that we launched Fermi, those wafer starts were done some time ago is a time when margins weren't as good as what they actually wound up being. And so our margin progression wound up exceeding our expectations. A result of exceeding expectations, we wound up having more die available to sell. Now given that Fermi only launched in the last three, four weeks of the quarter, there's only so much capacity you've got in the line when you exceed expectations like that. And we ship everything we can get to the back end, and that contributed to certainly, the quarter on margins. And going forward, we expect Fermi to continue to be an important element of our product mix.

As it relates to the other elements and the seasonality you referred to, we experienced seasonality just like our competitors do in the industry, and we think our 3% or 5% down is consistent with what we typically experience. Now notwithstanding that, we're expecting Fermi to be very strong this quarter as we continue to ramp that product and actually have an opportunity to ship Fermi throughout the quarter, which we didn't obviously have the opportunities the last quarter.

And there's, obviously, in the overall larger market, there are some concern about seasonality. But we are ramping Fermi as we had talked about before, and the success of Fermi is certainly as we expected. So when you see how it plays out here, I mean these are a couple of the -- with respect to Q2, those are the two dynamics that you're looking at.

The China market is the fastest growing notebook PC market. It also happens to be the market where we have the highest adoption of discrete GPUs. We believe the reason for that is because the Chinese market is much more sensitive to reviews of products and they're much more -- the consumers scrutinize their purchasing decisions much more than elsewhere around the world, and they tend to be much more value conscious. I mean they will go out and buy what is the best performance per dollar versus what brand OEMs that it comes from. And so the GeForce adoption and the inclusion of GeForce is a huge factor for the Chinese market, and so we're seeing very good adoption in China. The GeForce brand is also really popular in China, and the reason for that is because the Chinese consumers spend a lot of time online, and video games is a big part of how they enjoy their computers. Video games and enjoying movies and multimedia is a big part of how people use PCs. And so that's probably the biggest factor for the growth of discrete GPUs. Now looking into the summer, we're expecting Optimus to be very successful. We've shipped, at this point, only a handful of Optimus notebooks and I think there are 70 or so projects in the pipeline, and we're expecting the vast majority of them to go into production for back to school. And so Optimus has turned out to have been a very big success for us because the value proposition is just so clear. You get the benefits of the longest possible battery life when you're using light computing and whenever you use it, whenever you would like performance from your PC, Optimus instantaneously turns on the GPU and gives you amazing performance. And so having that uncompromising benefit in the PC and the notebook for the very first time has really resonated with the marketplace.

Our first-generation strategy, we wanted to focus on one operating system. It was our new player in this marketplace, and we focused all of our energy around the Microsoft Zune and Microsoft Win Mobile [Microsoft Windows Mobile], and I'm delighted with what we were able to build. It demonstrates that NVIDIA has created an architecture that's extremely low power while being very high performance, and that we know how to build phone processors. It's a big deal. It took us a long time to figure it out, and it's been a long-term investment, and so the Microsoft 10 and the Zune HD are the results of that first generation. On the second generation, we were able to expand to focus a lot of our energy around Android. And although it made sense for the first-generation androids to use available phone processors, the follow-on generations of Android are really going to go after performance. And iPhones are out there, the iPhone 4G is coming, the iPad is obviously a revolutionary product. The bar is pretty high for all of the mobile players, and so they need a processor that can keep up with the A4. If not, be much better than what the A4 can do because they have to take on the leader in the space. And so I think the second-generation Tegra has been doing incredibly well because Android is doing incredibly well. So we're going to come to market with the second-generation Tegra with the third-generation Android. And so that's our focus now, which is the  -- and I think it comes together at the end of the year, and we've talked about smartphones, we've talked about tablets. We have a very large number of designs in pipe and flight, and so we're looking forward to starting in third quarter and fourth quarter, many design wins to show up in production.",323,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Basically, it's Qualcomm and TI, and they both make wonderful application processors. Our differentiation and our contribution to the space is where multimedia, high resolution, snappy graphics is really necessary. And the first-generation smartphones had pretty low resolution displays. And so snappy graphics and high-performance multimedia and high resolution just wasn't as much of an issue. But as you know, with iPad and next-generation smartphones, resolution's a huge issue, and you need to have very snappy graphics with a 10x7 display, if not even bigger by that, even higher resolution than that. You're just not going to do that with a application processor that's not designed for that.

And TSMC has done a fabulous job, improving the yields of 40 nanometer since August of last year when we first ramped it to now. The yield and the number of wafers that they're able to produce, compound it, has really helped a lot. And so I think that with respect to manufacturability of 40 nanometers, I think we're surely out of the woods. I think we can now officially say that. We are clearly out of the woods, and I think that's all David was trying to say. The 40 nanometers at TSMC is now a world-class node and the manufacturability of it is very, very good. And so we're delighted with the execution from TSMC and they've just done a fabulous job. With respect to overall capacity, with respect to supply, the challenge is that the more and more customers are getting into 40 nanometers as well. And so we certainly aren't swimming in 40 nanometers supply. I mean we are constrained here and there. I wish we had more Fermis. I wish we had more GPUs of all kinds. And so there is still not enough 40 nanometers supply for the entire world, and so I expect that the 40 nanometer supply will remain constrained for sometime.",226,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

The back-end cycle time, the amount of testing that we have to do for Fermi GPUs are longer than mainstream products because they're just much, much larger GPUs. The Fermi GPU, as you know, is some 3 billion transistors, and so there's a lot of testing to do in it. It takes longer to sort it. It takes longer to assemble it. It takes longer to test it. And then we do final system-level testing on the GPUs before we ship them. And so that entire back-end cycle time is many weeks. And so all of the dies that came out as we're ramping and you could imagine the curve on the ramp that we're ramping up right now, a lot of the die that came out of the fab we couldn't get through the back end before the end of the quarter, and so that's all part of inventory. Now of course we're ramping into a fresh new market and a fresh new product and there's a lot of pent-up demand, and so we just needed to keep the pressure on it and just keep cracking through it.",216,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

That's what we consistently stated and so forth. When you look at our expenses, there are some expenses we can control and there are some expenses we can't control. And as you look at our operating expenses in the second quarter and the fact they are, like you said, modestly up. It really was a result of two things that were really not largely in our control. One of which has to do with employee exercises of stock options, where we have to pay payroll taxes on those as they exercise them. The second had to do with legal expenses, which you just mentioned. As you know that we have a case going on between ourselves and Intel right now. That's certainly in full swing of depositions and so forth, which is driving -- and discovery, which is driving a significant amount of legal expenses. But also, you have to add on top of that the fact that the FTC has an investigation going on as well. And that investigation is entirely outside of our control, but yet we have to support with depositions and discovery and so forth. And so those are the two things that are really driving our expenses. And considering that we're roughly at the peak of this, we don't see it tailing off this next quarter, which is why we guided flat.",234,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

What we've tended to do is we tended to redeploy resources in other areas of our business where we have other needs, in such areas as Computing and Mobile and so fourth. As it relates to the vector of MCP in terms of how it's doing and so forth, we've combined that business with GPU organizationally and also financially. And we've indicated that over time, we expect the MCP business to go down, and we expect the Discrete business to go up, and that is progressing according to plan.

At this point, it's pretty clear to everybody just as the future of TV as 3D. The future of PCs is 3D. And so if you would like to have a gaming PC or a multimedia PC and it has 3D Blu-ray, certainly, it should come with 3D Vision or some 3D glasses that you can enjoy with.

But ultimately, NVIDIA's gross margins ought to be in the mid-50s to high 50s. That's really where we have to go, and the reason for that is because an increasing amount of our business is highly differentiated business where software, middleware and other peripherals are such a large part of it. And as we continue to grow our Quadro business, as we continue to grow our Tesla business, as we continue to grow our Tegra business, where software is just such a large part of it, my expectation is that, that the gross margins will continue to reflect that. For each one of the businesses that I just described, the gross margins are better than what we are as a corporate standard. 2/3 of our company's revenues come from businesses that I've just described, or profits come from businesses that I've just described even though it doesn't represent nearly that much of the total revenues. And so my sense is that over time, as those businesses grow, our margins ought to drift towards it. And mixed with mainstream GeForce business, which will continue to be competitive, I think that in overall average, north of 50% is logical for our company. And so we just have to get there. You know that, Arnab, we've been transforming our company step by step over the last three, four, five years. And moving away from just offering a vast chip to offering solutions and software that differentiates us and add a lot more value to our customers. Our 3D Vision, for example, that was just discussed, is a great example of that. It only works with GeForce, and so it brings a lot more value to GeForce. CUDA is another area of innovation, and it only works with GeForce. And so over time, between those kind of things and many, many examples that's related to Quadro and Tesla and Tegra, those value-added ideas that we bring to the marketplace will be valued, we'd hope.",347,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But I think some demand is perishable. I mean if you went to a PC store and you couldn't buy a PC, you bought probably something else or maybe you waited. But 40 nanometers was surely supply constrained, and we're still supply constrained in certain segments of that, of the 40-nanometer product line. But at the moment, we see the marketplace as being relatively balanced. And looking into Q2, parts of the market is going to be seasonal and parts of our business is going to be high growth.

And the notebook is a new growth area for Quadro because just as we do love to bring our work home with us, so do people who design things. And so whether it's video editing, which a lot of people, a lot of video artists love to do it on their laptops, or designing tennis shoes to cars, the ability to bring their work wherever they go is a very important capability for them. And so we see more and more people both having a Workstation on their desks at work as well as being able to take it with them in their notebook. And in the future, we're expecting the server to be a big part of our Workstation business as well, Quadro into servers, either in the form of with the display or Tesla into servers as they're remote rendering capability is the new growth opportunity for us. More and more people would like to put their work in the cloud, and to be able to share that work and collaborate with people all over the world. And so we see those two drivers to continue to grow the Quadro market.

The first one is GeForce, and that one is in large volume production now. We're ramping that very hard, and we've got a lot of ramping to do. Because we were late with Fermi, we were out of this marketplace for some six months to maybe eight months. And so there's a very large pent-up demand for high-end products out there. And so we need to grow that segment, go back into that segment as hard as we can. The second is Tesla, Fermi is used for GPUs as a server, and they're used for computational processors for supercomputers, oil and gas seismic analysis to financial risk calculations. And so that is also just had a record quarter, and our expectation is we'll have yet another record quarter. And then the third segment of Fermi is Quadro. Quadro is our workstation, our graphics solution, and it's used by people who create movies, make movies as well as design cars.

Good afternoon and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2011. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David White, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up question.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investors Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 19, 2010, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2011. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended May 2, 2010, and the reports we may file from time-to-time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All of our statements are made as of today, August 12, based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research.
With that, let's begin. Rapidly changing market conditions made Q2 a challenging quarter. We experienced softness in consumer PC demand in Europe and China, our largest GeForce regions. Weak consumer markets and the weak euro shifted demand away from the premium experienced PC segment that GeForce serves. At the end of Q1, we began selling our new Fermi-based GeForce GTX 480 and 470 GPUs into strong demand, and saw healthy in-channel sellout for GeForce products across our lineup.
We entered Q2 with high expectations. As the quarter progressed, rising memory costs and the weakness of the euro increased in-market prices of the graphics add-in cards. In addition, the growing economic concerns in Europe and China began to create pressure on discretionary spending. Because the discrete GPU attach rates in Europe and China are among the highest in the world, and our share in both these regions is also very high, these factors hit our Consumer business particularly hard.
Today, we also announced an additional charge to cover costs resulting from a weak die/packaging materials set and certain GPU and MCP products shipped before July 2008. This is the same issue we disclosed previously.  We provided more detail in the CFO commentary which we released prior to the call.
Although the end markets remain uncertain, we have exciting new products that can drive revenue and share growth. We are continuing to regain our GeForce consumer GPU leadership position across the entire product stack. The GTX 480 has claimed the top spot into the enthusiast segment. Our focus is now on the gamers’ sweet spot, the $199 performance segment.
In July, we launched the GTX 460. GTX 460 uses our second-generation Fermi architecture and delivers the perfect balance of price, performance and power, specifically for the $199 segment. The industry reviews underscore the 460’s unrivaled competitive position.
HardOCP [indiscernible] (16:20) site, “It performs admirably. It’s dead quiet. It sips power. It runs cool. And it over-clocks like a monster without voltage modification.” GameStar Hardware exclaimed, ""NVIDIA's back. The GTX 460 is fast, really fast, and at the same time, enjoyably quiet. It has much lower power consumption.""
HardOCP also wrote in a following report, ""If our earlier articles have not proved it yet, this one surely puts the final nail in the coffin. The GTX 460 1GB SLI real-world gaming performance is superior to even AMD’s fastest high-end single GPU video card in a CrossFireX configuration.""
A non-tech put it simply, ""NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 460, the $200 king."" GTX 460 is a showcase of the revolutionary Fermi architecture designed from the ground up for DX11. We are now ramping the rest of the Fermi GPUs from top to bottom and including notebooks and workstations.
At SIGGRAPH, we launched the era of computational visualization for designers, engineers, researchers and animators with the introduction of our Fermi-class Quadro GPUs and new NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro solution. Computational visualization combines the parallel competing power of the Fermi architecture with visualization to enable a breakthrough capability for designers.
Powered by our new Fermi-class Quadro, artists can create photo-realistic imageries for print ads, commercials and movies in minutes rather than hours. Car designers can simultaneously optimize a design for beauty, as well as for aerodynamics. The new family of Quadro GPUs deliver performance that is up to 5x faster for graphics, and up to 8x faster performance for computational simulation than our previous Quadro generation.
Fermi-class Quadro is the biggest discontinuity we've introduced since Quadro FX introduced geometry processing over 10 years ago. Our workstation partners: Dell, HP and Lenovo are all racing to engage new markets, as well as upgrading a large installed base of Quadro workstations.
Tesla achieved another record quarter and continues to make further inroads into our targeted verticals.  Last week, DARPA announced that NVIDIA has been awarded a $25 million research grant [indiscernible] (14:55) to address what the agency called, ""A crisis in computing.""  Today’s conventional computers are starting to hit practical limits, since they can only do so much computation given a certain amount of energy.
For DARPA to recognize that NVIDIA should take the lead to discover the computing architecture of the future is a recognition of the impact of GPU computing and of NVIDIA's contribution to computing. Under a four-year contract, the team plans to build a new class of exascale supercomputers that are 1,000x more powerful than today's supercomputers using similar amounts of energy. Our team includes Cray, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and several top universities. 
The enthusiasm for our upcoming GPU Technology Conference in September is another example of the momentum we are seeing behind GPU computing. Last year, we exceeded attendees’ expectations. This year, we have 4x the number of papers submitted, 3x the sponsorship levels and are expecting twice the number of registered attendees. Industry speakers will discuss the use of CUDA in fields ranging from cloud computing, computer vision, energy exploration, life sciences, medical imaging to finance.  It is very clear now that parallel computing has reached the tipping point and is accelerating the discovery in a broad range of important industries.
Finally, in one of our most important initiatives, we need to execute and help our Tegra customers shift to their next-generation smart phones, tablets, netbooks and cards. These devices will be the industry's to first offer Tegra’s dual core CPUs and HD-resolution graphics and video. We will begin production shipments for some of our customers’ key projects this quarter. We are in the home stretch.
Regaining GPU leadership and share, ramping Fermi-based Quadro, continued adoption of Tesla and shipping Tegra customers; these are the immediate growth opportunities we are focused on.
With that, let me turn the call over to David.",1243,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-12-2010",2010-08-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3532.0,76085.0,5525816.0,Presenter Speech,David White,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mike. Revenue was $811.2 million, down 19% sequentially. GAAP gross margins was 16.6%. GAAP OpEx was $309.5 million, and GAAP net loss was $141 million, or $0.25 per share.  Reflected in these results is the net charge of $193.9 million related to the weak die/packaging materials set. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes the net charge, was $20.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share.
GAAP gross margin of 16.6% for the second quarter was unfavorably impacted by two significant events: first, GAAP gross profit was impacted by the aforementioned charge; second, the market shift in our Consumer GPU business resulted in excess inventory of certain, primarily older-generation products. As a consequence, our second quarter results include charges for a large inventory write-down.  Excluding each of these items, gross margin would've exceeded our outlook.
The inventories at the end of the quarter were $434.2 million, up 11.9% over the prior quarter. Notwithstanding the inventory write-down, inventory was up as a result of lower actual revenue than was planned early in the first quarter when we made wafer start commitments. 
Our manufacturing cycle time is approximately four months. We made appropriate adjustments to our bill plans over the course of the second quarter, but we don’t expect these corrections to have a meaningful impact on our inventory levels until the fourth quarter. Net of the inventory write-down we took in the second quarter, we believe the inventory mix in our current pipeline is aligned with current market demand.  
Revenue for the GPU business was down 29.5% due to reasons discussed earlier.  We do not expect the market conditions to change dramatically, but we expect our competitive position to improve and regain some segment share.
We launched our new GTX 460 into the $199 performance segment, and it has received outstanding industry reviews and continues to sell well and gain share.
Revenue for our Quadro professional solutions and Tesla computing solutions represented 26.5% of total revenue and was up 13.4% over the prior quarter. Tesla achieved another record quarter.  Revenue for the Consumer Products business was up 46.5% over the first quarter; substantially all of the increase was attributable to Tegra.
Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were up $1.77 billion, up modestly from the first quarter. Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2011: Revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5%; GAAP gross margin is expected to increase to 46.5% to 47.5%; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $300 million; and our tax rate is of 17% to 19%.

And all of the growth that we talked about in Mike's previous comments are the ones that we're focused on. GeForce GTX 460 goes into a segment of the marketplace that's really about gamers. And gamers come out to buy new graphics cards when there are new great games. And this last month, we saw the launch of StarCraft II, which is arguably one of the most important video games in the entire PC industry, with some 12 million-plus gamers around the world. And StarCraft II, for all the people that are on the phone that knows about it, obviously hasn't been refreshed since 1998. I think that's over 12 years or something like that. And so the market has been extremely enthusiastic about it, and the sale-through has been really fabulous. And so I think this is a pretty good season for gaming graphics cards. And GTX 460 is really the best graphics card we've ever built for gamers in the history of our company. So that's one. The second one is Quadro Fermi. Fermi-based architecture Quadro is just ramping into production now. And the OEMs are really enthusiastic about it. The end users are clamoring for it, and so I think this is an opportunity for us to upgrade the installed base of Quadro workstations around the world with a revolutionary new architecture. Mike already talked about in his comments pretty substantial speed-ups from generation-to-generation. I don't think we've ever seen a 5x speed-up from one generation to another generation. So this is a very, very big deal. And then the third thing is Tesla. We had a record quarter in Tesla this last quarter. We’ve got some exciting new products that are going to ship into the marketplace imminently. And so I think this is a marketplace that is clamoring for more processing capability, and we're not seeing any effect from the consumer marketplace because of it.  And then the last part is Tegra. As you know, the most important and probably the fastest-growing computer market today is the smart phone and the tablet market. And Tegra is our entry into that. We're seeing customers trying to pry these chips out of our hands, and we've got to get these things shipped into production, and they’re really exciting new products. So those are the four areas where we’re confident to see growth: GTX 460, Fermi-based Quadro, Fermi-based Tesla and our Tegra SoC. With respect to gross margins, all of those products that I just mentioned are either at or above the corporate gross margins that David talked about.",440,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Given the uncertainty in Europe and China, and given to the fact that you're talking about attach rate for discrete graphics came down this quarter, and the exchange rate, what makes you confident that you can get the attach rates up or improve demand in those two key segments for you?",72,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

One GeForce market is the gamers, is the GeForce GTX market. They're not sold to OEMs, they're not really sold to system builders, they’re sold end users. Most of it is sold through e-tail or retail. The vast majority of it is sold as a retail-based add-in card. In a way, the way you can think about GeForce GTX is that it’s the game console within the PC. And what really drives the sales of that segment of the marketplace is games. There's another part of our GeForce business, the lower-end GeForce business that is sold to OEMs. The way that the OEMs think about GeForce in those markets is that it's the ultimate, if you will, or the premium – the ultimate upgrade or the premium-experience PCs. Every PC is built from either AMD or Intel CPUs and various integrated graphics. And if you wanted to create a product line with basic and competitively priced PC on the bottom and premium-experience PCs on top, the best way to do that is put a high-resolution display on it and then maybe you add 3D Blu-ray to it and you add a discrete GPU to it. And that's really how the vast majority of the PC OEMs, as you look around the world, differentiate their premium PCs from the commodity or the baseline PCs. And so if you look at that marketplace, that's what I think is uncertain, and we'll continue to assume that it’s uncertain until it's not. We saw it before everybody else did. And the reason for that is because we're in the high-end consumer PC segment. And as memory prices went up and as the euro got weak and the various end markets got soft, the first thing that people did was shifted down price and into integrated graphics. And then, of course, if the weakness persists, eventually the total number of units of PCs will decline, which is what people are starting to see now. And so I think we're taking a relatively conservative posture with respect to the PC OEM business. But the four businesses that I talked about just now, I think are businesses that we feel pretty good about.",372,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

We talk about these topics at every board meeting. And so the use of cash is a topic that comes up on a regular basis. And so we'll have that conversation again at the next board meeting and do the appropriate thing. With respect to seasonality we're, for the overall Consumer PC market, we’re taking a rather conservative posture about it. And we're assuming that what we saw before everybody else, this is, let’s see, we started seeing weaknesses in the end market probably starting in May, the May/June timeframe, late May, early June timeframe. And it's persisted since and I think other people are starting to see it across the board now. We're going to take a relatively conservative posture with respect to that segment of the market. The four businesses that we see growth in, we feel pretty good about. And they're not affected by the end consumer market. The vast majority of that is enterprise business. And although the Consumer GeForce business, or the GeForce GTX business has targeted gamers, what really drives the sales of that is great games. And it's hard to find a better game than StarCraft II to propel the upgrade of graphics cards for gamers. And then the last one, smart phone growth and tablet growth, that's the most important segment of the computer industry today, and it's a segment that we’re entering for the first time starting this last quarter in a small way, and then with this quarter, hopefully in a much larger way.",263,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And many people have subscription TV as well as premium content. The way that OnLive works is fabulous, and we're wonderful partners with them. What you see in the servers is a bunch of GeForces. And so we're excited about the work that they’re doing. We're excited about getting video games to a larger number of people and making video games much more accessible. So all-in-all, I think it's a fabulous development to have cloud-based GPU computing, if you will, emerge. But the services still needs to reach a much broader audience. Latency matters, and so as OnLive builds out their servers and server farms around the world over the course of the next several years or a decade, people still need to be able to enjoy games wherever they are. And so I think that's one factor. The other factor is not all games will be available from OnLive. StarCraft II, for example, is not, and WoW will likely not be. And so if you want to enjoy a broad range of games, having the ability to play the game on your local PC, as well as being able to serve it off the cloud is a wonderful way to enjoy more games. And so we're a huge proponent of it and we work closely with them to make the services as good as possible. And in the short term, what we see is a growth opportunity in putting GPUs into the cloud.",257,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The first case is obviously the U.S. government finding Intel to have practiced businesses and conducted itself in an improper way.

That's good for the entire ecosystem. It’s good for us It’s good for MD. It's good for customers, OEMs. It's ultimately good for consumers. Our case with Intel is not related to that and it's strictly related to a contract dispute related to, on the one hand, chipset license to us, and on the other hand, a cross-license to them.

The number of discrete GPUs in the marketplace was about the same. And so for the last several quarters, I don't believe -- I was shown some Mercury numbers which, unfortunately, doesn't account for our fiscal quarter versus AMD's calendar quarter. But anyways, the basic math here is still relatively the same, that the discrete GPU marketplace is – the number of discrete GPUs totally shipped is about the same from the last several quarters and our expectation is that it remains in the next several quarters. Notebooks is way up. Discrete GPUs for channel desktops was down. We believe that a lot of that has to do with the fact that DRAM prices had gone up. The euro had weakened, and so people have skewed down. And so looking forward, my expectation is that OEMs are going to continue to want to segment their PCs. And for the mainstream segment where the basic performance is what comes with integrated graphics, they'll continue to use integrated graphics. And for the premium segments, for the premium-experience PCs, they’ll want to add a discrete GPU to both differentiate that platform, as well as deliver a better experience. And so my expectation is that, that desire by the OEMs to differentiate, to segment, to offer a premium experience is not likely to go away. Sandy Bridge is going to increase integrated graphics performance, just as every generation they've been increased integrated graphics performance. And by the time that Sandy Bridge ships, there’s going to be some pretty fabulous discrete GPUs that ranges from the basic levels that we offer today to the high end. And so we'll see how it turns out, but my expectation is that the OEMs will continue to want to segment and differentiate their platforms.",310,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

With respect to market share, we probably lost a couple, 2 million, 3 million units, if you will, in market share. And that's a lot when you think about it that way. The vast majority, as you mentioned, above all of that is low-end discrete. The price of those GPUs are low teens, anywhere from $10 to call it, $12, $14. And the gross profit dollars on those devices are not extremely high. And so we know how to go win that business back. During the first quarter or so, because we're so constrained in supply and the market was so robust, we were reluctant to be too aggressive in capturing business that we wouldn't later be able to fill. As it turns out, as the market softened in the May timeframe and the June timeframe, that turned out to have been a bad decision. And so we're in pretty good posture now and we know how to go take share back in the low end. And so we’ll take some share back in the low end.

And so my expectation is that the workstation business is going to continue to grow. It's going to continue to grow for two reasons: one, more and more people are upgrading to Windows 7, and that upgrade process will affect workstations as well; the second reason is during this time, this last couple years, we've invested in expanding the reach of our workstation solutions. Whereas it was predominantly used for manufacturing in the past, our workstations are now used for broadcast workstations, for 3D television streaming, for postproduction, for video editing, medical imaging, gosh, the computational simulations of fluid dynamics, there's all kinds of things that our workstations are now being used for.

I think at this point, I think most of us believe that Europe in Q2 was soft, that the euro was weak, and that naturally would cause some skew downward. And China, they, reducing their stimulus to the economy have slowed down the market of it. Now, of course, our business is, we have a much larger exposure in Europe and China because our brand is so useful and so powerful to help the local OEMs enhance their brand. And also because consumers find video games and content much more appealing out in the other markets, I think that those are just incredibly important markets to us. And so our exposure is probably larger than theirs. Overall, I think that we’re just going to have to wait and see how their Q3s shake out for us to really know.",143,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

But there's nothing like great games. And to the extent that -- it's kind of hard to think about StarCraft II as a game. I really think of StarCraft II as an event. I mean this is a once-a-decade refresh to one of the most important video games of all time. I mean this is, StarCraft, as you know, is a cultural phenomenon in many countries. They watch StarCraft competition on TV. There's a StarCraft channel. There's StarCraft teams. So in many countries, StarCraft is just a very, very big deal. And so this is a very welcome upgrade and the game is absolutely beautiful and GTX 460 is perfect for it. And so my sense is that for the 12 million StarCraft players out there, there's some serious upgrading to do.

First of all, where people buy workstations and upgrade their workstations on the rhythm of the companies themselves. The automobile industry that uses CATIA [Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application], or the airplane industry, or the tennis shoes industry, they all upgrade on different cycles and they use different packages. And more and more industries are using digital approaches to prototype, or style, or simulate, just like we do. In your industry, you use computational finance. In my industry, we use EDA [Electronic Design Automation] simulations and EMI [External Machine Interface] simulations. And we use all kinds of simulations to predict the outcome of our product. And whether it's in design, or manufacturing, or advertising, or broadcast, or medicine, more and more people are using digital approaches to predict the outcome of their products. And so I think that the market is surely expanding. The other factor that's really exciting for us, and what's so great about Fermi Quadro is it's such a great discontinuity relative to anything that we've shipped before. I don't know that we've ever shipped a product that is 5x faster in the type of applications that it's used in from generation-to-generation. And so we're looking forward to upgrading the installed base in addition to the natural growth and the natural upgrade of the workstation market. So I'm really excited about Quadro and we're looking forward to seeing how it does in the marketplace. The OEMs are really excited about it as well. We have HP and Dell and Lenovo are geared up; Fujitsu seems all geared up to, these are our workstation partners, geared up to take Quadro Fermi to the market.",285,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

They cover things in terms of how we tape out products, how we kit prototypes for engineering test vehicles. It covers the minutia of things like travel and the things that are not very exciting. But we've been fairly diligent across the entire business, trying to figure out how do we reduce waste, how do we economize in terms of our expenses without naturally impacting our development plans and so forth. And going forward, right now and certainly in the environment we're in today, we don't see our attention on expenses abating anytime soon. We do have continued efforts in reducing cost. We also have cost pressures going in the other direction.

And this is something that the vast majority of our competition just no longer understands. People aren't buying our Quadro solution a chip at a time. They're trying to solve a problem and it could be that they're trying to ray trace a car so that they could see a photorealistic image of it while they're trading off various designs. It could be that the dataset is just absolutely enormous, and they need to have the scalability and the scalable solutions that we provide. It could be that somebody’s workstations needs to be virtualized and have a Windows NT on one or Linux on the other and both of them have to be accelerated. And the fact that we have the best software stack for both Linux as well as Windows in the world makes a huge difference. And so the list of reasons why people choose Quadro is quite deep.

And so the bar is pretty high and we're not seeing any significant competitive changes out there that we notice right now.",213,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

So I can't tell you other than from an aggregate standpoint that, generally, the trend has been down for the last three months. We expect it to go down again in the third quarter.

Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David White, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call up to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up question.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investors Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until November 18, 2010, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended August 1, 2010, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All of our statements are made as of today, November 11, 2010 based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. With that, let's begin.
We have restored our speed of execution. Since March, we've built seven new GPUs, all of which went to production with VeriSilicon. The Fermi architecture is now in every segment of our desktop, notebook and workstation product lines. We are seeing solid gains in our core GeForce and Quadro businesses and are recapturing our share. 
In the GeForce business, we have our extended our DX11 technology leadership and the results show. Our desktop standalone GPU share grew from 55% in Q2 to 59% in Q3. For budget-conscious gamers, we introduced the GeForce GTS 450, which is designed to deliver the most advanced GPU gaming experience to the important $99 add-in card segment. According to latest data from Steam, a broad survey partner used by PC gamers today, 56% of gamers play at resolutions between 1600 x 1050 and 1280 x 1024, resolutions for which the GTS 450 excels. The GTS 450 follows one of our most successful GPUs, the GTS 250. In October, we launched the GeForce GT 430. It is designed to deliver unparalleled experiences in photo and video editing, Blu-Ray 3D and the next generation of GPU-excel equipped browsers and web content. The GT 430 is targeted at $79 add-in card and is the perfect first upgrade from integrated graphics. 
And this week, we launched the GeForce GTX 580, the world's fastest DX11 GPU. The GTX 580 is based on the second generation of Fermi architecture engineered from the transition level up in just seven short months and raises the bar as the fastest and now quietest GPU of its class. The combination of the innovative vapor chamber thermal solution and new architectural enhancements increased power efficiency and performance over previous generations. The GTX 580 deliveries up to 35% more performance per watt and raw performance that is up to 30% greater than the GTX 480 it replaces. For DX11 games, the GTX 580 is up to 160% faster than the closest competitive product. For previous DX9 and 10 games, the GTX 580 is faster by up to 62%.
In notebooks, we launched during the quarter a complete family of GeForce 400M GPUs with Optimus Technology. Lenovo and Dell have already shipped and more OEMs will follow. With our new Fermi notebook GPUs, we have significantly increased our design win share. Starting in Q4, with the Fermi bridge ramp [ph] (18:32), we expect to take our notebooks share to our all-time highs. 
In our Quadro Professional business, the uptake of the Fermi architecture continued to be strong. In October, we launched Quadro 2000 midrange GPU and the Quadro 600 entry level GPU. These new professional graphics solutions for the computational and visualization benefits are the breakthrough Fermi architecture within reach of all engineers, designers and animators. The Quadro 2000 delivers 1.5 times the geometry performance of its predecessor, a dramatically higher performance across leading CAD and DCC applications such as SolidWorks and Autodesk 3ds Max.
The Quadro 600 is an economical half-height solution that features the industry's best performance per watt for applications such as Autodesk AutoCAD 2011. As OEMs and software ISPs complete their qualifications on these latest Quadro's, we believe we are tracking to historical peak revenue even in less robust economic conditions. 
The adoption of our Tesla supercomputer GPU continues to grow. Last month, that new Tianhe-1A supercomputer was revealed HPC 2010 China. It's capable of over 2.5 petaflops, making it the fastest computer in the world. The system is located at the National Supercomputer Center in the city of Tianjin. Tianhe-1A is powered by 7,000 Tesla M2050 GPUs. Had this system been built with CPUs alone, it would have required more than 50,000 CPUs, twice as much floor space and three times the electrical power to deliver the same performance. The difference in power consumption is enough to provide electricity for over 5,000 homes.
We are thrilled with [indiscernible] (20:10). Created in 1960s for naval military research, supercomputers were embraced by scientists to simulate models of the world. The creation of our Tesla parallel processing GPU has come at a time when companies in a wide range of industries are in desperate need of faster supercomputers to accelerate product development. Thom Dunning, who directs the NCSA and the Institute for Advanced Computing Applications and Technology at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign put it succinctly when he stated, ""What we are really seeing in the efforts in China, as well as the ones we have in the U.S., is that GPUs are what the future will look like. What we are seeing is the beginning of something that's going to be happening all over the world."" Supercomputing is no longer a niche. It's a huge growth business. 
Another highlight of the quarter was our second GPU Technology Conference held in mid-September. It was a huge success that underscores the momentum building around parallel computing. Leaders from national laboratories worldwide, as well as Fortune 500 companies, start ups and the universities presented more than 280 sessions to more than 2,000 attendees from over 40 countries. Compared with last year, we had five times the number of talk submissions and twice the number of sessions.  The Exascale Report stated, ""Absolutely one of the best and most important conferences in the technology and advanced computing sector.""
Heading into Q3, our focus was to restore our speed and excellence in execution, and to drive our immediate growth opportunities to ramp Fermi-based GeForce and Quadro GPUs and regain GPU leadership and share. With our base GPU business now back in growth mode, we can further accelerate our growth of Tesla and Tegra in the coming quarters and position NVIDIA at the center of the exciting revolution happening with cloud and mobile computing. With that, let me hand the call over to David.",1263,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Revenue for the third quarter was $844 million, up 4% sequentially. Gross margin was 46.5% at the low end of our range primarily as a result of product mix being slightly less favorable than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. OpEx was down to $288 million, principally as result of our significant improvement and execution of our new product introductions. Most importantly, we've taken the last seven GPUs from A01 silicon directly into production.
Avoiding the need to respend significantly helps to keep our OpEx flat while dramatically improving our time-to-market. Combined, these generated a GAAP net income of $84.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
Our focus on inventory reduction continued and tight management enabled us to work it down 13% during the quarter to $378 million. We achieved this while simultaneously reducing channel inventory slightly. Revenue for GPU grew slightly and was up nearly 6%. Total revenue for our Professional business was down slightly as a result of the Computing segment being down. Revenue for the Computing segment varies from quarter to quarter because it can currently be influenced by a small number of large orders. As we successfully grow into more vertical segments, this revenue stream should smooth out. Our Consumer business was up slightly, driven by a strong showing on Embedded business. Tegra revenue should begin to ramp in Q4 as our customers begin building their prelaunch inventory.
Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5% from the third quarter. GAAP gross margin is expected to be flat; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $300 million; GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18% to 20%. That concludes our prepared remarks.

As you know, it's still a little choppy out there. But there's several things that are working in our favor. The first is our Fermi GPU's going into the Sandy Bridge announcement. A lot of people have misunderstood the way the GPU market works and the contribution that a GPU has -- that makes to premium experience in notebooks. And so -- whereas Sandy Bridge is a far better CPU and a better GPU than previous generation, the discrete GPUs that are connected to it have made enormous strides as well. And so our expectation with Sandy Bridge is that our market share is going to go up substantially. The adoption is going to be as good as before. And in fact, the adoption of discrete GPUs and notebooks has been growing over the last several quarters. And our expectation is that going forward, that trend will continue. And because Sandy Bridge is going to be such a great processor and such a great notebook, our expectation is that the Sandy Bridge transition's going to be really exciting. So that's number one. Number two, when I start building into our phone and tablet design wins, and although they're a little bit behind, the work that Google and Andy Rubin's team is doing at Google is just really amazing. This is clearly a world-class engineering team, and they're building a magical product. And so I'm looking forward to the next generation of Android phones and tablets that are coming out. And I think it's going to really, really surprise people and delight consumers everywhere. And so although it's a little bit behind, I think it's going to be completely fabulous. Now it's going to take something absolutely great to compete against the iPad and the iPhone, as we all know, because both of those devices are quite amazing devices. And so it's going to take something that is truly remarkable to compete against it. And I think Andy and his team and all of our engineers here working with them and all of our partners around the world working on it are going to absolutely deliver. And so that's the second thing. And Tesla is going to continue to gain momentum. The number of projects we're working on around the world is growing and so we're going to continue to see success there. There's quite a bit of announcements coming next week at the Supercomputing Conference in New Orleans so I won't leak any of that. But we're going to have a pretty exciting show next week.",448,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

The thinking was that as Fermi becomes a larger portion of the mix. I’m just trying to understand the margin guidance.

But we were coming of out a rather complicated Q2, as you recall. And so I'm delighted with the way things worked out in Q3. And we're just going to have to improve it from here on out. So I wouldn't read too much into that. The important thing to realize is that we're going to recapture a lot of the high-end business that we had ceded because we were late to market with Fermi. And we're going to capture that back, and we continue to capture that back. And as we ramp more and more, more of our mix goes to Quadro and Tesla, both of which are very high margins and that's going to continue to lift our margins. And, of course, the Tegra business has a much longer design win cycle and the amount of contribution of software to the Tegra business is just incredible. You're building an entire computer on a chip. And if the computers are as sophisticated as what it's going to take to compete against an iPad or an iPhone, the amount of software that you put into your product line is going to have to increase dramatically, and so the margins will reflect that. And so as we continue to increase the mix of these three products, Tesla product, Tegra product; one goes into the cloud, one goes into mobile devices and the Quadro product, our margins will continue to increase. So my sense is that, that's direction that we're headed and there's nothing that tells me otherwise at this point.",278,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then Tesla, just the nature of the beast being very lumpy, how should we just think about that?

And NVIDIA doesn't have a very large enterprise sales force. But now that starting this last quarter, towards the end of the quarter, Dell and HP and IBM all have their systems that they've designed with the Tesla GPU in it, we are now engaging, or if you will, their sales force is engaging into the GPU computing ecosystem. And so with thousands and thousands of sales and marketing people from the three largest enterprise computing companies in the world selling Tesla now, I think we're in a much better position to gain much smoother traction. And so the way I think about Tesla up to this point is that we've been doing mostly evangelism, mostly lighthouse design win targeting; and with the momentum that we are seeing even with that, we're now able to deploy the resources of the OEMs to go after it. And so I hope that and I believe that with a larger sales force supporting and engaging customers like all of the big farmers around the world, all of the supercomputing centers around the world that all want to advance research, oil and gas companies around the world and finance companies all around the world, now having a much broader coverage. I think you're going to see a smoother ramp and hopefully a much more aggressive ramp. So that's one. I think with respect to our core or base Consumer GPU business, you mentioned catch up. Frankly, we've caught up with Fermi. We were late with Fermi, but we caught up with Fermi. We simply pulled further ahead.",282,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

You know how proudful we are about the work that we do. And so I think with GTX 580, whereas we typically launch a new generation each year, because we fell behind with GTX 480, the teams really hustled and brought the next one out very shortly after based on our second generation Fermi architecture. And as a result, we improved our performance per watt by almost 40%. I mean, that's a huge leap using the same exact process. And so as a result, 580 is faster. It's lower power. It's quieter. It's just a wonderful product. And so I think in that segment, winning wins. So this is not a market particularly from $99 above. Those aren't markets where lower prices wins the day. If somebody is willing to spend $199 for a gaming card, they’re going to spend $199 to buy the best gaming card. And where GeForce has a real advantage is across the board on traditional games, but GTX, all of our GTX family has such an amazing DX11 performance compared to the competition. And tesselation is the essence of DX11 and the modern generation of games. And so I think we have, at this point, unambiguously the best architecture and we also now unambiguously have the best implementation.

If you look at what we have been trying to do over the last several years, we've been trying to extend our leadership in GPUs and continue to build that based on the GPU business, the core GPU business, which is PCs and workstations, but in the process, build two new initiatives that we believe was going to be really important growth initiatives. One of them was GPU for high-performance computing or another way to say it is GPU in the cloud. Putting GPU in servers available as a computational resource for mobile devices or computers was a really important initiative for us and that turned into what we call Tesla. The second initiative was mobile computing, which what we call Tegra. These two products, and these two directions of computing, we believe, was going to be the future of computing. And along the way, a recession came along and we didn't execute well on Fermi and we tripped ourselves up a little bit, but we gained our footing again. Q2 was -- we got it out of our system and since then we've executed on seven Fermi generation GPUs, all of them went to production with first silicon. Every single one of them went from tape-outs to production release at record times compared to before. The velocity of the company has really, really amped up. And so I think our core business of the GeForce and the Quadro business are really, really in great footing now. And just as we've gained that footing, Tesla and Tegra are both ramping into production and helping us get into these two really important growth markets. And so I could see the traction now and we know what we're working on with respect to customer projects and we have a good feeling for when they go to production. So at this point, we really feel like we're back to growing, and more importantly than just back to growing, we're going into the right markets, which is the future of computing.",340,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And it's taken longer than we expected by a few months. But the important thing is that you can't just build a tablet. You can't just put an operating system on a tablet and hope that on a piece of glass and hope you're going to compete against the iPad. The iPad is a wonderful product. And if you're going to give that wonderful product a run for its money, you better build something absolutely exquisite. And so whether it's the quality of the work of the craftsmanship that our teams are working on or the capabilities of these devices, they have to be absolutely groundbreaking or why would anybody come to buy them? And so I think that the extra time that was necessary to build these devices and build the operating system and all the applications and the system software necessary to do it, and obviously we're not going to talk about what they are right now, but they're going to be absolutely magical. And so I think that, that's the important thing to realize. And I think although we are a little bit late, the market potential is so huge and this is the future of computing. This is the second device into the future of computing.

And if you haven't had the chance to try them, they're really magical computers. And so I think -- if you could spread the word, tell your friends, we're going to postpone the transition. So I think we built with Apple a really important new GPU with integrated chipset and it's a great chip. And I'm delighted to see them used in so many different systems. But our Tablet business and our Phone business is going to ramp and it's going to ramp hard. And there are customers lined up all over the world with a lot of different phones and systems and the amount of activity in our Tegra business is just simply too great right now. And so we've just got to hunker down and get these products to market, make sure that we build something really amazing and all the engineers that are working on it are working 24/7. And so we just have to build some of the best things we've ever built.

There's a lot of tablets that are going to get built that aren't really going to ship. And everybody's building tablets because it's just so important. This is such an important part of the future computing market. This isn't a fad. It is clear now that touch computing and tablets is a wonderful way for a lot of consumers to enjoy content. And by being able to connect a wireless keyboard and a mouse, the difference between a tablet and a notebook is pretty marginal. And so I think that going forward, you're going to see this tablet device being quite disruptive to both notebook as well as entry desktop. And so I think this is an important trend and that's why a lot of companies -- every single company I know is working on a tablet. There's  -- car companies working on tablets. Consumer electronics companies working on tablets. Computer companies working on tablets, and communications companies working on tablets. I don't remember the last time in the history of computing where a singular device is being worked on by all the industries. The medical industry's working on tablets. This is a revolutionary form factor and I think it's a foregone conclusion this is going to be probably the largest computing segment. Now how much of that share depends on ultimately how delightful all of these tablets that are being built are. And I'm just so glad that we decided not to go to market with tablets earlier, but to wait and work and put all of our energy behind the next generation operating system. And the team over at Google working on it and Andy Rubin and his team are working 24/7 and they're doing amazing work. And I'm just really, really delighted that we decided to focus and not spare it on current generation operating systems.

And if you gave somebody a choice between a netbook and a tablet and a wonderful tablet, why would anybody choose a netbook? And so I think the logic I think at this point is pretty clear, and people see the trends. And how big is it going to be to us depends on how well we execute. This is a segment that I hope that we can add a lot of value to. And computing matters here and very, very, very low power computing is what Tegra was designed to do.

And it would do injustice to the amount of engineering that has gone into building the next generation of tablets. Arnab, as I mentioned earlier, the iPad is not your normal device waiting around for somebody to beat it. I mean, this is an extraordinary device. And if you want to build something that is desirable and even more desirable to some other customers, you've got to build something great. You're not just going to put a phone operating system on a larger display and ship it.  You’re just not. And so the amount of engineering that has gone into building the next generation device is not an operating system upgrade by any  -- you won't recognize it, let me just put it that way. And what the team is shooting for is nothing short of a great experience. And so I have every confidence in the team. Andy and his guys are doing amazing work and we're putting all of our best on it. And of course, many partners around the world are putting their best on it. We're going to make sure we build something absolutely, absolutely magical. And so that's job one. With respect to R&D, you're right that although the PC industry hasn't grown substantially in the high end over the last several years, we continue to invest so that we could build two major initiatives. One was Tesla so that we can put GPUs into servers in the cloud; and one was Tegra so could put it our GPU and technology into mobile devices. I think it is clear, surely, I think to us and I hope to you, that if we hadn't made the investment to put NVIDIA in the middle of cloud computing and mobile computing and that today we are basically selling PC chips, it would be one of the greatest irresponsible acts of investment that I can imagine. Here's an incredibly talented organization that knows how to build these things and for us to be at the epicenter of the next computer revolution is an opportunity too great not to have gone after. And so we decided to invest heavily to be here. And I think that over the next year and we're starting to see it now, the investment was surely worth it and that we've made the right investments to be at the growth, the next growth part of the world and the next growth part of the industry going forward. And so I'm excited about the investment that we've made, frankly, and I think we've made some really important contributions to the computer industry that you'll see in the very short near future.",462,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And obviously, we had to -- in order to build a great device, you need a lot of software to go with it, including operating systems and applications and that's taken us pretty much the entire year to go do. Meanwhile, as the competition is finally catching up to where we were last year, the beginning of the year, we're about to enter into our next generation. And so I think today is probably too early to talk about -- I'm anxious to sell you some Tegra 2s. So I'm anxious to get everybody excited about Tegra 2s and I think they will be very excited about it. And then shortly after that, we'll introduce Tegra 3.

There is no indication at all that the attach rate is changing. Integrated graphics has improved over the course of the last 10 years, last 15 years. It's been 15 years I think. I think about 11 years. So it's been 11, almost 12 years that integrated graphics has been around. And every single year, it's gotten many times better than the previous year. You almost don't have to try for it to be better every year. And so I don't expect -- and so this year it's better than last year, and Sandy Bridge is a great processor. I'm excited about it. I think it's the best processor that Intel has made in several years and it's by far the best processor on the planet. And so I expect that the refresh cycle associated with Sandy Bridge to be quite exciting both on the desktop side and on the notebook side. I surely am.

We're going to have to discover another great reason for people to grow the high-end PC marketplace. Our discrete GPU GeForce market has been relatively stable for some time. But the growth has all come from low-end notebooks and netbooks and devices like that. And I think that, that market is absolutely going to be cannibalized by the tablet. And the reason for that is because the tablet is just much more delightful to use on the one hand. And if computing is a secondary device, anyways, or it's for casual computing, why not use a tablet? The applications are all served up wonderfully and the experience is wonderful and responses are beautiful. It's an exquisite device. And if you want to use it as an entry device, you can always attach a keyboard to it, a wireless keyboard to it or a wireless mouse. So those things are really easy to solve and before you know it, how people look at a tablet, it may be as a tablet or a transformable netbook. It's kind of hard to say.

The answer is no. We're not building any more chipsets. And we're building SoCs now, and we're building Tegra SoCs. And so we're going to take integration to a new level and that's our focus. And the second thing is with respect to the Chipset business, it's not grown largely this year because we haven't really been expanding the sales of it. And with respect to the tail off, most people expected the tail off, I guess, come Q1 next year. But I think the tail off is going to take a little longer than that for a couple of reasons. On the AMD side, our AMD chipset remains quite well positioned. And my sense is that our chipset there will continue to ship throughout next year. And then the second thing is the MCP89, the latest and the last generation of Intel chipsets that we built was just a really wonderful piece of engineering. And the work that we did with Apple was really great. And they're going to continue to use that for some time.

Our Sandy Bridge GPU is just the best in the world. And it has Fermi in there and this is our second-generation Fermi. And so you saw one evidence of it with is GTX580. The engineering team just did a wonderful job and their execution is just fabulous. So that's one. And the second thing is Optimus technology is just too important. You probably heard about Optimus, but it's this automatic hybrid GPU computing solution and it's automatic. It's seamless. It's just delightful and no switching buttons, no rebooting. The computer never stalls. Our GPU turns on automatically whenever you need it, and whenever you don't need it, it goes to sleep completely, consumes no power. And so I just think that Optimus is one of the best things we've ever done and it's such a great technology it disappeared. And I think everybody now, every notebook company in the world wants to build computers for the premium experience. There's the base line computers where integrated graphics is fine, but you also want to offer premium experience notebooks, and this is where they put our GeForce in it, but they still would like to have excellent battery life. And so with the discrete GPU, our next generation Fermi-based GPU, and also with Optimus, they get the benefit of great experience and very, very long battery life. So it's surely a non-compromise solution. And so those are really the two reasons that we've captured so much more share.",254,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The very first entry-level GPU that we offered was called Vanta. And it had a whopping 7 million transistors and took all of our might to build. And so anyways, we've built entry-level GPUs for every architecture, every season, and we haven't lost focus of our high end. Fermi, you could argue that we were too ambitious to focus on the high end. We wanted to bring a level of geometry performance to the world that it had never seen. And we took enormous architectural risk to change our architecture completely so that the geometry processing capability of our GPU reached a level that really the world had never seen and the world has not seen since. And I don't expect that you'll see it from our competition all next year. And so Fermi is clearly a revolutionary architecture and [indiscernible] (1:09:55), if you will. But we gathered ourselves again and the engineering team since then has gone into light speed and we executed on seven new GPUs, all working the first time and the velocity of the company is fast as ever.

And if not for Fermi, we wouldn't have the benefit of Tesla and we wouldn't have the benefit of the leadership that we now enjoy in Quadro.

I'm sorry, Quadro. Quadro is about to reach their all-time high. And so my expectation is that the Quadro business is going to continue to grow. And the reason isn't so much just because we're serving the workstation market. I mean, we're creating new technology that grows our market. And so, for example, at GTT, we demonstrated the world's first interactive ray tracer and this allows people to do industrial design and styling and walk-throughs in a way that they couldn't conceive of in the past. And this is a cloud computing initiative, and so this puts Quadro in the cloud. And so our expectation is not only where we continue to benefit from workstations that continue to adopt Quadro. Now people are going into a new refresh cycle. Their workstations are now getting pretty old. Many of the workstations that are now three or four years old and it's time to upgrade them. And the performance difference between what Quadro brings and what's in the field is not 2x or 4x. I mean, it's 10x the performance. And so there's an upgrade cycle that's always going on. And then secondarily, we're going to create new markets and new opportunities for ourselves by putting Quadro into the cloud. And so that's what the iray initiative is about and that's what we call it the reality server, which is a software stack that allows for distributed, multi-computer, multi-GPU rendering serving up to multiple users.
