Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing recent end-market business highlights, and then Doug will provide summary of the first quarter fiscal 2013 financial results. 
Now revenues for our Q1 fiscal year '13 was $576 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. This represented though a decrease of 7% from last quarter, but an increase of 2% from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding legacy consumer, revenue actually declined 5% sequentially but was up 8% year-over-year. 
Wireless revenue only declined marginally in what would usually be a seasonally weak quarter for us as a result of multiple smartphone ramps with several OEM customers. As we also guided, wired revenue was down due primarily to continuing weakness in carrier routing from service providers. 
Industrial was also down, below our estimate at the beginning of the quarter, mainly because of weaker distribution resales [ph], coupled with ongoing channel inventory reductions on our site. 
Let me provide more color on each of our target markets. Starting with wireless. Revenue from wireless during the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations, declining 2% sequentially during Q1, but I do want to highlight that wireless revenue grew 22% year-on-year. Wireless represented 53% of our total revenues in Q1. Normally, our fiscal Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for wireless. However, several factors contributed to our ability to sustain the healthy revenue level we achieved in fiscal Q4 and continue into this quarter.
For one, we had a strong follow on demand from our 2 largest smartphone OEMs, one in North America, the other in Korea. Secondly, several of our other OEM customers launched 4G/LTE smartphone programs in the quarter. In fact, we noticed, for the first time in several quarters, strength from OEMs outside the top 2 from Taiwan, Korea, as well as North America. These results offset somewhat by weakness in China smartphone market due to customer supply constraints of certain components and in addition, we chose to walk away from certain low margin Chinese business.
Looking ahead to Q2. As expected, but a quarter earlier than when it occurred last year, we have seen the annual product transition at our largest North American smartphone OEM, which will act as a headwind in the quarter. However, this has been meaningfully offset by continued ramp at our large OEM customer in Korea. In addition, we see compelling demand in the quarter from the 2 OEMs who are both ramping new 4G/LTE smartphone platforms. As a result, for Q2, we expect overall wireless revenue to decline in the high single digits on a percentage basis.
While the revenue headwind from our largest OEM may cloud the picture somewhat, I would highlight that the 4G/LTE smartphone launches in Q1 and Q2 that I mentioned and that increasing FBAR content, which is helping support a more favorable wireless product mix.
Next, moving onto wired infrastructure target markets. Revenue came in with a 10% sequential decline. Much of enterprise networking during the quarter was flat but after double dip -- double-digit, sorry, growth in Q4, our SerDes ASIC business paused temporarily during Q1, as our major networking OEM began to transition from 10G switching platforms in data centers in preparation, in anticipation of launching next generation 40G systems.
Also as we expected during the quarter, fiberoptics [ph] continued to be weak tied to soft carrier routing spending, which impacted all 3 major OEMs that we serve. 
Looking forward to Q2 though, we believe enterprise network and storage spending has bottomed. We also expect to see carrier routing continuing to be soft and do not see a recovery until the back half of the fiscal year.
However, we expect a strong ramp in the next generation 40-gigabit data center switching, as our largest networking OEM rolls out their platform Nexus 6000. Here we have substantial ASIC content, as well as next generation proprietary fiberoptic interconnects. As a result, we expect wired revenues to grow high single-digit sequentially. 
Let me now discuss our industrial and other target markets. Just to remind you, starting from this quarter, we are now grouping our consumer royalty based revenues [indiscernible] into the industrial market. However, stripping that out and on a comparable basis to Q4 2012, industrial declined 8% sequentially, below our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, even though year-on-year we grew 6%. As most of you know, we recognize revenue on sell in and industrial sales are significantly weighted towards distribution. The weaker-than-expected sales were caused primarily by a sequential decline in the distribution resales -- slight sequential decline, I might add, as well as ongoing inventory contraction in the supply chain. Regionally, we saw China continue to recover and grow at low double digits, but we saw Japan and Europe decline significantly while the U.S. remained virtually flat. 
Looking forward to Q2, while we believe channel inventory is now rather lean, we do not currently see a sustainable uptick in end demand. In fact, based on a review of our major OEM end customers in industrial, they forecast their revenues to decline an average low-single digits. 
Now, I know several of our analog peers, component peers out there are forecasting an uptick in the business next quarter. I might note that this time, last year, we saw a similar phenomenon, which we interpreted as an uptick in distribution -- or where we interpreted an uptick in distribution orders as a recovery in end demand and ship products in anticipation. The expected recovery did not materialize and we saw destocking in the supply chain for the rest of the year. I'm focused on not letting that happen again. Given our review of end-market demand, we just don't think any inventory replenishment going on today is sustainable.
Therefore, we anticipate revenue in industrial and others will decline slightly, low-single digits, when compared to Q1, consistent with what we believe end market demand dictates.
Therefore, in summary in Q2, we expect a major product transition in wireless. Industrial continues to be challenging and pretty much flat, wired infrastructure provides an opportunity for revenue growth, though it's not expected to be enough to offset the other 2 target market declines -- weaknesses, I should say. Hence, we are guiding overall revenue to decline between 2% to 5% in Q2 from Q1.
Switching gears for a minute. As you probably saw earlier today, we issued a press release this afternoon announcing our CFO, Doug Bettinger's departure in early March. I do want to take this opportunity to thank Doug for the many contributions he has made to Avago over the last several years, including helping to transition us from a private to a public company. He has been a key part of delivering our financial performance and establishing our relations -- relationships, I'm sorry, with you, the investment community.
We are starting a formal search for Doug's replacement. In the meantime, Anthony Maslowski, VP and Corporate Controller, will serve as interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Maslowski has been with Avago since 2006. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Doug for more detailed review of our first quarter 2013 financials.",1198,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2013",2013-02-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3593.0,424743.0,20008064.0,Presenter Speech,Douglas Bettinger,,Executives,3,"Okay. Thanks, Hock. Good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the first quarter of fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you today that my comments will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release that we issued today and it's also available on our website at avagotech.com. 
Revenues of $576 million in Q1 represents a decrease of 7% from last quarter and an increase of 2% versus the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was roughly in line with our guidance for the quarter. And as Hock mentioned, revenue from our wired infrastructure target market came in a little bit better than we thought, so that was offset by weaker-than-expected revenue from our industrial target market. And finally, revenue from our wireless target market declined slightly, which was about in line with our expectations. 
For the last 3 quarters, we've disclosed that Foxcon was a greater than 10% customer and they continued to be one again this quarter. After growing for 3 consecutive quarters, distribution resales paused and declined modestly in Q1, reflecting weaker end-market demand. Distribution inventory continued to contract as we expected at the beginning of the quarter. And as you know, of all of our end markets, the industrial target market is impacted the most significantly by distribution. We obviously saw our industrial market revenues decline to a larger extent from these 2 occurrences. 
Looking into Q2, we expect resales will be roughly flat and distribution and inventory will likely decline again.
Our Q1 gross margin was 50.7%, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. This was driven by a slightly stronger revenue in the wired infrastructure target market. Q1 gross margin declined 40 basis points from last quarter, primarily as a result of end market mix. 
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses in Q1 increased by $11 million to $86 million and SG&A increased by $2 million to $44 million, pushing our OpEx to $130 million or up $13 million sequentially. And you remember from last earnings call, the increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation accruals compared with Q4 and secondarily, to our increased R&D investment. These expenses were in line with our guidance for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, R&D increased to 15% and SG&A increased 1% to 8% of net revenue.
Income from operations for the quarter decreased by $37 million sequentially to $162 million, and this represented 28% of net revenue. Compared to the $163 million for Q1 of last year, income from operations decreased by $1 million. We recorded a net gain of $2 million in interest and other. 
Taxes came in at $1 million for Q1. This was lower than we expected, and it was primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of R&D tax credits in the United States. Q1 net income of $163 million decreased 16% from the prior quarter and Q1 earnings per diluted share of $0.65 was $0.12 lower than Q4. Compared to Q1 of last year, net income was $7 million higher and for earnings per diluted share, it was $0.03 higher. Earnings are higher versus the prior year primarily due to higher revenues, as well as the lower taxes, which was offset by the higher spending that I described. The sequential decrease in Q1 earnings was primarily attributed to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. 
Our share-based compensation in Q1 was $18 million. The breakdown of this expense for Q1 includes $2 million in cost of goods sold, $7 million in R&D and $9 million in SG&A. In Q2, we anticipate share-based compensation will again be approximately $18 million. And just to remind you as I always do, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
So now moving to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding came in at 46 days. This was down 5 days from the prior quarter. Our inventory ended at $208 million, which was an increase of $14 million from last quarter. And this translated into days on hand of 72 days. Q1 inventory increased primarily because of a last time buy from one of our component suppliers, as well as the ramping of our Fort Collins facility.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.15 billion and we generated $185 million in operational cash flow. We spent $67 million on capital expenditures. This CapEx level was below our guidance for the quarter, mainly because of the timing of equipment delivery. For Q2, we expect CapEx will be in a range of $60 million to $70 million. And I'll remind you, the CapEx spending today is primarily due to the ongoing buildout of incremental FBAR filter capacity in Fort Collins.
For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 406,000 shares, which consumed $13 million of cash. And on December 28, 2012, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per ordinary share, which consumed $42 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.01 from the prior quarter. And I just point out that since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011, we've continued to increase this dividend each quarter. And as I mentioned last quarter, we also continue to evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisitions as another way of deploying cash to maximize return to our shareholders. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Revenue was expected to decline by 2% to 5% from Q1. We expect lower wireless sales to one of our large customers will be partially offset by a return to sequential growth in wired infrastructure. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 50.75%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to again be approximately $130 million. I'm forecasting interest in other to be a gain of $1 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $6 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 254 million shares.
And just to remind you, starting with this quarter, we stopped reporting the consumer and computer peripherals target market as a standalone market. We've combined the remaining revenues from that market, given the small size of the remaining IP royalty revenue into the industrial target market. And we're calling this new market, simply, industrial and other. That combined target market declined 14% sequentially in Q1. 
And as Hock mentioned, had we been reporting only the former industrial target market, the decline would have been less at 8%.
And finally, you heard from Hock that I'm moving on to another opportunity. I'd like to pause and take the opportunity to thank the Avago management team, the board and especially my finance and administration team for the support over the last 4.5 years. I'd also like to assure our investors that Avago remains in the hands of very capable finance and management teams.

Not as a mass-market supplier of standard commoditized components, but rather of specialized high-performance components, which typically ends up in relatively niche market applications in those areas we target. And no different in wireless. And here, our area of focus has always been, as we indicated, filters and duplexes. The FBAR duplexes that we are proprietary technology over. To the extent we sell power amplifiers, we sell it to facilitate our sale of duplexes. And either as a front-end modules, sell them on discrete basis. But really to push either FBARs as a package deal or, as I mentioned, paths or front-end modules. That announcement by one of this out, a very important partner for Avago on this product called RF 360 is largely a multiband, even multimode power -- largely power amplifier gain. It doesn't have filters, it doesn't have duplexes and we don't believe it would have given the unusual nature of filters and duplexes. So far from our point of view, Avago, it's  not something we view obviously as intersecting or conflicting with the model we have. In fact, if anything else, we continue to see an interesting evolution of the wireless market and now particularly in the RF market given that the content in RF, be it power amplifier, switches or more so, duplexes, are exponentially increasing with the complexity of bands that comes on 4G/LTE implementations. So we do not see it having any major -- any significant impact on us. I don't know, and definitely not on our business model.",288,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Just wanted to ask a question on the networking side, if I could. You talked about the increase next quarter being driven by some new products that your OEM customers are ramping.

I don't think they have a very good visibility beyond that now, even if they do tell us, it doesn't necessarily mean that's what they will stick to or have any clear indication what it is. But what we do see for the rest of this quarter in our view is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, spending in enterprise, be it networking or storage, is flat, very flat by and large. While we are obviously guiding significant and meaningful step up in our shipment -- in our revenues, in wired infrastructure is largely driven, as I mentioned, via a product launch. In a way, a product launch and the decline in 10G and data center switching towards 40G -- the new generation of 40G data center switching. And then increased content -- substantially increased content we have in this new product launch. That's what's driving it. So other than that, no, I think much less you said it. Things are kind of flat at least for the next 3 months. Beyond that, I don't know. We do expect, I might add, that in carrier routing, especially building out back hauls in 4G/LTE networks, be it particularly in China, we do -- and even in the U.S., we do expect an increase in the levels of such spending. We have not seen -- we have seen spending trough, I should say, since over 6, 9 months ago. And -- but we also believe that it's time point to slowly step up. We start to see signs of that in China with China mobile, China telecoms. But I expect that build out to start coming in, in the second half of our fiscal year.",311,1.0,6.0,0.5555555555555556,0.6

But if you kind of -- can you maybe just give us more color on your thinking there, both in terms of the linearity to orders in the industrial and the distribution that you saw throughout the quarter, what you're seeing right now?

All we do see is, it's -- and there's a lot of some volatility, not a huge amount of volatility, but there's some -- there is definitely a certain amount of volatility in demand, in end demand as on -- as you run through each quarter and from quarter-to-quarter. And we do see that even on the resale side. Even though we recognize revenue on shipping, as I mentioned. But region wise, as I mentioned, we do see, on average, daily uptick in demand in China. However, what we unfortunately see on the other side of the picture is Europe and Japan is somewhat declining in that -- in those areas. And U.S., if there's a recovery, it is very slight. And as -- I won't use of word sustainable, maybe. But what we often see is there's a spike and it goes away. It's almost a specific applications, specific customers, specific programs might create a spike only to end, and something else created. But then so you -- you are seeing some level of volatility. And so when we mention all the things considered, all -- taking it all together, it's not the kind of uptick in demand that we saw after the downturn of 2009 that ran all the way to 2010. You had seen nothing like that at all. And maybe I am being conservative. But after, as you put it, the head fake of 2012, beginning of 2012, we're very careful about looking at this market in terms of claiming sustained bottom or sustained recovery after that.",268,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

I hate to say it, but we have a pretty full range of product that enters into a lot of end markets in industrial. And we know to track them very closely. And what I'll say, is we do not see industrial necessarily as collapsing. We see it as relatively, all things considered, flat. Why our revenue is not flat is because we have continued to destock at our distributors. And so since we recognize revenues from shipping, we see that the decline. But resale is not necessarily collapsing, but it's not recovering either. So the question is, is that strong sustained demand? I don't know. I mean, depends on the line -- if you have bookings out for the next 6 months that are firm, maybe you can make an indication on bookings for the next 3 months. I will tell you this, we have bookings but it doesn't show a positive uptrend on the nature we saw in the recovery in 2010 or that lead to part of 2009, when there was a clear recovery from an industrial downturn.",290,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

And as a follow-up, Hock, at your Analyst Day, you gave some very interesting information about FBAR and the expanding TAM for that capability. Outside of your largest customer, can you give us a sense for what kind of FBAR filter attach rate that you're seeing with smartphones today? Are you seeing new customers come in to adopt that capability? Because what I'm trying to get to is you are installing a lot of FBAR capacity, almost quadrupling over the last -- from, say, 2011 onwards. What does that imply in terms of how many FBAR filters we should see in a given smartphone for you to adequately utilize that capacity?",113,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Well, to answer your question, the simplest way to answer it is, I think, is a simple fact that we've indicated during Analyst Day. And you may recall that, Vivek, which was 3, 5 years ago, we would say that 2 bands. As you know, the spectrum for wireless communication is divided into bands. And there are bands in 2G, there are more bands in UMTS. And they're even more bands in 4G/LTE. And 3, 5 years ago, probably I would say 2, 3 bands would use FBAR on a regular sustained basis. Today, I would say that we probably have sockets that covers around 10 bands roughly, maybe even more. And so you can see the fairly significant or substantial increase -- and, of course, there are more phones being used out there but there are also more bands being used out there. But what's even more interesting as we pointed out, again and again, is there are those -- it's the same amount of space we have out there in terms of ether for carrying those  microwaves. But the bands are multiplying very rapidly. Each band requires its own different modulation schemes. And so they are basically starting to interfere with each other, which increases the requirement for a much better filter or duplexer than has been required in the past, where we're running 2G with much less bands. So to put in a nutshell, you can see the increase in the requirements for much better filtering out there. We see that in many OEM customers, especially as they launch 4G handsets. And as they start using bands that start to interfere or squeeze into existing, I guess, spectrum. One clear example of that is WiFi, WiMAX. The WiFi, WiMAX spectrum frequency is squeezed by a couple of frequencies for cellular bands used in China, used in Europe. And what we're seeing is a lot of demand for smartphones that need to operate and roam in China, as well as in Europe. And I'm talking specifically on those bands. So to answer your question more particularly, the reason we are building more and more capacity is simply because we have designs, we have won designs, we have requirements from customers on designs that we are winning requiring us to put in -- to be able to supply more of those FBAR filters out there. And frankly, we're trying to expand as fast as we can to meet the time frame for which those demands are coming in.",420,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We don't want to give you that kind of impact because of the nature of the business. But broadly, we can look back at events and probably see themselves repeating. And the product transition, 1 interesting question that was asked of me earlier on in this Q&A session, that we see occurring this quarter, Q2, occurred in Q3 last year. And if you look at context of what happened after Q3 last year, you see the launch of the -- and the ramp of the new generation products, which ramped very nicely, very strongly. And we showed -- we presented a very strong set of results for wireless business in Q3 and Q1 and the 2 quarters following their product transition. We do not see any reason why there is not a similar pattern or trend for this year as well, which is after transitioning Q2, we do not see why Q3 and Q4 would not follow the trend of what happened last fiscal year. And that's for wireless. In the case of wired to hover back [ph] and indicate, again, this is not a forecast but I'm just, in a sense, amplifying on the comments I made to earlier questions, which is simply that we see carrier routing to probably start to improve in the back half of the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we started to -- we have started to see some signs of that happening, especially in China back haul LTE spending as it is. We probably start to see some of that in North America as well in the back half if the carriers launch their forecast CapEx plans on -- more bandwidth and more routing. And we see some of the new programs coming in data center spending. We see a lot of interest build outs of large-scale data centers, which, because of its scale, will require launch of new programs, new platforms in data center switching, which we are very well embedded with our ASICs and proprietary fiber. So I like to see that opportunity -- I probably like to see that opportunity happen in the back half or later part of the fiscal '13. In industrial, I've no basis to one way or the other to tell you where things will hit, other than to say that China is continuing to recover, offsetting it seems to be a weakness in a couple other regions. And they both -- they kind of washout. We kind of seen -- or will likely see close at hand and probably no reason to see otherwise a flat industrial as we progress through the rest of the fiscal year. But again, this is just a guess.

Whether this will be translated into higher demand and revenue for FBAR products, we will see. We don't have -- we have not experienced that uptick yet.

Let's take the second and final question first. Very, very slow in typical enterprise manner. They'll launch a program and it will take a while for that program to gear up to speed. Some of these programs have launched 6 months ago and we are starting to see real activity now. And that's part of what we're experiencing here and you'll probably see some of that out in the marketplace. It's a long lead time kind of business and usually. It's usually a big ramp followed by -- and that may last for 2 quarters followed by a slight rollover and then it stabilizes and starts -- increasing over time as it replace existing generation system. That's typically the cycle that it follows. No different, I believe, in what we are seeing now. With 40G data center switching platforms that's coming into play, which a lot of this big data center build-out guys are very, very interested in buying. And in terms of the ASIC that goes in those products, as many of our product, like typical enterprise products, our cycle here is 18 weeks, typically, 1-8.

By the way, our FBAR unit cost keeps going down as we progress every year. And as we scale up in capacity, that drives it down even more. But more than that, we go into new processes. Every year, we have a new generation of FBAR process that enables us to shrink the die, to make it much more competitive. And we need to do it simply because, I mean, the demand we are seeing and we are anticipating will -- is fairly significant -- substantial versus the capacity even we are putting in place. And as I'm sure you all know, we don't build the capacity with the hope of demand showing up at the front door. We have a pretty clear line of sight of what we're earmarking this increased capacity for and we're building towards that. So -- and we have plenty of demands for those products that we make on those things. But when -- we talked about lower margins and all that is, as I mentioned many times before and is particularly true in 3G UMTS, we sell FBAR, we also sell power amplifiers that goes hand in hand. Either in the front end modules or sometimes in a bundle. And so the power amplifier does dilute our FBAR margin, no surprise, as you can see there. And where we don't feel that, that dilution is warranted is when we walked away from the business.",246,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing recent end market business highlights, and then Tony will provide a summary of the second quarter fiscal 2013 financial results. 
Now revenue for our Q2 fiscal year was $562 million, which was at the upper end of our guidance. This represented a decline of 2% from last quarter and a decrease of 3% from the same quarter a year ago. Here, wireless revenue declined 9% sequentially, in line with our guidance, as we expected the negative revenue impact from a major U.S. smartphone product transition, was partially offset by new platform launches at certain other OEM customers. Wire revenue was up as we expected. Surprisingly, industrial was also up slightly and above expectations, thanks to slow, but steady improvement in the industrial end market demand. 
Let me now provide more color on each of our target markets starting with wireless. Revenue from wireless was essentially in line with our expectations, declining 9% sequentially during Q2. Wireless represented 50% of total revenues. A significant product transition at our largest North American smartphone OEM was the primary reason for the Q2 sequential decline. However, this revenue headwind was partially offset by the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S4 platform, as well as certain other OEMs that ramped 4G/LTE smartphones during the quarter. We have significant FBAR content in these devices and we do see increased opportunity to expand FBAR content in next-generation smartphones. 
Let me elaborate on this further, if I could. As many of you know, LTE is proliferating and LTE operates in bands that are pushing traditional SAW filters to technical limits. We also now are seeing envelope tracking being adopted in some new smartphone designs. The benefit of envelope tracking or ET, as it is known, is better power amplifier efficiency. However, ET creates a noisier RF environment. As a result, we generally believe that FBAR provides isolation, which will improve the performance of the future ET-enabled phones.
Finally, service providers are also starting to adopt a technique known as carrier aggregation led by the combined different bands to achieve much higher data rates. We see the use of FBAR multiplexers that efficiently combine multiple signals as the preferred approach for smartphone OEMs to successfully implement carrier aggregation. Given these trends, we expect FBAR filtering will continue to be the key driver of our wireless business whether it be discreet FBAR duplexes or higher ASP front-end modules integrating FBAR with power amplifiers and other RF content. 
Now consistent, as you may know, with our earnings higher gross margin with our FBAR products, I would also highlight that a mix of wireless has gone up from low 40s, as a percent of revenue a year ago, to 50% this last quarter. But yet our corporate gross margin has remained basically unchanged at around 51% on a non-GAAP basis.
Now looking towards Q3. We see the start of a very strong ramp from our North American smartphone OEM customer as they transition to the next-generation platform. Demand outside of this large customer is also expected to continue. As a result, we anticipate Q3 overall wireless revenue to grow in the high-single-digits on a percentage basis. 
Next, wired infrastructure. Wired revenues grew 7% sequentially and represented 27% of total revenue. During the quarter, we saw an early recovery in enterprise spending, mainly though from data center applications and build-outs. While the traditional, more traditional enterprise networking market remained virtually flat. As you may now, many data center customers are today moving to the next-generation 40-gigabit per second switching platforms. We believe our design win momentum and many key OEMs is allowing us to gain share in this important growth area. We believe we have strong growth opportunities for our ASIC SerDes business on 40G data center switching platforms, in particular with our largest networking OEM. On the other hand, I would also note demand from carrier routing is still weak. 
Looking forward to Q3, however, we expect data center spending will continue to improve, creating a tailwind to our SerDes business. We also expect an uptick in 40G parallel optic interconnects, which will follow this equipment installations, driven by this new data center platforms. These 2 demand drivers, we believe, will allow our wired infrastructure revenues to grow mid- to high-single digits sequentially in Q3.
Finally, let me discuss our industrial target market. You may recall last quarter, we guided low-single digit decline, actually, in industrial. It turned out, we were somewhat conservative. Revenue grew 4% sequentially and accounted for 23% of the total revenue. During Q2, industrial orders actually improved, but at a gradual pace, driven primarily by slow but very steady demand -- increase in distribution resales in the industrial market. In fact, industrial resales for us grew 3% -- over 3% sequentially, in line with our initial revenue growth. 
In all geographical regions, except Japan, resales, in fact, grew quarter-on-quarter. Looking at Q3, we continue to see an improvement in end market demand across all regions, driven through multiple applications. We therefore, anticipate revenue in industrial will continue to grow mid-single digits when compared to Q2.
In summary, Q3, we expect broad-based improvements in all 3 target markets. Similar to Q2, wired and industrial should continue to trend up, but at a somewhat higher pace. The big swing factor for us is from wireless with the ramp of the product transition at our major North American smartphone OEM. With that in mind, we expect consolidated revenue for Avago to grow between 6% to 9% over that of Q2.
Okay. With that, let me now turn this call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our second quarter 2013 financials. Tony?",956,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Before reviewing the second quarter fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.
Revenue of $562 million in Q2 represents a decrease of 2% from last quarter and a decrease of 3% from the same quarter a year ago. The sequential result was at the upper end of our guidance for the quarter. Q2 results were helped by improvement in demand from our industrial end market, where as you know, we sell primarily through distributors. These results compared to wired revenue that came in slightly lower than our guidance. Revenue from our wireless target market was in line with our expectations. Both Foxconn and Samsung, were greater than 10% customers in the quarter. 
Our Q2 gross margin was 51.2%, approximately 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. This was driven by stronger revenue in the industrial target market and better gross margin performance in our wired market. Q2 gross margin increased 50 basis points from last quarter for similar reasons.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses for Q2 increased by $2 million to $88 million as a result of higher R&D investment. However, SG&A decreased by $2 million to $42 million resulting in flat operating expenses of $130 million compared to Q1. These expenses were in line with our guidance. As a percentage of sales, R&D increased to 16% and SG&A decreased to 7% of net revenue. Income from operations for the quarter decreased by $4 million sequentially to $158 million and represented 28% of net revenue. Compared to the $171 million for Q2 of last year, income from operations decreased by $13 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $1 million, which was offset by a $1 million gain from other income. 
Taxes came in at $5 million for Q2. Q2 net income of $153 million decreased 6% from the prior quarter. And Q2 earnings per diluted share of $0.61 was $0.04 lower than Q1. The sequential decrease in Q2 earnings is primarily attributable to lower revenue and higher taxes. 
Compared to Q2 of last year, net income was $15 million lower and earnings per diluted share was $0.05 lower. This was a result of lower revenue and higher spending. Our share-based compensation in Q2 was $17 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q2 includes $2 million in cost of goods sold, $7 million in R&D and $8 million in SG&A. 
In Q3, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $20 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding came in at 44 days. This was down 2 days from the prior quarter due to our efforts in the collections area. Our inventory ended at 229 million, an increase of 21 million from the last quarter. Days on hand were 76 days. We continue to build wireless inventory in anticipation of various product launches with our smartphone OEM customers. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.22 billion and we generated $191 million in operational cash flow. We spent $47 million on capital expenditures. We spent approximately $37 million on an acquisition in the quarter. For Q3, we expect CapEx to be approximately $67 million as we continue to spend on our fab capacity expansion in Fort Collins, Colorado.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 318,000 shares, which consumed $11 million of cash. On April 4, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per ordinary share, which consumed $47 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter, and I point out that since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 2011, we've continued to increase our dividend each quarter. 
I'd like to make a comment about our capital allocation strategy going forward. Supported by a healthy balance sheet and strong quarterly free cash flows, our focus will be to continue to maximize the return to our shareholders. Our board will continue to consider increasing our quarterly dividend in line with what we have done in the past. We also plan to be -- to more consistently repurchase shares to limit dilution from employee-related stock issuances. In addition, we will continue to evaluate potential strategic investments and acquisition as another way of deploying cash to maximize return to shareholders.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. 
As we stated in the press release, the guidance does not include the acquisition of CyOptics business. However, we do plan to provide additional guidance for the acquired business after the transaction closes. So first, revenue is expected to grow by 6% to 9% from Q2. We see broad-based strength across all 3 end markets. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 51%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $133 million, interest and other is projected to be a gain of $1 million, taxes are forecasted to be approximately $6 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is 253 million shares. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",920,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Seasonality in the smartphones business, I believe, still exists. Though, very much muted these days. [indiscernible] A few years back, frankly. It's more driven by product launches, major product launches, of large smartphone OEMs more than anything else. And what we were referring to, in our guidance for this July quarter, is the fact that we will be experiencing -- or we are experiencing, I should say, we are in the midst of it, the initial -- just the initial ramp of this large smart -- North American smartphone OEM in this quarter, but it is just the initial ramp.

And we expect Q3 right now in our guidance to be not much different. We could be pleasantly surprised. But we certainly expect, as we move beyond June, July, for service providers in China and even North America to start putting in place core routing backhaul infrastructure, which will then drive a stronger demand for our parallel optics.

Jim, industrial, as you know, is -- up to 2 quarters of -- of not very great movement in trends, we started to see last quarter, actually, a reversal in resell. And I'm referring to resell globally. And as I mentioned, industrial actually grew 3% recently last quarter sequentially. We expect -- and what we're seeing in order patterns is we feel we very much expect the same to happen this quarter. The important fact for geographies, North America was strongly recovering. North America sequentially was growing high-single digits last quarter and momentum continues today. Euro and Asia-Pac was also growing at least mid-single digits in industrial. The only market that was down last quarter was Japan, and it's because of the yen.

We find companies are still not spending that strongly, but holding -- sustaining. But on the data center side, we still -- we see a lot of build-outs. We're seeing increasing level of build-outs and that's showing -- and that's giving a lot of growth to the business we are in because these guys are adopting, for a large part, of these new-generation products in 40G and where we have a lot of market share.

My question is, is that an accurate understanding of that slide presentation? And can you help me understand that within context of your plans to quadruple capacity between '11 and '13, because that would then imply that your unit output would go from about 1 billion per year to several billion per year.

I guess, the point of what you're trying to say is the volume -- our volume shipments of FBAR is that increasing pretty strongly or dramatically. And answer is, yes. It has been and especially with more and more LTE rollouts in more and more countries beyond North America, definitely, yes. And so also with the coming into place of technics, as I mentioned, by envelope tracking and -- down the road, next year probably -- next year, carrier aggregation and adoption of carrier aggregation by handset OEMs to enable that, even more so. So yes, that's a good reason why we're increasing our capacity. Now to be fair, we should also say that penetration of FBAR 3 years ago was at a much lower level than penetration of FBAR today. So it's -- our volume increase that you are kind of highlighting and is kind of a demonstrated with our capacity increase that we just put in place is also a factor, not just of end markets growing, as I indicated here, but also the fact that the -- and the fact that number of smartphones are increasing, is also a reflection of the fact that the content of FBAR in each smartphone is also increasing.",208,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So if I do the math then, it's clear that pricing on FBAR is coming down because obviously, the volume growth of quadruple is so far ahead of the revenue growth of FBAR. So I guess my question is, as pricing is coming down, it seems like you're able to maintain margins. So I guess my question is, as we go forward, looking even outside of the top 2 customers, what's your perspective on the growth potential outside of top 2? Is it potentially greater? And also, what's the implication for margins for business overall, given the pricing dynamics going lower on really sort of extraordinary volume growth here?",121,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

The drive to more and more FBAR usage in handsets is largely driven by requirements, it's driven by changes in the -- technology changes in the industry, now architectural changes in the industry for making smartphones, less so specific OEMs. Though certain specific OEMs may show preference for FBAR versus SAW filter because of performance. It tends more -- from our perspective, to be driven more by the fact that LTE, as a global thing, is happening and to replace 3G, or carrier aggregation, as I mentioned, is happening as in by -- and when it happens, it will take -- it will do something that most service providers, carriers will adopt as envelope tracking because it saves power on handsets. So that -- on that -- all those issues are driving just like we mentioned in the last conference call, certain bands like in Europe, the European band, LTE band, drives at 100% into FBAR. Like coexistence problems between TD-LTE and the WiFi and WiMAX band in China also drives it into FBAR. Those are technological trends, not unique to any specific OEM. So to answer you, the fact that 2 large OEMs may use it now, it does -- it's just a reflection of the fact that the entire industry will be trending towards it.",227,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

And now to the answer to your bigger part of question, I cannot really respond to it, not because it is proprietary to our customer, which it is, as much as the fact that it's the architectures will be what they choose to adopt.

There are a lot of other components. And as you put in more and more bands, operating within each circuit in any handsets, you start to need things, among other things, things like switching, tuning, various other things that will be very helpful and also interfaces. As you know, to operate envelope tracking, you need a certain kind of interface. In fact, people call it MIPI interface. That requires pretty tricky CMOS designs.

If it doesn't work, you don't get a signal, you won't get a signal and the phone may cost of $1,000 or $200, it just won't work. And in many -- as I mentioned in an answer to an early questions, a lot of the drivers towards increased use of FBAR over SAWs over the last few years, especially, has been driven by technical considerations, not just PR preference in performance, as much as technical considerations. Because if you can make it work in Band 7, if you can make duplexing work well in Band 7, LTE in Europe except with FBAR, you have no choice. You've got to put an FBAR in.  And the same applies when you try to run TD-LTE in China with WiFi. You're going to have a lot of interference, has no getting out of it.

On FBAR on your latter question, I guess, well, with -- SAW is our biggest competitor, frankly. SAW filters, by the way. I mean, FBAR today in a total environment of handsets market, of which they are like over 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion units per year. By far, the vast majority of handsets uses SAW filters. So in my guess, our approximate guess for FBAR penetration, is probably only about barely 20% at this point. But it's hard because in the same phone, you're going to have -- with multiple bands, you can have both in the same phones, SAW filters and FBAR, which makes it even more tricky to estimate it. But the fact of the matter is, SAW guys and there are people like Virata, TAIYO YUDEN, OpCos. They're all largely SAW guys. They're still here in this area. We do see some FBAR on -- entrants, as we mentioned correctly. We have license TriQuint to do it, and we are probably best -- 1 or 2 other guys who tried to do it. But do keep in mind, obviously, 2 things: one is we have lots of IP around it, huge thickets of IP on FBAR, but more importantly, in my view, we've been doing this thing now for 15 years. We are now in our eighth generation of FBAR process. We like to believe we will outrun, outcompete anybody in this market in the straight marketplace.

And everyone of us now do -- in regard to that, I think we are pretty sure that there is a big, large installations happening, that it will be -- that will be, as we put it, as they call it, term it, trials. And these are very large volume that they're putting -- installing for trials currently and it's interesting how they're building it up. But they definitely are. We think -- our exposure to it comes in 3 ways, interesting enough. We sell components something from -- our multi-RF multi-market components, our low-noise amplifiers, maxes, even small-single amplifiers occasionally into those base stations that are being installed. So something like 200,000 is a war that's going on for trials. That's still going on. We are -- that's fought and won. We also see, and related to that structure, that once those base stations are in and things are starting to operate and the license are in, they have to do backhauling of those signals. And that's where a lot of our core routing would have an opportunity to participate in. And finally, of course, with TD-LTE, handset needs TD-LTE handsets operating in those bands, those spectrum tend to have very strong coexistence issues with WiFi, which is also a very prevalent spectrum and very common spectrum in China, among other things. So great opportunity of coexistence for FBAR. So we're going to get in 3 ways. Right now, when we think it will happen? I don't know.

You've got 1,000 little points in there. I don't know where to start, but let me start with number one, I didn't say my gross margin has been at 50%. I'm sorry, you may have misheard. What I meant was perhaps whether 50% was used was that -- the mix of our wireless revenues last quarter versus the same quarter a year ago was 50% versus low 40s. And in spite of that mix of wireless, our overall corporate gross margin remained at 51%. That's just to clarify that, but our gross margin in wireless, I didn't not say at all that it was 50%. It doesn't mean it isn't, it's just that we do not disclose separately gross margin by product in segments, if you don't mind. But to answer your question, yes, I think it's definitely improving gross margin in our wireless business as the content of FBAR increases and it is whether it is increase of content through discrete duplex -- FBAR duplexes or filters versus in the form of a pad, it helps. Obviously, we've a pad, as you call it, has been a power amplifier duplexer module, the mix -- it somewhat dilute the overall mix, but the trend is all in the right direction. And what we do see and recognize is and that's a point I was trying to show -- make in my opening remarks earlier is that even as our wireless business as a percent of total revenues do grow, the improving gross margin, we are seeing in our overall wireless business because of a favorable product mix will continue to improve. And that we definitely are seeing -- have been seeing, which basically reestablishes our longer-term model, which is that we will grow as a company long-term and we will, over time, expand our gross margin. Okay, now, will things group revert back to more power amplifiers? That's never say impossible, but all indications are architectures of next-generation smartphones as we foresee, as we have visibility on, is obviously, pushing in a direction that we view as very favorable from our overall product mix in wireless.",357,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

All the big, easy chunks of spectrum were given, 3G followed thereafter and a lot of the big chunks were given away. What's left when we -- by the time we reached 4G, was a sliver and chunks, a little bit here and there scattered all over. And that's when the challenge of -- to the carriers shows up. Because for LTE or 4G, you don't have chunks of it, you have little slivers of bandwidth of spectrum scattered all over the spectrum, some of them very far, but none of them quite combined to a fast channel. And that's when carrier aggregation really drive it. So it is -- it's true, if 4G or LTE is what creates the impetus towards looking at carrier aggregation because carriers have multiple slivers that you need to put together and make into one big set pie.

We're going to start today by reviewing recent end market business highlights and then Tony will provide a summary of third quarter fiscal 2013 financial results.
As I begin, let me remind you that our third quarter results included 5 weeks of contribution from CyOptics. With that, revenue for our third quarter fiscal year was $644 million, which included $21 million from CyOptics. Non-CyOptics-related revenues grew 11% from last quarter and were above the upper end of our guidance of 6% to 9%. Wired infrastructure was up 18% sequentially and industrial was also up 18%, both well ahead of our regional guidance. This more than offset weaker-than-expected results from wireless, which ended up 3% growth sequentially in the quarter.
Now, looking at Q4, we do -- we expect overall revenue to grow between 12% to 15% sequentially. This includes a full quarter, or 13 weeks, of revenue contribution from CyOptics, which is forecast to be approximately $55 million. I want to highlight too, that, excluding CyOptics, we expect to grow revenue, high single-digits sequentially, as well as year-over-year.
Let me provide more color on each of our target markets. Starting with wireless, over the last several months, as you are no doubt all aware, the smartphone market -- high-end smartphone market, in particular, has softened. Recent OEM smartphone launches have disappointed. I would note, however, that our wireless business is still up 19% year-over-year in Q3. The reason is simply content. The emerging proliferation of LTE, first, in North America, then Japan, and now gradually rolling out in Europe and soon to follow in China, drives the need for higher performance RF. With proprietary RF bar filters and pads, power amplifier duplexer, front end modules that is, Avago is focused on solving the most difficult RF challenges, and as a result, we believe we are capturing the most value-added sockets.
Now, having said that, the competitive landscape continues to evolve pretty much as we expected, as emerging players in filters are now showing up. But we believe our position remains very strong as we continue to invest in design innovation, process technology and capacity. As a result, I continue to be confident in our wireless growth prospects going forward.
Looking at Q4, interestingly, our 2 largest smartphone customers are ramping their next-generation platforms, and our content in both these platforms continue to improve substantially. As a result, we anticipate our Q4 wireless revenue to grow mid-teens, sequentially, on a percentage basis.
Moving on to wired infrastructure target market. Here, non-CyOptics wired revenue grew 18% sequentially in Q3, as I mentioned, and represented 28% of overall revenues. Data center related demand was particularly strong, helped by the accelerating transition from 10G to 40G. Our ASIC SerDes business had a record quarter. In the past, we have highlighted our increasing design wins at major networking OEMs and we clearly saw the benefits of that in the current -- in the recent quarter. 
In fiber, after 2 lackluster quarters, due to flat, traditional enterprise spending, increased data spend -- increased data center spend, I should say -- also pushed up demand for our 10G, as well as our 40G optical transceiver products. Looking forward to Q4, we see data center spending continuing to sustain, including strong demand for 40G products.
Finally, we see core routing demand returning, driven particularly by backhaul build-outs in China. As a result, we expect wired infrastructure revenue, excluding CyOptics, to grow sequentially. Demand for CyOptics Edge Emitting Lasers and receivers is strong, due to the rollout of 100G coherent telecom networks and 40G single-mode fiber interconnects in large data centers. We are transitioning certain low-margin subsystem business into related higher-margin component sales. Notwithstanding this transition, helped by strong market demand worldwide, we expect that -- we expect CyOptics to contribute approximately $55 million in net revenue in Q4. In a nutshell, we anticipate overall wired infrastructure revenue, which includes for CyOptics, to grow approximately 20% sequentially.
Now switching gears to our industrial target market. Net sales grew 18% in Q3, which was much stronger than my expectation at the beginning of the quarter and accounted for 24% of our overall revenue. Worldwide industrial's resales were up again this quarter, led by China and Japan, which were very strong. We also saw some limited inventory replenishments in our OEM customers and the channel after 2 quarters of de-stocking, which we believe was related to our customers' confidence in the sustainability of current end market demand.
In China, we saw strength in transportation, as well as power generation and distribution. In Japan, we benefited from exports of silver dry [ph] by our Tier 1 OEMs and strong emerging demand for PV inverters in small-scale solar systems.
Focusing on Q4, we expect resales to continue to be up. However, after the robust revenue uptick and the inventory replenishment we saw in the previous quarter, we expect revenue from this target market to be roughly flat sequentially.
In summary, therefore, we exceeded our revenue expectations in Q3 and that -- as a -- sorry, we exceeded our revenue expectation in Q3, as a pronounced improvement in our wired and industrial businesses mitigated the underperformance in wireless. For Q4, we expect wired to continue to perform, while new generation smartphone REMs [ph] and our 2 largest customers give us confidence wireless will be very strong. As a result, excluding CyOptics, we expect to grow revenues high single-digits sequentially, as well as year-over-year. Including the contribution from CyOptics, though, we expect overall revenue to grow between 12% to 15% sequentially in Q4.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our third quarter financials.",955,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2013",2013-08-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3749.0,507992.0,23439709.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the third quarter fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com. 
Revenue of $644 million in Q3 represents an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 6% versus the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the approximately 1-month contribution from CyOptics, which was slightly higher than expected, Avago's non-CyOptics revenue grew 11% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential strength from our non-CyOptics business was a result of much stronger demand in wired infrastructure and better-than-expected recovery in industrial compared to our prior expectation. As Hock discussed earlier, revenue from wireless target market was below our expectations.
FoxConn continued to be a greater-than-10% customer in Q3.
Our Q3 gross margin was 50.9%. Better product mix drove gross margins higher for our non-CyOptics business compared to the prior quarter, which was offset by the negative impact of CyOptics on our overall gross margins. I should note that the non-GAAP gross margin for CyOptics also outperformed our expectation.
Turning to operating expenses. OpEx for Q3 came in at $137 million, in line with our guidance when you include the guidance we gave for CyOptics business. R&D expenses increased by $3 million to $91 million as a result of higher R&D investment, as well as 1 month R&D spending for CyOptics. SG&A increased by $4 million to $46 million due primarily to higher offensive litigation expenses in addition to 1 month of SG&A costs related to CyOptics. As a percentage of sales, R&D decreased to 14% from 16% in the prior quarter and SG&A remained at 7% of net revenue. CyOptics' operating expenses came in at the low end of our expectation.
Income from operations for the quarter increased by $33 million sequentially to $191 million and represented 30% of net revenue compared to the $186 million for Q3 of last year, income from operations increased by $5 million. Other income was $4 million, which was a gain in fair value of marketable securities representing minority interests.
Taxes came in at $7 million for Q3, in line with our guidance.
Q3 net income of $188 million increased 23% from the prior quarter and Q3 earnings per diluted share of $0.74 was $0.13 higher than Q2. The sequential increase in Q3 earnings is attributable primarily to growth in non-CyOptics revenue, as well as earnings contribution from CyOptics. Compared to Q3 of last year, net income was $6 million higher and earnings per diluted share was $0.02 higher for similar reasons.
Our share-based compensation in Q3 was $20 million. The breakdown of the expense for Q3 includes $3 million in cost of goods sold, $8 million in R&D and $9 million in SG&A. In Q4, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $21 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding came in at 52 days. This was up 8 days from the prior quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in the quarter and unfavorable impact of CyOptics DSO. Impact of CyOptics is 5 days unfavorable. Our inventory ended at $248 million, an increase of $55 million from last quarter. In addition to $32 million of CyOptics inventory, which negatively impacted our inventory days on hand, we continue to build wireless inventory in anticipation of various product launches with our smartphone OEM customers. Days on hand were 82 days. Impact of CyOptics is 6 days unfavorable.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $863 million and we generated $137 million in operational cash flow. We spent $65 million on capital expenditures. We also spent $400 million of cash on CyOptics acquisition in the quarter. For Q4, we expect CapEx to be approximately $67 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares, which consumed $38 million of cash. We continue to be committed to a share buyback program that aims to limit dilution from employee-related stock issuances. 
On June 28, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per ordinary share, which consumed $52 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 2011, to date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter.
Now let me turn our non-GAAP guidance for fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. Total revenue is expected to grow by 12% to 15% from Q3. Gross margin is expected to be 50%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $12 million, and finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 254 million shares.

Let me try to parse that and go one by one. Let's talk about market trends short term, Q4 and specific to the rest of the year. What we do see is, other than our 2 largest smartphone OEM customers, in the higher-end phone range especially, we see a few other phone OEMs launching new phone programs. I mean you have seen that especially on -- we see about Optimus, we see Nexus coming out and we see a few other Lumias coming out, around that, later in the year. But, obviously, the 2 biggest high-end smartphones makers are making the news and we see both programs launching this particular quarter, definitely in the second half of this particular quarter. And right now, as we perceive it, inventory is the least of our problems, in that regard of excess inventory. We are ramping up very, very strongly to try to meet demand. Very, very strongly and very, very urgently just to meet demand of those several smartphone OEMs that we have to support at this stage, okay? That's pretty much what I would limit my discussion to, as to say. A lot of the bookings, a lot of the backlog is in place and what we're trying to do is really an interesting challenge to our supply chain to meet it all. But we'll get there. Then, as far as the second part of your questions on mix, in the short term, both are happening. There are quite a few satellites and discrete FBARs, satellite PAs and discrete FBARs that happens. We also obviously see, from our perspective, quite a bit of head architectures that are also happening. And it varies, obviously, from OEM to OEM, and the best way to answer is we see both. We are seeing both as we see right now. Obviously, increased FBAR architecture comes from increased LTE bands that are now put into a lot of these high-end smartphones, which needed to be supported and yet not some of them. Many of them are not supported as pads but rather supported on a discrete basis. So we see quite a considerable mix of both in this next 6 months, I guess the best way to describe it.",378,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then to follow-up on the industrial business. Clearly, there, your results had been lagging a lot of your peers for a while, but now have caught up and then some it seems like. So can you maybe talk about the channel behavior, and specifically the distributors, what you're seeing from them? Is it a matter of their inventories got too low and they needed to replenish somewhat or they just feel better about overall demand? So do you feel like you're more or less shipping in line with any consumption at this point?",97,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Aug 27, 2013",2013-08-27,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3749.0,507992.0,23439714.0,Answer,Hock Tan,,Executives,8,"Well, obviously, we're not trying to be too smart about it. Consumption, definitely showing consumption a bit tricky. But I'll tell you what we see in China. In China, a lot of customers are not huge and their management of supply chain is extremely short term. And what we do see, what we have always seen in China and continues that way, is when they perceive end markets to be not as strong, they'll be the first, our Chinese customers in industrial, will be the first to disappear from the demand horizon. And when things go turnaround, they're always the first to show up and they tend to probably replenish their de-stocked inventory level very quickly. And I believe a big part of what we're seeing in Q3 was exactly what happened. A lot of OEMs, small OEMs, midsized OEMs in China came in and bought, and bought pretty heavy. And our China -- revenue -- industrial business in China grew double digits, strong double digits I should say. As they did in Japan and yet Japan is different in a sense. There was a lot of exports in Japan perhaps helped by the yen, also helped by lumpy business related to machine-to-machine tool and automation investment or handset makers in China. And so we see a combination of that influence. As far as channel inventory is concerned, we didn't see -- keep in mind, for the last 2 quarters, we have been de-stocking our channel inventory. So what happened last quarter, we've -- especially Chinese customer jumping in and replenishing their stock, our channel inventory also went up. Overall, our total channel inventory went up about less than mid-single digits overall. So, while it did go up, it's in a limited basis. So most of the OEMs took on the parts.",302,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And frankly, it disappeared because the timing of phone launches, at least with the markets where we address, seems to have overridden that seasonal trends. So it's more the timing, and especially the timing of large phone OEM makers. In this particular case, I'll start with Q4, what we are seeing here is -- our strength here is seen by 2 of our largest customers in wireless are launching their next-generation phone platforms almost at the same time, very interesting. And so we are seeing, basically, revenue aggregating, I guess, in one quarter. Probably another quarter beyond that one. Not making a forecast here, but it seems it will probably run over, does it's effect of this quarter and you'll probably rollover to the quarter after that, but in a very, very strong manner. Now they're not the only guys who -- because we seem to see some other phone OEM makers, we're also launching new phone platforms somewhere over the current September, October, November timeframe also, especially September, October timeframe. So everybody seems to rush in and maybe that's also tied to seasonality for Christmas. I just happen to think that maybe a larger part of it is they choose to do it all at the same time, by coincidence or maybe not so coincident. And that's what's happening this quarter. Meanwhile, back to last quarter. Last quarter was, obviously, a different interest because there wasn't any particular large phone launches, that we see for ourselves, that would benefit us last quarter. It was more a broad-based sustainability of smartphone OEM customers coming in for demand. And it was pretty nice too, because it still enabled us to grow 3%, maybe less than what we had expected. But, all things considered, wasn't too bad from our perspective. But it was more a variety of the other multiple phone makers all sustaining, and in some cases, launching new programs that kept our revenue and then sustained our wireless revenue last quarter. This particular quarter is unusually impact of 2 big guys and several other small guys launching new phone programs.",367,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I guess, as my follow-up. On the wired side of things, if you take the CyOptics out of it, for answering this part of the question, seems like you grew about 17%, 18% organically quarter-over-quarter in July and you're implying guidance of 4% or 5% in the October quarter. Can you just talk through what drove the big upside and then why the slowdown, a little bit, from a sequential perspective? Is it inventory? What, did you fill a channel?

Most of it goes right direct to our large OEM customers. The likes of Cisco, among others, in Juniper and there is others. And, well, I mean we saw pretty decent growth in Q3, in fact, very good growth in Q3, especially on the ASIC side. We probably expect to see a bit of a pause, as is typical, and we're going by that. Having said that, on the fiber side, we're continuing to see a lot of strength, especially now with the return of core routing this particular Q4 quarter. So, yes, when we weigh these 2 things together, which is basically a relative slowdown after very robust Q3 for ASIC but continuing strength in our fiber. And that hasn't slowed down, in our view, from Q3. We probably do not expect the 18% sequential growth in Q3 to be able to sustain in Q4. But it's nothing to do with any fundamental trends in the end market. The fundamental trend is data center spending. This continues to sustain and be strong and the conversion in this data center spending, the build out, rollout of data centers, not just in America, in China as well, is driving a lot of demand for
40G optical transceivers, as well as the switches and routing, the switches, especially data centers switches that go through a bid that will drive our ASIC business. So that's still there, that's the strength from Q3 to Q4 unchanged. And what is now thrown into the Q4 mix is core routing. But offsetting that is we do not expect our ASIC demand, our shipment, to be as strong in Q4 as it has been in Q3.",299,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And when you focus on China, the same thing does apply in the sense that TD-LTE does require FBAR as due because of the interaction coexistence, so to speak, with Wi-Fi. And so we are seeing demand for those FBAR filters in China very nicely, ramping up very nicely. And in some of those -- and in -- while it's -- basically, we -- we do see competition now.

I think on the operating expense side, it was -- we were thinking that it'd be 3 to 4. It ended up being slightly below 3 for CyOptics. And we don't see any specific operating expense growth there.

You're asking for a long-term thing, not just a couple of quarters that passed. Tell me out 1 year or out, and I'll be -- I'll tell you, we expect gradual industrial recovery because industrial, over the past and before this quarter and last -- especially before Q3 last fiscal quarter, industrial as an overall end market demand, has actually declined. And it's a secular decline, in my view. And I think we are seeing a gradual steady recovery of industrial that has happened with recovery of various economies. And with the fact that China needs to spend some money on infrastructure development, no doubt they are not -- maybe not as large as it used to be in 2010. But still, they need to spend, as we pointed out, this quarter for Q3. And they continue to spend this quarter on power distribution, power generation and high-speed transportation. We see -- and we see a recovery gradually of America and even the European economies. So I see industrial over the past -- next 12 months to gradually recover. We see from our end, we will go improve with the tide. As far as wired infrastructure is concerned, we have quite a few fairly exciting products that are very unique, very proprietary, very valuable to several of our OEM -- large OEM customers, which will launch over the next 12 months, which will enable us, we believe, to outperform even the enterprise networking industry. And so we see that as really a strong growth pattern. And within all this, in the context of all this, we see our wireless business, if you look at it year-on-year, grow at about 10% to 20% year-on-year. And we have been doing that around mid-teens for the last 3 years or so, and I don't see that changing. Is within a year, the wireless business does get rather seasonal, as someone put it earlier, I call it more volatile within a year as we move quarter-to-quarter. But when you look year-on-year, our wireless business has been steadily growing at around 15% a year. And the funny part about it is I do expect over the next 12 months or so that, probably, our wired infrastructure business might even outgrow our wireless business.",381,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And you've seen our history and what we've done with that. The share buyback program is something we're getting more consistent on. And I think you'll see after a couple of quarters the consistency there. So I don't think those will be necessarily impacted by anything we do on the CapEx side. As for our FBAR expansion plans, we're in kind of the last phase right now of the current expansion plan. And I'd like to remind everyone that everything we've spent pretty much in the wireless area has been for capacity. There has been no huge R&D, CapEx expenditure here to date. It's all been capacity adds. And we're finishing that up at the end of this year. A little bit will trail into next year.

What you're really asking, if I could put it in a simple -- in a more direct context, is, are we seeing a lot of competition in FBAR filters? I would preface that by saying, we always have competition from SAW filter manufacturers, from SAW filters. SAW filters may not perform as well as FBAR, but in many, many bands, they perform adequately. And given the price differential between FBAR and SAW filters, many phone makers prefer to use SAW filter cost point of view. Having said that, the increasing number of bands, some of them in China and in Europe and even North America, where those bands require the use of FBAR filters or duplexes, I should say, or filters, in order to get -- receive signals in an adequate -- in a satisfactory manner to meet those specs. And in those areas, we have, as I mentioned in my remarks, seen some emerging players showing up and offering those kind of -- similar kind of FBAR filters, perhaps. That's true. Having said that, we are still, by far, larger. We are still also, in terms of technology and design performance, by far, well ahead of all those. But having said that, we are not taking that -- we are not -- we're obviously taking those competitions seriously, and we will continue to do that. And the way we do that and stay ahead of the game is we continue to design filters faster and better even in terms of next-generation filters for the same band, much better than our competition. And really, it's all about staying ahead in the marketplace. We do see some of that. But as I pointed out earlier regarding an earlier question related to the same thing, we're still very far ahead of the curve, and we intend to remain that way. And we certainly intend to differentiate ourselves either on a discrete basis by having very high-performing filters for some of the phones or bands in China that requires those filters in TD-LTE and Wi-Fi or that we couple it with, as you pointed out, power amplifiers, very good performing amplifiers, to create what we call front-end modules or pads, which takes away -- which removes a lot of competition from players who either do not have FBAR filters or do not have power amplifiers [indiscernible], okay? And that's -- there are not many players out there who have both FBAR filters and power amplifiers, and by that, I mean have those capability in a very, very advanced and technologically progressive manner. There are very few out there.",449,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And obviously, there are not that many of them around that does those kind of -- and we focus on enterprise networking, enterprise basically rather than telecoms for transport. And I conclude, as part of enterprise, data centers guides a new breed of players who are coming in and building their own data centers, people like Google, as an example, or Facebook or Amazon, among others. So there's a mix of players there. But having said that, our core customers are the likes of Ciscos, Junipers and a few other OEM names, which we support very closely, we develop products that are, in some cases, unique and proprietary to these people so that they can effectively provide a solution sale to the likes of Google, Amazon and others as well.

That might be a bit challenging. But that aside, even in filters, FBAR filters, in its own right, okay? As I mentioned, we're in generation #8 or 9 in FBAR filters.

Well, when, right, I think, in the midst of -- for large data centers -- a lot of large data centers, we're in the midst of seeing build-outs of data centers that uses 40 GB, obviously, because there's -- it's 4x the bandwidth for every port. So we are seeing a lot of that happening. And it's interesting, simultaneous to that happening, we are obviously seeing a lot, as we have been seeing for the past 12 months, and continuing acceleration of doing conversion of 1 GB to 10G. Well, that's also happening. But certainly, what we've seen over the last several months is very, very strong surge for 40G.

That's why 40 GB is happening. 100 GB, 100G in, I guess, equipment, 100G interconnect are just interconnect being for short-reach data centers as opposed to the telecoms, fiber optics, transport. From the enterprise point of view, very little of that, if any, has happened. I think there's more. 100G will be more of a 2015 event rather than right now. Right now, what we're seeing is more 40G.",253,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So maybe that -- so on the high-end side smartphones, high-end smartphones have slowed down, though I think low-end smartphones conversion from feature phones are still continuing very well. So that's one trend. But in the other side -- the opposite side of the trend is in a lot of smartphones, especially even the high-end smartphones that appeared to have slowed down, the content is accelerating. We are now talking about smartphones that has and going to 10 bands in 1 phone. And over the next 1 to 2 years, 2 years -- within 2 years, going to over 15 bands in 1 phone. And that's probably because of the proliferation of bands, LTE especially coming in, and the requirement for LTE phones, as I many times pointed out, to be backward interoperable with 3G, which has a whole [indiscernible] UMTS, which has multiple bands. And even back to EDGE, 2G or CDMA, which has itself its own set of bands. So when you add it all up, each phone, each smartphone begins to carry a fairly sizable amount of bands. And as you know, each of those bands require their own peculiar unique RF composing nature and components. So content is what drives it. That's what we are seeing now. Of course, I love for my 2 largest OEMs to keep growing share and grow bigger as other OEMs that has bought. But reality of what we are very good at is, as I said, we're getting more and more content in those same phones.",317,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

When we stepped -- we sell -- when we referred to 40 GB, in particular, it's wired enterprise networking for us, which include data centers. There are 2 subsystems or components we sell in this market. There's the ASICs we support, selected OEM customers' ways. And many of these ASICs, especially, go into this new generation of switching switches and routers that are -- that -- which -- that supports 40G data transport -- data transfers, I should say. So that one, we are one step removed, but that's obviously what you're referring to as much because we don't sell boxes, we sell ASICs. And they are pretty much extended prices predetermined years ago. And then the other part of business we sell is fiber optics transceivers or interconnects, you want to call it that, that populate and allow data to be transferred from 1 switch -- from a switch to the server -- to another switch or router. And those -- where we sell those are in the enterprise short-reach data centers, as well as enterprise networking. And here, I'll be direct, we see very little competition, much less price degradation. Okay, maybe you're referring to 40 GB long-reach transport for metro networks and those stuff. And that, by the way, we now have visibility through our acquisition of CyOptics, whereas CyOptics sales do sell and continue -- has been selling the lasers and chip components to support module makers who make those products to sell into that space. And that's possible because 40G single mode for data transport, metro networks have been around now for a couple of years, at least, if not longer and for quite a while now. And those probably have seen some price competition, especially on the module side, but not on the enterprise networking side of the whole thing, where you're talking more short reach in data transfers.",322,5.0,8.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8

Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing our market business highlights, and then Tony will provide a summary of fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results.
Revenue from our fourth quarter fiscal year was $738 million, represented an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 19% from the same quarter a year ago. Sequential increase was at the upper end of our guidance, which was 12% to 15% growth. To perhaps provide you with some further comparability to last quarter in which CyOptics only contributed about 5 weeks of revenues, our total non-CyOptics revenue grew 8% from last quarter.
During Q4, wireless was very strong, driven by major product ramps and our large smartphone OEM customers. Wired infrastructure was up 22% sequentially, primarily due to a full quarter of revenue contribution from CyOptics. These more than offset the weaker-than-expected industrial revenue, which ended up with a sequential decline of 4%. Let me now provide more color in each of our target markets, starting with wireless.
Revenue from wireless came in above expectation, growing 19% sequentially and represented 47% of our total revenues. Sequential strength was driven primarily by strong product ramps, as I mentioned earlier, and our 2 largest OEM customers. As you may have seen from the independent third-party teardowns, our content in both of these platforms improved substantially compared to prior generations. As a result of the proliferation of LTE today and the challenges in RF designs, our proprietary FBAR filter and integrated front-end module have proliferated in many smartphones. We see this trend continuing to drive our wireless business over the next few generations.
Now looking into Q1 of fiscal 2014. We expect strong demand from our 2 major smartphone OEM customers to sustain and be only partially offset by the seasonal weakness at other OEMs. As a result, we expect overall wireless revenue to be flat, perhaps maybe even slightly down in Q1.
Moving on to  wired infrastructures. Wired revenue, as I mentioned, grew 22% sequentially, represented 33% of overall revenues. Our non-CyOptics wired revenue was up single digits after a pronounced 18% sequential growth in Q3. Data center-related  demand continues to be strong, particularly for our 40-gigabit-per-second fiber optical products. However, our ASIC service business paused temporarily after a record high during Q3 due primarily from inventory adjustment with major OEMs. Meanwhile, demand for CyOptics Indium Phosphide based optical components was strong due to an uptick in 100G coherent telecom networks and 40G single-mode long reach interconnects in large data centers.
Looking forward to Q1, however, we expect that sustained strength in data center spending in 40G will be partially offset by a pause in carrier routing spending in China. In this Q1 also, we begin to convert the low margin module revenue in China to relate to the high-margin component sales as part of our transformation of the CyOptics business model out of the telecoms in our module infrastructure. Accordingly, we anticipate wired infrastructure revenue to decline mid-single digits on a percentage basis compared with Q4.
Switching gears to industrial, during Q4, worldwide industrial resales were down mid-single digits, driven particularly by softness in China and Japan. Europe and North America, however, remained relatively flat. The decline in China resales reflect that, I should say, restocking by Chinese OEMs during the preceding quarter and showed very much a characteristic volatility of Chinese OEM customers. No surprise, therefore, our industrial sales declined 4% in Q4 and represented about 20% of our overall revenues. Looking forward into Q1, we expect seasonal weakness globally. We will continue to reduce inventory into our distribution channels as we have done so last quarter. Accordingly, we anticipate revenue from industrial to decline mid-single digits too on a percentage basis compared to the preceding quarter.
With this, in summary, I would -- let me recap. Q4 was strong, product ramps in wireless and strong fiber demand in data center buildout and telecoms infrastructure. Q4 -- in Q1 that we're in, we expect demand in wireless to sustain, but year-end seasonal weakness in enterprise spending, as well as industrial, will drive 3% to 6% sequential revenue decline. However, on a year-over-year basis, we expect the trend in our business -- in our major businesses, to remain solid, with a projected high-single digit year-on-year growth for Q1, even without the benefit -- even without the accretion of CyOptics.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financials.",759,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
25016048.0,"Avago Technologies Limited, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Dec 04, 2013",2013-12-04,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3269.0,559547.0,25520450.0,Presenter Speech,Anthony Maslowski,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com.
Revenue of $738 million in Q4 represents an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 19% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The better-than-expected sequential growth was a result of stronger demand from both wireless and wired infrastructure target markets. Revenue from our industrial target market was below our prior expectation, primarily due to weaker-than-expected distribution resales. In the quarter, Foxconn continued to be a greater than 10% customer.
Our Q4 gross margin was 50.5%, 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margins improved in specific product categories, offsetting total unfavorable product mix.
Turning to operating expenses, OpEx for Q4 came in at $144 million, in line with our guidance. R&D expenses increased by $8 million to $99 million, primarily due to full quarter R&D spending for CyOptics. SG&A decreased by $1 million to $45 million. As a percentage of sales, R&D decreased to 13% from 14% in the prior quarter. And similarly, SG&A decreased to 6% from 7% of net revenue.
Income from operations for the quarter increased by $38 million sequentially to $229 million and represented 31% of net revenue. Compared to $199 million for Q4 of last year, income from operations increased by $30 million. We recorded a net gain of $11 million in other income, primarily due to a gain in fair value of marketable securities representing minority investments.
Taxes came in at $13 million for Q4, slightly above our guidance. Q4 net income of $227 million increased 21% from the prior quarter. In Q4, earnings per diluted share of $0.89 was $0.15 higher than Q3. The sequential increase in Q4 earnings is attributable primarily to the full quarter earnings contribution from CyOptics, as well as higher revenue from non-CyOptic businesses. Compared to Q4 of last year, net income was $33 million higher, and earnings per diluted share was 12% higher for similar reasons.
I'd like to point out that Q4 2013 marked the record highs for revenue, operating income, as well as net income. Our share-based compensation in Q4 was $22 million. The breakdown of expense for Q4 includes $3 million in cost of goods sold, $8 million in R&D and $11 million in SG&A. In Q1 2014, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $24 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense.
Moving on to the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding came in flat at 52 days compared to the prior quarter. Timing of shipments in the quarter and unfavorable impact of CyOptics DSO continued to weigh on Avago's total DSO. Our inventory ended at $285 million, a slight increase of $1 million from last quarter. Our wireless inventory remained at the elevated level in anticipation of continued strength from one of our large smartphone OEM customers.
Days on hand were 71 days, which decreased 11 days from Q3, given the much higher revenue during the quarter. We also took the opportunity in Q4, given the favorable credit market, to resize our revolving credit facility. As you have seen, we've entered into a new credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal of up to $575 million with an ability to increase it to $675 million compared to our previous $300 million facility.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $985 million, and we generated $212 million in operational cash flow. Just to foreshadow Q1 a bit for you, Q1 is a generally weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year. We spent $57 million on capital expenditures, this was below our guidance for the quarter, mainly because of the timing of equipment delivery. For Q1, we expect CapEx to be approximately $63 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased 852,000 shares, which consumed $33 million of cash. On September 30, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per ordinary share, which consumed $57 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011 to date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter.
Now let me briefly recap our fiscal 2013 full year results. Revenue increased by 7% to $2.52 billion, mainly driven by the strength in our wireless business. Avago's overall gross margin decreased by nearly 20 basis points to 50.8% as compared to 51% for fiscal 2012. Net income for fiscal 2013 increased to $731 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, as compared to $700 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, in fiscal 2012.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. Total revenue is expected to be down in the range of 3% to 6% from Q4. Gross margin is expected to be 50.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $10 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 257 million shares.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",938,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Now, of course, we are heading in our Q1 numbers into a Christmas quarter, so there will be some holidays in which we'll expect that seasonal downturn, as it happens every year, when we hit our fiscal Q1 because of the Christmas holidays and all that. But otherwise, on a run-rate basis, weekly, it's pretty stable in North America and Europe industrial. China, however, which is a big engine on driving industrial -- among the global industrial OEMs worldwide, as well as not just China purchasers, it's a very volatile industrial market. It's up one quarter, down the next, and up again, and that's probably because of the buying characteristics of Chinese OEMs. We tend to behave like this is a PC market almost. So they buy one quarter, we stock up, and then the next quarter it disappears. And if they see the demand coming in, everybody rushes to buy. So you get very volatile demand in China quarter-on-quarter, and we are seeing that. And Japan, it's part [ph] a lot to China, and they get dragged along by China. And so what we've seen over the last quarter and this quarter, too, is China is not -- is relatively down, slightly down, and Japan with it. So overall, because of that seasonality on one side and characteristic buying behavior in China, industrial is kind of down. And the best way to describe is probably down mid-single digits.",265,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

Let's start with the easier one, which is the non-CyOptics business, which is largely now -- a lot of it is component sales to the telecoms industry -- infrastructure industry, that is. But let's talk about what we are -- what is Avago's fiber business largely before CyOptics, which is enterprise. Here, the big driver is data centers, large data center build-outs, less so on traditional enterprise networking. In traditional enterprise networking, you won't see a lot of buyout from some of our large OEM customers, recent earnings announcements and commentary. It's kind of flat, very flat. Data center build-outs are one -- big data center build-outs seems to be what drives it, and seems to be what drives a big part of the -- of our growth to the extent that there is growth in some of these areas. And that's 40G. As the business starts -- things start to move from 10G, which is getting mature now, 10G, to 40G, which is exciting fun, one -- the guys who are leading the charge here  are data center build-outs. And that is still very good. Meanwhile, traditional enterprise is, at best, flattish, and that's what we see there, in fiber optics, and we translate that into the ASIC SerDes that we supply to several major OEMs in enterprise networking. We see that happening, which is what I mentioned about pause until 40G catches on. Coming back to your second question on CyOptics, no surprise as we indicated to you when we bought this company, is they have a combination of module or subsystem business, especially in China Fiber to the Home, as well as the do component sales into -- especially the new coherent 40 and 100G networks. That business is very exciting, and we're definitely continuing to push on it. As far as the subsystem business, the module business in China, especially as it relates to telecoms infrastructure, as well as Fiber to the Home, those are businesses that are extremely competitive. Our competitive edge are the laser components, chips, as well as lasers and receivers that we sell. That makes us unique and the technology unique. So we are basically transitioning, starting this quarter, as we mentioned, from selling subsystems to selling components to the same customers, to the same end customers and application, I would add. The impact will be a reduction in revenue, which will happen, and -- but an increase in gross margin percentage.

Well, used to be, few years back, and it still is to some extent, depending on how you look at it, I guess, is seasonality in handsets simply because, I guess, usually before Christmas, now Chinese New Year as well, but usually before Christmas, year end, promotions happen and handset growth is very strong, especially October, November. December, things roll over and generally is a bloody disaster in demand, and that's typically how handset business grows. As however, the business, especially what matters a lot, the smartphone business, consolidates into 2 very big guys. The timing of product launches, the key product launches of those 2 guys, takes over a lot of the seasonality. Now it happens that those launches, especially on one of the big guys, coincides with year end. So we still see that sharp, very sharp year-end seasonality. For us, we see that particular strength in our fiscal Q4 and our fiscal Q1, the current quarter. Then after that, fiscal Q2, the following fiscal Q2 and Q3 would dip rather precipitously as we go through transition to the next product generation. And then up it goes again, the roller coaster ride again, in Q4 and the following Q1. And that's the new seasonality we are seeing. Not that much different, perhaps, from the old seasonality, except because of consolidation and concentration of customers, it's now become more pronounced.",232,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

One is, of course, our Q1, as we call it, fiscal Q1, ends in January. And Chinese New Year this time around is at the end of our fiscal Q1. If anything else, before Chinese New Year starts, as you know, it's not demand that determines, it's supply. The factories in China wants to pull in as much as they can before customs and all that -- logistics shutdown in China as Chinese New Year comes on. So for us, our Q1 might see a pull-in, some -- a little bit of pull-in because of that. Not much, we like to think, but there probably will be some. But that's our Q1. Then other competitor might be talking about Q1 from a traditional calendar March quarter. And as it refers to the Chinese guys, see, it's probably -- depending on which customers they have and who they are referring to versus what we have and what we are referring to, for us, obviously, it's very much tied to 2 large OEM, smartphone OEMs. From the Chinese market point of view, we have obviously substantial revenues there, but it's more -- it's certainly not to the level as we see in our 2 largest OEMs, and we definitely do not participate broadly in the sense of substantial share in the Chinese white-box OEMs at this point, except specialized FBAR filters that are needed in -- as new China LTE bands coming. We don't have that broad overview that perhaps another one of our peer group competitor might have.

The pace of change there is a very much on track. We're very happy with what we're seeing there, and then we still see some potential. We're not going to change anything outwardly to you guys, and we'll probably stop talking about CyOptics individually because as the quarters come forward, CyOptics is really a part of what we call our fiber optics components business.

I think it changes. I don't -- I think the last thing we can assume is that the next year repeats what the previous year goes through in the cycle. But all indications are that -- and the part of it is related to now more than pure seasonality, as I said -- answered in an earlier question. We all calendar seasonality of Christmas and all that is really overriding it. It's the timing of major product launches of a couple of very large OEMs, as you all know. And right -- and one of those OEM launches fairly consistently, at least so far we have seen. The other OEM doesn't behave that same way. So in my -- adjust that profile of that revenue from one, and it probably will. And this coming year, in '14, probably we'll have some level adjustment. But I could be wrong that everything, all things considered, things will work out evenly, like what's happening this quarter. Right? Q1. If you asked me 4 years ago, going back that way, Q1, fiscal Q1, is usually the weakest quarter for our wireless business. Today, it's right up there as the strongest quarter for our wireless business so far in Q1. In fact, as I mentioned, it sustains from the very high Q4 level. The only reason Q1 is maybe down, as I pointed out, is because other than the 2 major OEMs, all -- most other OEMs are actually experiencing the traditional seasonality in their case. So that will be a headwind against the sustaining strength of our 2 largest OEM customers. And that's what we are seeing now. By the next Q4, Q1, say, will the same thing happen? Don't know. Very hard to predict in this business. What we will be sure is we'll go to product transitions to a new generation of smartphones with all those OEMs, particularly the 2 major OEM customers.",335,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

And then just as a follow-up to that, from what you can see with all the design wins in the pipeline, and I think you are keeping CapEx at fairly robust levels, so I assume FBAR demand is staying fairly robust, do you think the wireless business can conceptually grow at a similar sort of mid-teens pace as you managed to grow it over the last 2 years?

Our robust CapEx, as you put it, is not just on wireless. Having said that, you're right. The last couple of years, a big part of it has been on wireless as we build out capacity in FBAR to meet increasing demand, which drives our increasing revenue growth. But that aside, a substantial part of that CapEx is also related to our wired infrastructure business. We are also building out specific capacity, especially in front end, Indium Phosphide fabs or basically our LED laser fabs in Singapore, especially. We're investing in building out capacity there and improving processes there. We're investing in test equipment for proprietary fiber optics. We've also been taping out a whole bunch of ASICs, which we can -- which we treat for accounting purposes as CapEx as well. So our wired infrastructure business is getting a substantial portion of that CapEx spending. As you all know, I correct you on that. And that also indicates our outlook on those businesses as well. And then finally, coming back to your question on wireless, yes. To be fair, it's hard to sustain the level of growth we have been seeing over the last 3 years in wireless. Purely scale of large numbers, nothing else. Having said that, is it still growing as evidenced by the fact we're continuing putting investment in the fabs. But will it grow as fast as the last few years? I tell you this: it depends on how fast LTE bands, LTE smartphones proliferate in new areas like Europe, China and other -- and perhaps that will determine over the next few years the rate of growth of our wireless business. But we're not planning for it to be growing as fast, to answer your question specifically, as we have grown over the last 3 years in wireless.",317,5.0,8.0,0.7777777777777778,0.8

It's all largely been adopted by the guys who are building hyper data centers who are adopting it. And many of these guys are very untraditional in their ways of adopting architectures in both fiber optics, as well as switching and routing. So that's probably the level of innovation you're seeing in the marketplace and, I guess, changes in the trends, which is why I'm very careful to point out traditional enterprise is still chugging along but relatively flat.

And then on our other side, we try to promote proprietary standards. On the standard side, yes, I think price competition has always been there and continues to be there, which is what drove us into the proprietary fiber optics business in the first place. We still sell into standard, which we do -- obviously we do, and it's an important part of our business. But it's never been a nice place to be in because prices keeps dropping. You're first to markets, you won't stay there for long because of standard. And sooner or later, price will plunge. And we continue to see that price degradation even now in 10-Gig. Meanwhile -- not yet in 40 but in 10 gig. Meanwhile, on a proprietary site that we do, prices are more orderly and more manageable. And obviously, we kind of -- somewhat immune from the price frenzy that we see on the standard fiber side.",206,-6.0,7.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7

And I will not just specifically take it as literally as the translated to mean that there's a slowdown in demand. But we've all seen there is not a strong demand across the board on traditional -- in very much in traditional enterprise. In data center build, yes, depending on who you -- who are the winners and losers. You may see strength or you may not -- or you may see flatness. But we also get the sense that for some of our OEMs, there's been over-aggressive -- over-enthusiastic purchasing in the previous quarter, which kind of lead them to pause, especially with the launch of the next -- a new generation of switches and routers. And I suspect a part of that pause is what we are seeing here.

It's already started, as you know, earlier this a -- a few months ago with the launch of the first one, which is the Note 3. Thereafter, I think we are seeing a few other programs coming along with several OEMs. Most of them coming out probably in early part of next year and continuing on to right up to the end of the year. So we see that rollout happening by envelope tracking. Carrier aggregation is somewhat slower. That will even use a lot more FBAR but it's also more slower to get implemented. I think spikes are still being worked out and I probably would guess that you do not really see in any significant amount before end of the year, if not 2015 for carrier aggregation.",152,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We work on a very simple premise in this wireless side. Okay? Our gift to this end market is our FBAR technology, filter technology. Okay? Where they need to be used. And where they need to be used depends on bands, the certain bands. Certain bands require FBAR filters to work. Other bands that are easier, their modulation schemes are easier, do not. They get away with SAW filters. If they can get away with SAW filters, typically, they will get -- will use SAW filters. Then there are some bands in the middle where -- with some phone makers where there are issue of coexistence, interference, and then they use FBAR. And all we are really interested in on this simple basic model is find all the sockets that needs good filtering and sticking FBAR filters. And the world moves -- depending on how the world -- depending which part of the world moves in one direction, you -- we see -- we have been seeing an increase in utilization of FBAR. And example, China. China is not about high-end smartphones as you know, not very much. But if TD-LTE shows up and if -- now, TD-LTE only shows up in maybe high-end smartphones, JoAnne. But eventually, like everything else, TD-LTE becomes mainstream. In every phone in China, say, in most ones in China, TD-LTE runs in the frequency based on the bands right overlapping Wi-Fi. You can't run one without the other in that -- in space. So you need FBAR. Even in low-end phones in China, eventually when it goes mainstream. So it's not about high-end, low-end. Having said all that, what has been driving us over the last few years, generations, it's just -- and it's tied to proliferation of LTE bands, too, by the way, is the fact that phones, particularly smartphones -- but any phone if you want to look at it -- is increasing in content. Because any phone that runs LTE has to be backward compatible to CDMA -- to 3G and CDMA and 2G. So cross-cross. So more and more content goes in a phone. As content increases in the phone, which means number of bands each for -- any phone supports increases, the chances of more filters using FBAR in any one phone increases. And I point on my earlier remarks, it's largely -- what we've been seeing the last couple of years is -- 3 years in fact, is content increase in the phone we sell to, less so the number of unit phones that have been sold out there. It's not about number of increase -- number of phones that is driving our growth now. It's the content those phones that we fell into have of our products.",461,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
