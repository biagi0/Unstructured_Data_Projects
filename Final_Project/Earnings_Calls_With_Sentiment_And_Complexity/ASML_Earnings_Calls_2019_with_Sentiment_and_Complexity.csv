Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2019. 
Q4 net sales came in at EUR 3.14 billion, slightly higher than our guidance. Net system sales of EUR 2.42 billion was more weighted towards Logic at 60% with the remaining 40% from Memory. We shipped 6 EUV systems and recognized EUV revenue of EUR 579 million from 5 shipments. 1 system was shipped to collaborative research center Imec, was not recorded as revenue, which we mentioned last quarter. 
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 719 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 44.3%, which was negatively impacted by the Nikon settlement. Without this charge, the gross margin was 48.5%. 
We signed a memorandum of understanding with Nikon to settle our legal disputes over the alleged patent infringements that was initiated by Nikon. Therefore, we recorded a provision in our 2018 accounts, which has a negative impact of EUR 131 million on gross margin in 2018. Overall, R&D and SG&A expenses came in a little higher than guidance with R&D expenses at EUR 442 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 135 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 345 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q4. This leaves around EUR 1.35 billion of the 2018-2019 share buyback remaining. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.03 billion, which was higher than expected due to early payments by multiple customers at the end of the year.
Moving to the order book. Q4 system bookings came in at EUR 1.59 billion. Logic order intake was 80% of total value with the remaining 20% from Memory. We took 5 new EUV orders in the quarter. 
For the full year, our net sales grew 22% to a record of EUR 10.9 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales was similar to last year at EUR 2.68 billion. We shipped 18 EUV systems with a total EUV system sale of EUR 1.9 billion, representing a significant growth over 2017. 
Our gross margin for 2018 was 46%, which would have been 47.2% without the Nikon settlement charges. We made considerable improvements on our gross margin in 2018 and remain on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020 as confirmed during our Investor Day in November last year.
We continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increased R&D from EUR 1.26 billion in 2017 to EUR 1.58 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV road map. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2018 revenue was about 14% and SG&A was about 5 -- 4.5% of revenue, both similar to 2017 as a percentage of revenue. Net income for the full year grew 25% to a record of EUR 2.6 billion, resulting in 23.7% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 6.10. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2019. We expect Q1 total net sales of about EUR 2.1 billion. The lower revenue guidance is due to a combination of revenue pull into Q4 2018 as well as a reduction in shipments due to a fire at one of our suppliers, Prodrive, and some system demand change. 
As announced in a press release on December 3 last year, there was a fire at one of our suppliers of electronics components and modules. This resulted in a loss of work in progress as well as some inventory. Due to the integral cycle time of about 1 quarter for these modules, our first quarter sales will be negatively affected -- impacted by around EUR 300 million, which we expect to largely recover in Q2. We expect the remainder to be recovered in the second half. 
Our total net sales forecast for Q1 includes around EUR 300 million of EUV system revenue. We currently expect to ship 3 EUV systems in Q1. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to be around EUR 600 million, which is primarily due to lower field upgrades as a result of the Prodrive fire. 
Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be around 40%. The lower gross margin is due to a combination of mix, lower field upgrades, factory loading and EUV service burden. The mix relates to a reduction in higher-margin immersion systems and field upgrades as a result of the Prodrive fire and some system demand change. With lower system sales, there is also a reduction in factory loading, which has a negative impact on gross margins. 
As our EUV installed base continues to grow, we must expand our service infrastructure to support these systems in the field, which is an increased burden on gross margins until we start collecting service revenue later this year. We see the impact from these items continuing into Q2 with an expected recovery in second half. 
The positive margin recovery in the second half will be driven by higher revenue, does improve factory loading as well as increased field upgrades, and we will start shipping the higher-margin NXE:3400C, in addition to realizing EUV service revenue. We expect to move towards our 2020 target of over 50% gross margin as we exit the year.
The higher R&D expenses for Q1, around EUR 480 million, are due to an acceleration of the NXE:3400 road map and growing investments in the High-NA EUV program. SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 130 million, which is similar to prior quarter. 
Although we are currently going through a period of uncertainty in the industry, we look forward to a growth opportunity in 2019. As we remain confident in our long-term growth, we will propose a 50% increase in our dividends to EUR 2.10 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 24 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 880 million. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",1020,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had another good quarter, closing a great year for us with a record demand from our memory and logic customers combined across our entire product portfolio. While the current geopolitical landscape and economic environments are creating volatility in the markets and uncertainty on the near term, as mentioned before, we still expect overall growth in 2019. 
At the very end of last year, we saw the continued slowdown of memory end market demand as well as some demand reduction in the logic end markets primarily driven by the mobile and the server markets. And this translated into pushouts of our planned systems to both memory and logic customers from the first half 2019 in their attempt to regain balance of supply against demand. 
The net market, as mentioned today -- in prior quarters, remains in an overbuy situation -- oversupply situation and is going through a digestion phase after a period of significant 2D to 3D conversions, yield improvements and wafer capacity additions. 
DRAM is experiencing softening of bit demand, largely driven by decreased demand in mobile market as well as some inventory correction in the server market. All this has resulted in some pushouts of planned shipments by memory customers in the first half of 2019. Customers have indicated that they believe there will be a recovery the second half of the year, and they expect that inventory levels will be managed down swiftly. 
In Logic, while we see some softening in Deep UV demand, which is primarily driven by the mobile market, we still expect strong demand in support of the ramp of 10 and 7-nanometer nodes. We also expect to see strong growth in EUV demand, supporting the customers' ramp of 7 and 7-plus nanometer nodes as well as a transition to the 5-nanometer node. 
Although future developments in the macroeconomic environment can impact our current view, currently expect Logic demand to increase around 50% year-over-year and Memory to be down around [ 20% ] year-over-year. We still expect single-digit percentage growth of Installed Base revenue. In summary, 2019 will be a growth year, largely driven by Logic. 
On the ASML product side, we -- let me start with update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make solid progress as evident in the positive public comments from our logic and memory customers with the use of EUV in their most advanced nodes. Logic customers are installing systems in support of volume manufacturing for the 7 and 5-nanometer nodes. DRAM customers are also working on qualifying EUV with their future nodes. And this year, we expect that the first commercial EUV-enabled chip reach the consumer market. 
2018, we demonstrated over 145 wafers per hour, and we are accelerating our EUV road map to deliver 170 wafers per hour with our NXE:3400C with first shipments planned in second half of 2019. NXE:3400C will also include a number of innovations that will further improve availability. 
As Roger mentioned, we shipped 6 systems in Q4, which translates to a total of 8 EUV shipments in 2018. With the 5 orders booked this quarter, our shipment plan of 30 systems for 2019 is covered. 
In Deep UV, we shipped out 189 systems in 2018, an increase of 17% over 2017, and we were able to further increase our output in support of the demand from both logic and memory customers. And we continue ramping our latest immersion system, NXT:2000 with a record time to achieve mature customer yields. 
Our application portfolio has continued to see strong adoption in all market segments. Our latest YieldStar system continues to gain adoption in memory customers following the strong adoption we saw in Logic. Integrated products using the combined technology of HMI and ASML are being evaluated at multiple customer sites to help improve customer yields and time to market. 
So to summarize 2018, our fourth quarter came in slightly above our guidance, and we nearly achieved EUR 11 billion sales for the year, which was a milestone originally set for 2020. Although 2018 was a very good year from a financial perspective, I think it was also a milestone year in terms of technology innovations across all our products. This not only provides our customers with higher value solutions, it also fuels our future growth. 
Turning to 2019. We currently see some uncertainty in the market, but after a long period of strong capacity investments, driven by healthy demand over the past years, it is normal to see a period of digestion, which we expect in first half of 2019. 
With regards to the markets we serve, our customers responded quite late in Q4, slowing demand in their end markets by delaying deliveries of litho systems for the first half of 2019 to balance supply and demand. We now see our first half of 2019 lower than the second half of 2018 with the reduction being roughly an equal split between Memory and Logic. 
The fundamental drivers of high-performance compute with associated high-performance memory and data storage are still in place and our customers clearly indicated the need for a strong shipment settled in the second half of 2019 in support of their 2020 business potential. The demand in the second half of 2019 will, therefore, be 50% higher than the first half of the year. 
For 2019, the Logic segment is expected to be the growth driver, investing strongly in technology transitions as well as production capacity with our advanced nodes. As we have consistently done in prior slowdowns, we sustained or even accelerated our investments in R&D, deliver on the leading-edge technology where the market turns up, which has been and will be the key driver to secure our long-term growth. We expect to increase our investments in R&D to EUR 1.9 billion for 2019. 
We reiterate that we see market demand that supports yet another growth -- supports yet another year of growth for ASML in 2019 with significantly stronger demand in the second half of the year. As Roger explained, we see similar developments in our profitability with lower margins expected in the first half of 2019, improving towards our 2020 targets of over 50% as we exit the year. 
Despite some uncertainty in the current environment, we remain confident about our sales and profit targets for 2020 and beyond as we communicated during our Investor Day in November last year. We're happy to underline this confidence with our proposal of a 50% increase in our dividend. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",1096,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So let me start by talking about the gross margin and the gross margin drivers, if you like, in the first quarter and then reconciling that to how we see the rest of the year. So as I mentioned in my introduction, the main drivers of gross margin in the quarter, so bringing back the gross margin from 48.5%, which is the gross margin that we had in Q4 if you adjust for Nikon and then bringing it down to the 40% that we essentially guide for Q1, the main drivers there are the loading in the factory. As we said, that is the result of obviously, lower sales level. That would account for about 1% in that bridge. The second element is the mix in DUV, and that is essentially as a result of some of the pushouts from the first quarter into essentially the second half. And that generates approximately a 2.5% impact in that bridge of the gross margin. The biggest impact on gross margin actually is from what we call the field upgrades and service, and that has 2 components to it, and I mentioned both components in my introduction. One component is the lower field upgrades. And the lower field upgrades that we expect to have in Q1 are, to a very large extent, related to the Prodrive situation because it means that there is no availability for field upgrades for certain components. So that's one element. And if we talk about the EUV's -- EUV service burden, which I mentioned in my introduction, again just to recap what we mean by that, as you know, the installed base in EUV is growing. A number of our customers are looking into high-volume manufacturing for EUV, not too long from now. That means that we have to support them, obviously, in the field to get everything up and running. While the revenue associated with the service from EUV will only kick in once wafers are being produced, which we expect to happen at the end of this year. So that means that we have a significant cost burden right now, while the revenues only kick in at the end of the year. If you take those 2 together, so the lower field upgrades and the EUV service burden, that accounts for approximately 4% in that gross margin bridge that I gave you. And then there's about 1% left, which is miscellaneous. That has a number of elements in there. So that kind of gives you the bridge from the 48.5% to the 40% that we had in Q1. Now back to your question, how is all of that going to -- how we going to recover to normal margin levels, if you like, in H2, and as I mentioned, how we going to get from this situation into the -- towards 50% gross margin that we expect as we exit 2019 into 2020. So as it relates to the mix effect and also the loading effect as a result of the uptake of the business that we expect for the second half, that is what is the main driver -- the main driver behind that. We also expect some of the field upgrades that we lost as a result of Prodrive in the first quarter. We expect some of that to be recouped in the second half of this year. Third important point in getting the margin up to that level is the shipment in the course of the second half of the 3400C model, which is the model that, as you know, has a significantly better margin profile. And then, finally, again related to what I just mentioned at the end of this year when high-volume manufacturing starts to kick in on EUV, that's where we also expect service revenue to come up. So that's essentially how we came back from 48.5% to 40%. But also, it gives you the bridge how we believe we're going to exit the year at the level of towards 50% gross margin.",676,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

And Mitch, let me answer the, I'd say, the Q-on-Q sequence. Let me say half-on-half sequence. So first of all, I'd like to reiterate what I said earlier that, for the year, we expect the Logic sales to be 50% up from last year, Memory about 20% down and a single-digit growth in Installed Base Management. Now you can add it all up. And if you then come to that number, that sales number will be divided half-on-half. As such, we believe that the second half of 2019, as I said earlier, will be about 50% higher than the first. So if you take those numbers, then you can calculate the Q-on-Q, I would say, the half-on-half trend.",119,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I think, Krish, that is a good question. I think what our customers are actually seeing is what their customers are telling them what they need. So there's nobody there with a crystal ball that can say -- that can tell us that the second half is going to be absolutely certain at a certain level. It's simply not there. I think, therefore, the economic uncertainties are simply there, and they need to basically stabilize to give us a bit more confidence. However, having said that, the feedback we get, especially from our DRAM customers, is that -- from our largest customers, is that they said we should not underestimate their ability to react swiftly and that's what they have done. So they said, to what we are looking -- where we're looking now, that is a 20% bit growth or even slightly less this year. And then looking what they have installed in terms of capacity and their ability to react swiftly, which they have already done, they believe that, with that bit demand, they should be back into a more positive territory in the second half of this year. That's what they've told us. But again, if you're asking for absolute certainty, which somebody did during our press conference this morning, there is no absolute certainty, but it is very much related to the economic environment. But based on these data points, our customers believe that we need to be ready to start shipping again in H2.",250,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

On the R&D side, the guidance we get for Q1, EUR 480 million, in essence, that's kind of the run rate that we would expect for the quarters in this year. So our expectation for the full year would be about 4x this number. And so the number that we expect for 2019 with the road maps in there that you're very familiar with, particularly the High-NA, the pulling in of the 3400C multibeam and a number of other things.

So if you take our Q1 guidance, this is -- and you basically take that on average -- or sorry, on an annual basis, you can argue that we actually created the infrastructure -- R&D infrastructure to do this, and we wanted to finalize that by the end of 2018.

Dassen,,Executives,30,"So on your other 2 questions, on the economics, as you know, in terms of the specs, the current machine that we ship has a spec of 125 wafers per hour. We've guided that for the 3400C. It's going to be 170 -- more -- over 170 wafers per hour, which means approximately a 35% increase in the throughput. And I think as we've guided in the past, you can typically assume that the ASP kind of correlates with that percentage. So currently, the ASP for the machine that we ship today is about EUR 100 million. So you can kind of calculate what the ASP expectation is that we have for this machine. In terms of upgrades, indeed, we do have options to have a part of the performance update that the C has over the B to also make that available to the B machines in the form of upgrade.

But having said that, I mean, it's going to be a question of economics on this because it's a different lens. So actually, basically, you need to be able to take the hit of quite an expensive upgrade and that, of course, needs to be balanced with the real performance of the B and the real performance with -- of the C. So we'll just have to see whether that's going to happen. But when it happens, it's going to be an expensive -- an upgrade.

It's the -- sort of like I said, the fourth quarter shipments will probably be -- are going to be all 3400Cs.

But now I'm going to confuse you that some of the Cs will have -- be fully upgraded new vessel, yes, which is 5 to 10. So there's going to be an in-between version of the 3400C, which was at a, we could say, older-type EUV source vessel. So it's 13 in total. But really, the ones with all the new vessels is going to be 5 to 10. We try to do 10, could be 5 if the supply chain is a bit slower than we think. But overall, it's going to be 13.

And I have a follow-up regarding the -- just the big picture and how do you see the overall demand environment. If I were to strip away the EUV revenue, it seems like the core business could have a couple of quarters of sequential decline, which is typical of a downturn. If I were to look at the late '15, early '16, you had 3 quarters of sequential decline in revenues. And the prior downturns were also a multiquarter revenue decline.

To be very frank, we can only repeat or tell you what we get from the discussions from our customers because they have a better view of their market in the discussions with their customers. So this is -- I can only repeat what I said earlier. They talk about a 2-quarter correction in inventory. That is driven, I think, very much by the macroeconomic situation and the macroeconomic uncertainty. So this is a big crystal ball that I don't have and nobody has, so we'll have to see. I'd like to really comment on what you started your question off with, and that's of if you strip away EUV and look at the core business. May I remind you that EUV is our core business, yes, and that we can only ship those leading-edge Deep UV tools because there is EUV solution for 7 and 5-nanometer. Without the EUV, there would not be a 5 and 7-nanometer transition. So that means that everything that we are shipping is -- and that includes EUV, has to do with the technology transitions that our customers are planning to actually capture the value of everything that we still talk about and that will happen which has to do with cloud, Big Data -- and I could repeat the whole thing again. That is unabated. That will happen. And you cannot strip EUV out because it drives this technology transition. It's part of the core business.",268,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

If you read those numbers, I think there are 2 areas where we see, from a product point of view, an increase, which is eerie, which we talked about. And like I said earlier, you cannot strip this out because it's just part of the entire development in the industry. And indeed, we have KrF. We have dry. Deep UV is also higher currently than what we think that we saw in 2018, and that has to do with, indeed new fabs, has to do with China. It is not that much higher, but indeed, it doesn't show a reduction in system sales. And this is also what Roger referred to, that this mix, this Deep UV mix, which is a mix of immersion and KrF, is of course in the first half leading to this 2.5% reduction in the gross margin. But with the immersion systems picking up in the second half, that will resolve itself.

So that goes into the right direction. The issue is, and I said it earlier, that we decided in 2018 to at least make sure that we step up the infrastructure for EUV service that we are at that point. We're not going to grow that any further in 2019. But we do get the full brunt in terms of cost starting January 1, 2019, because the EUV infrastructure, given the ramp profile of our customers, needs to be ready and the learning curve for our people in the field is more than a year. So that effectively brings the blended EUV gross margin down. And we said it earlier, we don't have yet coverage of that EUV service infrastructure. It will only start by the end of the year when we start seeing the first HVM, high-volume manufacturing, wafer output, for which we will get paid. And of course, that will accelerate throughout 2020 and beyond. So the service burden, and Roger talked about it, is I think the main reason why there is a gap between the 30% and the 20% that you calculated.",219,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7

That fire had an impact on the upgrades that we were planning to do in the first half of this year. Now we're using those components to shipments. That actually means that the upgrades are coming back in the second half of the year, but those are complex upgrades for which we simply don't have the service capacity to do all the upgrades to basically catch up 6 months -- or it's actually 12 months of business in 6 months' time. So for the year, you would see that, that actually gives you a lot -- you just lose upgrade business, and that brings the growth percentage down to single digit. Now hopefully, I do assume we do not have a similar situation in 2020. And then, it should really correct itself. So it is the single-digit growth has to do with the fact that we cannot recuperate 12 months in 6 months. That's the main reason.",220,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

So I would refer to right now -- I would refer to the Capital Markets Day and the moderate market scenario we've put in there. It gives you the EUV number. But I -- that also tell you that I've been very much looking forward to the performance of the 3400C, which we have a lot of confidence.

The second half of the year, in Q4, we should have a tempered quarter run rate, which actually means, to one of the earlier questions, that the cycle time is coming down -- the factory cycle time. The integral cycle time of EUV, which includes also the supply chain, is still well over 12 months. But our integral cycle time in the factory should go down to anywhere between 15 and 18 weeks.

So with that essentially done, that means that there is some leeway there and that we would be able to manage down the total R&D expenses because that research is done.

Wennink,,Executives,63,"Well, the customers are our customers. They're a bit more distance, as you can imagine. We do have interactions with customers of customers, but that's largely on the road map and not so much on the operational situation at our customers. I mean, we don't discuss our customers' production capability or the capacity of our customers. We don't have that insight. Like I said, we do talk about the road map, and I think in the discussions that we've had with customers of our customers, it's also in our mind pretty clear that they all understand that EUV is here and it actually works. Now having said that, what is particularly important is not so much the lithographic performance. I think the lithographic performance of the machine itself is actually better. Every time, it's better than what was anticipated and that's -- that actually drives a lot of the design. So this is good. Now we are, of course, not yet at a availability and at a, let's say, maturity level that we would like to see for high-volume manufacturing. The 3400C, with all the improvements that are in there, there's also a lot of availability improvements in there, and that is going to be the proof of the pudding. And I think this will -- this is why I also said in an answer to an earlier question that the 3400C and its performance is going to be a big driver also in 2020. And we're confident that we're going to get there. And I can't imagine that customers of our customers that are -- even though they are further away from us, that they want to see this first.

But they're going to be more -- it's just more than one DRAM manufacturer we're going to ship the retool to. So that is very much a function of our ability to bring the 3400C up to maturity levels that customers need for DRAM. I think we can do that. I think the -- everything that is -- that we have in front of us, which is the availability improvements in the EUV source, the higher productivity, the 170 wafers per hour, those are all ingredients that make it attractive for DRAM customers to start using EUV in DRAM. So I think there is little doubt there. So it's up to us. It's up to us and to the customer to make sure that what is in the 3400C can actually be used in high-volume manufacturing.

I think it would be good to just look at EUR 3.6 billion and really break it down into a number of components because there is a number of elements in the EUR 3.6 billion that are actually unrelated, I would submit to, to the global demand for Memory. And those 2 components are: first, the demand for our systems by domestic Chinese players. As you know, those are strategic investments that are actually unrelated to the current global demand for Memory. So that's one strategic component. The other strategic component is that we see customers preparing for the introduction of EUV in DRAM and that's a strategic project, it's a strategic decision. And based on conversations again with our customers, we see that that's -- that it's actually happening. So we would say that for those 2 components, we believe, the risk profile is fairly low. And those 2 components account for approximately EUR 1 billion take it together. So that brings you down from EUR 3.6 billion total system sales in Memory to EUR 2.6 billion. If you compare that EUR 2.6 billion that is contingent upon the global demand for Memory. If you contrast that to the number that we had last year, it's actually 30% down, so that's a good reflection I think of the uncertainty that exists in the market and that's totally factored into our perspective this year. 
So EUR 2.6 billion is the remaining portion related to the global demand for Memory. Of those EUR 2.6 billion, we already recorded EUR 700 million in the first quarter. So that leaves you with EUR 1.9 billion remaining for the 3 quarters to come. And that's the part that is related to the global demand and maybe uncertainty in the global demand. So I would say that the risk profile there is a little bit higher, but also the opportunity there is higher and it will be very much dependent on how the situation particularly on DRAM is going to manifest itself in the remainder of this year. But all-in-all, I think it's important to recognize that this EUR 3.6 billion has different components with different risk profiles associated with it.",407,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,9,"So the margin that we see for Q2, we guide there between 41% and 42%, which is probably is more or less in line with where we were in Q1. On a basis -- on a revenue basis between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion, so that's what we're -- and that's what we're looking at. We have significant programs in place and significant developments to expect to see the gross margin really develop favorably in the course of the second half. The first one is the introduction of the 3400C machine in the second half, which has a significantly better margin profile than the current machines. The second category is the service revenue and the service margin on EUV and that's very important, we talked about that last -- at last quarter as well. As you know, at this stage, we have significant costs because we're helping our customers gear up for EUV and for insertion of EUV into high volume manufacturing. So we have the cost at this stage, but we don't have the revenue because the way for output, of course, is still very, very modest. That will kick in, in the second half because then we will see EUV in high-volume manufacturing, so that would drive up the revenue and also we have programs in place to bring down the cost of EUV service. 
So those two combined will have a significant positive impact on the EUV service margin. The third category is installed base revenue. Installed base revenue, we see good potential for increase there and also in the high margin pieces of that. And then we also see a better development of the mix, particularly the mix in our DPV business in the second half. And finally, because we will see a higher output level in the second half that will also lead to better factory loading and as a result of that better fixed cost coverage. So all those measures taken together will lead to a significant improvement of gross margin in the second half and we believe will very nicely position us for our goal of having a gross margin in 2020, which is going to exceed 50%.",367,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2019. Although this was a modest quarter, in absolute numbers, we did report both sales and gross margin above our guidance. Q1 net sales came in at EUR 2.23 billion, slightly above guidance, driven by an additional EUV shipment in the quarter. Net systems sales of EUR 1.69 billion was more weighted towards Logic, 60%, with the remaining 40% for Memory, the same split as previous quarter. We reported EUV system revenue of EUR 371 million from 4 shipments. Installed base management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 540 million, which was slightly lower than guided due to lower upgrade business. Gross margin for the quarter was 41.6%, which is slightly higher than the 40% guided due to a favorable Deep UV mix more than compensating for gross margin impact of one additional EUV system. Overall, R&D and SG&A expenses came in a little lower than guided with R&D expenses of EUR 473 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 121 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 55 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q1. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.28 billion. Moving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at EUR 1.40 billion. Logic order intake was 75% of total value with the remaining 25% from Memory, again reflecting the strong logic demand expected this year. We took 3 new EUV orders in the quarter. Net income in Q1 was EUR 355 million, representing 15.9% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 0.84. This was favorably impacted by a one-off tax benefit. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2019. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast to Q2 includes around EUR 600 million of EUV system revenue on 6 expected shipments in Q2. We expect our Q2 installed base management revenue to be around EUR 700 million. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 41% and 42%. The lower-margin EUV revenue will be compensated by higher-margin non-EUV business. We continue to expect further improvements in gross margin in the second half driven by higher system sales, increased field upgrades, shipment of higher-margin NXT:3400C systems as well as contribution of EUV service revenue. This will provide a significant step towards our 2020 target of over 50%. Expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around EUR 485 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 125 million. Our estimated 2019 annualized effective tax rate is around 11% because of a one-off tax benefit in 2019. We still expect our long-term effective tax rate to be 14%.
As we remain confident in our long-term growth, we will propose a 50% increase versus last year in our dividend to EUR 2.10 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 24 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 0.9 billion. We still expect to execute the remaining EUR 1.3 billion of the 2018-2019 share buyback program this year with a weighting towards the back of the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",569,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, although it was a modest quarter, the results came in above our guidance, and we expect further strengthening in the coming quarters. There continues to be volatility in the markets due to the macroeconomic environment, and some uncertainty remains in the semiconductor industry. Our memory customers are going through a period of rebalancing supply and demand with an expected improvement in their business conditions over the course of the year. 
Our view of 2019 remains unchanged from last quarter. We continue to expect overall growth in 2019 with increasing demand for our products as we move through the year. The fundamental end market drivers clearly remain in place as expanding end market applications continue to fuel the demand for high-performance compute and high-performance memory. 
In Memory, the NAND market continues to digest the high level of capacity additions over the past few years, and this digestion started last year and will likely extend through most of this year. DRAM market is also seeing softening in the near-term demand as they work through an inventory correction. And based on our customers' view, we continue to expect memory demand for our litho systems down around 20% relative to last year. But bear in mind, there is a portion of this memory demand that supports new technology as well as new domestic Chinese customers, and this demand is clearly more strategic and will -- is very likely to happen independent of the near-term global bit demand.
If you remove these 2 components from our estimated 2019 memory demand, you get the lithography spend for memory bit supply that is 30% lower than the comparable spend in 2018. This reduction in spend is significant and will help in correcting the supply-demand balance. And on top of this, we have seen a significant reduction in wafer output in the memory space. This quick reaction to the changes in the end market demand is clearly different from what we've seen in earlier cycles and will also help in correcting the inventory situation. 
The Logic segment is expected to be the growth driver in 2019 with the majority of the demand linked to technology transitions and production capacity for advanced nodes. We still expect this Logic business to be up around 50% relative to last year, driven by Deep UV as well as significant EUV demand. Furthermore, we still expect single-digit percentage growth of installed base revenue. 
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV customers are starting production of the most advanced logic processes on our NXE:3400B systems, with plans to transition to the higher-productivity NXE:3400C systems in the second half of the year. First set of qualified NXE:3400C optics are in our factory. These higher transmission optics will enable the higher throughput of 170 wafers per hour. We expect these systems will deliver the next level of cost-effective shrink in both Logic and Memory. We shipped 4 EUV systems in Q1 and are all in track to ship to plants 30 systems in 2019.
In Deep UV, we continue to innovate in support of future nodes and new applications. Driven by continued high level of demand for Dry products, we will bring the Dry -- the Deep UV Dry products to the high-performance NXT platform, starting with the NXT:1470 planned for delivery mid next year. We also see increasing demand for 200-millimeter TWINSCAN systems across all dry wavelengths and industry segments. For instance, in thin film head manufacturing, we recently received an order for a special version of the XT:1470K (sic) [ XT:1460K ], which is a dry ArF platform, which is expected to enable the shrink road map at a leading hard disk storage manufacturer.
In our application business, our computational lithography deep-learning technology has been adopted at several leading-edge customers. We continue to make progress in e-beam technology and are on track to deliver a multi-beam system for this year for R&D with plans for commercial product shipments in 2020. With the announcement of the acquisition of Mapper's IP assets in January, more than 100 former Mapper employees accepted jobs from ASML and are now working on the development road map of our e-beam and application products. 
In summary, despite uncertainty in the current environment, we continue to see market demand that supports another growth year with strengthening of both sales and profitability quarter-on-quarter this year. Logic will be the primary driver of growth this year, supported by technology transitions and production ramp of the most advanced nodes. As discussed, Memory includes more uncertainty, on the one hand, because of the uncertainty of global bit demand, but on the other hand, due to fast adjustment of production capacity and, therefore, presents both a risk and an opportunity. Overall, our view of the business is largely unchanged from last quarter. We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets with significant growth potential beyond 2020. 
With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",836,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

That's a very good question. I think as you know, DRAM is much more -- we started -- I think we discussed this on previous calls also. It's much more cost-sensitive than the logic space. It actually means that the higher productivity EUV tools, the 3400C, is the tool of record for DRAM manufacturing. Now clearly, we're in the process of maturing that 3400C tool in terms of availability, in terms of the productivity, of course, we seem to be proven in the customer fab. So I would expect that by the end of this year, I would say somewhere in Q4, where we see the first results of those tools in the customer fabs. And we would need the projected wafers-per-day productivity, which is a result of the raw throughput plus the availability. That will really drive the number of layers, ultimately, in application of DRAM. I would expect, though, that customers will first allocate a relatively small portion of their output to EUV because it's a new technology, it's a new process. But when that is proven, that can accelerate. So it's -- you could really say it's really up to us to make sure -- and of course, together with our customers, because we -- it's new technology, new process technology, we need to prove that in the course of this year really towards the end of the year that the promised productivity and availability is there, that we beat the 2,000 wafer per day target that we've set ourselves and even see whether we can get higher. And going up, I would say, significantly above the 2,000 wafers per day, which ultimately, should be possible, will drive the adoption of the number of DRAM layers. So it's a bit too early to give you a guidance on the 2020-2021. It really depends on how we perform, and of course, it's our -- in our best interest and that of our customers to do as good as possible.",332,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Like I said in my introductory comments, what we're seeing is there's a bit difference to what we're seeing in previous cycles. There's the pretty rapid reaction of customers to actually reduce output, so basically to lower the utilization. I think that is an attempt of the customers to quickly adapt the imbalance in supply and demand. Now that will lead to a situation whereby in the course of the year -- and many customers have actually said this, that they expect throughout this year, could be middle of the year or at the end of the year, but throughout this year, a better situation for them and a return to better business levels for them. Actually, so what that means is that we don't expect this year that there will be a big snapback in demand for those systems, because if you lower the utilization now, first, what you will do is use that utilization when you go up. So that probably means that if we see a correction, it's going to be next year and not this year. Now having said that, the -- we are preparing the supply chain. We always have in the supply chain a certain level of buffers so we can have a rapid response shipment ready, which is true for the long lead time items. That's our optic supply and some very long lead time electromechanical parts of our tool.

I think what we are planning -- what we have given you as an indication in the past, and I'd like to refer to the update that we gave at the Capital Markets Day last year where we gave you kind of a mid-scenario, where we look at that number. Then I think everything that we're currently seeing in terms of logic demand, the use of EUV at 7, 7 plus, 6 and 5 nanometer, I think that confirms our thinking for that particular number that we gave you. And there is a level of memory shipments in there also, whereby we assume that at least in a moderate market scenario, we will ship some numbers to -- some shipments to Memory customers also. So all in all, I think we have in our moderate market scenario 2020 about 33 EUV units, and that's what we're targeting at. Now is there some upside potential? I think if the 3400C works indeed as smoothly as we're planning, that could be. But that means we should have, I would say, double-digit, above the 2,000 wafers per day level. Then yes, this could spark some additional demand. And then customers should give us a problem to get more out than those 33 systems. But this is what we're currently seeing as the most likely scenario. So that's what we told you back in November last year.",236,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

But in the course of the second half, starting in Q3, we'll see the first C shipments with the considerably better gross margin profile associated with that.

The full Cs are actually less, I mean, if you have a kind of intermediate version. So the full Cs is probably around 5, yes, and so the rest is an intermediate version that will be upgraded later on. So that was a bit of a confusion. That has to do with the fact that not all modules are fully ready when we start shipping the first C with the improved lens and there are other features to that C system that come later. So the -- that is the upgrade in the C version, which is relatively minor. But the upgrades you're probably referring to, from the B to the C, and this is where we don't think there will be a lot of upgrades for the simple reason that the B is a lower productivity tool with a lower price. And if you want to go to the C version, you really need to have the new optical path there, which actually doesn't [ advise ]. It's possible, but and then you have to have such a major upgrade in the field that it's questionable whether it's economical for customers to take the tool down for such a long time and then pay such a high price for the upgrades. So I think the Bs will remain the Bs and the Cs -- the real Cs, the final [ N ] Cs are probably a handful, yes? And there is then this version that is going to be shipped at least with the right lens and with some other modules later on. So those are small upgrades, which are part of the purchase price.",277,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

I estimate the installed base of all EUV systems out there this year to be around 60. And obviously, some of these systems are for R&D and some of them are older generations. So let's say 60%, 70% of the 60 units could potentially be upgraded. I mean, you just referenced the economic challenges for upgrading, but then again, I can't ignore the fact that there is a large installed base. And in that context, how should I think about the tools that are already being paid for and some of them maybe halfway through depreciation versus benefit of purchasing an outright C version?",112,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think it's not 60. It's just below 50, those in the field. But you have to realize that the number of those tools are 3300s, 3350s, and some of them -- and most of those tools are being used in the qualification in the R&D space, yes? So we are -- you are right, some of them actually they are entering into their last term of depreciation. Now -- so some [ wafers ] be used also in the R&D space and will not be upgraded. And also, it's like the 3300Bs, they are, yes, lower productivity tools but also lower-priced tools, but are perfectly capable production tools, and those will stay in production. And that's nothing different than what we did in the past when we had NXT versions, yes, where basically you have a 1950 followed by a 1960 and a 1970. Yes, some of them can be upgraded, but as I've said earlier, the upgradability of the 3400B is there, but it's very expensive and you could argue whether it's economical. So I don't expect it there. 
On the 3300s, not the 34, the 3300s, I see limited upgrade possibilities, but many of those tools will stay in an R&D space. And some of them we can negotiate with the customers to take some of them back and refurbish them here in the factory, and those are the kind of the plans that we are developing with our customers today, just to make sure that they have a efficient use of their assets. And then those are programs that will probably run over the next couple of years, yes, to make sure that we can help our customers get the maximum amount of their installed base, which is, by that time, fully depreciated. And it will be kind of a trade-in and upgrade program, but that -- those details still need to be worked out.",320,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,33,"So it's a -- so the gross margin from Q1 into Q2 is a bit of a blend. So as you rightly said, we'll have more EUV shipments. And as you know with the 3400B, that means that the gross margin, for that reason, would go down. It will be compensated by the Deep UV business and will also be compensated by the fact that we do have better installed base revenue with some field upgrades in there into second quarter. So if you take the negative from more EUV shipments, that gets compensated by the other 2 developments.

Dassen,,Executives,35,"You're on a roll there. So you absolutely mentioned 2 very, very important elements in there. So indeed, it is the introduction of the 3400C model, which is -- which as we said is going to start in Q3, and that will be a significant uptick in our gross margin. So that's one big component. The second component, indeed, is mix, which is also envisaged for the second half of the mix in the Deep UV business more towards -- even more towards immersion. A very significant part that we talked about quite extensively also on the call last time is installed base revenue and then, in particular, the EUV service cost and service revenue. So we're working very hard, as you know, at this stage to get our customers and help our customers and go to high-volume manufacturing. 
So there's a lot of costs that we incur as a result right now, whereas the revenue is very limited, because as you probably know, most of the revenue and service is tied to wafer output, which, of course, at this stage, it's very, very low. So there's a big mismatch at this stage between the cost and the revenue. That will obviously remedy itself in the second half and then significantly into 2020 and beyond. So those are the key drivers. And then we have factory loading to the extent that the business goes up and some other components in installed base, base revenue, including field upgrades. So those are the main levers that we're pulling in order to, indeed, get to the over 50% that we've guided for 2020. And we believe we're on track. So the step change, you will see significant elements of that step change in the course of the second sales -- second half.",300,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So that's an important driver where we had a limited number of that in Q1, as we also indicated, which is also a -- was also a function of the supplier situation that we talked about last time. So field upgrades is one significant -- one important driver of the higher number in Q2. In the second half, the second half, we expect installed base revenue to be higher than in the first half. As you said, we're still looking at single-digit growth for installed base revenue.

One is it is -- these orders come in choppy. There's only a few customers there. So it means that it's not a whole bunch of customers. We get onesies and twosies to come in these batches. So that's what you have, one. And it's about the same as we were last year. Last year, first quarter 2018, same thing, where we include the orders come from for 2019 this year, the 30 units. This was the same question, same situation, choppy. But we said at that time, before the end of 2018, we have all the orders for 2019. I think it's the same situation now. I mean, when we look at 33 systems, we look at -- and I relate back to an earlier question, where is the demand come from? It comes from the logic transition, 7 plus, 6 nanometer, 5 nanometer for 3 customers, the potential for DRAM that we talked about in a moderate market scenario. Those are the discussion that we're having with our customers and gives us the confidence that we're preparing for these 33 unit numbers. And we will have those orders by the end of the year to fulfill 2020 like we did last year. 
On top of that, we are reducing our order lead time to our customers. I mean, when we're in this phase where our customers need to order 2 years in advance, with a semiconductor industry that's quite choppy, they don't like 2 years. Those were actually agreed with them that we're going down to 18 months and 15 months and, ultimately, one hand, at the 12-month lead time for EUV systems. That gives them some more flexibility to better plan. Well, part of that, you're already seeing. So with that planned lead time reduction, our customers will take that into account in placing the orders that are going to be choppy. And that will fill the order book to make sure that by the end of this year, we'll have the units there for 2020 shipments.",344,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

I think as I said in my introductory comments, these -- especially in the memory space, these investments are of a strategic nature because their greenfield companies have greenfield fabs. And the first qualification rounds of the devices that they're making have -- they actually have -- they are behind us. So actually, they are looking at ramping their first lines, and this is what we're -- that's what they're doing this year. So that will happen. So I think that -- we don't see any change there. And I think the same is true for some of our indigenous Logic customers. They have technology transitions ongoing to either 28 or 14 nanometer, which is strategic and that happens, albeit at a somewhat lower level. I think in China we see memory quite significant volume and logic is more modest. But all those plans are stay on track.",149,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Understand that last year you've started accelerating your R&D for the High-NA generation tools. So I'm just wondering that -- is 2019 another up year for R&D compared to 2018 and of course, the year before? Or are we actually seeing some time H1 2019 will be top of the R&D cycle? And also secondly, after 2020, in theory, if you have done all the R&D and all the preparation for High-NA launch, your free cash flow should increasing significantly. So what's your view in terms of your future capital return program?",107,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,48,"So in terms of the R&D, we're looking at about EUR 1.9 billion R&D for the year. And that's what we've communicated, and I think we're on track. I think the number that you've seen for Q1 is very consistent with that number. And indeed, we said that there's a number of reasons why we're doing that. One is in the continued preparation for High-NA, pulling in of the 3400C development and also, for instance, around the development of multi-beams. So there are distinct programs that underpin that. We've also said that we believe that in the course of 2020, we will see that we're gradually navigating that back to the longer-term 14% number that we've indicated. So you will still see a higher percentage for 2020. But in the course of 2020, you will see us navigating back to that 14% longer-term number. I don't want to spoil the party, but we shouldn't expect that the R&D work on High-NA comes to a grinding halt by 2020. Obviously, that will continue to be there, and a significant part of the R&D work in 2021 and beyond will still obviously be related to High-NA. 
But you are right, there will be a significant generation of free cash flow. And I think we've been fairly clear on that during Capital Markets Day, where we said, first off, we're going to make all those investments that we deem necessary for the continuation of the business as we run it today, which is primarily R&D, and that's the number we just talked about. We said on the M&A front that it's unlikely that there will be targets both available and attractive for us, such that there would be a significant expenditure on that front. We will sustain our cash balances, as we've indicated. And anything that is available over and above that, we said we'll return to our shareholders. And we'll do that in a policy of increasing dividends. And I think the dividend proposal that we've given for this year, I think, is testimony to that. And anything else that we have available, we'll return in -- by way of the share buyback programs as you've seen we execute on -- in quite a disciplined way.",375,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And my second question is, if that were the case, does that impact in any way the cadence at which you're going to deliver your tools?

Pierre, I think to answer your last question, I don't think it has an impact on the cadence. What you will see is there's going to be more nodes and half nodes and quarter nodes that people are using for different purposes, a different device for different end markets and different applications. I mean, it was clear some of our largest customers in the Logic space have indeed announced nodes that they call 7 plus, 6, 5, 3 for different types of customers. But more importantly, I think when you talk to our customers, they actually say, and especially in the foundry space, that the number of tape-outs for those devices are very significant. And I think you will see a more heterogeneous supply of those nodes for different application and different customers. So -- but when we add it all up, it is the most important. And we see what we think the EUV demand will be next year and years thereafter. There's no reason why we change our -- let's say, our moderate market view for next year. It all fits. But you will see a more heterogeneous and, thereby, perhaps for you guys, a less transparent node-to-node transition. It's getting a bit more complicated.",208,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Just another one on the memory space, perhaps slightly more near term. With the fourth quarter results, I suppose with third quarter results before as well, you had talked about pushouts from certain customers. I'm just wondering -- I mean clearly, you're keeping the full year guidance the same in terms of the down 20 for memory overall and down 30 as you described for the underlying business. But just within that, as the customers are trying to find the bottom in the cycle and return to supply-demand equilibrium, have you seen any further pushouts at least from perhaps quarter-to-quarter basis within the year?

Wennink,,Executives,54,"I would say they have been pretty steady, Andrew. Like I said also earlier in my earlier comments, there is always the fact that we're in this digestion or this supply-demand balancing phase. There's always a question of how long will it last. And it's going to be basically a function of the bit demand for the end markets, which for DRAM, I think our latest outside analysts -- when we think about Gartner or these guys, for DRAM, hover around to 20% and for 3D NAND between 30% and 35%. If you follow that then, and we just stick to what our customers says and say, well, you could see a rebound in their business throughout this year. And that's basically because the first thing they're going to do, like I said earlier, they've reduce their utilization, which is pretty unique for us. I mean we haven't seen that in earlier cycles to this extent, and they will first reuse that. So they will see their business pick up, of course, earlier. 
So there are no signs that at this moment, in any case, that they're going to have another round of reductions. I think what they're doing is they're just trying to get the supply-demand balance in order as soon as possible by -- through their own actions. It's basically controlling the utilization, yes, and that's good. So maybe that's the reason why they feel, based on things on the 20% bit growth in DRAM and 30% to 35% in 3D NAND, that they believe -- that is why -- that somewhere in the course of this year, they'll see a rebound in their business. That could very well be. So no, no further adjustments that we've seen. Of course, there is absolutely no security or certainty with these comments because nobody can really predict where the end markets are going.

And then just as a quick follow-up, we've commented on a little bit, but given the messaging around the 3400C, is it fair to assume that the next kind of sway to the EUV bookings for 2020 is likely to be quite back-end loaded this year?",137,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I also think customers are going to make -- customers of customers are probably going to make more applications, specific choices of what they want to use with that particular application because it's not a full node. This is half node. You can even say quarter nodes, yes? That makes it less transparent and also for us. But we do enter discussion with our customers. We talk -- do talk about those nodes that require EUV because that's where the question is, how much EUV would they need. And in that discussion, we will just look at -- we have to look at this blend of EUV applications and the number of wafers that you would need per node. We would need to get to some kind of equilibrium almost to assess how much EUV we would need. But everything we've heard until now with all those node changes, we do believe that what we have in our moderate market scenario for 2020 is the right number. So -- but yes, you are right.

Wennink,,Executives,70,"I think I don't know exactly what is behind that. You should ask our customers. But it's just simply what we are seeing. I think it is -- had a certain logic to it. I mean you can keep your utilization as high as you can, but just -- that basically means you're driving the cost per device down, so the cost per chip, because you basically use the fixed cost pattern. That's one strategy. The other strategy is to say -- but that could mean that the cycles last longer, yes? They could also have a strategy, say, basically, we would have shorter cycles. They go a little bit deeper, but then the recovery is also faster. And I think this is where -- when you see this, and quite a significant reduction in utilization in the memory space, that looks like that's the type of decision that they've taken. On the small node transitions, the change in order patterns, I don't think so. What I basically think is that it's more the end markets with our customers where they have different nodes that they can offer to their customers and different nodes for different purposes, different customers, whereby the positive here is that the tape-outs that our customers are talking about, the number of tape-outs, are as high as ever. So that means that there's a lot of demand for different solutions. And as long as you all use EUV, I don't see it's going to be any choppy pattern here or a smoothing of their pattern. They think -- it doesn't make a big difference in my opinion. It's just more diversity. So no big change. I don't expect that.",284,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

The quarter was good. I think we had sales that exceeded our expectations, or at least our guidance. That was because we pulled some system in from Q1 to Q4, which led to a EUR 3.1 billion sales number. Gross margin was good, 48.5%. However, we -- a few days before the results, we reached an initial settlement with Nikon on a year-long IP infringement court case and we settled with them. And we provided [ another EUR 30 million ] of cost, which actually brings down the gross margin. We charge this to the gross margin, brings it down to 44.3%. Now if we look at that, net income for the quarter, EUR 900 million. And if we take into account the Nikon settlement, EUR 788 million.",129,-6.0,7.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,3,"I think 2018 is a very good year. I mean, in 2018, we actually reached our EUR 11 billion target -- almost our EUR 11 billion target that we set for 2020, which is very good. That actually means that net income was EUR 2.7 billion. However, because of the Nikon settlement, we had to take the provision -- or we wanted to take a provision for EUR 130 million, which brings the net income to EUR 2.6 billion. Gross margin, 47%. With the Nikon settlement, that goes down to 46%. But all in all, if you look at this from a financial point of view, very good. Now having said that, I think the biggest achievement is not on the financial ones. The biggest achievements, I think, in 2018 were the technological breakthroughs that we had in EUV, DPV business, application business. So we're very well positioned for further growth in the next couple of years.",157,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,5,"When you think about EUV in 2018, I can tell you anything about technological progress, which I will do, but really the most important here is that it's the acknowledgment of the customers that EUV is there to be used in high volume production. So all our major customers are planning EUV in high volume production. And they're very vocal about this. I mean, in their public statements on the next generation, they talk about EUV, whether it's for N7+, N5, L7, it is EUV. So why is that? And it's actually evidenced by the fact that when we look at our order book, it contains more systems -- more unit systems than our planned shipments for 2019, so that's very good. And why is that? I think it's really because we made some technological breakthroughs. We actually are over 250 watt power in our current systems. It brings us over 145 wafers per hour, where we initially planned 125. We pulled the development of the 3400C in, which gives more transparency and more wafers per hour, over 170 wafers per hour. If you take that all together, that explains the confidence of the customers to say EUV will happen and we're going to put this into high volume production.",210,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It's undeniable that we have a concern, a certain weakness in the market right now. I think it's primarily driven by the fact that we see certain patches of the economy cooling. China, for instance. We have geopolitical tensions, the fear of trade war. We have local fears like the Brexit. And everything together leads to, I think, a slowing demand for end products, which also reflects on semiconductors. And that's what we have seen. And I think we've seen that trend developing in the second half of 2018. But at ASML, we really notice it very close to year-end, we saw customers coming, both Memory and Logic customers that actually said the market is clearly showing signs of slowing and some weakness. And they decided to push out some of the H1, the first half 2019 shipments, into the second half. That is both for Memory and for Logic customers. And that has happened. Now, if we look at that, and we would split that into the business segments: NAND, there is some overcapacity, it's not a surprise. It was already there also last quarter. We saw the 2D to 3D transition has happened. Yield improvements are clear. There was a lot of investments done over the last 2 years. So digestion period, that is clear. DRAM. I think DRAM, you very clearly see a slower end demand for bits. That has to do with, for instance, the mobile market is slowing because of the economic situation. You see some slower uptick in the server market. So that is where DRAM demand -- the end demand seems to slow, which will not only happen now, but I think it will continue in Q1 and Q2.
On Logic, Logic is also a victim, you could say, of some slowdown in the mobile phone space. But if you really look at Logic from our point of view, there's quite a significant growth profile in 2019 for Logic, and as also mentioned by our customers, there's very strong demand for the next-generation chips. So for the N7+ chips, for N5, for N10 and that all needs EUV also and a lot of immersion. So from a Logic point of view, the market is strong for us. Now I'd like to summarize 2019 as follows: if you look at the business segments, I think Memory, 2019 as compared to 2018, were probably just over 20% lower than in 2018. For Logic, however, I think Logic for 2019 as compared to 2018, we see around a 50% increase for the demand for our systems, yes? And on installed base management, it's going to be single digit. Also, because you see a slowdown in the industry, so some of the upgrades that we're currently planning, probably a little bit later. All in all, if you add that up and you compare 2018 and '19, we see growth. 2019 is going to be a growth year.",491,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

The first quarter will be light and it will be light because, just like I've just mentioned, we have about a EUR 300 million impact of the fire at one of our suppliers, which actually pushes some of those shipments into Q2. One of the reasons for the lightness in Q1 is the pull-in that we saw in Q4 of 2018 of some of our systems that we planned for Q1 and the push-outs that are starting to push to the second half of 2019. Now looking at that and looking at the first half, I think those trends that I just mentioned for Q1, I think they will also be visible in Q2. But we see a very strong correction and uptick in the second half of 2019. So it's going to be a year that is really skewed towards the second half. And I think if you would compare the first half of 2019 with the second half of 2018, it will be a lower number, yes, a lower sales number. And that difference, that reduction in sales, is evenly split between Memory and Logic.",202,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,15,"The gross margin is a reflection of the light sales number, yes? And I think, specifically, there are -- I think there are 3 reasons also. One, of course, lower sales. With this supplier accident that has actually happened, we have to push some of the higher-margin systems to Q2 and beyond. Upgrades, we'd like to use the components to build new systems and we push upgrades to the second half of the year. Those are high-margin products that we planned for Q1, which, of course, are now pushed back. Next to that, of course, lower sales means a lower load in the factory. So the factory utilization is going down. And the third very important item is that we have invested very strongly in our service infrastructure. Our customers will ramp high volume EUV towards the end of the year, in the second half of this year. And that means that the service infrastructure is there and it's a big number. And with very low sales, you have a bigger relative impact of that -- still that service business that is not profitable yet on the gross margin of the first quarter. We'll see that also in the second quarter. But it will recuperate in the second half. In the second half, you'll see a strong improvement of the gross margin because of higher sales, better load, the introduction of high-margin EUV systems. We'll see upgrades coming back because we will then have all the components to do the upgrades. And I think if you add that all together, you will see a gradual improvement of our gross margin from the low levels in Q1 to the end of the year where I strongly believe that we'll exit the year with gross margins which are growing towards the gross margin target of 50% in 2020.",306,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I've been with the business more than 20 years and I stopped saying this business is not cyclical. I mean, I've stopped saying that a long time ago. It will always be cyclical. If you look at the very strong capacity additions that we have had over the last couple of years, driven by very strong end demand for leading-edge products. But it's logical that at a certain moment in time when the economic tailwind is suddenly a headwind, that will be some time where we need to do a digestion. And that's happening as we speak. Now that's normal and we have had that before. But you need to really think about what does that mean for the medium- to long-term future of the company. It's very bright. I mean, there's no doubt, and you can listen to our customers, of what the benefits are of the next-generation chips, yes? Those will be significant. So we will keep investing. Even in times of slowdown, we've done this in the past and we'll do it again, we will invest in R&D or even accelerate. We need to pull EUV in. We want to make sure that those high-value products for the customer and for us will be available in 2020 and beyond. So we're going to increase our R&D from EUR 1.6 billion last year to about EUR 1.9 billion this year. And I think it's all driven by the fact that we strongly believe in what we have said at our Capital Markets Day about the prospect and the future of this company. And I think if you look at that and you translate that into our confidence, we translate that confidence into increase our dividend with 50% and I think that, all in all, is a very good thing.",302,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,1,"I think the second quarter was a good quarter, a solid quarter. With our sales of EUR 2.6 billion, we came well within the guidance. Gross margin, 43%, a bit higher than we guided. Those were the results of some more manufacturing efficiencies in EUV, but also very important some more -- great field sales. Those were sales that were higher than we anticipated. That was with good margins and, of course, that was a result of the -- what we saw in Q1, where we had a very low average field sales because of the lack of components due to a fire at the supplier.
All in all, ended up with a net income of EUR 476 million. Of course, up, that's because of, of course, good gross margins, but also a long-term tax benefit.
From a order point of view, solid order intake, a good order intake, EUR 2.8 billion, which includes 10 EUV systems. And we shipped, by the way, 7 EUV systems in the second quarter. So all in all, I think it's a quarter that we can be very satisfied with.",186,8.0,5.0,0.9444444444444444,0.5

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Yes, I think that's clear softness. That's the result, I think, of -- not only, I think, in the 3D NAND and in DRAM, of some very significant investments over the past couple of years and a decelerated growth in the end market. I mean the end markets are growing less than we anticipated 6 months ago. So that creates softness.
Last quarter, we said that memory sales, DRAM and NAND together will be about 20% lower than last year. I think, currently, with the further softness that we're seeing, it's probably, this year, going to be about 30% lower.
Now put it into perspective, 30% lower sales, about EUR 3.1 billion in memory sales this year. But as we said last quarter, it's about EUR 1 billion in there, which we call strategic, which are the memory ramps of the Chinese customers, plus EUV. Those will happen. So if you subtract that EUR 1 billion from EUR 3.1 billion, you get EUR 2.1 billion. And that issue really compared -- those are the capacity shipments, the bit capacity shipments, less than 45% down as compared to 2018.
Of that EUR 2.1 billion, we shipped EUR 1.2 billion in the first half. So EUR 900 million, the second half. Is there some risk, still, to memory sales? Well, it's a soft business so, potentially, there could be some risk still left.",231,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

I think Logic is actually very healthy. Last quarter, we said that the Logic market for 2019 -- or our Logic sales for 2019 would be about 50% up from 2018. Now what we see today, it's like more like 65%. So we see an increase in the demand for Logic from our customers, and that's really driven by the technology transition.
You think about it, it's 7-nanometer, it's 10-nanometer in microprocessors, 7-nanometer Logic and beyond. And that's really driven by those technology transitions that are driving the things that we're all looking for. And as our customers tell us, also things like 5G, so these things are all happening. So it means that, this year, Logic sales will be significantly up and also up as compared to last quarter. Now we know memory is down as compared to last quarter, but all in all, it compensates.

Wennink,,Executives,7,"Yes, I think a couple things there. I think good news is that on the productivity side, we're meeting our productivity targets at ASML. We have run now our 3400C version at more than 170 wafers per hour, which is good, which is actually our target number. And we've run -- perhaps even more importantly, we've run the 3400C number now also under production conditions, memory production conditions of our customers and achieving more than 2,000 wafers per day.
So from a productivity point of view, good progress. I think from an EUV demand point of view, very much also driven by what we see in Logic, which is the 7-nanometer and beyond transitions. They are happening. So the EUV demand for this year, 30 units, of which 40%, 12 units, we need to ship in Q4, we're going to ship 7 in Q3. So that is -- that's very clearly there. The demand is there. If there's any risk, I would say 40% ramp in the fourth quarter of everything we need to ship to customers this year only in Q4 put some pressure on the supply chain, yes? So if there's any risk to the 30 number and it's probably some supply chain issues that might pop up once we start executing the shipments.
So all in all, pretty good, happy. When we look at the order intake also in Q2, 10 EUV shipments, it's just a proof of the fact the end demand is there.",248,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,9,"Well, we look at the third quarter, we expect about EUR 3 billion of sales. Gross margin, anywhere between 43% and 44%, but -- which includes 7 EUV systems. I think for the Q4 -- when you look at the total sales, we said earlier -- I said earlier, total sales 2019 will -- remains at our targeted level. Logic, a bit more up; Memory, a bit more down. That means that Q4 is going to be a very strong quarter, a very strong quarter in terms of sales. But also a strong quarter in terms of gross margin. I think we will see trending in Q4 the gross margin up to the 50% level that we are targeting for 2020. And driven by, I think, 4 main elements. One is, of course, the fact that it's a high-volume quarter, a lot of emerging systems. It's good margins there.
We see also good loading. I mean, in the fourth quarter, we have a good factory coverage. We see the introduction of the 3400C. So, basically, that's a higher-priced system. And last but not least, we will see the first EUV service income coming in.
So all in all, I think the year will be a good year if you think about this. People look at 2019 in terms of wafer fab equipment sales. Now the general expectations will be down this year in the wafer fab equipment, but not for ASML. 2019 looks another growth year for us, and we're happy with that.",253,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the second quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the third quarter of 2019. 
Q2 net sales came in at EUR 2.57 billion, within our guidance. Net system sales of EUR 1.85 billion was more weighted towards Logic at 61% with the remaining 39% from Memory, representing a similar split as the previous quarter. We reported EUV system revenue of EUR 764 million on 7 shipments, which was 1 more than guided. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 717 million, which was a bit higher than guided. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 43.0%, which was above guidance due to better EUV manufacturing results and higher field upgrades sales, more than compensating the negative mix effect in comparison to Q1.
Overall R&D and SG&A expenses came in as guided with R&D expense at EUR 487 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 123 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 884 million was paid as dividend and EUR 15 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q2. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 2.34 billion. 
Moving to the order book. Q2 system bookings came in at EUR 2.83 billion, which was 100% up from Q1 bookings, mainly driven by EUV where we took 10 new orders in the quarter. Logic order intake was 67% of total value with the remaining 33% from Memory, again reflecting the strong Logic demand expected this year. 
Net income in Q2 was EUR 476 million, representing 18.5% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 1.13. This was positively impacted by higher gross margin and a onetime tax benefit.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2019.
We expect Q3 total net sales of around EUR 3.0 billion. Our total net sales forecast for Q3 includes around EUR 750 million of EUV system revenue on 7 planned shipments. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management revenue to be around EUR 700 million.
Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 43% and 44%, which is slightly higher than Q2. The expected improvement in margin due to expected higher volume will be partially offset by customer configuration mix. We continue to expect significant improvements in gross margin in the fourth quarter driven by higher system sales, improved product mix, increased field upgrades, shipment of higher-margin NXE:3400C systems as well as contribution of EUV service revenue. This will enable us to achieve a gross margin for Q4, which approaches our 2020 target of over 50%.
The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR 495 million and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 125 million. Our estimated 2019 annualized effective tax rate is around 9% because of a onetime tax benefit in 2019. We still expect our long-term effective tax rate to be 14%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",508,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger as highlighted, although it was another modest, but decent quarter, results came in at above guidance, and we expect further strengthening in the coming quarters. The macroeconomic environment continues to provide market volatility, which translates to a level of uncertainty in the semiconductor industry. The demand for Memory remains soft while excess inventories are being worked down in the supply chain. And some of the second half Memory demand risk that we discussed last quarter has meanwhile materialized and resulted in system push outs of this year into 2020. This Memory weakness is being compensated by strengthening of Logic demand such that our view of 2019 total sales remains unchanged. As such, we expect 2019 to be a growth year with sales and profitability increasing throughout 2019. 
In Memory, the market continues to digest the high level of capacity additions that are put in place over the past few years. The digestion started last year was exacerbated by decelerating macroeconomic growth. This will likely extend throughout most of this year. Based on lower demands from our Memory customers, we now see our Memory sales down around 30% year-on-year versus 20% indicated last quarter.
As discussed last quarter, we see 2 contributing components with Memory demand this year. And we have characterized 1 as strategic, which we expect will happen largely independent of market conditions, which includes both early Chinese domestic Memory ramp and EUV for DRAM. This component is valued at approximately at EUR 1 billion, which we believe has low risk of pushouts. 
The second is the bit supply component, which we previously indicated as having a higher risk. And if you remove the strategic component from our estimated 2019 Memory demand, we get a lithography spend for Memory bit supply of around EUR 2.1 billion, which is around 45% lower than the comparable spend in 2018. And as we have already shipped around EUR 1.2 billion to Memory bit supply the first half of the year, it leaves around EUR 900 million in the second half of the year targeted for Memory bit supply, which has an inherently higher risk profile than the strategic investments in Memory. 
On the positive side though, our Memory customers continue to indicate they are making significant reductions in wafer output to an extent we haven't seen in previous downturns. This reduction in spend and lower wafer output will help in reaching a more normalized supply/demand balance.
Logic will clearly be our growth driver in 2019 with the majority of the demand linked to new technology transitions and advanced node additions. We are seeing increased demand from our customers driven by accelerated ramp of 7-nanometer node and beyond, supporting amongst others the introduction of 5G technology. With this strengthening, we now expect our Logic business to be up around 65% for the year relative to last year, which is 15 percentage points up from the 50% that we communicated last quarter.
Along with increased system demand in the second half, we also expect stronger demand from field upgrades, which translates to low single-digit percentage growth of Installed Base Management revenue.  
Now let me turn to the ASML product side and update you on our EUV business. In EUV, we recently demonstrated more than 170 wafers per hour on our first NXE:3400C system. We have also run more than 2,000 wafers a per day and the customer Memory production conditions and this is a significant milestone and that it confirms the required capability for Memory production, which means that our focus will be on stability and uptime to secure our customers ramp plans. We plan to ship the first NXE:3400C system in Q3, with a higher number of C systems planned in Q4. 
And as Roger mentioned, we shipped 7 systems in Q2, 1 more than guided and received 10 orders. As a confirmation of the potential of the NXE:3400C for cost-effective high-volume memory production, we received a number of EUV orders this quarter for systems slated for use in Memory. The customers are aggressively bringing new technology to the market, which reflects on the solid demand for 30 systems this year. Demand for NXE:3400C systems has proven to be high. Our 2019 shipment plan is significantly skewed towards the second half of the year and to Q4 specifically. Next to the back loaded plan, we're also transitioning to a new scanner model, like I said earlier, the 3400C, which suppliers need to ramp their production. Taking both of these into account, there is a risk of a few systems planned for Q4 moving into the first weeks of 2020. However, this risk has been taken into account in our comments regarding our full year 2019 sales outlook. 
In any case, strong demand for NXE:3400C as well as the continued progress in the ramp up of our production capacity is clear. 
In summary, despite uncertainty in the current environment, we continue to see a stronger second half with the strengthening of both sales and profitability quarter-on-quarter. Logic will be the primary driver of growth this year and demand has further strengthened from last quarter as customers accelerated ramp of their advanced nodes. Memory demand has more uncertainty and has further weakened since last quarter. However, as mentioned before, the stronger Logic demand compensates for the weaker Memory demand. And in total, our overall sales outlook for the year, as I mentioned before, remains unchanged, and we expect 2019 to be another year of growth. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",924,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

On the last one, it's '19 -- the 30% down is the total Memory sales of ASML into the Memory segment as compared to 2018. And so that's what the 30% meant. On EUV, 30 to 35, yes, that's our shipment capacity next year. Memory related, interesting question that is. Like I said in earlier calls, Memory has clearly given us a kind of a breakeven point where they can move into EUV as it relates to DRAM production and has to do with the productivity. And we gave a target of 2,000 wafers per day. Now we have shown in our factory under Memory production conditions that we can get over 2,000 wafers per day. So it's really about the uptime and the availability of the system. Now we're shipping the first C system this quarter, we will install it. So by the end of the year, we will be able to see really some, let's say, you could say, more marathon evidence of the 2,000 wafers per day. That will drive the demand for EUV next year. Having said that, I strongly believe that 2020 will be dominated by Logic in terms of EUV. It means the 3400C and I think currently when we talk to our Logic customers, as a very clear roadmap, a path into 2024, 7-nanometer and beyond. So no matter how you look at it, it's clearly an upside DRAM for next year, but the majority will still be different by the Logic demands from our customers.",254,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Just 2 quick ones. Firstly on the EUV bookings in the quarter. I am kind of following up from last question. But can you -- also can you help us understand how that breaks down between Memory and Logic in terms of what you're seeing so far? And is it fair to presume those are all 3400C? And then just secondly, I think last quarter you commented that EUV bookings this year would be quite back-end-loaded. So with you seeing 10 already in Q2 is quite solid. But is it fair to say then we shouldn't expect too much in Q3, that it will take that 3400C to be in the field to then get more bookings in Q4?

Yes, on the EUV bookings, I think the majority of the bookings that we shipped in Q2 are for Logic. There are a few systems, which are slated for Memory production, which is understandable because you want -- given the current state of the capability performance, it is logical that you would see some of those systems being shipped to go into a DRAM pilot [ low ] production. So the majority will be for our Logic customers. We had a good order intake in Q2. It's my expectation that, that will continue in Q3 and Q4. Because like I said, we have a production capacity actually between 30 and 35 units. And I think by the end of the year, we'll be fully booked for those tools because I do believe also that by the end of the year, we'll be able to actually show in longer test, marathon test that the DRAM conditions that we were able to show here at ASML were not a unique event and we'll be able to basically replicate that. So I don't think there will be an order low. I think it will be a gradual intake of orders towards the end of the year. Like we saw last year, last year we said the same thing. By the end of 2018, we'll have 2019 booked. It's my expectation that we'll see the same thing by the end of this year.",240,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I think we have this -- when we look at the production capacity 30 to 35, that is basically on the 12-month period. So if we have to shift few of those systems into January of 2020, they naturally would come on top of those 30 to 35. Under the assumption that we cannot have that same kind of supply chain risk at the end of 2020, which you could argue, there's a lot more learning curve so we should be able to keep the production schedule or the supply chain schedule better than we could in 2019 because we're introducing a new machine there. So yes, normally, it will be on top. But like I said, 30 to 35 is still a range of 5 tools. So I would stick to the 30 to 35.",137,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think there's a lot of questions in one question. But let me answer this. I mean 2020 where we gave you the 2020 number, there was basically a mid-market scenario that we gave you, yes.  And a mid-market scenario, like you said, that had a certain percentage growth on Memory, as I mentioned, 20% and 35%. And that is indeed the case. But what we're seeing today is also that Logic is a bit stronger than we anticipated. So that could be a compensating factor. But all in all, I think it's too early to make an educated guess on whether 2020 will be a moderate market or will be a low market. I think it's too early. I can only say that where we see Memory is today with indeed significantly lower growth, bit growth numbers than the ones you mentioned and the fact that our customers are cutting 45% of the their -- at least litho purchases for bit capacity. And they are lowering their wafer starts, I mean something will happen. So this is -- so it's too early. But I think the trends are clearly such that I believe customers are doing everything, try to rebalance the supply and the demand. And whether that will be at the end of the year, early 2020, it's simply too early to say.",226,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

I think it's an interesting question. I mean we're really looking at the introduction time of EUV in DRAM. And it is driven by -- I think it's just the economics. And like I said in previous quarters, also it's not only the economics, I think we also get a very clear feedback that the device performance using EUV is also significantly better. So it's a combination of the 2. And it will be an introduction time whether it's 1z or it's another alphabetical letter, it doesn't matter. At that moment in time, EUV is there to stay, yes.  And as you pointed out, going forward with those next generations, after the introduction node, there will be more layers added to EUV.

I don't think it's a pull in. I think that the majority of what we're seeing is incremental. And these are not borrowing from 2020.

I just wanted to dive in a bit into the gross margins. You said your gross margins in Q3 were affected by some customization work. Would you be able to give us any number as to -- in percentage terms as to what that hit is? And you're also suggesting that your gross margin in Q4 is likely to be quite close to sort of the 50% range, the high 40s.  Would you be shipping any 3400Bs in that quarter? Or would that shipment be entirely 3400Cs? And one small one, if I might push through is if DRAM were to improve, I mean DRAM were to start adopting EUV after the first runs of the 3400C and they do come in with orders, would you be able to accommodate more than 35 machines for next year? Or is that sort of an upper limit of what you can do with your current capacity?",159,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,30,"A couple of comments on the gross margin. So in terms of composition, Q3 resembles Q2 quite a bit, so in terms of sales mix. So that's why the basic point of departure there is kind of similar. It will be higher, right.  So the total volume will be higher, and therefore, factory loading will be higher that has an uptick in gross margins. And then we also said that in the mix, the configuration mix, Q3 is a little less favorable, if you like, than Q2. But that's minimal and just based on the configuration of the specific systems that we provide. And that's the reason why Q3 is a little bit higher than Q2, but not dramatically so. 
If we then move to Q4, I think you will see that the company is really going to run -- is going to fire on all cylinders. So then you really have the impact of a number of structural developments that are going to occur. First is the 3400C, to your point, Q4 will be -- still be a mix of B and C models, but the C model will be dominant in that total mix. But so you will have the increased benefit of the 3400C pricing and margin. At that point in time, we would also see that the service revenue on EUV will go up and service margin will go up. For Q4, we also predict better field upgrades, which is business that has a solid [ positive ] gross margin. We would also see higher factory loading as a result of the significantly higher volume that we have there. And Q4, as a result of all of the things that we just discussed, also has a very significant portion of emergent in there. So at that stage, we have 5 very significant developments that indeed will position us such that we are going to approach the over 50% guidance or indication that we've given for gross margin in 2020.

I think answering that question, I also want to go back to last year. We basically said EUV has turned the corner. And I said that I think on earlier occasions that I believe 2018 was a very significant year for a simple fact that the confidence that our customers had in EUV as the key enabler for next generation device innovations, that, that confidence got to a much higher level. Now with the 3400C and the results that we're seeing now, I think that has only strengthened. 
So when you look at the road maps that our customers are now presenting to us, very clearly to see an acceleration. And you can't imagine that. You can't imagine that, that there are -- if you look at the end markets, which is not only high-power compute in the mobile market, but it is much wide [Audio Gap] are actually increasing, looking at a competitive edge in a growing market. It's much wider application space. And I think this is what drives the road maps of our customers. And actually the road maps of our customers are more aggressive because of EUV and because that it works, I mean they see the results today. So this is why I believe that what we're currently seeing I mean is incremental and I think has basically a runway. This is -- and it makes sense.  If you look at where they are, they have a production technology that they can apply in terms of the innovation of the next generation nodes that their customers need. Where is the -- I think it is the more aggressive road maps that our customers are showing as our underpinning why I believe this is more sustainable.",291,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Yes, I think on the Memory side and especially China, I mean you have to realize that these are greenfield companies creating greenfield fabs, ramping their first nodes, their first device generations. And they need a certain level of output capacity that they need to put in place. That's happening this year. That's very strategic, that will happen. And of the EUR 1 billion, I mean half is China EUV roughly. And it doesn't matter that much or how it spread over the year. But that's roughly what it is and that is just happening. I mean it's -- we're not -- that's not waning, that's not increasing, it's just execution according to plan like we said last quarter.

I will answer the question on the lead time and Roger will answer the question on the OpEx. On the lead time, there is an order lead time which we give our customers of about 18 months. And now having said that, we are negotiating with our customers from time-to-time. And they don't always hold to the 18 months. It sometimes depends on some certain conditions that are not that significant, but we only have a deal when you have a signature. So but that -- the lead time is 18 months, it was 24. We're driving it down, we have to, because you have to realize that it's pretty difficult also for our customers to guess what they need in terms of capacity ramp and the size of the capacity ramp 18 or 24 months out, nobody knows. 
So it is essential that we keep reducing the cycle time in the supply chain and the cycle time in our factory so we make sure that we can deal with that flexibility. We don't put a limit to it. It is not that if you don't give an 18-month order, you won't get the slot because we have other ways to secure the shipment and that's basically knowing that we do the installation inspections when the factory is built, when the factory is finished. We work together with suppliers of the equipment that is attached to our tools. We work together with the suppliers and actually making all the facilities and all the piping and then -- and everything that goes with a semiconductor fab. So we know that customers are realistic and it's real that they are planning those EUV tools. And that gives us the confidence that while some customers might not adhere to the 18 months for all kinds of commercial reasons and that they sign the orders a bit later, the tool will ship, and that's how it works.",324,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,43,"On OpEx, as you know, 2 main components in there: SG&A, SG&A, as you would've seen, is fairly consistent over the quarters. So if you look at 2018, 2019, it's fairly consistent. And the guidance that we've given for next quarter, EUR 125 million, and that's the number that I'm pretty comfortable with that we'll be able to keep at that level for a little while. And as it relates to R&D, you're absolutely right. We've pushed down the accelerator last year on R&D. We've indicated why. So this is on the pulling end of the low-NA program, we're really accelerating that program. Again, the fact that we're now talking about the EUV, the first EUV 3400C shipment in this quarter. And the fact that we've been able to, in essence, pull that in with the year I think is the result of that effort. And we'll continue to speed up in that process and the low-NA development. 
High-NA is a big ticket item obviously in R&D and also the continued development of multi-beam. So those are the 3 main categories, as a result of which we told you last year, we're pushing down the accelerator. What we've guided for next quarter, EUR 495 million. I think it's reasonable to assume that, that's a number that you will also see in Q4. And then gradually you will see with -- an expected development of our business, I would expect that, let's say, at the second half of 2020 that you will see it get back gradually to the 40% that we've guided at the Capital Markets Day.

Let me say, I think on the longer term EUV tools, what you -- what -- EUV tools will be first used, let's say, at the industry 7-nanometer node. As I say, there's layers ranging anywhere from between 7, 8 to 12. It depends on what customers are actually doing and with a tendency to go up. The next node, which industry 5, that's a significant increase. I think you'll see likely more than 20 EUV layers. So yes, that will, of course, create a demand for more EUV tools. However, we also have a productivity increase road map that should deal with part of it. But it cannot only be taken up by productivity improvement, so we need more EUV tools. This is why we have a capacity of around 45 units in our factory. 
If you look at our Capital Markets Day presentation, then with our mid-market scenario, that is -- this is probably what we would need taking into account the higher productivity. Now if it turns out that the end demand, when I talk about the customer end, the demand is even stronger, then yes, there are scenarios where we have to go over 45.  We are not planning that yet. I think we have some time in terms of square meters that we need to build then because then we need to just extend the factories. We're not at that point yet, but we will watch that closely. But currently, I would say 45 units for a system with higher productivity capability, that should be sufficient for next couple of years.",267,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I have 2 of them. First one -- both on 2020. The first one for Roger, if you look at next year, it looks like you're going to do EUR 4.2 billion to EUR 4.4 billion-or-so in EUV revenue. Is this figure within that whole revenue stream should come in at a 40% gross margin or is 40% more the exit run rate for next year? And then a question for -- a follow-up for Peter. If your customers mix and demand is similar in 2020 as in 2019 and you're shipping more EUV units, should we assume DUV units start coming down in 2020 because of more EUV? Or you think that transition is still for the down the road?",126,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

To answer that question, I think it's further down the road. I mean, next year, you will still see very clear mix. Don't forget, let's take an example, there are Logic makers that have said we're going to ramp a 7-nanometer product in 2021, which means they need the tools in 2020. But still they're ramping capacity of the previous nodes, which is real capacity that they need to ship. So it's going to be a bit of a mix next year. The 2020 -- I don't think I've said at the 2020 EUV mix is going to be similar to 2019 because that is dependent on I think the success, you could call it or the demand for DRAM in the next year, which is a bit -- still needs to be proven like I tried to explain earlier.",141,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

Peter, as always, I appreciate all the detail.  I'm just kind of curious you talked about in your prepared comments that the non-EUV memory revenue for the back half of the year needs to be about EUR 900 million. I'm kind of curious if you could help us understand the profile between Q3 and Q4, i.e., how important is the Memory tick up to kind of your Q4 implied outlook? And do you think the current run rate is kind of, for better or worse, a bouncing along the bottom run rate and the risk is timing for an upturn? Or could you actually envision a scenario where Memory would actually go lower from these levels?",120,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

It's a good question. So John, to answer the last one, I need a crystal ball because I don't know, whether it's going to be lower or not. I mean is it the bottom run rate? Well, EUR 900 million, annualized EUR 1.8 billion for capacity in an industry that is growing and also looking at where Logic is going, it's pretty tough to see that much lower than it is. Now I think the spread of the EUR 900 million, I don't have the exact details here, but I think it's about half-half, I mean it's not that much different. I am looking at -- yes, I think it's about half-half, yes. So it's not skewed to one of -- to Q3 or Q4. But by any means, EUR 900 million for 6 months or EUR 1.8 billion on an annualized basis for capacity -- for bit capacity in litho is not a very large number if you analyze it -- if you annualize it. So that's actually, that's a low -- that's a relatively low number. 
Now is that a bottom? I don't know. I don't know what is going to happen, but like I said earlier, on the positive side, customers are also changing their wafer output plans to the down side. So all these things will, of course, help. It's like with every memory cycle, you have to grind through it and lowering CapEx. And in this particular case, which is different than previous cycles, as you know, turning -- or closing the faucets here, basically slowing down the number of wafer starts. That is something that we haven't seen before. So all these things will help. I'm not that pessimistic on the length of this downturn, this Memory downturn. It will turn whether it's the end of the year or beginning of next year, I mean I don't think it's going to last out a lot longer.",323,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

For my follow-up, I just wanted to go back to the impact of improving productivity on EUV tools shipment. It's pretty obvious that in the Memory space, DRAM space, there should be a pretty high correlation as productivity goes up, economics make more sense and even intra-node insertion of more layers seems like very plausible for DRAM. But I'm kind of curious about Logic foundry side just given that there's sort of a design cycle time for 5- and 7-nanometers, if you start to exceed productivity targets, does that actually drive more tool units or fewer tool units? Because my guess is intra-node insertion would be a much more difficult, timely, costly thing for your customers, your customers' customers. Are we still focused on units because if productivity is going up, I am assuming you're going to get better ASPs. So should we be more focused on a revenue target for litho instead of unit targets -- for EUV instead of a unit target?",168,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I'll let Roger comment on the last part. Yes, I think when you look at customers and the EUV uncertainty that I have seen over the last couple of years, the fact that they actually have changed layer adoption of EUV as we went -- as we -- as they gained more confidence and got more information out of their R&D, they actually changed the layer counts. It did -- it wasn't stable. I mean it actually changed. And actually, there's a tendency to go up. So that proves that the customers do take -- they have alternatives.  Not that they're completely developing 2 separate techs, I think there's some interchangeability there, where they can swap certain layers to EUV if the economics make sense. I think it's taken into account in the design process. I mean that's what we've seen. And although why, as you know, the strength that we've seen by adding more layers could not have happened and we're seeing it. So it means that they're taking account of it.

I think more and more we need to look at the EUV business not in terms of units, but in terms of the euro value that is attributed to that because you're absolutely right. The number of units is meaningless to the extent that you see the very significant uptick that we've been able to demonstrate in productivity and then translates into higher ASP. So that's why, on the go-forward basis, I do believe that we all need to think much more in terms of EUV revenue rather than EUV units.",108,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think we are introducing several new features on the 3400C, which includes -- actually it ranges from optics to laser alignment systems to the module vessel, which we're using to create EUV plasma. And it's all of the above and it all needs to come together at the right time. So when you have one of these components a few weeks later then you're a few weeks behind the shipment schedule.

Dassen,,Executives,5,"So for Q4, we guide in terms of revenue EUR 3.9 billion, which is a very high number, but it's also more or less in line with what we said before. EUR 3.9 billion -- including in the EUR 3.9 billion would be 8 EUV shipments. That is a little lower than what we had demand for and also what we had basic capacity for because you might recall that we have demand and basic capacity for the year for 30 tools. 
And if you add it all up, we would land at 26 tools for this year. The reason for that, as what we've indicated in the previous quarter, is that we had some issues in the supply chain. Those issues have been solved, but it did lead to a certain delay in the rest of the floor as a result of which we're going to have a few systems, so 4 systems really, drop into the first weeks of 2020. So EUR 3.9 billion. 
On the gross margin side, our guidance is between 48% and 49%, which is a very significant improvement of gross margin over the previous quarters of this year. We've talked about the main reasons why gross margin is picking up as it is. So just to recap those main reasons, a big one there is the pricing of the 3400C. So nearly all of the EUV tools that we're going to ship in Q4 are 3400Cs. So that is a -- and they have a much better margin profile. So that's the main driver. 
Second element is the EUV service revenue. We talked about that before. A significant portion of EUV service revenue is linked to wafer output. Wafer output is gradually going up, is picking up. So Q4, better than in Q3. And we'll continue obviously to further improve with EUV getting into high-volume manufacturing across the board. So you will see an uptick there. 
We have field upgrades at a higher level than we've seen before, and that will result in a significant uptick. Also the mix that we have in our DPV sales is favorable. We have quite some immersion tools that will ship in Q4. 
And finally, with this large volume, we also have a significant factory loading in Q4 as a result of which the fixed cost coverage is improving. So that's why we're looking at a very favorable development of gross margin to 48% to 49%, in that bracket. 
If we then look at the full year. So if you add it all up, then for the full year, we would land approximately at EUR 11.7 billion, which is more or less in line with what we expressed as an expectation at the beginning of the year, at least at the overall revenue level. 
If you look at the way it being composed, there is a significant shift even more so than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, a significant shift to Logic, and landing for the full year at approximately what we expected at the beginning of this year. I think it's a significant fee that we're able to do that in light of what I just mentioned, the fact that we have 4 EUV tools that might fall into the first weeks of 2020 but also in light of the weakness of the memory market. I think all in all, we can look at a very strong performance for ASML for the full year 2019.",582,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Dassen,,Executives,7,"So it's a little early to give quantitative expectations for 2020. But let me give you some qualitative considerations that we have looking into 2020. 
Let's start with Logic. I think the Logic market is healthy, and that is driven by all the things that we've been talking about for quite a while. So obviously, artificial intelligence. But definitely also what you hear our customers talk about quite a bit is 5G both on the device side but also the application of the more advanced nodes in the infrastructure for 5G, which is new. So those are significant drivers of the demand there, and that creates a very healthy climate for Logic. 
If we look at our customers, we see them at different stages in the acceleration of their road map, but all of that really translates into good demand for our products and particularly, I would say, on the EUV side. 
If we look at EUV, our current expectation is that we might be looking at 35 EUV tools, all of them 3400Cs for next year. So EUV, I think, is looking really good. 
If we then go to the memory market. I think there is uncertainty about the point in time where the memory market will recover. There will be recovery. The question really is at what point in time will you see the recovery and at what point in time will that recovery lead to increased demand for our products. There's a specific relevance, I would say, for DPV and specific relevance for the DPV revenue and gross margin. So that's why it's of interest to us, obviously. 
If I look at today's market, then I think it's fair to say that the condition of the market today is not as favorable as the market condition that we assumed when we were looking at the mid-market growth scenario that we modeled at the Capital Markets Day in November of 2018. But hey, we've all been there. If the recovery is there, then you will see all of a sudden the recovery will be fast and the recovery will be strong. So I think we still have very significant options and positive options on the table for 2020. 
On installed base revenue, indeed we do see a significant potential there and a significant uptick from where we are this year. And that is a combination of what we discussed earlier on, which is the increase in EUV service revenue, which, again, is driven by wafer output, which obviously will go up in 2020 in comparison to 2019. But also we do plan for quite some upgrades in the next couple of months and upgrades that will bring significant value to our customers. And all of that leads me to believe that the expectation for the installed base revenue in 2020 can be very favorable.",477,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Dassen,,Executives,9,"First off, I think we should recognize that this is a momentous quarter for EUV if you just look at everything that's happened. So first off, let's recognize that we now see the first commercial sales of devices manufactured on EUV. And the manufacturers of that have publicized that in quite a substantial way. So I think EUV is there. It's in the product that you can buy today as a customer and as a consumer. And I think that's a remarkable thing that we should just recognize happened in the last quarter. So that's one important thing to recognize. 
Second important thing to recognize is we had the first 3400C machines shipped in Q3. Now if you add it all up, it's very clear that the confidence that our customers have in EUV has gotten to a very, very high level. And if you then see that translate into the bookings that we had in the last quarter, 23 EUV bookings for Q3, I think that's testimony to the fact that the confidence levels on EUV are at a very, very high level. 
And this is both for the Logic market but also for the DRAM market because a substantial number of the -- percentage of those 23 was, in fact -- is, in fact, related to DRAM, and that tells you that the confidence levels in the performance that our new tool, the 3400C, generates at that point is very, very high. So I think this is an important thing to recognize where we are, an important quarter. 
And just looking back, 20 years of hard work, 20 years of perseverance not just of ASML but of many believers in the ecosystem. And I think this is probably the right point in time to express a big thank you to everyone who has been involved in making this happen. And then that way really was fundamental in creating a solid underpinning for a very bright future for ASML.",330,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I will first highlight some of the third quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019. Q3 net sales came in at EUR 3 billion as guided. Net system sales of EUR 2.3 billion was heavily weighted towards Logic at 79% with the remaining 21% from Memory, clearly showing the current strength of Logic business and the digestion mode of Memory business. We reported EUV system sales of EUR 743 million from 7 shipments as guided.
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 661 million, which was a bit lower than guided. We expect this will be captured in a higher Q4 installed base sales. Gross margin for the quarter was 43.7%, nicely within the range we guided. Overall R&D and SG&A expenses came in as guided with R&D expenses at EUR 493 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 129 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 154 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q3. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 2.1 billion
Moving to the order book. Q3 systems bookings came in at a record EUR 5.1 billion, mainly driven by EUV where we received 23 new orders in the quarter, both from Logic and Memory customers. Logic order intake was 73% of the total value with the remaining 27% from Memory, again reflecting the strong Logic demand. Net income in Q3 was EUR 627 million, representing 21% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 1.49. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect Q4 total net sales of around EUR 3.9 billion, which will represent another record year with approximately EUR 11.7 billion of sales. Our total net sales forecast for Q4 includes around EUR 950 million of EUV system sales from 8 planned shipments. 4 systems originally planned in Q4 will now ship in early 2020 due to temporary supply constraints in the NXE:3400C ram. We expect our Q4 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 850 million, which is almost EUR 200 million higher than Q3 driven by strong demand for field. 
Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be between 48% and 49%, which is significantly higher than Q3. The expected improvement in margin is due to higher system volume, higher ASP for NXE:3400C model, Deep UV product mix, higher EUV service sales and higher field upgrade sales. The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around EUR 500 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 135 million. Our estimated 2019 annualized effective tax rate is around 7% due to several tax benefits in 2019. We still expect our long-term effective tax rate to be 14%.
Regarding our capital return. ASML announced that it has revised its capital return policy to provide for dividend payments on a semiannual basis. ASML dividend proposals will continue to be subject to the availability of distributable profits or retained earnings and other factors such as future liquidity requirements. 
The interim dividend over 2019 will be EUR 1.05 per ordinary share. The ex-dividend date as well as the fixing date for the euro/U.S. dollar conversion will be November 4, 2019, and the record date will be November 5, 2019. The dividend will be made payable on November 15, 2019. In January 2018, ASML announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 2.5 billion worth of shares to be executed within the 2018-2019 time frame. ASML intends to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 2.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans.
Through September 29, 2019, ASML has acquired 8.2 million shares under this program for a total consideration of EUR 1.4 billion. ASML does not expect to purchase the full EUR 2.5 billion worth of shares within the 2018-2019 time frame. In line with our policy to return excess cash to shareholders through growing annualized dividends and regularly timed share buybacks, we will decide on a new share buyback program next year. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",705,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

As Roger highlighted, it was a good quarter and provided another clear signal on the increasing customer confidence in EUV technology as witnessed by the strong EUV order volume for both Logic and Memory manufacturing. We expect a very strong fourth quarter in both sales and profitability, again driven by Logic demand for both EUV and Deep UV, and this further confirms 2019 to be a Logic-driven year as we indicated at the start of the year, fueled by end-market applications requiring high-performance computes, such as 5G and AI, which drives demand for leading-edge Logic. This in turn translates to demand for both EUV and Deep UV in support of the most advanced nodes as customers accelerate their ramp plans for 7-nanometer and beyond. 
In Memory, the market continues to digest inventory in the supply chain and operate with reduced wafer output as they work to reach a more normalized supply/demand balance. And this translates into a weak demand from our Memory customers, and we see a significant reduction in our Memory business this year as indicated in earlier conference calls. We expect this weaker demand environment to continue through Q4 of this year, whereby the timing of the recovery still remains uncertain. We continue to expect low single-digit percentage increase in our installed base sales this year. 
Let me now turn [ the page ] on our product side and update you on our EUV business. EUV customers continue to ramp this technology in volume manufacturing and have publicly announced some of their first EUV-manufactured devices. We continue to make solid progress and shipped our first NXE:3400C systems this quarter for use in volume manufacturing. The NXE:3400C will deliver an increase in productivity of over 35%, which will provide significant customer value and bring profitability in our EUV business more in line with the rest of the business. 
The high productivity of the NXE:3400C demonstrated the required capability for Memory insertion as evidenced by the system orders as well as a potential increase of layer adoption in Logic. Of the 7 EUV systems shipped this quarter, 3 were NXE:3400C systems, and we plan to ship another 34006 -- 3400C systems next quarter of the total 8 systems planned in Q4. 
As Roger mentioned, there were some temporary challenges in the supply chain as we ramp our output capability and transition to a new fully configured 3400C model. These supply constraints resulted in a movement of a few systems originally planned to ship in Q4 and to early next year. Customers are aggressively bringing new technology to the market. And with increased customer confidence around EUV technology, we're seeing strong demand for our EV systems at -- as witnessed by the strong order intake of 23 systems in Q3. These systems are planned for the ramp of 7-nanometer Logic and beyond as well as insertion in 1z and 1a DRAM production. To meet strong customer demand for our 3400C systems, we have a production plan in place for 35 EUV systems next year, which includes the systems originally planned in 2019. 
To summarize 2019, we see a strong fourth quarter in both sales and profitability. Logic has been the primary driver of growth this year, and demand has strengthened as customers accelerate the ramp of their advanced nodes. Memory demand remains weak as customers work to reduce inventory and improve factory utilization. Our overall view for the year remains largely unchanged, and we confirm 2019 to be another year growth.
Regarding our outlook for next year, it's too early to provide quantitative expectations, but we'll make a few qualitative comments. Major innovation drivers and applications like artificial intelligence, 5G, autonomous driving and big data are driving a clear secular growth path in high-performance Logic at the advanced nodes. Logic demand is currently strong. And although different, Logic customers are at different phases of accelerating their road map. We expect this demand to remain healthy, primarily driven by EUV, as we look into next year.
As customers transition to the 7-nanometer node and beyond with increase in EUV layers, it is also driving strong demand for our UV systems. As all systems are expected to be NXE:3400C systems next year, we expect to not only see an increase in unit volume, but also expect to see significant growth in UV sales next year. These new applications -- these new application drivers not only require high-performance Logic, but also require high-performance Memory to maximize value. Memory demand is more critical in nature -- sorry, memory demand is more cyclical in nature, and the memory market conditions today do not yet reflect what we would call moderate market conditions, but a scenario that we used to model 2020 as we -- as was shown during our Investor Day last year.
Although the Memory market is widely expected to recover next year, there is uncertainty on the timing and when it will trigger the demand for wafer fab equipment and more specifically, demand for our DPV and application products. Where the Memory market recovers, history has shown that the demand can change quickly and it likely will be the case again this time. The timing and the degree of this Memory recovery, in combination with the current outlook for the Logic demand, will determine the ultimate 2020 product mix between EUV, Deep UV and application products. This not only forms the basis for another year of growth but, depending on this mix, will also determine the margin profile for the year as our EUV margin improvement is well underway but not yet at the Deep UV levels. 
Regarding installed base business next year, we expect the service portion of this business to grow nicely as our installed base grows. As our customers start running EUV in high-volume production, we therefore expect to see more EUV service sales next year. There are also a large number of upgrades planned next year that we expect to drive significant growth in our upgrade business. 
In summary, the positive momentum in EUV is reflected in the increasing confidence of our customers as they accelerate the adoption of EUV technology in volume manufacturing. And although there is still some short-term uncertainty around timing and the degree of the Memory recovery, we are optimistic on a medium- to long-term secular trend which underpins the confidence we have in our 2025 growth scenarios.

Thank you, David. On the 30 to 35 systems, that's what we said before. And indeed, you are correct, unless, as Roger mentioned, we have 4 systems that we're planning to ship in 2019, moving to 2020, so we put them on top. But as you also know, that in 2019, we were back-end loaded this year. So we always said that that's the beginning of the year. And with the introduction of the C, we experienced a few weeks' delay on certain modules that are part of the final configuration of the C. So that's why it moved into 2020. 
So just to be on the safe side, we are -- you could argue, without the forces that moved from 2019 through '20, we're on the lower side of this 30 to 35 range, and that is correct. So plus 4, that's why we say 31 plus 4 is about 35 systems. Does that mean that we don't have more capability? No. We do have more capability. I think we're just more on the conservative side. Also, given what happened this year, back-end loaded, that could mean that you always have a risk of moving some systems into 2021. So you should look at it in this context.
Now on HMI, as you know, HMI shipments were largely focused on the Memory business. It's voltage contrast applications in the 3D NAND space. That, of course, has been lackluster, as we all know, and -- especially for 2019. So yes.

Now for well-known reasons and good reasons, that particular participation of that partner could not happen and that actually meant we had to do it ourselves, which created a 6- to 9-month delay. So that means that the first pilot systems are going out in Q1 next year, which you have to add about a year before you go into HBM. So the anti -- note the HBM ramp will be about 12 months later move into 2021.",158,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Would it be fair to say that as you ship this first multi-beam e-beam system early next year, you gain more momentum, then by the time you have your next Capital Market Day, you would be able to discuss more how the Holistic Lithography part of the story is going to be scaled? And I'm asking you this because e-beam was supposed to be part of it. It was delayed, and now it's back on track. And I think now that the EUV is in high-volume manufacturing, it will be great to get an update on how holistic and part of it how multi-beam e-beam inspection going to play out throughout 2020.

So I don't think that is a major issue for 2020. I think when you referenced to a Capital Market Day of next year, which, of course, we'll talk about a bit later, but we'll definitely have one, we will talk about the holistic strategy of the company as an integral part of our entire product strategy, and it will be a growth area.
But you say EUV being there. Yes. It is ramping in HBM in 2020, definitely, but it's just the beginning. I mean the growth of the company does not depend on the growth in our holistic business. It's -- that's going to be an integral part of our growth profile. EUV, as you may remember from the previous analyst, the -- is the significant part of our business by 2025 with a significant growth profile. So I think it is both holistic applications. And you need to remember, our holistic strategy is a combination of our application business, our EUV and Deep UV business, yes?

And always it's a -- what we need to watch as has always been the case is the pricing levels, what is the pricing trend. When the pricing trend turns for both, you just need to see how sustainable it is. So you really need to be kind of objective from 1 or 2 weeks. We have to look at it from a little bit longer period and then look at that trend. And then you need to remember when that trend turns, that our Memory customers still have some idle capacity that they are going to use first before they start to add more wafer fab equipment. That's all. This is the general trend, both true for NAND and for DRAM. So I would advise all of us to just keep looking at the pricing trends.",198,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

That is the ambition, and we have the plans to get there. And that will, of course, fully depend on the value that we bring to our customers. But we're confident that with the road map that we have in front of us that we are going to get there. So that is what we're driving on the system side.

And then secondly, with regards to Memory usage of -- or DRAM usage of EUV, how the progress is on that front and how you see that ramping up?

To answer your last question, I think Memory will follow. But I think that the insertion timing of EUV for Logic customers is much closer to each other where you could say that the difference of insertion is a year, 1.5 years max, whereby I think with DRAM, it could be a bit longer. And so I think, yes, you will see this trend, but it will be -- but it will definitely be, let's say, more spread out over time where just like I said on the answer of the previous call -- of the previous question, that one of those other Memory makers or DRAM makers is closer to the leader and other one is following at more distance. So it will take more time before all players in the DRAM markets are EUV users as opposed to the Logic market where it all happens within, let's say, a 12-month time frame.
So on the manufacturing capacity, what needs to happen, I don't think -- our current plan is that with the focus of cycle time reduction, that's what it is, we can probably push our capacity in the supply chain and the ASML to launch UV systems. Now I'm not going to say that, that's going to be there next year. But next year, we'll be over 40. That our final plan is that with the cycle time reduction and production efficiencies, we should be able to push with the current square meters that we have and that -- perhaps a few more people, then we can push it to 50 units.",266,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

First question is really on the EUV gross profit margin in the quarter. I just wondered if you could give us some color on what the margin was in 3Q and what do you expect us to do in 4Q, and then just any color on the ramp into 2020 as well. I know you've given the number for the full year, but any -- how should we think about the cadence? And my follow-up is on the CapEx. You previously said that annualizing the 1Q number would be a good proxy for CapEx for this year. Is that still true?

Dassen,,Executives,46,"So on the gross margin for EUV in Q3, I think we said that for the full year, you would look at the full year around 30%; for Q3, you're looking at slightly under 30%; for Q4, you're looking at slightly over 30%. That's the way to look at it. 
Again, we should bear in mind that in Q4, we don't get the full benefit of the pricing of the 3400C because of what we discussed earlier on, which is that they are not yet in final configuration. So you will see for 2020 that there is more potential there. And that added to what Peter was discussing, which is the reduction of cycle time, all those are the factors that will ultimately drive EUV system sales to the 30%, 40% and above that, that we discussed earlier on.
In terms of CapEx, I think that the CapEx number that you've seen for the first quarters, I think you will see a slight increase. And that's for the fourth quarter. So for the full year, you're going to see approximately EUR 800 million to EUR 900 million of CapEx. For the next -- for 1 or 2 years thereafter, you might see similar levels of CapEx because as we have pointed out before, we are at a point where we are really accelerating the developments of our High-NA. And of course, that will lead to building of clean rooms. It will lead to significant investments that we're making together with ZEISS. We're building a logistics center. So we have -- we're really preparing for a sort of the ramp of both low-NA EUV, but also for High-NA. So we will see that for, let's say, another 2 years. And then gradually, you will see that the CapEx levels, as a percentage of sales, will develop to the kind of 3% that we've modeled for 2025. So I think that's the way to look at it. So a few years of significant investments and then getting to a more steady state, 30%, that we've indicated for 2025.",346,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

And I think the DPV sales has always -- it will not be driven by Logic because Logic is pretty strong. DPV sales and the trend of DPV sales will be driven by the timing of the recovery of the Memory market. So I think what we will see in DPV sales is a -- it's a bit of -- it will happen. I'm pretty confident that the Memory rebound will happen in 2020. It's just a matter of when. But if that's the case, then I would see an improvement of the DPV sales profile throughout 2020.

As you know and as we've talked about before, this year, we have a mismatch because on the one hand, we have significant cost of helping our customers prepare for high volume and manufacturing, whereas the service revenue is based on wafer output, which, of course, is only kicking in gradually this quarter and last quarter at a very low pace. Of course, that will rebalance itself in the course of 2020. So at that stage, we will get an imbalance. And then from 2021 onwards, we'll see a significant, positive development in the gross margin development of EUV service sales.",124,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I just wanted to maybe check with you where we stand in the ramp of EUV in Logic in terms of penetration in the node that are rolling out, being ramped up now and the next generation that is going to be ramping up maybe in 1 or 2 years from now. And my question is, if you sell like X number of tools or X number of players in the 7-nanometer, 7-plus node, what kind of number of tools or what kind of number of layers should we expect in the next-generation models of 5-nanometer or 5 node?",106,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

It's -- when you look at the 7-nanometer node, I mean we said this before, on average, there is about 10 layers, yes. That's all in average. And then with different customers, we have different layers. But the average, if you take 10, you're probably right. When you go to the next node, which is going to be 5-nanometer node, you should look at doubling it, yes. So -- and this is about the main rule that you can use. But again, it depends on the customer architecture. Some could be a bit lower, other could be a bit higher.

And then if you think of anything in terms of how you translate that into the outlook revenue for yourself, then we need to take into account the improvement of productivity in tools and then increase in prices.

I think it's not simply a function of volume. It's also a function of the value. So when we look at our road map there, the road map is really driven by the productivity of our tools. And we are still focusing on improving the next-generation points you see in NA EUV tools in terms of productivity. So that will be a higher value. But also, it's not only that, it is also the more stringent and more -- I'd say, more aggressive on product overlay numbers that are also going to provide a little value to our customers. So it is a combination of those 2. So it's that -- it's -- so the growth of the sales will not only be a function of the volume, but definitely also volume times the value increase.

So if you have a machine that has a higher throughput and that throughput is recognized by the customer, that also means that the breakeven point between the multiple patterning layer and that EUV layer comes closer and closer, yes? So yes, we will see with a higher productivity, higher uptime, the better non-maturity of the tool, the better overlay, I think you're all right to just basically transfer multiple layers into EUV.

I guess first question, if I go back to your commentary in early September around Memory, you were talking about an increase in utilization and giving some comfort to a recovery, whereas I think the language here seems a little bit more, I don't know, conservative. And so I guess would love to hear if anything has changed in your Memory outlook over the last month or 2. And then as you think about a recovery into 2020, if you could parse how you're thinking about NAND versus DRAM, given that your intensity on the NAND side is so much less than the DRAM side.",110,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

I think you are absolutely right on the last point. I mean it depends. And I think it was an earlier question, what do we think is going to rebound first, NAND or DRAM? And I answered that by saying we don't know. But it's true. If NAND ramps first, the litho intensity in NAND is lower than in DRAM. At the other hand, it's very difficult to predict which one will go first. 
On the increase in utilization, we have actually said in terms of the utilization, what we have seen is that the utilization numbers have stabilized and it's just a matter of to see how DRAM pricing will recover, how inventories that are in the chain, how inventories will be in and up and will be absorbed over what time periods, then customers will start to utilize the tools even at the higher level before they start putting in orders for new wafer fab equipment. I think it's the utilization leveling that we have seen, which is always good. We talked about it in that context. But then it doesn't tell you anything about the end market yet because that is a matter of people buying more bits.
And with reference to what I said earlier in our 2020 model, which was the scenario modeling that we did, we assumed for 2020 a 20% bit growth in DRAM and a 40% in NAND. This is not where we are today. Now that doesn't tell us anything about next year because it could change and it probably will and it very likely will. But to what extent would it then grow in 2020, that's something we just have to wait and see. And like I said, I would suggest we all look at the pricing levels of those devices and take that as an early indicator of what's going to happen.",314,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

Wennink,,Executives,63,"So C.J., a couple of reasons for the share buyback program and the delay in execution thereof, if you like. So one, we should not forget that we also introduced an interim dividend and, of course, we can only distribute the euros once, right? So that is one -- a key element. You're right, CapEx. And we talked about CapEx is significant. So that's another driver. And also, the further ramping of EUV and also the fact that we're pretty backloaded this year in terms of sales. I mean all of that contributes to a free cash flow pattern this year, which is a bit of an anomaly. And that's -- so that's combined with the interim dividend. I think that created the circumstance that we just described.
Tempting, what you do, to ask us to make any projections on the share buyback program in 2020. We're going to do that in 2020. And in 2020, we'll announced what the share buyback program will look like at that point.",170,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Peter, in your prepared comments as well, you sort of referenced the performance of 3400C and sort of talked about customers being -- sort of having greater conviction in the tools operation and therefore, layer count going up. So when you talk about sort of 10 layers on average at 7-nanometer, doubling to 20 at 5-nanometer, that has been a moving target higher. 7-nanometer's relatively fixed at this point. But as we look at the 5-nanometer, is there still the opportunity for that to go higher? What are you hearing from the customers in terms of those plans?",126,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think it's a good question. Of course, our planning of the number of layers that we use EUV is also based on the assumption that our -- that we share with our customers or customers share with us. And you should not forget, there's always a level of conservatism in there. You have to -- where you have the tool, let's say, 2 years back, and we talked about layers of 7-nanometer. And of course, they look at those layers at the absolute necessarily layers that needed EUV. And over time, when we got more confidence and customers got more confidence on EUV as a production technology, the layer count went up. It gradually went up. And it's logical because you get more confidence and that means your level of risk-taking is also different, which I think will also be true for 5 -- when you go to 5-nanometer. 
And we would -- and we will execute on our productivity improvement plans, we will execute on our uptime plans, we will execute on the plans that we have for the improvement along product overlay. When you look at that and we do this and customer will gain more confidence over time and obviously in 2020 on the use of EUV in high-volume production and we execute on our plans, I see a trend similar to what we saw on the 7-nanometer, is that the number of layers might go up. And that would be quite logical, but it's all a matter of cost. So yes, there is definitely upside opportunity.",262,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So on the SG&A side, I think the 4% that we've modeled, that's -- I think that's still what we're targeting for. So I think that's probably still the right number to go for. 
In terms of R&D, I guess the way to look at it is this year, we're probably going to end approximately EUR 2 billion. That's the R&D number that we're looking at for this year. I think if we look at the capacity that we have today after the significant increase in capacity in terms of number of people that we have in the R&D department, I think we're now at a stage where we say that's the right capacity to have for the -- at least for the near-term development plans that we have. We talk about the acceleration for low-NA. We talk about High-NA. We talk about multi-beam. We talked to you before about, for instance, the people that we hired as a result of the Mapper transaction for multi-beam. So I think at this stage, we're comfortable with the people that we have. So for the foreseeable future, I think what you're looking at is that the capacity is okay.

So on the throughput for the 3400C, as we said before, for the machine, it's 170 that the throughput that which, again, is a more than 30% uptick from the 125 that we had on the B machines. The changes that we're going to make to the machines that are out in the field now, both for this quarter and for next quarter, in essence, they're not really related to throughput, they are more related on the availability of the tool. So -- because it's all related primarily to the modular vessel. And that is not so much a factor, if you like, in throughput, it's a factor in the availability. Now we expect that, that will be done next year.
In terms of upgrades, for the 3400B machines, we do have a number of upgrades available for 3400Bs do not exactly get into the same throughput out of 3400C because that would mean swapping of LANs, which wouldn't make economic sense.

On the -- and on the DRAM layer count, yes. I mean on 1z, it's 1 layer. On 1 alpha -- also, what is true for Logic is also true for DRAM. I think its throughput is amazing. And DRAM is more cost-sensitive in a sense. So higher throughput to more attractive. It could be to replace these multiple patterning layers with EUV. So that is one thing. At the other hand also, what we are seeing is that device performance in DRAM is also very much favorable when it comes to these critical layers for EUV. 
So now 1 alpha is not in HBM yet, as you know. So it's still in -- you could say, that is still in the development phase. But currently, we are looking at 3 to 4 layers. So I mean we've been surprised. I've been getting some feedback on the reasons why our customers want to move with DRAM in -- sorry, with EUV in DRAM. And one of the reasons is not so much the current productivity, but it is the device performance that you get when you use EUV as compared to Deep UV. So currently, 3 to 4 layers. But like I said, it's in the development stage, so we don't know what is still in there when we really get to a maturity level.

Two questions, if I may. Firstly, maybe for Roger. When we look at -- you touched upon the free cash flow development earlier. And when we look at the change in assets and liabilities over the first 9 months, it does seem significantly more negative than in previous year. I would assume that's to do with the EUV ramp. But could you give us a sense for how you think free cash flow development might shape up going into next year? Any parts in terms of how we should model that would be appreciated. And secondly, if I may, going back to the 23 orders, just wanted to understand the thought process in terms of customer discussions. Clearly, a large number. Do you think the customer has gone ahead and placed this order because they are worried that EUV is accelerating and they might fall behind in the queue? You think it's a one-off? Is it a sign of maturity? Just trying to understand what's led to the customer go ahead and place such a large order at this stage.",184,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I'll take the free cash flow question and Peter will take the customer question. So on the free cash flow, I think it's actually a combination of things. I think, rightfully, you point at the continued EUV ramp. That's definitely the case. I mean the way EUV is ramping indeed does lead to a free cash flow anomaly, as I call it. So therefore, you would expect at some stage for that to normalize. And also, given where we are today, we are talking to our customers to look at different models and also in terms of prepayment there and down payments in there. So that's what we're addressing. And I think given the level of maturity that we currently have on the products, I think that is the right way for us to go.
Secondly, as we've all seen, this year is very much back-loaded in terms of sales. And obviously, that also results in a situation where free cash flow is following an anomalous pattern. So if both of those issues are addressed, I would expect that next year, you're going to see a cash conversion, which is much more natural than what you've seen in this year.",203,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

On the question for -- on the customer orders and why so large now. You mentioned is it fair that they're going to end up in the back of the queue, I think customers are -- the way that we interact with our customers and the transparency that we give them on our manufacturing capability, on our manufacturing plans, I don't think that give rise to a lot of fear. It is really driven by the fact that the customers have figured out that in the devices that they want to make, whether it's 7-nanometer or whether it's DRAM, 1z products, that the performance of EUV layers and the productivity that they can now count on gives them the confidence that this is the way to go. And so this is the first question that they will internally answer and then we'll share it with us. And then they come to the next question and say, and then how much do we need and what is available? And then, of course, it's -- well, it was a public knowledge where that -- what our capacity is. It's -- and EUV is very complex technology, and we also know that we're ramping a supply chain that from time to time might be a bit late, a couple of weeks late, as we have seen at the end of this year. 
So this is the order. Why did they come? They come because they know that EUV will provide them with the solutions that they need, and it's going to provide them significant value. And if you listen to the customer statements, you can actually get confirmation on that. Now -- and then of course, they come to us and we're very transparent on our capacity and say, fine, if this is the EUV performance, this is our wafer start ramp plan and this is the number of tools that we need.
Yes. You are capacity limited, let's put the order in. It's in that order and not the other way around.",341,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
