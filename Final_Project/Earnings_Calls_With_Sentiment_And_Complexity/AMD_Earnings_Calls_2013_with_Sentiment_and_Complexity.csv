168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3995.0,404098.0,19064583.0,Presenter Speech,Rory Read,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth. We made progress in the fourth quarter, delivering on our commitments, managing expense and cash and beginning to transform AMD for long-term growth and profitability. However, full year results fell short of our expectation as the challenging macro environment resulted in a weaker-than-expected PC market. 
As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we are executing a turnaround that will take several quarters. We expect continued choppiness in the PC market in the first half of 2013, and we will closely manage the business as we reset, restructure and ultimately transform AMD. 
We have the right strategy and a new set of products coming to market in 2013. We continue to make the investments required to drive a larger percentage of our revenue in the high-growth adjacent markets: dense server, semi-custom, embedded and ultra-low-power client markets. 
We are implementing 3 phases of our turnaround: first, complete the restructuring of our business. This is a critical step in reducing our operating cost model to enable a return to profitability; second, accelerate our business in 2013 by executing the delivery and launch of a new set of powerful product offerings; and third, transform AMD to take advantage of high-growth opportunities in adjacent markets where our IP provides a competitive advantage.
As with any turnaround, it is critical we meet our commitments throughout each step. To that end, we effectively managed our cost, reduced our inventory and maintained our cash above our minimum acceptable levels in the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.55 billion met our guidance while decreasing 9% sequentially and by 32% from a year ago. 
For the second year in a row, we had a successful Black Friday as sales of AMD-based notebooks in North American retail grew from a year ago. As a result, nearly 1 in every 3 notebooks sold in U.S. retail in the fourth quarter were powered by AMD. We also saw a sequential increase in desktop microprocessor ASP based on strong channel adoption of our new Athlon FX CPU and A-series APUs in the quarter. 
The value proposition of our latest processors drove demand and helped reduce channel inventory. Customers continue to embrace the differentiated value proposition of our APUs. We added VIZIO as a new customer based on the industry-leading graphics performance and long battery life of AMD's APUs. VIZIO's first AMD-based products will include 2 touch-based Ultrathins and a Windows 8 tablet. 
Now turning to our server business. We recorded significant revenue growth for our SeaMicro dense servers, driven by large-scale cloud data center wins. SeaMicro solutions are being deployed and evaluated by a broad variety of marquee customers, demonstrating the value of our investment in dense server and setting the stage for continued future growth. 
Our graphics business performed well in the quarter as well, highlighted by record workstation and gaming revenue and the launch of the Nintendo Wii U game system powered by AMD graphics technology. To help accelerate desktop GPU sales in the channel and reinforce our long-term strategy to be a leader in gaming, we launched the ""Never Settle"" campaign in the quarter. This promotion was well received by partners and consumers as we bundled some of the season's hottest games with our highest performing graphics cards. 
In the channel, unit shipments and revenue for our high-end Radeon graphics grew, driving a richer mix and increased ASP from the previous quarter. We will launch a follow-on promotion this quarter, pairing our highest-performing graphics cards with some of the most anticipated game titles of 2013. 
Now I want to return to the trends impacting AMD and the industry overall and the steps we are taking to restructure, accelerate and ultimately transform our business. We are well on our way toward implementing a new operating model that will allow us to achieve lower operating expense and enable a return to profitability. 
In addition, the new products that will accelerate our business in 2013 have passed several key milestones in the quarter, as we began shipping Richland and secured solid design wins for the Brazos follow-on Kabini, and our new ultra-low-power Temash APU. Both Kabini and Temash are currently going through final internal validation in parallel with customer evaluations in anticipation of launches that are planned for the first half of this year. 
AMD's first mobile GPUs based on our Graphics Core Next architecture also began shipping in the fourth quarter. ASUS, Lenovo and Samsung have already announced plans to offer these low-power GPUs, and we are seeing strong design win momentum for these GPUs because they deliver discrete-level graphics performance while stretching battery life in both traditional and Ultrathin notebooks. 
Our longer-term transformation to drive growth in adjacent high-growth markets continues to gain momentum. In the server space, we'll combine our extensive 64-bit design experience x86 processor IP and ARM processor cores with our SeaMicro Freedom Fabric to continue to drive leadership as the industry transitions to dense servers. We believe we already have significantly more dense server customer installations than any other competitor, making our SeaMicro technology the most tried dense server solution available in the industry. 
Now in ultra-low-power clients, we bolstered our SoC design capabilities with new engineering talent, simplified our development processes to improve our execution speed and quality. Our Kabini and Temash SoCs for notebooks, tablets and convertibles are exceeding our expectation. More importantly, the strong value proposition and differentiated features of these products are exceeding customer expectations as well. Kabini will be the first industry quad-core x86 SoC, and Temash is expected to be the highest-performing tablet SoC available in the market, more than doubling the graphics performance of our current generation tablet offering. 
Finally, we have strong design wins for our embedded and semi-custom APUs. Initial products based on these APUs are expected to launch later this year, driving our embedded semi-custom business to more than 20% of our revenue mix by the fourth quarter.
So in summary, we have made good progress in the fourth quarter with our turnaround. We delivered on our financial and customer commitment, effectively managed cash, reduced inventory and lowered operating expense in the face of a difficult market. We will complete the majority of our restructuring actions this quarter, with the goal of reducing our overall cost structure by 25% from early 2012 levels by the third quarter of 2013. 
We are introducing strong new APU and graphics offerings in the first half of 2013 that will accelerate our AMD business, with the ultimate goal of returning AMD to profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of this year. We are also making good progress on the multiyear transformation of AMD that will allow us to deliver 40% to 50% of our future revenues from high-growth markets where our IP is a differentiator. 
Our embedded semi-custom APU business remains on track to contribute approximately 20% of our overall revenue by the end of this year. And our SeaMicro dense cloud server business continues to gain momentum. 
We remain focused on the steps we must take over the next several quarters to turn AMD around and deliver consistent profitability and growth. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our newly-appointed CFO, Devinder Kumar. Devinder?",1205,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2013",2013-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3995.0,404098.0,19064584.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. 2012 was a challenging year in which we made strategic investments and began to take the actions necessary as part of our corporate and financial reset to position the company for future success in a changing computing landscape. 
In the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced restructuring actions and operational efficiencies designed to reduce our expense structure and help return AMD to future profitability and free cash flow generation. The restructuring plan includes a reduction of AMD's global workforce in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 by approximately 14% and will result in operational savings of approximately $190 million in 2013. 
By the third quarter of 2013, we expect to reduce operating expenses to $450 million per quarter, down 25% from the first quarter of 2012. As we ended 2012, we also successfully amended our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to better align our wafer purchase commitments with current PC market dynamics, strengthen our balance sheet and help us achieve our operating goals. 
Though the macroeconomic issues impacted consumer PC spend in the second half of 2012 as the challenges we faced in the second quarter continued through the end of the year, we faced a difficult selling environment, which negatively impacted our overall 2012 financial performance. Let me provide some details on the full year 2012 financial results. 
Revenue for the year was $5.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.2 billion, lower than what we guided due to the restructuring actions and alignment of expenditures with business expectations. We achieved non-GAAP operating income of $45 million. We managed capital expenditures down to $133 million in 2012, below guidance of approximately $200 million. Tax benefit was $34 million, better than guided due to a one-time benefit of $36 million related to the SeaMicro acquisition. 
Cash balance as of the end of the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, above the optimal zone of approximately $1.1 billion and well above the target minimum of $700 million needed operationally.
Let's turn to the fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $1.16 billion, down 9% sequentially, driven by a revenue decline in Computing Solutions segment of 11% and a decline of 5% in the graphics products segment. Revenue declined due to lower volumes across both segments. 
To derive non-GAAP gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures, among other items, we excluded the impact of the lower of cost market charge related to the GLOBALFOUNDRIES' take-or-pay obligation of $273 million, discussed in more detail in my CFO written commentary which has been posted online. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 39%, up 8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2012 was 31%, and this was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of approximately $100 million or 8 percentage points. Fourth quarter 2012 gross margin also benefited from sales of higher-priced second-generation desktop APUs.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $506 million, lower than guidance primarily due to tight spending controls in the quarter. R&D expenses were $313 million, 27% of net revenue. SG&A expenses were $193 million, 17% of net revenue. Non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million, and non-GAAP net loss was $102 million. 
Interest expense was $45 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. Tax provision for the quarter was $4 million compared to 0 in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP loss per share was $0.14, calculated using 747 million basic shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, better by $65 million from the prior quarter's negative $35 million, excluding the LCM charge of $273 million.
Now switching to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $829 million, down 11% sequentially. Client Product revenue declined 13% sequentially, primarily driven by lower microprocessor unit shipments. Server business revenue increased sequentially, driven by an increase in unit shipments of compute systems focused on dense servers, and chipset revenue declined in line with microprocessor unit shipments. 
Computing Solutions operating loss was $323 million, an increase of $209 million sequentially, primarily due to the $273 million LCM charge. Graphics segment revenue was $326 million, down 5% sequentially, primarily due to an 8% sequential decline in GPU revenue, partially offset by record game console revenue and record workstation graphics sales.
Graphics segment operating income was $22 million, up $4 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to the higher game console revenue. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long-term marketable securities at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, down $297 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2012. The decrease is primarily due to operating cash flow of $286 million, which included a few specific cash payments as follows: payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES of $130 million, comprising of $50 million for the limited waiver of exclusivity; an $80 million termination fee related to the take-or-pay agreement; and cash payments of $46 million related to restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
We exited the quarter above our target optimal cash level and well above the target minimum cash level of approximately $700 million. Debt as of the end of the quarter was unchanged at $2.04 billion. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $630 million, down $53 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower revenue. 
Inventory was $562 million exiting the quarter, down $182 million or 25% from the prior quarter due to a decline in MPU inventory, primarily as a result of the amendment of the Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 
Now turning to the outlook. For the first quarter of 2013, AMD expects revenue to decrease 9% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be flat sequentially. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $495 million, and we expect inventory to increase sequentially ahead of new product introductions and technology transitions.
For 2013, we expect operating expenses to be at $450 million by the third quarter of this year; capital expenditures of approximately $150 million for the year; taxes of approximately $4 million per quarter. We plan to be free cash flow positive by the second half of 2013, and we expect to maintain cash balances in the optimal zone of $1.1 billion for the year and well above the target minimum of $700 million. 
Overall, we have taken significant steps to align our business with today's PC environment and position the company to capitalize on new opportunities in adjacent high-growth markets in 2013 and beyond. We expect our restructuring actions and our corporate reset to position us to return to profitability and free cash flow generation in the second half of 2013.

And my other question is over the last several quarters, as you've been -- since you've been at the company and you've been forming your long-term strategic goals, has your thinking changed on how AMD should be transformed?

It's interesting, David. Over the past 16 months of being here at AMD, it's clear that this company has a deep base of intellectual property. It has a huge asset pool in terms of the talented engineers and dedicated AMD-ers across the planet. And this is an unprecedented period of change in the industry. Our strategies remain basically fundamentally consistent throughout this. The only thing that's really changed is the time period that we need to execute that change and accelerate into that. First, it's a 3-phased turnaround: one, reset and restructure the company. And I think here in fourth quarter, you see us making that kind of progress where we're delivering on that commitment. We're executing and managing our expense, we're managing our cash properly, and we've improved our inventory position significantly. With that, we're on a drive to get to $450 million by 3Q. Then we need to execute and accelerate in 2013. That's where we hit the top of the curve of this restructure and reset phase and begin to move into the launch of these powerful new products that we have in place. At CES, Lisa and I spent a lot of time with customers, and they were excited about Richland, which has now launched. And they were excited about Kabini and Temash: Kabini, the follow-on to our most successful Brazos platform, and then Temash into the low-power segment. These are very interesting products, and we're going to continue our industry leadership into the graphics segment. And then dense server had its best quarter ever and showing the foundation for future growth. But ultimately, where we have to take this company is we need to transform AMD to take advantage of where the market is going, the high-growth segments, those areas where we can apply our innovation to lead. That's where we have to take the third part of our step, and we're making those investments now. In dense server, we're already seeing the early progress with SeaMicro that I mentioned and then moving into embedded, semi-custom. This year, we'll be 20%. But our ultimate objective within the next 3 years is to move to 40% to 50% of our revenue in those segments. And then obviously, the opportunity for us to build on our long heritage in the client segment around low-form -- new form factors in the low-power segment. These are areas where AMD can create leadership, diversify its portfolio, build on its long history of success and its differentiated IP for leadership. Dave, I think that's the 1, 2, 3-step approach that we need to take.",434,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Let me just take a moment to explain that. We have previously said a $165 million one-time charge and $110 million of our termination fee related to the WSA will be spread over Q4 and Q1. As we completed the analysis from an inventory standpoint, it was more appropriate to record almost the whole charge in Q4, and we went ahead and did that, and that is $273 million. At this point in time, even with the restructuring charge that has been taken in Q4, we do not anticipate anything significant happening in the 2013 time frame.

What we're trying to do in this segment is again to create the leadership that we've done in the past with Brazos, and then to apply that same kind of knowledge into Temash, which brings us down into the fanlist tablet segment. Now from a talent standpoint, what we've really focused on is a mix of industry knowledge across the semiconductor space. And you've seen us bring in interesting players across the past 12, 15 months. Players that are from the who's who of the industry, they know the semi-custom space, they know microprocessor design, they know semi-custom and, of course, embedded. These talents also, you can see with Keller's and that -- Mark Papermaster's and obviously, Lisa Su, the experience to deliver that in industry-leading microprocessor design. And that's why I think you're seeing some of that progress around Kabini. Lisa, you want to add a thought or 2?",258,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We're very excited about our Temash tablet because it really is satisfying a new space in terms of performance tablets, that's separate from what today's consumption and sort of the higher-power tablets that are out there. I think it is an opportunity for us to lead. I think from a mobile standpoint, this is where we think there's a sweet spot for a full Windows 8-capable tablets and extending from down to quad core to a very low power point. So as we build out this part of the roadmap, it's about system-on-chip designs, getting much more flexible in how we reuse IP and getting products out to market at the right time.

We've tried to focus those areas where we thought there was efficiency and productivity to be gained. For example, there's opportunities for us to dramatically reduce the number of different process technologies we're running in our various foundries. That drives all the IP to be written to multiple libraries. We very much focused in terms of efficiency to drive the number of metal layers, the way we reuse our IP, the IP development process that Mark Papermaster and Lisa Su have implemented through our technology board. We are seeing efficiencies and productivities through that. At the same time, we're driving to improve our focus in terms of the types of design wins we go after. We don't -- it's really not the best business practice to go after just a gigantic number of design wins. We want those high runners, those design wins that drive volume. Every design win drives cost, drives back-end execution, testing resources. When we drive to hundreds of design wins, some of those are 25,000, 50,000 units. Those are not efficient. We've been focusing with Lisa's business unit teams and John Byrne's sales team to really identify those design wins that get the volume and get to the most efficient usage. That's how we're driving that kind of focus in terms of efficiency and productivity, and those are just a few. We've implemented the financial transformation system on the back end. John Docherty on the supply chain has an intense focus across each of his processes to drive that efficiency, to improve our execution. And what's interesting, while we had some scheduled challenges in the middle of summer last year, the second half of the year, the progress that the business unit teams and the technology teams have made on our 2013 roadmap part has been very consistent and on schedule. So I think we're making the right moves to push for that efficiency, look for the reuse of IP, create an ambidextrous architecture that's reusable and to drive efficiencies across the portfolio. And in fact, we announced the new Senior Vice President, Chekib Akrout, who is driving that transformation and efficiency focus across our entire business as a full-time job.",387,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If you look at our OpEx in Q1 2012, that's closer to $600 million. And in Q4, we've ended closer to the $500 million level. So we've already taken out approximately about $100 million of expenses. And the restructuring actions that we took from headcount and some facilities actions that we are putting in place happened very late in Q4 and obviously, we have some going on in Q1 2013. So those benefits obviously, as you know, lagged the actions.

So in the last quarter, desktop was stronger. I was wondering, first of all, if you could clarify whether that was purely a mix shift within desktop, say, on lower volume shipments or if you actually saw an increase in units sequentially in the fourth quarter in addition to, it sounds like an ASP rise? So that's sort of number one. And then number two, what are you thinking about for mix for 2013? Do you see more lower end and -- PCs and tablets?

Maybe let me take some of the comments on sort of the mix on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. So in the fourth quarter, I think we took a very balanced approach to managing the margins. I think we saw some positives and some negatives in the desktop business. We did see an increase in desktop ASP primarily because we introduced our higher-end Athlon FX series, as well as the new A-series Trinity APUs into the channel, and that drove ASPs up a little bit on the desktop side. There were some competitive pressures on the notebook side. So all in all, a very balanced approach to the margins. I think as we go forward for 2013 mix, we're not talking about full year gross margins. Devinder mentioned our guidance into Q1. When you look at the mix there, we would expect that as we get into the second half of the year, we will have the higher end of the A-series, the A8s and A10s.

Then a quick follow-up. How much are you, I guess -- well, let me back up. The changes that you have been talking about, you and Rory and Mark, on simplifying the manufacturing process, reducing the number of wafer processing steps, for example, adopting a more standard process presumably is expected to do 2 things: one, lower unit cost; and two, speed your time to market.

That's one piece of it, as I kind of highlighted, JoAnne. The idea across the development process, the way we interlock now, the focus that we have. In the past, custom, hugely long complex designs were the way the PC market moved. In the future, it's going to be quicker, low-power, more efficient design. What also you get from this approach, obviously you'll get time to market, you get lower cost. You also get better yield, which is also important in terms of really managing the business. So it has benefits across the board. And speed of execution as we move forward in a model where you're going to see a consortium-based model. And the proprietary control points of -- as some of x86 break down, these kinds of models are going to be key. So we're going to stay the course on that. That's helping us on the $450 million.

I will say that in the fourth quarter, we started shipments of AMD-based SeaMicro systems, as well as Intel-based. And they've gotten a good reaction. I think as we go forward, we are committed to both ARM and x86 in the appropriate markets. And clearly, we've stated that we will be doing ARM-based server chips, and that will be in the 2014 time frame.

Remember, if you go back to 1Q last year, there was a lot of concern about the flood that affected Thailand and the hard disk file, and it was quite surprising as we kind of suggested that supply chain would be quite resilient. The numbers were quite strong out of 1Q. We think there'll be continued chop and pressure in that first half of 2013. And this market's a bit dynamic right now. We do think Win 8 is a very important event in the industry. I think that impact or effect will build over the course of the year. We expect the second half to be stronger than the first half from my perspective. And if I looked at the overall year, weaker in the first half, stronger in the second half, probably net to flat to slightly down. That's our view of it in terms of where we're expecting the market and how we're planning to balance that in terms of the gross margin and in terms of the revenue line, and that's how we came to the conclusion.",207,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

And you could see it with the introduction of our relationship with VIZIO just here at CES and that introduction of those 2 Ultrathins and obviously in the tablet space. You're going to see us continuing to work across OEMs in the embedded space, new partners and across the ODM segment to get that expansion and begin to build that market. But again, our focus is to build that over a 2- to 3-year period to drive that to 40% to 50% of our revenue across of those high-growth segments.

I think we're making steady progress in 3Q, 4Q and as we move forward there. I think that inventory and our finished goods position, Devinder touched on it with our WSA work and the focus, we, at the end of 2Q and even into 3Q, were seeing pressure in terms of potentially building more inventory. And while we did have to take a charge in 3Q to address some of that, I think we've done a strong job in terms of focusing on that inventory. That positions us for the new product introductions that we talked about at CES: Richland, Kabini, and Temash. And I think that's what positions us to move forward and begin to build this turn and acceleration in 2013, with the objective to get to profitability in the second half and positive free cash flow at that time frame again.

So the graphics business is very strategic to our overall strategy. I will say that we have lost some share over the last couple of quarters. I do believe we're at the low point in our graphics share based on what we can see in terms of new design activity. We have a very strong channel approach with our ""Never Settle"" Bundle that we talked about last quarter, and we will be building upon that this quarter. And we also launched our new HD 8000 series at CES, that's now shipping in a number of mobile OEMs. So I think the share is indicative of decisions that were made 12 months ago.

The graphics team here that we have is leadership. The kind of IP, the kind of engineering skill, the ability for them to innovate and drive, you -- I don't know if you had a chance to walk through, Steven, the CES work that we showed there. This team -- yes, and I thought you saw some really interesting application of how you could create a sound -- a surround compute environment, leveraging the graphics capability. And imagine that kind of solution moving forward. Say they're building a brand-new building, and that building's not even built. You could create, with our technology, a sales room that created the windows and the graphics representations. So what's this building on the 22nd floor look like at night? And all of a sudden, the graphic engines fire up the windows. You can see that world, and you could apply that kind of surround compute that we see emerging, this new trend of convergence that the cloud is fundamentally driving, and it's our graphics IP that's going to be a fundamental enabler of that future. That's the world we're chasing. We're not going after the past. That stand-alone data and application on a singular device protected by a couple of proprietary control points, that era is ending. The era in front of us is an interconnected world where there's almost a tsunami of new devices that begin to emerge, and they're all graphically linked because the data and information, the applications are running on cloud dense servers and these mega data centers. And they're distributing information across a whole set of client devices. They're efficient, they're low power, they're across embedded devices.

168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3572.0,444043.0,20771748.0,Presenter Speech,Rory Read,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth. First quarter revenue was $1.09 billion, slightly better than our guidance. We managed operating expenses in line with guidance and maintained cash balances above our optimal levels. 
We continue to make good progress on our 3-step turnaround: step one, restructure to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency; two, execute our 2013 product road map to accelerate our business and return to profitability; and three, ultimately transform AMD to take advantage of high-growth opportunities in adjacent markets where AMD's IP provides a competitive advantage. 
At this point, we have largely completed our restructuring activity, and we will now focus on the second step of our transformation, executing our 2013 product road map and returning to profitability and positive free cash flow in the second half of 2013. Our strategy to gain share in the traditional PC space is based on winning the most important designs across each customer by region, price point and form factor. This year, we will have the broadest range of mobile processors in our history, spanning from sub-4 watts to 35 watts. We have introduced our newest A-Series Richland APU for the mainstream client market and have secured innovative and premium design wins. In AMD's sweet spot, we have started volume shipments of Kabini in the first quarter and have a strong portfolio of high-volume, entry-level design wins based on its substantial performance and battery life improvements. As part of our strategy to win new client form factors, we are ramping production of Temash in support of the ultra low-power and fanless designs. Temash beats the competition and is ideal for tablets, hybrids and convertibles. 
We have a strong portfolio of customer offerings coming to market, and we expect this will spur demand in the back half of 2013 and provide us with an opportunity to grow share. Many of the new design wins are touch-enabled and will bring the full Windows 8 experience more broadly to mainstream and entry price points. Our server business revenue increased sequentially, as our high-performance Opteron 6300 Series continued to ramp. 
Now turning to our graphics business. In the first quarter, we saw a strong revenue growth for our desktop GPUs in the channel and record workstation revenue. We also have a strong pipeline of design wins in the notebook discrete market, which we believe will drive mobile share growth in the second half of 2013. Our graphics business momentum is a result of our strategic decision to double down on being the gaming industry leader. As a result, desktop GPU channel sales are accelerating. We believe we've regained share based on our industry-leading GPUs and the ""Never Settle: Reloaded"" campaign, which bundles our graphics cards with many of the industry's biggest games. The program also cements tighter connections with AMD and the leading game developers. We are leveraging our position in PC and in discrete markets, combined with our recent game console wins, as we drive to make AMD silicon the de facto standard for game developers across the globe. Graphics IP remains critical to our success, increasingly providing differentiation across our entire product portfolio. And we remain committed to further investing in this business to extend our leadership IP. 
The PC market will remain an important business for AMD for years to come. With more than 300 million PCs expected to ship annually for the foreseeable future across a variety of form factors, the PC is far from dead. Our industry-leading APUs and GPUs provide the opportunity to deliver share gains in this traditional AMD market. As the PC era rapidly evolves into the new cloud era, we continue to march into high-growth markets like dense server, ultra low-power client, embedded and semi-custom solutions as we transform our business to capitalize on emerging trends reshaping the industry. Our design approach to leverage reusable IP blocks allows us to use the same foundational technology from our PC and server offerings to quickly attack these new opportunities. As a result, we remain on track to deliver more than 20% of our revenue from semi-custom and embedded markets by the fourth quarter and 40% to 50% of our revenue from these and other high-growth markets in the next 2 to 3 years. 
A large part of the momentum this year will come from our game console wins. The game console industry is expected to ship more than 40 million game consoles in 2013. That number is expected to grow, as game consoles further evolve into broader entertainment devices that serve as home media hubs and local cloud distribution systems. Sony's PlayStation 3 is already one of the most popular platforms for streaming online video. And Microsoft announced last year that the Xbox 360 is now used more for watching videos and listening to music than it is for playing games. Our graphics win in the Nintendo Wii U set the foundation for this growth, which we have built upon with Sony's announcement that the PlayStation 4 will feature a semi-custom AMD APU. The PS4 integrates a combination of x86 processors and advanced graphic IP, which is unique to AMD. This single-chip APU features our low-power Jaguar cores and next-generation AMD Radeon graphics. We are excited about our semi-custom pipeline and the large opportunity for AMD to deliver semi-custom silicon, with ASPs at the higher range of our client offerings. 
In the embedded market, we'll introduce the industry's first quad-core x86 SoC this quarter. Our low-power, single-chip embedded SoC delivers more than 2x the compute and 4x the graphics performance of our competitors' offerings. We are well-positioned in the embedded x86 market, which is projected to grow to more than $7 billion by 2016. 
So in summary, we continue to make good progress in our 3-step strategy designed to restructure, accelerate and transform AMD while returning the company to operating profitability by the second half of 2013. We have started shipping a powerful set of new products that provide strong opportunities for share growth in the traditional PC market. And our semi-custom and embedded design wins continue to accelerate as we transform AMD for the new cloud era and attack these high-growth markets with our differentiated IP. We look forward to continued strong execution in 2013 as we enable our customers to innovate across a diversified set of markets based on our differentiated and tailored technology solutions.

168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2013",2013-04-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3572.0,444043.0,20771749.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. As Rory mentioned, AMD continues to execute on our 3-phase turnaround and transform our business model to changing PC market fundamentals by diversifying our product portfolio. Phase 1, reset and restructure, is largely completed, with most of our restructuring behind us. We are also on track to lower our expense base by approximately 25% by the third quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 and have already reduced operating expenses from $592 million in Q1 of 2012 to $491 million in Q1 2013. 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2013 was $1.09 billion. The 6% sequential decline was driven by a 9% decrease in the Computing Solutions segment, which was partially offset by a 3% increase in Graphics segment revenue. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 41%, an increase of 2 percentage points sequentially and better than guided due to a $20 million benefit from an opportunistic emerging market sale of certain previously reserved Llano products. Excluding this benefit, gross margin would have been flat sequentially at 39%.  
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $491 million, in line with guidance, as we continue to push towards our operating expense goal of $450 million by the third quarter of this year. 
Non-GAAP operating loss was $46 million, and non-GAAP net loss was $94 million. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.13, calculated using 749 million basic shares. This loss per share includes a $20 million benefit from sales of previously reserved products. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $40 million, an increase of $10 million from the prior quarter due to the lower operating loss. 
Now switching to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $751 million, down 9% sequentially due to lower desktop, notebook and chipset unit shipments, primarily driven by seasonality and a weak consumer-buying environment. Client product revenue declined 9%. Our server microprocessor revenue increased from the prior quarter, mainly due to higher ASPs for our higher density microprocessors. Chipset revenue declined sequentially, primarily due to lower unit shipments. Computing Solutions operating loss was $39 million, an improvement from an operating loss of $323 million in the previous quarter. The prior quarter loss included the impact of an LCM charge of $273 million related to the reduction of wafer purchases required in the 2012 Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 
Graphics segment revenue was $337 million, up 3% compared to the prior quarter, due to higher channel sales, game console royalty sales and workstation graphic sales. Workstation graphics had a record quarter, and we continue to make progress in that business. Game console royalty revenue was up sequentially, driven primarily by a large milestone payment in the quarter. Graphics segment operating income was $16 million, down from $22 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower GPU sales to OEMs. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long-term marketable securities, at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion, flat compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2012. We exited the quarter above our target optimal cash level of $1.1 billion and well above the target minimum cash level of $700 million. 
We made a $175 million payment related to limited exclusivity to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the first quarter, completing all of the payments related to the limited exclusivity. In addition, we bolstered cash with net proceeds of $164 million from the sale and leaseback of our ""Lone Star Campus"" in Austin, Texas. In the second quarter of 2013, we will make a $40 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES related to the reduction in wafer purchase commitments for 2012. The remaining $200 million balance related to this item will be paid in the first quarter of 2014. 
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.04 billion, unchanged from the prior quarter. Inventory was $613 million, up $51 million sequentially, as we prepared for new product introductions. 
Now turning to the outlook. For the second quarter of 2013, AMD expects revenue to increase 2% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 39%. Quarterly operating expenses are expected to be approximately $480 million. And inventory is expected to continue to increase sequentially ahead of new product introductions and approach more normalized levels of $650 million to $700 million. 
The first quarter was a good start to the year in terms of executing to our commitments. The improvements we are making to our cost structure and liquidity management serve as a strong foundation upon which we can build throughout this year as we refresh our product line, accelerate our execution and return to operating profitability and positive free cash flow generation in the second half of this year.

As Rory and I said in the prepared remarks, the reset restructure is largely done. But as you probably know, there's a time lag in realizing the full benefits of restructuring. For example, some of the headcount departures are staggered. We have ongoing savings from building-related expenses that can only be realized after the employees leave and we continue to consolidate at various sites to a smaller footprint in terms of space. And those saving get realized as we get on in time and, in particular, starting in Q3 2013. The other thing I would add is, as you probably heard from Rory's remarks, a lot of new product introductions occurred in the first half of 2013. And, therefore, with those products, there's always some costs that are associated with new product introductions that we think will go down as we get to the second half of 2013. So, really, it's a time lag in terms of realizing the full benefits of restructuring but also, as we transform the company and accelerate into the second half of 2013, some of the reduced expenses related to the new product introductions.",194,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Kabini in that sweet spot of the market, I think, where you've seen us do well with Brazos in the past. I also think you're going to see the market begin to shift in that direction. There's no doubt ASP buying patterns will continue to move into entry and into mainstream pricing. So I'm excited about the Kabini offering. Then Temash, what I like about Temash is it's really a very credible solution in that convertible fanless space. This is an area where we need to make progress. And I believe with this chip, which clearly beats competition both on compute and graphics performance, positions us well.

I mean, you got the different pieces from a viewpoint of -- as we talk about unit shipments and mix of revenue. But there are a lot of factors that come into play from gross margin, as you probably know. From a business standpoint, at least in our back-end factories, we still have assembly, test, mark and pack factories, where utilization coming out of the Q4, Q1 time frame and the revenue that we have obviously affects our COGS piece of it. And that's one factor that's kind of a headwind from a gross margin standpoint. Product mix, we have introduced new products, Kabini shipping in Q1 and Temash shipping in Q2. And, obviously, that will be a positive from a viewpoint of going with a gross margin. So you're right, we see ourselves having operated over the last few quarters in a stable gross margin situation, despite the fact that the PC market has been very dynamic.

So you've been operating in a stable gross margin environment, but that stable gross margins are quite a bit lower than where you were running previously. Again, you've got Temash and some other things launching, which should be gross margin-accretive, but then again, you're guiding flat for next quarter. And I guess the reason I'm asking is, I think one of the big drivers for keeping cash balances in line has to be your gross margin trajectory in the back half. So I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color -- if not to go directly in the guidance, but at least, what are some of the things we should be thinking about into the back half of the year that can give us confidence that the gross margin trajectory can be enough to keep the cash balances up at the level where you think they can be?",163,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

We think second half is better than first half, as we said. It's probably down low to mid single digits overall for the year. But if you look at our business and you say, ""This is a very interesting set of products that we've introduced from Temash, Kabini, Richland, the graphics products,"" I think we're in a very good position to generate and spur demand in that second half. We're looking to build on those strong products to add share. And from our standpoint, we want to return to profitable growth in that second half. Then you mix in the new businesses as we start to create this diversified portfolio and the combined mix as we manage expense is a good model for us to create profitability and sustain profitability over time. So I think the net is, PC market should be better in the second half, from our perspective, than the first half. We have a stronger set of products in the second half. That should allow us to go after share opportunity. And then from the standpoint of graphics, same position, strong products moving into it, and then bringing in some very interesting new products, like the PS4. This should open up a nice opportunity for us to move back to profitable growth in the second half.",251,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Let me try to give you some color there. So the game console is a very, very exciting market. Its life cycle usually lasts 5 to 7 years, and it's an opportunity to both take leading-edge hardware out there, as well as continue to enhance the software. So I do view it as an opportunity of growth over the medium term, and certainly, as we ramp new console generations, that's a direct opportunity for growth.

Now, we go after the console. And with the work that we've done in Nintendo Wii U and now with the Sony PS4, these game developers spend a lot of money as they move to the next generation. And with the consolidation of the game console wins that we've announced, you can see that this would allow them to develop in a more effective way, a more cost effective way, and you'll see us leverage our technology across that base from a strategic standpoint. It lowers the partners' time to market, it lowers their cost to development, so it speeds that. And additionally, as they tune now to our development technology, which they're going to be able to do, it's going to perform better on our hardware and software, both from a PC, from the discrete graphics and then from a game console base. I think that sets a very nice foundation to continue to build that. And then, Glen, you saw us double down in the space where we focus to really go after those game developers with the ""Never Settle: Reloaded"" campaign, where we went after those biggest and most important games in the industry and showed that partnership again. I think this is all part of a longer-term game plan to really create a differentiated experience that creates a solution for the partners, for our customers, and ultimately, the better experience for the customer.",277,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

I think it's fair to say that the PC market is still choppy given some of the market data that came out recently. From our perspective though, what we do see is that the OEMs are being fairly aggressive in their adoption of new form factors, I would say more so than last year in terms of the realization of where the growth has to come in terms of innovation. So much more on Ultrathins, much more in lower price points as we get to 599 and below. You'll see 299, 399 price points. And that is traditionally AMD's sweet spot. That's where we've designed these products. So that gives us the opportunity to hopefully gain share in the second half of the year.

I know it's gotten a lot of press recently, but this -- there -- it is clearly going to continue to build momentum. The uptake will improve as more of the form factors, touch, the experience becomes better known, you're going to see that activity. And based on what we're seeing from our partners, we're seeing in terms of the global design activity that we mentioned in the earlier remarks around the PC space, there's a lot of interest in the low-power parts of Temash and Kabini, and then some of the premium form factor wins that we got with Richland. So I think the foundation is definitely there. Win 8 will be better understood, it will be -- in terms of its adoption and its uptake, I think that second half is generally always stronger than the first half, and that I do think that we're seeing the design activity. And it's important, Glen, from the standpoint we specifically targeted with our products to understand the price points, the form factors, by region, by partner, so that we could go after those most effective and higher volume design wins that would yield the proper return and help us lower our overall expense.",227,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The pipeline build has been very positive in embedded. The new product introductions like that product, which is 2x competition on performance and 4x on graphic, that I think has really put us in a position where we can build on that.

And we're focused on being that partner with these customers to create the long-term solutions to help them win. I mentioned the cloud environment, the cloud era. This is a shift from this kind of proprietary, controlled commercial environment where PCs were controlled by a couple of proprietary architecture and rule holders. And they gathered all the profit in a single set of pools. What I think is the cloud era begins to break that as data and application move to the cloud, we're going to see an explosion, a tsunami of devices that are going to emerge. And our customers are looking for silicon solutions that are differentiated, that allows them to create not just a commercial solution, but a really specific, differentiated solution that they can win in the market.

I think if you do the math, you can probably come up with the numbers. But from our standpoint, as I've said previously, we have levers available. If you look at Q1 2013, I talked about the payment of GLOBALFOUNDRIES to the tune of $175 million paid. We did a sale-leaseback transaction to almost entirely offset that, and actually, a little bit more and maintained cash flood from last quarter.

I think it's fair to say that we have to be very diligent in executing our product portfolio. Our value proposition isn't necessarily based on technology nodes and CPU performance. It's really on user experience and how we turn our graphics and digitalization advantages into something that could improve the end-user experience. So this year, we have, as you stated, the Richland, Kabini and Temash launches, all very successful in executing in the first half of the year. We've also talked about our Kaveri APU in the second half of the year. We're on track for that, and that gives us an opportunity to bring in our Heterogeneous Systems Architecture, which really brings the microprocessors and the graphics capability together. So we're going to continue to push that. We believe that APUs are the future and that is where we can really get the performance.

168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2013",2013-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3543.0,485354.0,22409760.0,Presenter Speech,Rory Read,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth. We are making progress on our 3-step strategy to restructure, accelerate and ultimately transform AMD for growth. This progress allowed us to deliver improved results in the second quarter. 
Revenue of $1.16 billion was higher than our guidance, as strong demand helped drive sequential unit shipment increases and market share gains across both of our business segments.
With our restructuring complete, our focus in the second half of the year is on continuing to accelerate our business. We expect to return to profitability in the third quarter, based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance.
Our traditional PC business is heading into the typically stronger second half of the year, with a competitive portfolio of new products and strong mobile design wins, particularly for systems in the $300 to $600 sweet spot of the market. Many of these systems will be the first to bring touch capabilities down into the mainstream price points, where AMD has traditionally been the most successful.
We remain on track to deliver more than 20% of our revenue from our Semi-Custom and Embedded Businesses in the fourth quarter, with growth in the second half of the year primarily coming from our semi-custom SoC products for both the Sony and Microsoft next-generation game consoles.
These tailored products are great examples of the opportunities we have to quickly diversify our product portfolio and enter into new markets where our IP and design capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage.
Looking more closely at our progress in the PC market, our strategy to gain share by introducing a new set of APUs and winning high-volume notebook designs across key customers by region, price point and form factor helped drive strong double-digit sequential increases in mobile processor unit shipments.
With our mobility APU launches last quarter, we now offer the broadest range of mobile processors in our AMD history. Our new Elite Mobility APUs scaled down below 4 watts, while more than doubling the performance per watt, compared to our previous generation.
We are seeing strong adoption of these new APUs. This is particularly true of our high-volume Kabini, which is powering a number of thin and light touch notebooks that will hit the $400 price point. Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung have begun to roll out products based on our latest APUs, and we expect many more systems to launch in the second half of the year.
We also continue to make progress rebalancing and strengthening our channel business. The introduction of a Richland APU helped drive a sequential increase in desktop processor channel revenue. We expect to continue to build on this improving channel trend in the second half.
Turning to our server business. A number of large data center wins in the quarter drove sequential revenue and unit shipment increases. Additionally, we continue to gain momentum in the emerging dense server market as customers are choosing AMD SeaMicro offering for their data centers, based on the industry-leading energy efficiency, density and bandwidth of our solutions. We intend to further attack the fast-growing portions of the server market in 2014 by introducing our next-generation x86 APUs and CPUs, as well as our first ARM-based server product.
Our years of enterprise design experience and the ability to integrate our industry-leading dense server fabric into the processor provides us with a differentiated product for this new and exciting market.
Now turning to our Graphics and Visual Solutions business. Our strategy to make AMD the de facto standard for game developers continues to gain momentum as we launched the industry's fastest desktop and mobile graphics chips and cemented our position as the technology provider of choice for all 3 next-generation game consoles.
In the high-end enthusiast portion of the desktop's GPU market, the combination of our powerful graphics products and the ""Never Settle"" game bundle program drove significant share gains and a richer mix in the channel from the previous quarter.
Our Professional Graphics business also recorded its fourth straight quarter of growth, delivering record revenue as we continue to aggressively pursue this lucrative market.
Looking at the second half of the year, we believe we have good opportunities for growth, based on the PC market strengthening slightly from the first half levels and the ramp of our Semi-Custom business. Longer term, the 300 million-plus unit traditional PC market remains an important part of our core business, especially as the mainstream $300 to $600 system price points, that have been -- traditionally been our sweet spot, become an even larger portion of the overall PC market.
We will continue transforming AMD, leveraging our design expertise and IP to pursue additional growth opportunities for our semi-custom, ultra low-power client, professional graphics, dense server and embedded solutions. We expect these high-growth businesses will account for 40% to 50% of our revenue in the next 2 to 3 years.
In summary, we are pleased with the progress we are making to restructure, accelerate and ultimately transform AMD, as strong demand for our latest products drove improved financial and operational results in the second quarter.
We expect to deliver significant revenue growth in the second half of the year, as our strong new products position us to gain share in our traditional businesses, and our first semi-custom SoC win allows us to participate in new markets.
We are on track to reach our operating expense target of approximately $450 million, and we expect to return to profitability in the third quarter, based on the midpoint of our guidance. We are excited about the near-term opportunities to demonstrate our efficient business model, disciplined operational focus and diversified product strategy that will deliver consistent profitability and growth.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Devinder. Devinder?",957,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2013",2013-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3543.0,485354.0,22409761.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. Phase 1 of our 3-phase turnaround and transformation strategy is largely behind us. We are now pursuing a diversification of our product and revenue portfolio, with a focus on high-growth market opportunities. As Rory mentioned, our performance in the second quarter was driven by both traditional PC and new growth opportunities, which support our business model transformation in an evolving PC market.
We are on target to generate 20% of our revenue outside of the traditional PC space, to Semi-Custom and Embedded products by Q4 2013. The last phase of transformation over the next 2 to 3 years is expected to see us transition 40% to 50% of our revenue base to higher-growth markets, which include Semi-Custom, dense server, Professional Graphics, ultra low-power client and Embedded products.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2013 was $1.16 billion. The 7% sequential increase was driven by a 12% increase in the Computing Solutions segment, which was partially offset by a 5% decrease in the Graphics and Visual Solutions segment.
Gross margin was 40%, a decrease of 1 percentage point sequentially and includes an $11 million benefit from the sale of certain products previously reserved in Q3 2012. You may recall that Q1 2013 gross margin of 41% included a similar benefit of $20 million. Excluding these benefits, gross margin was flat at 39% for both Q2 and Q1 2013.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $479 million, and we remain on track to achieve our operating expense goal of $450 million by the third quarter of this year. Non-GAAP operating loss was $20 million and non-GAAP net loss was $65 million.
Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.09, calculated using 752 million basic shares. This loss per share includes the $11 million benefit from the sale of previously reserved products. Adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, an increase of $14 million from the prior quarter, due to the lower operating loss.
Now switching to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $841 million, up 12% sequentially, due to significantly higher notebook and higher server and desktop unit shipments, primarily driven by demand for our new Kabini and Temash offerings, as well as our latest Opteron 6300 series of products. Client product revenue and server microprocessor revenue increased sequentially. Computing Solutions operating income was $2 million, an improvement from an operating loss of $39 million in the prior quarter.
Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue was $320 million, down 5% compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to lower game console royalties. Graphics and Visual Solutions segment operating income was breakeven, compared to $16 million in the prior quarter.
We continue to diversify our product portfolio into new markets where the competitive dynamics are different. In the Semi-Custom space, for example, the market is differentiated from the rest of our business, as our customers engage with us very early to jointly define and fund engineering development of customized products. Development revenue and the associated costs are incurred during the development cycle of the given products. When the Semi-Custom products ship to the customer, we generate silicon sales and the associated ongoing OpEx is significantly lower than our non-Semi-Custom products, due to the upfront funded development.
The Semi-Custom model has the potential of providing a long-term revenue stream based on high volumes, which results in gross margin that is lower than the corporate average but has significant revenue and earnings power as volumes ramp. Under this model, the majority of gross margin dollars fall through to operating income, and the operating margin for this business will be in the low double-digit range, more than offsetting the impact of the lower gross margin.
In addition, as we transition to shipping silicon products, game console royalty revenue included in the Semi-Custom business is expected to decrease moving forward, although the decline will be more than offset by our growing Semi-Custom development and product revenues.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long-term marketable securities, was $1.1 billion. During the quarter, AMD made a $40 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES related to the 2012 wafer purchase commitment reduction and exited the quarter at our target optimal cash level, and well above the target minimum cash level, of $700 million. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2 billion, flat from the prior quarter.
Inventory was $711 million, up $98 million sequentially, largely driven by semi-custom products and the ramp of new products in the PC space to support growth in the second half of the year.
Accounts payable at the end of the quarter was $402 million, up $101 million compared to the end of the first quarter of 2013, due to the timing of purchases and payments. Depreciation and amortization was $54 million, down from $62 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the sale and lease back of our Austin, Texas, Lone Star campus.
Now turning to the outlook. For the third quarter of 2013, AMD expects revenue to increase 22% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 36%. Despite expecting revenue to increase significantly, quarterly operating expenses are expected to decline approximately 6% sequentially to around $450 million. Expense management will continue to be a focus area for us, as we move forward. 
At the midpoint of revenue guidance, AMD expects to be profitable at the net income level. Inventory is expected to increase sequentially to approximately $800 million, largely based on semi-custom product builds. We expect inventory to remain at those levels for the coming quarters, consistent with the ramp of our Semi-Custom business, and cash is expected to remain flat sequentially at approximately $1.1 billion.
In summary, in the third quarter, we will build on the strong foundation we have established, as we remain laser focused on execution and returning to profitability in the third quarter and positive free cash flow generation in the second half of the year.

As we look forward, we see a continued opportunity in the PC segment. While we see it only slightly stronger than the first half, and I believe down, year-to-year, I think there's an opportunity for us with our stronger product portfolio to continue to build on the momentum that we saw in the second quarter. Clearly, the market is moving down into the entry and mainstream price points where we've played very well. And I think this is a very good opportunity for us to continue to build share. Now having said that, clearly, the momentum and acceleration of revenue will come from the new segments, as well as off of that initial base.

And then, Rory, you guys did a good job kind of helping us understand the profitability in the gaming systems. I'm just kind of curious, as we see the launch of new products in the core compute and server market, you're slightly above a breakeven operating level in the June quarter. How do we think about profitability in the core business, especially given that you gained market share in the second quarter? Breakeven was probably a little bit lower than I would have expected.

Driving to that level is something we've talked about over the past 3, 4 quarters, and I think we're executing well to deliver that. You're seeing a movement in the revenue up, and the control of the expense down, and a nice new set of products that are coming out. That, I believe, we can continue to build on. The PC segment, as I talked about earlier in the call, the market's choppy. There is no doubt that market will continue to be choppy the next 12, 18 months. In spite of that, that market's over 300 million-plus units, that's a great opportunity for us and a key component to our future strategy. We want to grow and we want to take share there. Now to augment that and to balance off our expense and reuse our IP, let's take that IP and technology and apply it into these new high-growth segments.

We are on target to hit the $450 million in Q3 of 2013. And beyond that, we're going to be laser focused, look at the mix between the OpEx and the revenue. And as Rory talked about, as the revenue evolves over time, whether it's a Semi-Custom business or the traditional business that we have, we keep an eye on that. If you think for a moment that there's going to be an uplift in revenue, we're going to watch that very carefully. And what I would say is the increase in OpEx, if any, would be significantly lower than the increase from a viewpoint of the revenue, is the way I would look at it. This is really moving to a model which is very different than we have had in the past. And with the OpEx reductions you're seeing in Q3 with the significant increase in revenue, it demonstrates the earnings power of the model.

The idea of an ambidextrous architecture and reusable IP, this is what you're seeing. The power of Jaguar as a core showing up in Semi-Custom offerings, into server chips, into all the way to client chips. This is the model that we're -- on the journey that we're taking, to dramatically improve the efficiency of how we create SoCs, leverage our IP, and we've been investing to go get some of the best industry talent in Mark Papermaster's team and Lisa's team to really build out that technology leadership.

Because we're going to be very operating-margin focused as opposed to the traditional historical gross margin outlook that everybody has been focused on, on the AMD model, because this is truly a transition going from one business model that we have had in the history of the company to where it's evolving into more focus on operating margin as opposed to gross margin alone.",139,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We are on target to get to 20% of embedded semi-custom by Q4 of 2013. We've also said very publicly that longer term, we are targeting 40% to 50% of revenue to higher growth markets. And some of those businesses have higher than corporate average gross margins. So you can imagine, as we sit here in Q3, in essentially the first quarter, we are transitioning in a significant manner to a mix of revenue that's very different than what we have had in the past, that there is going to be a transition over time because it's 2 to 3 years to get to the 40% to 50% mix. And that can obviously have an impact on revenue, ASPs. It can have an impact on the gross margin. And finally, the all important from my standpoint, the operating margin, because that's what flows to the bottom line of the EPS.

So the Semi-Custom and the Embedded are both 2 important growth markets for us. Semi-custom has been so far dominated by gaming, but we see a lot of other opportunities. We have a strong pipeline that can similarly use our graphics and computing capability. And some of the markets are things like other consumer, specialty servers, those types of markets. Embedded processing is also important to us, and we see in those markets x86 being very valuable in industrial and medical and other casino gaming type opportunities.

It's a model where the costs are upfront, funded jointly between the customer and us. You incur the costs, you go ahead and introduce the product. And at the time of the product introduction, you get the sales. It's lower gross margin than corporate average, but the majority of the gross margin dollars fall to the operating margin, and that's the benefit that we get at the bottom line from an overall standpoint. As far as the details of the business and how you manage it between the sales, marketing, G&A and R&D, I'll let Lisa comment in a second on the R&D and G&A.

Third quarter revenue of $1.46 billion increased 26% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, as we returned to profitability and delivered positive free cash flow. Revenue was higher than guided based on incremental demand for our new semi-custom SoCs. The 3-step turnaround plan we outlined a year ago to restructure, accelerate and ultimately transform AMD is clearly paying off. We completed the restructuring phase of our plan, maintaining cash at optimal levels and beating our $450 million quarterly operating expense goal in the third quarter. We are now in the second phase of our strategy, accelerating our performance by consistently executing our product road maps while growing our new businesses to drive a return to profitability and positive free cash flow. We are also laying the foundation for the third phase of our strategy, as we transform AMD to compete across a set of high-growth markets. 
Our progress on this front was evident in the third quarter as we generated more than 30% of our revenue from our semi-custom and embedded businesses. Over the next 2 years, we will continue to transform AMD to expand beyond a slowing, transitioning PC industry as we create a more diverse company and look to generate approximately 50% of our revenue from these new high-growth markets. We have strategically targeted the semi-custom, ultra-low-power client, embedded, dense server and the professional graphics markets, where we can offer differentiated products that leverage our APU and graphics IP. Our strategy allows us to continue to invest in the products that will drive growth while effectively managing operating expenses. This is best exemplified by the 10% sequential reduction in our expense-to-revenue ratio as we drive to best-in-class performance on this key metric. 
Several of our growth businesses passed key milestones in the third quarter. Most significantly, our semi-custom business ramped in the quarter. We successfully shipped millions of units to support Sony and Microsoft, as they prepare to launch their next-generation game consoles. Our game console wins are generating a lot of customer interest as we demonstrate our ability to design and reliably ramp production on 2 of the most complex SoCs ever built for high-volume consumer devices. We have several strong semi-custom design opportunities moving through the pipeline, as customers look to tap into AMD's IP, design and integration expertise to create differentiated winning solutions. 
We made good progress in our embedded business in the third quarter. We expanded our current embedded SoC offerings and detailed our plans to be the only company to offer both 64-bit x86 and ARM solutions beginning in 2014. We have developed a strong embedded design pipeline, which we expect will drive further growth for this business across 2014. 
We also continue to make steady progress in another of our growth businesses in the third quarter, as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and share growth in the Professional Graphics area. We believe we can continue to gain share in this lucrative part of the GPU market, based on our product portfolio, design wins in-flight and enhanced channel programs. 
In the server market, the industry is at the initial stages of a multi-year transition that will fundamentally change the competitive dynamic. Cloud providers are placing a growing importance on how they get better performance from their data centers while also reducing the physical footprint and power consumption of their server solution. This will become the defining metric of this industry and will be a key growth driver for the market and the new AMD. AMD is leading this emerging trend in the server market, and we are committed to defining a leadership position. 
Earlier this quarter, we had a significant public endorsement of our dense server strategy as Verizon announced a high-performance public cloud that uses our SeaMicro technology and Opteron processors. We remain on track to introduce new low-power x86 and 64-bit ARM processors next year, and we believe we will offer the industry-leading ARM-based servers. 
Now looking at our traditional businesses. In the third quarter, our Graphics Business was in transition as our AIB partners prepare to launch new products based on our new R7 and R9 graphics chips. The transition is now complete, and we are seeing strong demand for our new products, which we believe will drive consistent growth in the coming quarters. A key innovation in these new chips is Mantle. Mantle was developed in conjunction with game developers to allow them to take better advantage of the capability of AMD's latest Graphics Cores, resulting in dramatically better performance and power efficiency. Mantle also means the investments developers make to create great content for the Sony and Microsoft consoles translates into optimized experience for all AMD APUs and GPUs moving forward. 
Turning to the PC business. The 300-million-plus unit market remains an important part of our business. But the market is clearly in transition as evidenced in the third quarter by consumer notebook softness, which we expect to continue for the next several quarters as tablet adoption increases and our customers' inventory levels remain lean. We expect PC industry unit shipments will decline approximately 10% this year and by a similar amount in 2014. We have the right product and IP, and we'll continue to compete effectively in this market. 
We are well positioned to expand our channel business and strategic OEM partnerships around consumer notebooks and commercial products. Kabini continues to ramp and support of a number of high-volume OEM platforms, and Temash adoption is growing. Toshiba and HP announced the first Temash-powered convertibles, and we expect more designs from other OEMs to launch this quarter. 
Our work to strengthen our desktop business is gaining momentum. We delivered a second straight quarter of channel revenue growth based on strong demand for our high-end A8 and A10 APUs and FX CPUs. We expect this trend to continue. We remain on track to begin shipping our next-generation Kaveri APU for the channel this quarter, and key motherboard partners are already offering new product in anticipation of this launch. 
So in summary, we are successfully hitting key milestones of our 3-step strategy to diversify and transform our business. We have completed the first step, restructuring AMD and stabilizing our business. We effectively managed cash at the optimal level and beat our $450 million quarterly operating expense goal in the third quarter. We are now in the second phase, accelerating our performance by consistently executing our product road map and growing our new businesses. Our success here drove 26% sequential revenue growth and returned AMD to profitability and generated free cash flow in the third quarter. Our progress sets us up to ultimately transform AMD in the third and final step, as we leverage our IP and design expertise from our traditional businesses to generate approximately 50% of our future revenues from high-growth markets over the next 2 years. We are in the middle of a multi-year journey we outlined over a year ago to redefine AMD as a leader across a more diverse set of growth markets. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank AMD-ers across the world who have pulled together to deliver on our commitment and successfully execute our plans. The job is not done, but we are making good and real progress. I look forward to the next steps of our strategic transformation. 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Devinder. Devinder?",1232,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2013",2013-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3177.0,529836.0,24253393.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. Our third quarter results met or exceeded our guidance for revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and cash, although inventory was higher than guided. We completed the first phase of our 3-step plan to transform AMD, the reset and restructure phase. And we are performing well in the second phase, accelerating our business and executing on our 2013 product road map. In the third quarter, we made progress towards our goal of diversifying our product portfolio as we successfully ramped our semi-custom products. Specifically, our semi-custom and embedded revenue accounted for more than 30% of total company revenue, exceeding the target of 20% of revenue by the fourth quarter of 2013. Financially, we returned to profitability both in operating and net income, met our target of reducing operating expenses to $450 million and generated positive free cash flow ahead of plan. Significant change is underway at AMD, as we continue to -- our transformation into 2014 and beyond. 
Now let me turn to the specifics of the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was $1.46 billion, an increase of 26% from the second quarter and an increase of 15% year-over-year. This represents the highest sequential revenue growth in the past 5 years. The increase was driven by a more than doubling of our Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue quarter-on-quarter, primarily from the ramp of our semi-custom SoCs. 
Gross margin was 36%, down 4 percentage points sequentially and in line with our expectations as we grew our semi-custom business, which has lower than corporate average margins, but significant revenue and earnings power as volumes ramp. You will recall that the semi-custom NRE operating model drives significantly lower operating expenses for this business, with the majority of its gross margin dollars falling through to operating income. The third quarter result includes a $19 million benefit or approximately 1 percentage point from the sale of inventory previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to an $11 million benefit or approximately 1 percentage point in the second quarter of 2013. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $443 million, slightly below our targeted level of $450 million, primarily due to the timing of certain marketing related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $78 million, and non-GAAP net income was $31 million, both of which exclude a gain of $22 million from the real estate transactions in the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.04, calculated using 764 million diluted shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $153 million, an increase of $99 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to improved operating income. 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $790 million, down 6% sequentially due to lower notebook and chipset unit shipments, partially offset by higher desktop unit shipments. Computing Solutions operating income was $22 million, up from $2 million in the second quarter despite the sequential 6% decline in revenue driven by lower operating expenses. 
Graphics and Visual Solutions segment revenue was $671 million, more than double last quarter's level driven by shipment of game console semi-custom SoCs. Graphics and Visual Solutions segment operating income was $79 million compared to breakeven in the prior quarter primarily due to the semi-custom business. 
Operating margin for the semi-custom business was in the mid-teens, primarily due to higher revenue and a very smooth ramp in our first full quarter of production. Moving forward, we expect semi-custom operating margin performance to continue to improve as the business gains traction, volumes increase and costs improve. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long-term marketable securities, was $1.2 billion. Third quarter real estate transaction generated cash proceeds of $56 million. We remain committed to operating and funding the business appropriately, and continue to have a number of liquidity-bolstering opportunities available. Inventory, as I stated earlier, was higher than guided at $922 million, largely driven by next-generation game console product ramps and preparation for fourth quarter shipments of our new graphics products. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2 billion, flat from the prior quarter. Accounts payable at the end of the quarter was $574 million, up $172 million from the second quarter due to the timing of purchases and payments. Depreciation and amortization was $52 million, down $2 million sequentially. And lastly, we generated positive free cash flow of $6 million in the quarter. 
Now turning to the outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2013, AMD expects revenue to increase 5% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 35% as our semi-custom business continues to represent a greater portion of our overall revenue. We expect to continue to maintain quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses in the $450 million range and expect to be profitable at the net income level. Inventory is expected to be flat from third quarter levels, and cash is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures for the full year 2013 are expected to be approximately $110 million, down from our prior guidance of $150 million. 
In summary, our execution and product diversification strategy is showing results as evidenced by our return to profitability in the third quarter of 2013. We are pleased to have delivered on our financial commitments so far this year, some ahead of schedule, and expect to continue these positive trends in the fourth quarter.

And the feedback I'm getting from our customers in terms of the design wins and the ramps, they look solid. We are -- our volume is solid in that space. And the next-generation products, the silicon is already in shop. So that's positioning us well to continue to compete in this segment. But make no mistake about it. The PC industry is clearly in transition and will continue to be in transition as tablet continues to tack, particularly in the consumer segment. We think we can compete well, and it will make a significant portion to our business moving forward. But think about it. Two years ago, we were 90% to 95% of our business centered over PCs. And we've launched a clear strategy to diversify our portfolio, taking our IP -- leadership IP and graphics and CPU and taking it into adjacent segments where there's high-growth for 3, 5, 7 years and stickier opportunities. We see that as an opportunity to drive 50% or more of our business over that time horizon. And if you look at the results in the third quarter, we're already seeing the benefits of that opportunity with over 30% of our revenue now coming from semi-custom and our embedded businesses. We see it is an important business in PC, but it's time is changing. And the go-go era is over.

But clearly, it's our objective to get back in black in third quarter and continue to deliver that in fourth quarter. And this year, it's the tale of 2 halves, the first half and improving second half. As we look to '14, we need to look at the full year and drive a business that drives revenue growth and profitability for the full year. That needs to be the next step in our transformation. Now in terms of the question about gaming, gaming is going to be an important driver of the business. And if you think about consoles traditionally, that's a 5-plus-year business, and it generally peaks in the third year. It will have some seasonality in the first half of the year, but we think there is strong demand and opportunity for us to continue to have a very good business. And we'll share the specifics of that as we give the guidance for 1Q next quarter. But I think it's important to think about it as we continue to go after this pipeline in semi-custom, we'll look to close additional deals over the next 2 years, 1 year and 2 years, that will allow us to continue to fill out that business with this nice, sticky flow of revenue, both in embedded and semi-custom. And while we're in the early phases of this transformation, as you move out and take the long view, you'll see the portfolio drive a much more consistent level of revenue moving forward. But again, it's our objective, as we stated before, to get back in black, which we did in third quarter, and then to move forward in fourth quarter or to continue to accelerate.

Look at the semi-custom business and how we're reusing IP in a series of high-growth segments. And semi-custom is an NRE model where there's an investment around engineering. In the quarter, we drove $300 million of additional revenue, up 26%. And at the same time, we had expense decline almost 10%, following a year we've driven down 25%. Clearly, that says we're getting a strong leverage in that model. And as we consider that in some of our core businesses, they'll continue to see pressure. They're at a different point in their maturity. We'll drive for higher efficiencies in those segments, and at the same time, look for opportunities to make investments to capture the new growth segments like growth businesses, like Pro graphics, embedded and semi-custom.

The consumer market is feeling more pressure, but all parts of the PC market are down. This market, this industry is down 10% and at rates it's never experienced before. It's going to continue. From our perspective, AMD is over-indexed to client notebook. We've always been. We've had -- just like we have to diversify our portfolio across high-growth segment, we need to diversify this core business. We need to move stronger into desktop. And as we talked about a year ago, we worked on the inventory in the desktop segment. And we built and repaired that, and we've seen 2 quarters of consistent revenue growth in that segment. And we believe that we have the right product stack to continue to make hay, make progress in that part of our business as well. But there's no doubt that the PC client segment, particularly at the entry-level, will feel pressure from tablets, and it's a competitive space. We're going to be in there, and we're going to compete because we have very good products.

So you go ahead and have the billion in inventory from a viewpoint of the steep ramp in revenue and you can have the timing from a viewpoint of when the wafers come in and then we have the parts. And what we are doing from a management standpoint is, over Q3 and Q4, keeping the inventory flat while the revenue has gone up 26% from Q2 to Q3 and projected to go up again in Q4. So I think you need to take the longer view in terms of the 6-month period, how much the revenue has gone up from the first half to the second half. And inventory essentially has gone from $600 million to $900 million. And by the way, the revenue is up significantly in both quarters compared to the prior quarters.",141,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The semi-custom business, and in particular the game console business, is built on an NRE model. The R&D costs have been incurred upfront. The gross margins, as we've been very transparent, are lower than the corporate average. But the majority of that falls to the operating margin line. In Q3 alone, thinking that we were at the low double digits when we talked about last quarter, we came in at the mid-teens. As we gain traction, as we extract more efficiencies, as we go ahead and increase the volume and get cost improvements, the operating margin could go up from the mid-teens, higher than where we came in, in Q3. I'll let Lisa comment from a business standpoint, too.",158,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And that was primarily because the ramp was actually quite smooth, and it went very well. As we look forward, again, this is a very nice product. It's one of those -- each of these products are high volume. They give us a lot of opportunity to optimize yield and cost and other things. So we're going to be working hard to improve that operating margin over the next number of quarters. And it's something that we believe there's leverage in.",110,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

We have a pipeline of additional products. And it's our intention to win and mix in a whole set of semi-custom offerings as we build out this exciting and important new business. And also, as you think about that NRE model, look at the expense-to-revenue ratio. When we historically ran this business at different margin, it was much higher, the high 30s, even into the 40s. In this quarter, we saw a 10% reduction in EDR [ph] with that significant revenue gain. And we're going to drive that efficiency moving forward.

Srini, good question. So it is a long life-cycle product, over 5 to 7 years. Certainly, when we look at cost reduction opportunities, one of the important ones is to move technology nodes. So we will, in this time frame, certainly move from 28- to 20-nanometer. And the reason to do that is both for pure dye cost savings as well as all the power savings that our customer benefits from. So I think we'll see leverage in the model as we continue to improve the costs. And as the costs improve, the volumes will also go up.",99,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

So let me try to help with that. So if you look at the combined quarterly shipments for Q3 and Q4, they're very much on track with what we would have expected. If you look at the supply chain cycle, we buy wafers earlier to ship, and the peak months are going to be October and November. So I think all of the data is consistent. We did ship a few more units in Q3 than we originally planned just because of the strength of the production ramp.

So we have wafer purchase from GLOBALFOUNDRIES that we have purchased throughout this year. Earlier this year, we did have some special payments that we made related to the limited exclusivity waiver that we got way back in 2012. And then we did have the termination payment. We made about $120 million payment of that. There is another $210 million from that left to be paid in Q1 2014. So if you relate that from a cash standpoint, we have, as I projected, $1.2 billion of cash. Revenues can be up in Q4.
