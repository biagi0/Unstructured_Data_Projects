In our first fiscal quarter of 2014, Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high end of our guidance range, while demonstrating momentum in revenue, orders and market share. This performance reflects healthy investment by our semiconductor and display customers in major technology trends that are playing to our strengths in precision materials engineering.
For Applied, 2013 was a transformative year. We changed our spending profile and shifted more investments to product development. We strengthened our organization and business processes in key areas. And we started to prove the growth potential of our Etch, inspection and display businesses.
In 2014, every employee across the organization is focused on building our momentum for profitable growth. We are driving performance improvements in our financial model, improving product time-to-market and cost, driving higher quality and getting the organization ready for our merger with Tokyo Electron.
In recent months, we have taken significant steps forward with our preparations for the merger. A joint Applied-Tokyo Electron integration team is developing the detailed plans to bring the 2 companies together. We are delighted with the level of engagement, enthusiasm and the strong working relationships that are already forming. The progress this team is making gives us increased confidence that we will be ready to execute as soon as the merger closes.
Each company is meeting regularly with customers to ensure that we are aligned with their priorities. Our discussions have centered on the value inherent in our combined ability to accelerate solutions for the industry's major materials innovation challenges.
The new company will be able to deliver more innovative products faster and at lower cost. We will have broader and deeper R&D capabilities to address customer road maps more effectively and with greater speed. By combining our field technical capabilities and best practices, we can collaborate more closely with our customers to support the rapid development of new device performance and yield solutions.
And through operating synergies in many areas, we can focus our R&D investments to deliver the cost of ownership and materials engineering innovations that really move the industry forward. We remain confident that we will receive approval for the merger in the mid to second half of this year, and we expect to submit our S-4 securities registration statement after we filed Applied's Form 10-Q for this past quarter.
Turning to our market outlook. We believe 2013 wafer fab equipment spending ended the year towards the midpoint of our range of $27 billion to $30 billion. We expect investment levels to be stronger in 2014, up 10% to 20%, driven by higher spending in foundry and memory.
The foundries remain the biggest components of wafer fab equipment, as they ramp new factories to fulfill demand for advanced mobile chips and race to introduce new technology to enable devices with higher performance and longer battery life. We expect foundry investment to grow 10% to 20% this year, which is very positive for Applied as we have our strongest share positions at these customers and continue to make gains.
Approximately half of total foundry spending this year will be focused on ramping 20-nanometer technology. The build-out of this node creates tremendous pull for our products that enable transistor performance. And in our first quarter, we generated record orders in Taiwan. In addition, we recorded our highest ever quarterly net sales in Epi, second-highest shipments of medium current implant tools and our highest quarterly PVD orders in a decade.
Leading customers are also making significant investments in their pilot lines for finFET. This technology is enabled by materials innovation, and Applied has a broad and unique portfolio of products to enable this inflection. We are collaborating early and deeply with our customers to ensure that they can quickly transition finFET into volume production with the right performance, yield and cost.
We also expect a stronger year of spending by NAND customers as mobility supports bit growth demand in the 40% to 50% range and 3D technology is introduced. We anticipate that total NAND investment will be around $7 billion, with incremental spending in advanced planar NAND and initial investments in 3D NAND.
The transition from planar to 3D NAND is enabled by materials innovation in thermal, deposition and Etch processes. This plays directly to Applied's strengths in precision materials engineering and expands our total available market by about 25% for first-generation devices. Overall, we are making significant gains in planar and 3D NAND. In our first quarter, we generated our highest NAND net sales in the past 7 years.
Consumption of mobile DRAM is also growing, providing a good foundation for increased investments in 2014. We expect DRAM customers to focus their spending on upgrading capacity to advanced nodes. In logic, we anticipate investment levels to be flat to down relative to 2013, with a high level of focus on advanced technology.
Moving to the display market. We expect the TV unit growth rate to be low-single digits for the year ahead. However, average TV sizes are growing at 1.5 to 2 inches annually, which is significantly higher than historic norms. This is driving area growth in the 15% range, which we believe is sufficient to support investment in 3 new Gen 8.5 factories.
In mobile, screen resolution is becoming an important differentiator, and we see significant growth in higher-definition screens that require low-temperature polysilicon backplanes. Consequently, we expect multiple Gen 6 LTPS factories to be built in the next 12 to 18 months to support this demand. Overall, we believe we have the potential to book $500 million of display orders over the next 2 quarters, although revenue patterns for the year may be uneven as this equipment is delivered.
In both semiconductor and display, materials innovation is the key to enabling performance gains and lower cost for customers. finFET, 3D NAND, cost-effective device scaling and next-generation displays are all enabled by precision materials engineering. Applied's differentiated technologies in precision film deposition, materials removal, materials modification and interface engineering are enabling these key inflections.
To support our customers' road maps, we accelerated R&D in fiscal 2013 by increasing our annual investment run rate in 300-millimeter semiconductor product development by $200 million, adding more than 500 R&D engineers. We are also investing over $150 million of capital in new lab capabilities. These investments have driven market share gains in our served market, as well as increased our overall wafer fab equipment share in calendar 2013. We are showing momentum in our traditional leadership areas, and over the past year, we have started to demonstrate excellent progress in markets that are large growth opportunities for us. 
In conductor etch, we have focused our strategy in areas where we can deliver differentiated technology to address our customers' most pressing challenges. We believe we gained around 5 points of overall Etch share in 2013 and continue to build momentum at leading memory and foundry customers.
In wafer inspection and defect review, we believe we gained between 4 and 6 points of share last year. We have made investments in R&D and field technical support, enabling us to increase our layer qualification in logic and foundry. Our UVision brightfield inspection product line delivered record net sales for the calendar year, and our new UVision 6 tool has recently been qualified by a leading customer for their most advanced node. In addition, we are strengthening our leadership in the e-beam review market.
In display, our pivot PVD tool continues to gain traction, complementing our clear leadership position in CVD. In the past quarter, we secured 100% of the PVD and CVD business as the industry's largest metal oxide factory.
Through increased R&D investments and focused portfolio management, we are creating a strong pipeline of new, highly differentiated products to enable future inflections in logic, memory and display. Over the past quarter, we have seen a number of customers accelerating their qualification of some of our most advanced products. This underlines the fundamental role of new materials engineering solutions in realizing next generation devices.
As we look to 2014 and beyond, we are incredibly excited about the future. We are uniquely positioned to apply our differentiated capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major customer inflections and cost-effective device scaling. This provides us with a great platform to build momentum for profitable growth. We remain highly focused on execution to ensure we take full advantage of these opportunities and to demonstrate progress against our financial performance goals.
We are preparing the organization for our merger with Tokyo Electron, a combination that will enable us to accelerate our ability to address the major materials innovation challenges facing the industry and increase the value we provide customers and shareholders.
I will now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.",1468,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2014",2014-02-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4170.0,582937.0,26491242.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. Over the last year, we have discussed our commitment to accelerating momentum for profitable growth. This entails a commitment to grow, grow profitably and accelerate our growth momentum.
To grow, we are aggressively rebalancing our spending towards semi and display products and technical field resources focused on disruptive, high-value products. This quarter, we increased R&D to 64.3% of R&D plus SG&A, which was up from 57% a year ago. We also increased our technical field resources by almost 20% in the same period. To grow profitably, while making these investments, we are also driving improvements to our operating margins to achieve the profitably targets we have set out for the company.
We are driving for return on these investments in the short, intermediate and long term. In the short term, Gary indicated some investments that are already giving us momentum. In inspection, we leverage our investment in the technical applications organization to increase our layer qualifications and market share. In Etch, we rapidly iterated new products to win market share in both the planar and 3D NAND.
In the intermediate term, we see returns on our investments, including more Epi steps, utilizing new materials; our new CVD tool, which improves critical film control; and the new CMP tool, which enables higher cross-wafer uniformity. In the longer term, our investments are targeting highly differentiated products in disruptive applications, some of which, such as selective materials removal, are $1 billion opportunities.
Even while investing for future growth, we are striving to improve our operating margins, which increased in each of the past 5 quarters, benefiting both from revenue growth and our actions to improve the model. This level of operating margin included R&D investment that is approximately 4 points above our history at similar revenue levels.
We are driving improvements in gross margins by delivering a greater mix of high-value products in semiconductor and display and achieving materials cost reductions. Our Q1 gross margins exceeded our original expectations, and based on current business projections, we now expect Q2 gross margins to be better than previously communicated.
Our current projections are the Q3 and Q4 gross margins will further increase, resulting in over 100 basis points of improvement for the year. To further improve our model, we also reduced EES spending to below $25 million in Q1, down 40% from the same quarter last year. Our goal is for EES to breakeven for the year.
To accelerate our growth momentum, we are revving up our product development engine. As Gary mentioned, we are increasing our capital investment in R&D development tools by $150 million. Moreover, we never stop critical development projects, including during holiday shutdowns. We are also excited about our pilot manufacturing line, which has already reduced product development cycle times while improving our initial product costs.
Next, I'll summarize some of the changes in our Q1 result versus the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 9% as growth in SSG and AGS was partially offset by a pushout at display orders. Net sales of $2.2 billion were at the high end of our expectations.
Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.5% was up by about 0.5 point due to our higher silicon mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $550 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 was in the upper end of our guidance range. Cash from operations of $372 million was up substantially, reflecting good collections and higher net income. We paid on $120 million in dividends and ended the quarter with cash and investments up $226 million to $3.1 billion.
Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.6 billion were up 13%, with increases in foundry and NAND, offset by a decline in logic and DRAM. SSG net sales of $1.5 billion were at the high end of our expectations, as increases in NAND and foundry offset decreases in logic and DRAM. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin increased 3 points to 24.1% on higher volume and favorable product mix.
AGS orders of $597 million were up 9%, due mainly to an increase in 200-millimeter equipment orders. AGS net sales of $507 million were in line with expectations. AGS non-GAAP operating margin increased over 3 points, 24.9%, driven by favorable mix and the higher spares margins.
In Display, orders of $79 million were below our expectation, reflecting a customer pushout. However, we expect a solid year for both TV and mobile investments. Display net sales of $159 million were flat, which was above our expectations, due in part to growth in pivot PVD revenue, which achieved a new record driven by share gains. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased by 5 points to 17%, reflecting operational improvements.
EES orders of $40 million were flat, and net sales of $40 million were down 9%. The EES non-GAAP operating loss climbed to $10 million. 
Now I will provide our Q2 business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 3% to 10% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be up by 6% to 10%. AGS net sales should be approximately flat. We expect Display net sales to be down -- flat to down 15%, consistent with the uneven revenue patterns of this business. And EES net sales should more than double. We expect our quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million, plus or minus $10 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29.
In summary, we are investing for growth while improving our model and accelerating our new product pipeline. We are very excited about our planned merger with Tokyo Electron, which will provide us with more strong products and technologies to enable our customers' road map, a larger installed base of systems to service, substantial economies of scale and a unique opportunity to return more value to our shareholders.

So we see more technology buys this year as all of those customers race to be the first to have a cost-effective finFET device with high yield.

If a project pushes out one quarter, that makes a big difference in terms of the end result. But if you look overall, again, on the foundry customers, certainly, 20-nanometer ramping is a big factor in the -- in foundry. And that one, it looks like that is pretty much on track. finFET is a big, really strategic battle for our customers. And we see a lot of focus there from a technology development perspective, not so much significant capacity buying in 2014. But definitely, that's a factor in the overall CapEx. And then we do see incremental buying if you go below the first 3 customers and a broadening of CapEx spending in 2014. NAND Flash, we see certainly good demand in that market, and so planar NAND investment is definitely picking up. And on 3D NAND, I think it's well known, one customer is ramping capacity there. But this is really another important strategic battle in the NAND business, and we see incremental spending from a technology standpoint really across the board for all of those different customers. That transition from planar to 3D is a tough transition. We've talked about that being really leveraging a lot of the technologies we have within Applied on the materials innovation. But it is a top technology transition. So I would say one factor is really relating to how fast that yield ramps and the cost comes down, and also the adoption of those new devices with the end customers is another factor.",271,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Clearly, DRAM orders were down pretty healthy in the quarter for you. But if you look at both DRAM and NAND and you combine that for you, and you look at where you are today versus sort of some of the peak levels you saw in April 2010 or even April 2007, you seem to be down further from peak than some of your peers. And I guess I'm just trying to figure out what's driving that. Is it really based upon the fact that a lot of your share gain's come at 3D and you're seeing more strength at planar capacity?

We have really great products around a lot of these critical processes. We talked about some of that in the July 8 investor meeting. And that, we're still very much on track with what we discussed. In the DRAM market, one of the changes that are happening there is really in the periphery where that's becoming more logic-like. That's another one that really truthfully hasn't been there in the past because the periphery is behind, of course, where logic is. But that is also helping us going forward in the DRAM business.

You're suggesting foundry CapEx is going to be up comfortably. Do you think that's more of a function of some of the other foundries beyond TSMC being more aggressive? And I know GLOBALFOUNDRIES made some high-profile announcements.

I think we're not going to comment on anything our customers are saying. But we certainly see a broadening of the CapEx spending in 2014 in foundry. And as I talked about earlier, certainly, we see very healthy spending on 20-nanometer in 2014. finFET is a very critical strategic battle in the work for mobility leadership. All of our customers are very focused in that area, and technology buys in finFET are also going to be a factor in 2014.",82,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I don't know if you signed off, Jim. But going back to what you said and John, every year you try and characterize and get a feel for the year. My 2014 is characterized by 2 things. One is there's a lot of technology inflections coming, whether it's VNAND or it's finFET, and tough challenging ones. They are compelling ones. They provide great value. But there's a number of real challenging technology inflections this year, number one. Number two, the spending is a little broader than it's been the last couple of years. So some of the foundries you see spending money, you hadn't seen as much in that past. So it's spreading out more. Now what does that mean for Applied Materials? I think the technology inflection is a good opportunity for us. And when you see us gaining share particularly on those inflections in foundry and NAND, as those inflections come to bear in DRAM particularly in the periphery, we would do well in inflections. So inflections are great opportunities for Applied, particularly as those inflections are going more to materials innovation.",188,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If you look at what's happening in the foundry business, it's about transistor. Interconnect is becoming more difficult. And that's all new materials enabling these changes in device performance. The same thing is true certainly in NAND. And if you look at DRAM, to keep scaling those devices from a cost-effective standpoint, there are also going to be major changes in the future around materials and devices that are also playing into the sweet spot of Applied Materials.",104,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

First, Gary, how do you think about the trajectory of this year? You just put up $1 billion in foundry orders, and you put up $1 billion in orders out of Taiwan. Phase 1 of a large 3D NAND project is basically done now, and we're sort of waiting on finFET to ramp. So do you, at all, worry that there's this pause sort of in the middle of the year? Or do you think that there's enough other stuff happening?",85,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We got to get one of those videoconferencing system. So here's what -- I'll see if I can help a little bit. If you look at the last couple of years, there's been a little bit of seasonality where the big foundry customers, in particular, buy more heavily -- give you orders more heavily in the front end of the year, get ready to sort of -- used to be back-to-school, now it's more Christmas and Chinese New Year. So you're probably going to get a little bit of that waiting this year. It does look like it's not going to be a big drop-off in the middle as people predict because we have more spread among different customers. So it's more spread out, as I said earlier. The second one is that we have these technology inflections. Now those are the ones that you guys are poking at that are harder to read. How big is 20-nanometer, and how soon are finFETs ready? What see is customers aggressively pursuing those, and frankly, aggressively pursuing them with some of our tools and our solutions. The cutover from one node to another, not exactly sure of the smoothness of that cutover. The 2 things that make us feel better are: one, there's some more customers buying for different nodes right now; and two, they are really aggressively pursuing these technologies because they're very compelling; and three, they're aggressively pursuing it with us. So is there a little bit of a bubble in the year somewhat? Maybe, but it's hard to read because of the inflections.",276,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

If you look at the foundry customers, ramping 20-nanometer successfully is critically important. Transitioning to finFET technology is critically important, this transition from planar to 3D NAND. All of those things are involving -- really in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. And I'm traveling to Asia probably every other week now, meeting with a lot of customers. We still see tremendous pull from customers as these are the strategic issues, strategic inflections that are facing our customers. And we see very strong pull and still confident in our ability to grow the company. And certainly, we also see a great opportunity in the combination with Tokyo Electron to accelerate our products.

I mean, there is -- the theory puts forth that customers might be concerned about that. But if you look at the track record, Gary and I have had together it for 10 years, and Gary for 18 years before that at KLA, we believe the win-win for customers and ourselves is to aggressively invest into new products which really help them get to the next device and help yield price performance. And that's the win-win. So if you look at Varian, we went from 30% margin to 75%. It was because we got better solutions.

If you look at the big growth opportunity and the transition from planar to 3D NAND, that is a big focus for all of our customers. And we talked about first generation. So you have a certain number of layers that you're building up when you're -- when you go to 3D NAND. That first generation for us, we see about 25% increase in our total available market. And we're also gaining share in the initial customers that are transitioning into 3D NAND. One of the things we talked about at the July 8th investor meeting is, where are the critical deposition steps as you're making this transition. And we talked about our position in that in selection. And that, we're still pretty much on track, Patrick, with what we talked about last summer. Certainly, the inflection is around thermal, deposition and Etch. We have some very strong products.

So if you look at the focus in foundry, it's how do I add more features, better performance, but I also have to have low-power and battery life. So what we're seeing -- and the same thing is true, again, as you make the change from planar to 3D NAND, as we talked about, is very focused on materials innovation. If you look at future memory devices, like MRAM, very PVD-intensive type of a process, many new materials. And I really think that these are major changes for the customers, major changes in device architecture, many new materials. And we really see that continuing. If you look at where do people go beyond first-generation finFET devices, we really see more Epi steps, more PVD, many new materials. When I'm talking to the customers, this is the key challenge for them: How do they keep driving Moore's Law and make that cost effective?

So the inflections going on at the foundry played very well to our strengths. If you look at PVD, very strong share there; very high share in Epi. It's a growing market. The question we just got asked about Epi, everything we see empirically about the Epi market is good, and the directional element of the Epi feels much -- feels very good.

We are still very much on track with what we talked about July 8. We have some very, very good products that provide customers with better device performance and yield. And certainly, that is a critical element for them as they make this transition. But we also have very good cost of ownership relative to other choices that they could make there.

I think -- I'll give you the characteristics here, then the potential upside, downside. The characteristics that you have, as I said earlier, spending is a little bit more diverse. So you've got more foundry customers spending money, some more memory customers spending money. So that's a good thing. And some of those people are not all at the same technology inflection. So that diversity gives you a little bit incremental cost. Second thing is the other big thing going on this year is the technology inflections between planar NAND and VNAND and between 20-nanometer and finFET. That's what everyone's debating. We see a lot of push for those. What would make the year bigger? I don't know. It was a bigger production buys of 20-nanometer or earlier production order of finFETs. That would be the foundry issue. Now I do think the spread out to multiple foundry customers gives you a little bit of push on the volatility. The second one on VNAND, I think it's going to be a pretty good NAND year. We see it in planar and 3D. The rate of transition from one to the other is a little hard to predict. What I will say is common to both finFET and VNAND. If you look at the device benefits of VNAND long term, very -- 3D VNAND, very compelling; finFET, very compelling. So there's a lot of incentive for customers to aggressively push to those absolute device benefits and the competitive benefits.

There's a limited amount that we can do right now relative to really understanding a lot of details around the technology synergies between the 2 companies.

And we really think that will increase in importance going forward. So to -- I really -- innovation is also connecting dots. And to the extent that TEL has some very good, complementary technologies that can -- that we can work together in providing new solutions, we do think there is a real opportunity there. And this is the strategic issue facing the industry is how fast do we make these technology transitions into these new devices. You see it today with finFET and 3D NAND being really difficult challenges. So we're pretty excited.

In the $30 billion model, which I think is about 22%, 23%, I don't know, it was in the low 20s, a little less, a couple of points less. And then models weren't as important to me as what the message was. The message was we are not running the company to a $37 billion wafer fab equipment number. We are managing Applied, and we're going to manage the combined company to a reasonable sort of mid-cycle number of around $28 billion to $30 billion. Our cost structures will be built around that. Our investments will be built around that. Our flexibility will be built around that. That's how we will manage the company. We've had good alignment with Tokyo Electron, that they agree.

There's first-generation versus second-generation 3D NAND. It's in the range, on the first generation, 25%, 30%. These are -- it's difficult to call that closely in terms of what that exact number is on the first generation, but it's pretty significant. If you look at some areas, some areas are up more than 50%. Some specific markets for us are up a significant amount. But the first generation is in that range. And of course, as you know, they're going to keep going vertical to drive bit scaling beyond the first generation, so the increase there is more.

I get asked this question a reasonable amount. I got asked the question, well, he was -- Quillan [ph] and Company has been talking about overall capital intensity going up, number one. And number two, they do in an overall term. So the first question I typically get asked is overall. Well, you got to look at the mix. So if you go look within foundries, within NAND, within DRAM and logic, and let's pick foundry where we talked a lot about the biggest pie-owner share. I don't think anyone doubts capital intensity is going up, if you go look at how much it costs a 50,000 wafer fab equipment. Cost has gone up. So within that segment, it's gone up. If you look at logic, it's gotten more expensive. Now what you have to parse out on that one for instance is greenfield versus reuse. I mean, reuse is a bigger issue on logic. If you look at VNAND, it's going up for first-generation in total. But it's very much going up where we play, which is deposition, Etch and thermal. If you look at lithography, which has been really driving the cost bus for NAND in the last number of years, it's going down. The next-generation VNAND is probably 50-nanometer lithography versus 10-nanometers, so it's reuse for existing lithography. So they can be very prudent in NAND in that total CapEx because the big cost of lithography has been eased. What they're doing is it's much more cost effective for them to use things like Etch deposition and thermal. I think then when you go to DRAM, which is the final market, the cost has been moderate. But the cost has been somewhat obscured because you haven't had a lot of new greenfield fab. So measurement is a little bit harder. As you look at next generation, all the capital intensity, the new DRAM cap is going up some, particularly because the -- the periphery is becoming more logical, like, all the same capital intensity that foundry and logic have. So I think you go look in the mix between customer type, the mix between greenfield and reuse, and then you'll look at the mix within equipment type and I think those things are consistent with what we've said, particularly the NAND question around that.",401,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

I think there's a lot of majority and merit to what you say because in foundry, big technology inflections spreading out to multiple customers. So I think there's going to be substantive spending driven by capacity, but also technology. I think DRAM, where you see DRAM prices pretty good, that would imply you might have a little upside because utilization's probably run pretty tight, as you remember they had that fire in China last year in Hynix too. So DRAM might play foul [ph] you actually. Flash, you got to sort through how much capacity is added between planar and VNAND and how much more that might increase their sales because if it's got better endurance and reliability, they may increase their addressable market for Flash devices.

In our second fiscal quarter of 2014, Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high end of our guidance, and we expanded our operating margins for the sixth quarter in a row. These results reflect healthy investment by our semiconductor and display customers, strong execution against our strategic plans, and significant improvements in our financial performance.
Across the company, we are focused on accelerating our momentum for profitable growth. We are strengthening our field technical engagements with customers, our R&D capabilities and our ability to ramp new products faster, with lower cost and better quality. At the same time, we are making great progress getting the organization ready for our merger with Tokyo Electron.
We continue to believe that we will receive regulatory approval for the merger in the second half of this year. Our S-4 securities registration statement has become effective, and our shareholder meeting to approve the combination with Tokyo Electron is scheduled for June 23. 
The detailed plans to integrate our 2 companies are taking shape. The level of engagement and strong working relationships within the integration teams are tremendous. This gives us high confidence that we can rapidly bring together the critical areas that will enable the new company to achieve its strategic and financial goals.
We have also been developing the mission, vision and values that will be the foundation of the combined companies' culture, and we will share more information about our progress at SEMICON in July.
As we work through the integration planning process, we are even more confident that we can accelerate materials innovation for the industry and increase the value we deliver to our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our market outlook. Evolving trends in mobility and connectivity are driving industry growth and accelerating innovation in mobile chips, solid-state storage and interactive displays. The advanced processors, sensors and memory needed to enable high-end smartphones have driven significant growth in the silicon content of these devices. 
Consequently, the foundries continue to make substantial investments, as they ramp 20-nanometer capacity and accelerate their pilot lines for 16- and 14-nanometer finFET technology. We expect foundry spending to increase 10% to 20% in 2014 and be distributed over a broader customer base, compared to recent years.
Mobility and cloud computing are also driving demands for NAND memory, and we expect bit growth to be about 40% this year. As a result of strong investments in advanced planar NAND, we believe total NAND spending could reach $7 billion for this year.
Adoption of 3D NAND is progressing at a slower pace than previously anticipated, but we still see increasing investment as customers work to solve technical challenges in a transition from planar to 3D devices. DRAM customers are also investing more, as they upgrade capacity at their advanced nodes to meet demand for mobile DRAM. We expect 2014 DRAM spending to be 10% to 15% higher than last year.
Overall, while there have been some adjustments in customers' investments plans in recent months, we maintain our view that 2014 wafer fab equipment could be up 10% to 20% relative to last year.
In the Display market, there are 2 primary factors driving growth. The first is TV, where average screen sizes are increasing at 1.5 to 2 inches annually, which is significantly higher than historic rates. Three new Gen 8.5 factories are being built in China, as our customers race to meet this growing TV area demand.
The second is mobile, where displays are an important area of differentiation for smartphones and tablets. Higher definition screens are driving demand for low-temperature polysilicon backplanes, and we expect multiple new Gen 6 factories to be built in the next 2 years to meet the market's needs. 
These strong market drivers in Display have enabled us to book $340 million of new orders in our second fiscal quarter. And while we expect our revenue patterns to be uneven due to shipment timing, our outlook for the Display business remains positive. 
In semiconductor and display, new materials innovations are enabling key inflections by providing our customers with solutions that improve device performance, yield and cost. We see tremendous customer pull for Applied's differentiated technologies in precision film deposition, materials modification, materials removal and interface engineering, which are at the heart of key transistor inflections. We are also working with our customers to drive significant materials innovation and interconnect.
Earlier this week, we launched our Volta CVD Cobalt system. This precision film deposition technology can be used to form CVD-based cobalt liners and selective cobalt capping films that allow customers to overcome critical yield-limiting issues as they scale copper interconnects at advanced nodes. This breakthrough strengthens our leadership position in interconnect, while growing the available market for Applied's CVD products.
Over the past 18 months, we have taken actions to support our growth strategy by shifting spending to our best opportunities, strengthening our processes and adding talent in critical areas of the organization. We have increased our technical capabilities in the field to better support new applications development for our customers. We strengthened our product development engine to accelerate new precision materials engineering innovations. And we aligned our product portfolio to increase our focus on those programs that make the biggest impact for our customers and for Applied.
We are starting to convert these actions and investments into market share momentum. In calendar 2013, we gained 1.4 points of wafer fab equipment market share, ending the year at our highest level since 2006.
We delivered positional share gains across the majority of our leadership businesses. Our PVD business gained 7 points of share in the year, epitaxy gained 5 points, while our implant, thermal and CMP businesses all delivered strong gains.
We also built positive momentum in areas that are large growth opportunities for us. We won 6 points of share in overall etch, driven by gains in conductor etch. We continue to build momentum and expect to gain additional conductor etch share in 2014.
Equally, our Process Diagnostics and Control group is demonstrating its growth potential. We gained 5 points of share in wafer inspection and 3 points in litho metrology in 2013. And this past quarter, the group delivered its second highest revenue on record. 
We continue to see strong customer pull for our inspection technology, particularly in defect review. We are extending our leadership in this market with the strong adoption of our new G6 e-beam review tool. This market is also one of the fastest growing segments, with customers using the G6 more extensively to solve defect problems as they ramp new foundry and memory device technologies.
Across the organization, we are focused on creating a strong pipeline of new highly differentiated products to enable future inflections in logic, memory and display. While we are making the required investments to grow, we are also driving superior financial performance. And as Bob will explain in a few minutes, we are making good progress towards our 2013 Analyst Day models.
We have reduced the impact of our solar business on our overall performance and expect our EES group will achieve breakeven or better performance for the year. We continue to strengthen the organization in many critical areas, attracting top talent in engineering and the field.
We are increasing our focus on high-value services for our large install base of tools. Our customers are planning to ramp challenging new devices in existing fabs. We see an opportunity to work with them to accelerate yield, improve performance and drive lower cost for these new device technologies. And we are driving improvement in performance, time, cost and quality across the company, so that we can execute better and be ready to effectively scale after we combine with Tokyo Electron.
In summary, as we approach the mid-point of the year, 2014 is playing out largely as expected, with global trends in mobility, connectivity and display, providing a strong foundation for customer investments in capacity and technology. We remain focused on applying our unique capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major technology inflections for our customers. We are driving profitable growth, gaining market share and making progress towards our long-term financial model.
Our preparations to combine with Tokyo Electron are accelerating, and we are incredibly excited by the opportunities this merger will bring for our customers, shareholders and employees.
Now I will hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.",1409,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q2 2014 Earnings Call, May 15, 2014",2014-05-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",4358.0,638156.0,28629983.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. We've been highly focused on investing to drive profitable growth over the short, medium and long term. We have also very tightly managed our spending to increase our product development in field technical support, while simultaneously driving for higher levels of profitability. 
As Gary discussed, we gained market share in 2013. This progress was made with limited leverage from the new and disruptive products that have been funded and are making their way through the development pipeline to our customers.
In fiscal 2014, we are on track for profitable growth. Compared to the same period in 2013, second quarter orders were up 16%, with SSG backlog at the highest level in the past 6 years. Revenue was up 19%. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was at the highest level in 6 years. Operating profit exceeded 20% for the first time in nearly 3 years, and earnings per share increased 75%, significantly outpacing revenue growth.
We continue to focus on margin improvement, even as we invest for growth. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 44.2%, up 1.7 points sequentially, including 0.5 point of onetime benefits. And we now expect to increase it by approximately 1.5 points in 2014, versus the prior year. 
R&D, as a percentage of net sales, has been running several points higher than in recent years. This is a headwind to our operating margins, which will become a tailwind as we introduce new and disruptive products in the future. Even with this higher level of investment, we are making progress towards our target operating model. All of our business segments delivered sequential operating margin improvement this quarter and the best performances in some time.
On a non-GAAP basis, SSG operating margins were the highest in 7 quarters, AGS' were the highest in 7 years, Display had its second-highest result in 10 quarters and EES was profitable for the first time in 2.5 years. By focusing on margin improvement, even as we invest for growth, we believe we can deliver approximately 5 points of non-GAAP operating profit expansion for the year.
Next, I'll provide more color on some of the changes in our Q2 results versus the prior quarter. Orders of $2.6 billion were up 15%, as growth in Display and SSG orders were partially offset by a decline in AGS orders, which reflected the seasonal timing of service contract renewals. Net sales of $2.4 billion were in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin of 44.2% grew 1.7 points, including 0.5 point of benefit from the partial recovery of a customs assessment charge we recorded in Q4 2013. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $559 million were within our guidance, and higher sequentially, due to the absence of Q1 shutdown savings and the addition of merit increases.
We expect quarterly OpEx to be about $555 million, plus or minus $10 million, for the remainder of the year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%, which was up from 22.5% in Q1. Both the quarterly rate and the expected annual rate have been impacted by a change in our forecasted regional revenue mix for the year. As a result, we expect the full year rate to be approximately 24%. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 was in the high end of our guidance. Cash from operations of $437 million, or 19% of revenue, grew 17%, reflecting higher profitability. We paid $122 million in dividends, and ended the quarter with cash and investments up $313 million, to $3.4 billion.
Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.7 billion were up 6%, with increases in DRAM and logic more than offsetting declines in foundry and NAND. SSG net sales of $1.6 billion were up 7%, in line with our expectations, as increases in DRAM and foundry offset decreases in NAND and logic. SSG non-GAAP operating margin increased 3 points, to 27.3%, on higher volume.
AGS orders of $537 million were down 10%, due mainly to the seasonal timing of service contract renewals. AGS net sales of $534 million were up 5%, in line with our expectations. AGS non-GAAP operating margin increased over 3 points, to 28.1%, driven by higher revenue, favorable mix and the recovery of customs assessment charges.
In Display, orders grew substantially to $340 million, reflecting large orders related to new TV facilities in China. These orders should result in revenue growth later in the year. Display net sales of $147 million were down 8%, in line with our expectations. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 point, to approximately 18%, reflecting operational improvements.
EES orders were $88 million, and net sales more than doubled to $88 million, in line with expectations. EES non-GAAP operating income was $7 million.
Now I will provide our third quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 5% sequentially. This range represents expected growth of 13% and 19% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be down 2% to 6%. This range represents expected growth of 17% to 22% year-over-year. 
AGS net sales should be flat to up 5%. We expect Display net sales to be down approximately 20%, and EES net sales should be up 5% to 10%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29. 
In summary, we are investing for profitable growth and are [ph] on track for year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability. We are very excited about our planned merger with Tokyo Electron, which will provide us with more strong products and technologies to enable our customers' roadmaps, a larger install base of systems to serve it, substantial economies of scale and a unique opportunity to return more value to our shareholders.
Applied and Tokyo Electron hope to see many of you in San Francisco on July 7.

I'll give you some data points on one. We did have some strong orders in the quarter for both SSG and Display, and we ended the quarter with our highest backlog in years. So that feels pretty good about, a little bit wind at our back. Positionally, we're doing very well as a company on these transitions, whether they be VNAND or finFET. There's been speculation or a couple of concerns, I think. One is some of the VNAND things may have pushed out. And I think there's a general consensus, a little less spending in the short term on that. Although, we see that as a very powerful longer-term trend. But on the other hand, we do see a serious commitment by our customers to getting their own finFET. So there might be a little bit of optimism coming on that in the intermediate term. And then I think specific to Applied, as I mentioned, we have a strong backlog. We have very strong Display wind at our back also for both TVs and the smaller displays, and the solar business is doing okay for us. So overall, I'd say there's a little bit of pushes and shoves.

So based on what we're seeing from customers and even some increase in demand, short term, from some customers, we see that business being pretty good for 2014. NAND demand is pretty strong. And again, we see that up. DRAM, we also believe, is up. Logic, we think, may be flat or down. But if you look at all of the different customers in the segments and you add it all up, based on what we're seeing, we're still in the range of the 10% to 20%.

Then you look within semi, we're making sustainable progress in some of the underlying things, which are the -- costs are somewhat down, the positioning is good, the new products are starting to appear. And then you have some mix issues that helped us a little bit on the quarter. And then we had a little bit less etch, and we had that one-time Korean thing.

We feel that the business environment is okay. I think it's not as big a concern as people say. We see pretty good strength in the second half. We see the finFET stuff okay. As Gary said, the foundry spending is more spread out. I think to get greater visibility into the mix, you got look below the top 3 guys. You got to look at all those other spenders, the next 4 or 5. And that strength year-on-year is more powerful than sometimes people focus on with the top 3. So I think the second half is okay. Traditionally, the last few years, the fourth calendar quarter tends to be a little bit bigger than the third calendar quarter, but it's a little too early to say.",141,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

We've had a really good start to 2014 in a number of different businesses. This last quarter was very good. And we look over the next 2 quarters, it's kind of hard to see beyond the next 6 months. The next 2 quarters also look pretty good for us. A major driver for the next few years is the transition customers are making in the foundry and memory to dramatically different device architectures with finFET and 3D NAND. These transitions are very good for us, really enabled by materials innovation, and we're optimistic that these transitions will grow our business and share as they happen. And beyond those leadership businesses, we're also seeing momentum in etch and PDC.

We're really happy about the progress we're making in conductor etch. We focused on investing in areas where we had the best opportunities to grow. And as we discussed, this is paying off. As we discussed earlier, with the 6 points of share gain last year. We've added great talent into the team. The level of excitement is tremendously high. In the second quarter, we had the highest conductor etch revenue in the last 7 years. And based on the interactions with customers, we believe that we'll have further conductor etch share wins this year and continue to grow share in 2014 and beyond. So very, very good momentum in conductor etch. Inspection, last quarter, we also had the second highest revenue quarter for PDC. And we anticipate 2014 could be a record year for this business. So very, very strong pull from customers in all segments, including inspection and defect review. I think one thing that people really maybe are not fully aware of is that we have leadership in e-beam review. We introduced the G6 e-beam review tool this year, very strong pull from customers, extending our leadership. And this is also one of the segments that is the fastest growing, as customers are focusing on how to solve defect problems as they make these major transitions in foundry and memory. So very strong growth in the market, in the total available market in e-beam review and very strong share position.

So interconnect scaling is really a major challenge for customers. They need to fill smaller and higher aspect ratio structures with good device performance and high yield. And this is getting really hard for future devices. So to address these issues, we developed the integrated cobalt liner and also a selectively deposited capping layer to enable customers to continue to use copper for future nodes. The cobalt liner is integrated on the same platform with our PVD chambers, which is a really great opportunity to expand our market in interconnect. And the capping layer is really a unique selective film similar to Epi, where we have a huge growing business in enabling new capabilities for customers. If you look at the size of the market, you have these 2 steps that will go across 5 different layers. So it's about 10 steps. And it's about a couple of million dollars for every 1K wafer starts roughly in terms of the size of the business. And this year in CVD, we anticipate this is going to be a strong, strong year. We anticipate gaining several points of share. And part of that is this new cobalt CVD film. So we anticipate very strong adoption in logic and foundry for really all of the customers.

Now there are challenges in that transition. And we actually have a very strong position in etch. That is really our strongest market segment, the planar and 3D NAND. And we have new applications that we're growing in that segment. We also have some unique technology that is focused on addressing the major challenges, yield challenges, that customers have as they're making this transition from planar to 3D NAND, some new deposition technology. So we really look at that being a really great opportunity. As we've talked about before, the switch from planar to 3D NAND is really focused on thermal deposition and etch products. And we've made a lot of investments in those areas. We see this is a great opportunity for us to grow share as these transitions happen. What we've said is that our available market grows 25% or 30% in the first-generation. And then, as you continue to scale the number of layers, as they drive bit scaling, that growth is even stronger for us. So we believe that we're in a very good position as that transition happens. Now it is a tough transition. But every single one of our customers are very focused, really, on technology buys to drive the development of that technology. Certainly, we see 2015, the spending ramping a fair amount above what we see in 2014. So most of the customers are really planning to ramp in '15 and '16.

Last week, SanDisk kind of talked about a 3D CapEx spend that would -- that seems to be targeting flat dollars off of their '14 spend level intentionally, talking about a longer period DRAM 3D. You've got Samsung this week talking about fully depleted SOI. I'm just kind of curious, as the economics start to become challenging and customers do things to extend nodes or slow progress, how does that impact kind of your view that you had at your Analyst Day in 2013 about a WFE number that can approach $37 billion?",127,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

So we are improving our profitability and our profile -- sorry, we are really driving improvements in our business model at $30 billion. So relative to the increasing CapEx spending, if you look at the planar to 3D NAND, more spending is in the areas that are -- where we participate and really, where we have enabling technologies. So you look at deposition etch and thermal processes, that CapEx is going up. And litho, as a percentage, is going down. So that is a really very good opportunity for us. The other thing I would say, just as I travel around and I visited pretty much all of the major customers in the last month or 2, the drive -- this is a real war for mobility leadership that's happening. So if you look at the memory area, the transition from planar to 3D NAND, it's a big bet [ph] that these different customers are focused on. And so they're all trying to get their first with the best technology. And the foundry competition is even more fierce because people are focused on driving low-power, higher performance, more features. And so you look at this battle that's going on, we absolutely see stronger pull from those customers and, as you said, that the CapEx does go up as they're moving to those new devices. Fortunately, for us, they are very heavily leveraged with our materials, precision materials engineering technologies. So the transitions are good for us. But it is a big battle and a big bet for all of these different customers as they go through this transition. So anyway, John, those are my thoughts.

We do see increasing capital intensity. We do see it playing well in the areas where we compete. We do see that our customers are competing in the things like finFET and VNAND are very powerful devices down the road. Now VNAND, when they go to second-generation, probably becomes more cost-effective than first generation. FinFET, will have to play out a little bit. More and more intriguing things are starting to pop up on the FinFET stuff too as the interconnect which we're talking about on the call. So how it all plays out commercially in a couple of years, I'm not sure. The other thing I think I've said during earlier call, John, we're managing the company to achieve significant levels of profitability of that $30 billion wafer fab equipment, so that we're very attractive company in terms of growing market share profitability at 30 to 37.",153,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

So the more foundry is growing, that's really great for us. And we have a great opportunity. As customers are introducing these new technologies, you have more Epi steps. You have a number of other areas that we talked about, the cobalt CVD, a lot of these technologies, we're seeing a broad adoption across all of these different customers.

You worry about all these things because it's a reasonably big deal. But in the end, it hasn't had a huge impact. There's a few things going on that touch on what Gary just said. We do very well at places like foundry because we're enabling technology. If you look at PVD for metal gates, you look at Epi, our products really help them solve, again, as Gary says, high value problems. So the benefit and value of our products is really high on foundries, and particularly at inflections around metal gates, finFETs and also, in inflections in VNAND, frankly. The inflection we're pursuing on DRAM is a little bit more on the periphery. So then, if you go to customers consolidating, we have strong share in all the foundries and are enabling technology.

If you think about what is happening with our customers in foundry and in memory and in logic, they are making major transitions in device technology. So as they're moving to finFET, as they're moving from planar to 3D NAND, as they're shrinking these devices, defects become a bigger issue, uniformity becomes a bigger issue, edge die yield, tool stability. So for our customers to extend our large install base of tools as they're making these transitions, they're really pulling on us more and more, and that really gives us an opportunity in AGS. The other thing is we really are making major changes in our organization to drive lower cost and also improve our ability in the parts business to grow that parts business, lower cost for customers and also, providing parts that do give lower defects, better uniformity.

Those -- that's the big picture. And we talked about significant growth in PVD and Epi, a number of different areas. And we really see that continuing. There really are more steps that are being added as the customers are trying to drive device scaling. And it is very hard for them to make these transitions. And really, more and more focus on materials innovation. So I would say that is the major theme for us. And that provides a very good environment over the next few years, as the customers ramp those new devices. Now within etch, we were fortunate last year that we had the 6 points of share gain in overall etch. And really, based on our gains in conductor etch and as I said earlier, we had last quarter the highest conductor etch revenue in 7 years. And we really have very strong pull from customers. Certainly, in NAND flash, we see that market being very strong. We are also -- we also anticipate that we'll grow our business in foundry this year. And in the other area that is an inflection is around selective material removal, where we have very strong products. And we see that technology continuing adoption as the customers are implementing these new device structures. So we really see a really great opportunity in etch for us to continue to grow in conductor etch. One of the things I talked about also is that we're not trying to boil the ocean. So we focused on the areas where we thought that we had the best opportunities. And certainly, we saw that conductor etch was a great opportunity.

Let me give you some color. So they're going to sort of these mega-fabs for a bunch of reasons. So if you look at the GeON fab, the total GeON fab is I think 220,000 wafer starts, but it can be with multiple phases. The total fab '14 build out eventually is over 200,000 wafer starts, I think. So these mega fabs, make it a little bit harder to count a greenfield fab because they do them in phases now. If you look at wafer starts, you probably have that data, that's a fair amount. Do you have the wafer starts? So if you look at -- we think 3D is up to about 80,000 by the end of the year. That's including just about 30 from last year. So wafer starts up a fair amount. Do you have foundry there? I think foundry's up quite a bit, too. But it's more about wafer starts than greenfield fabs I think.",164,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I just have a couple of follow-ups. The first one has to do with the breakdown of the backlog. Bob, I'm looking at your display backlog, it's up 65% Q-over-Q and up almost 30% year-over-year. And then, on SSG, backlog is down 7% year-over-year. How should we think about the margin profile, especially as some of these display equipments are shipped in the latter part of the year? And I'm asking you this because I'm under assumption that display margins are much lower than SSG. So if nothing happens or nothing dramatic happens to the SSG backlog, how does the larger mix of display is going to impact your overall margin?

Display backlog is up significantly. But year-on-year, I think the SSG backlog is also up. So we're in okay, pretty good shape on both. In terms of the mix, gross margins are higher, as you know, in SSG versus display. The display operating margins have been trending up reasonably well, so the gap isn't as big as it used to be. Third, the lead times for display equipment are much longer. So I don't think we're going to have a big bump in our operating margins in any given quarter because of unusual display disparities, either in operating margins or in huge volume of business. I think it'll be manageable.",116,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

And then one follow-up to your commentary about managing the business for WFE of $30 billion. Should I assume that your SSG operating margin would go back towards low 30%?

Now some people, including John earlier in the call, was worried that it wouldn't be a $37 billion environment. Our model, we showed also on that day was in a $30 billion environment. We're going to do about $22.5 billion. And so to make that model work between the $30 billion and the $37 billion, you need to have an improvement in SSG operating margin. As we said today earlier, across the whole company, if you look at our spending in an $8 billion revenue environment, which is 2004, '08 and sort of '12, '13, we're spending about 4 points higher as a company on R&D as a percentage of sales. And most of that is in SSG. So we expect not only that our spending as a percentage of sales will be more favorable, but we'll start to get growth in sales, especially in SSG, as this new products hit the market.

EES is now getting back into the black. We shifted a lot of money out of that. We've shifted a lot of money out of headquarters functions into the semiconductor R&D. So the operating margins, as you pointed out correctly, are lower. But the -- we really believe that those investments that we're making in SSG are important for our customers as they move to these new device technologies, finFET, first-generation, future generation, the interconnect technologies, new memory technologies. We really think those investments are important for our customers, for the industry. And we believe that we'll get a good return on those investments.

In our third fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high end of our guidance. We are demonstrating substantial progress toward our long-term financial model, having now improved operating margins for 7 quarters in a row. 
During the same period, we have stepped up our investment in research and development to create a pipeline of new product that will enable our customers' future success and drive long-term growth for Applied.
We are in the middle of the biggest changes in semiconductor and display technologies in decades, and these major technology transitions are enabled by materials innovation. This plays directly to Applied's unique capability in precision materials engineering. Our strong operating and financial performance is supported by sustained investment in capacity and new technology by our customers.
Across the company, we are building momentum for profitable growth. We have focused our strategy and investment in areas that have the largest impact for customers and generate the best returns for Applied. We are driving execution of our strategic plan by focusing on alignment and speed. And we are placing a significant emphasis on getting the organization ready to scale by ensuring that we have the right talent in the right areas.
The actions we are taking benefit us today and pave the way for rapid integration with Tokyo Electron. The merger with TEL accelerates our existing strategy by bringing together both companies' complementary strengths to create an expanded set of capabilities. This will enable us to be a higher value partner for customers by delivering more innovative products faster and at lower cost.
We are engaged in dialogues with regulators around the world, consistent with our goal of closing the merger before the end of the calendar year. During this phase, we have been advised not to provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussion.
Turning to our market outlook. Mobility and connectivity trends continue to drive significant growth and accelerate technology innovation in both semiconductor and display. 
In foundry, the broadening of spending this year and the build-out of the 28- and 20-nanometer nodes is fueling record performance for our transistor businesses. The next major focus for foundries is FinFET, and we believe this will provide a catalyst for a new wave of investment in 2015, as customers start to ramp this technology.
In memory, overall investment levels remained strong. NAND bit growth is expected to be around 40% this year. While the bulk of this incremental demand will be met by investments in advanced planar technology, customers are now publicly discussing their road map for 3D NAND to achieve cost parity with planar NAND. Based on what customers are telling us about their future investment, we believe the bit scaling advantages of 3D NAND, combined with performance improvement, will fuel 3D NAND spending in 2015 and beyond as more manufacturers move to this new technology. As we have said before, this transition to 3D materials-enabled devices is very positive for Applied, expanding our available market by 35% to 50%.
In DRAM, we see supply tightening. Lower-power mobile DRAM shipments are expected to grow about 60% this year. And in parallel, there are indications that an enterprise-driven PC refresh cycle is underway. As a result, DRAM investment is increasing. We expect technology conversion to provide the 30% bit growth needed this year while seeing strong potential for new capacity additions in 2015. We anticipate overall memory spending being up approximately 30% in calendar 2014. And in addition, we believe we will grow our share with memory customers by more than 2 points this year.
Looking at the market as a whole, we maintain our view that 2014 wafer fab equipment spending could be up 10% to 20% this year. We also believe that 2015 will be stronger than 2014, as the foundries ramp FinFET, more customers invest in 3D NAND and DRAM spending increases. 
In Display, 2014 is shaping up largely as expected, with strong investment in capacity and new technology. This is being driven by mobility, where higher resolution displays are becoming a major battleground for smartphones and tablet and TV, where average screen sizes are growing significantly faster than historic norms. In the past 2 quarters, we booked over $600 million of display orders, which is over $100 million higher than we expected at the start of Q2. 
In semiconductor and display, the major device technology changes that are taking place are enabled by materials innovation, and this provides a great opportunity for us. Over the past 18 months, we have aligned the company around our precision materials engineering strategy to drive growth at Applied Materials. Central to this strategy is the rapid development of enabling product, and we are very pleased with how our current portfolio and future pipeline are taking shape.
This quarter, our metal deposition product business delivered its highest revenue in 14 years. Epi, one of Applied's first products, posted its highest sales for any 12-month period in our history. Epi remains a key enabler for next-generation transistors, and we believe the applications for Epi technology will grow significantly in the future.
We are gaining share in both etch and CVD and expect our combined revenue in these markets to grow by approximately 40% in calendar 2014. 
We are also building traction with our selective material removal technology and now have tools at 5 large customers.
Across the company, we are driving actions that allow us to move faster and scale the organization. We are strengthening our teams and processes in the field, product development and operation. This is enabling us to see inflections first and deliver solutions to our customers faster. We are in the process of making changes to our structure to better align the field, R&D, service and operation while getting ready for our combination with Tokyo Electron.
To drive repeatable success, we have trained over 3,500 engineers and technologists across the company while investing in the development of our general managers and marketing capability. As technology transitions get harder for our customers, we are seeing strong pull for our service business. 
We have made significant changes in our service organization to deliver better device performance and yield, as well as more competitive cost for our customers as they ramp complex, new device technology. By building our capabilities in areas that help customers ramp new technologies faster and at lower cost, we anticipate AGS will deliver high single-digit revenue growth this year.
As Bob will explain in a few minutes, we are converting our focus on alignment, speed and scaling into superior financial performance. The progress we are making towards our 2016 financial model is driven by strong demand for our most enabling products in transistor and interconnect; improving performance in our businesses that are growing the most, including etch, CVD and display; and actions we have taken to limit our exposure to the downturn in the solar market.
To summarize, Applied has great opportunities, as we are uniquely positioned to apply our differentiated capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major technology transition. We are only at the beginning of these inflections. The ramps in FinFET, 3D NAND and new display technology will be the next of multiple waves of investment by our customers. We remain highly focused on execution to ensure that we can take full advantage of these opportunities and can rapidly scale the organization when we merge with Tokyo Electron.
Our teams around the company have already accomplished a great deal. The progress we are making towards our strategic and financial goals would not be possible without the hard work and passion of our global employees.
Now, Bob will provide additional details on our performance and outlook.",1285,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Aug 14, 2014",2014-08-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3313.0,684109.0,30335899.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. As Gary discussed, we have aligned the company around a growth strategy that is creating a pipeline of differentiated products to enable our customers' success as they make unprecedented technology transition. 
Before I get into the detail of our third quarter results, I'll spend a few minutes talking about our focus on execution and how this is translating and will continue to translate in stronger financial [indiscernible].
Let me provide some details about how we are executing better and faster in key areas [ph], how we are making sustainable improvements in our operating model and how these improvements are translating into stronger financial results. Here are a few examples of better, faster execution across the company. 
In SSG, market share gains are being helped by a significant reduction in our product development cycles. In AGS, we are driving profitability improvement with the introduction of new device performance and field service products and tighter alignment with SSG. In Display, we reduced our factory overhead costs and inflation cycle time. In EES, we expect to be above breakeven and cash flow-positive [indiscernible] the year. And for the company as a whole, we have been reducing our tax rates for the implementation of a more efficient tax structure [indiscernible]. 
Now let me give you some examples of the sustainable improvements we are making in our operating [indiscernible]. We have increased resource allocation to SSG and display, areas where we have superior opportunities to grow revenues and margin. Within SSG, we have increased our focus on the products that are most enabling to customers [ph] and where we have great opportunity to grow. These areas include Epi, CVD, etch, inspection and PVD. And we are relentlessly focused on reducing materials and overhead [indiscernible]. For the year, we're on target to achieve a 2% reduction in material [indiscernible]. 
Our strong execution is translating into improved financial [indiscernible]. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 gross margin was at a 6-year high, and our full year gross margin will be up 2 points, approaching 44%. Q3 operating margin was at a 3-year high. The full year results could be up by 6 points. The fiscal year tax rate could be down by 1 point or more and is making progress towards our 22% target. And operating cash flow was at a 3-year high. 
Our focus on execution, alignment and speed is translating into stronger financial results today, enabling us to make solid progress toward our long-term model and getting the organization ready for our combination with Tokyo Electron. 
Now I will provide more color on our third quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.5 billion were down 6% sequentially, driven by SSG orders, which tend to be seasonally slower this time of year [ph]. Compared to the third quarter of last year, orders were up 24%. And our book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1 for the seventh consecutive quarter. Backlog was almost $3 billion, with SSG backlog at a new 6-year high and Display backlog at a 5-year high. Net sales of $2.3 billion were near the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin increased to 45.5% in Q3, which included 0.8 points in non-recurring benefits. Even excluding these benefits, gross margin improved by 1 point [ph] [indiscernible]. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 was near the high end of our guidance. Our operating cash flow was $584 million or 26% of revenue. Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter.
SSG orders of $1.6 billion were down 6%, with decreases in DRAM and foundry, more than offsetting small increases [ph] [indiscernible]. SSG net sales of $1.5 billion were down 7%, slightly below our expectation due to some changes in the timing of customer fab. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin increased 1.4 points to 28.7%, reflecting favorable mix. SSG's operating margin performance was at the highest level in almost [indiscernible] years. 
AGS orders of $552 million were up 3% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. AGS net sales of $567 million were slightly higher than expected, an increase of 14% [indiscernible]. AGS non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 27.2% and remained near the highest level in 7 years [ph]. 
Display orders of $296 million were the second-highest in the past 6 years [ph]. Display net sales of $119 million declined, in line with our expectation. While backlog grew at very high levels, in anticipation [indiscernible]. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased by over 4 points to 22%, including a benefit from the sale of some previously reserved [indiscernible]. Display's operating margin was the highest in the past 3 years [ph]. 
EES orders were $66 million. Net sales increased to $103 million. EES non-GAAP operating income was $25 million, including the benefit of favorable litigation outcome. 
Now I will provide our fourth quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat, plus or minus 3%. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be down 1% to 7%. AGS net sales were flat to up 4% [ph]. We expect display net sales to be up over 60%, and EES net sales should be down approximately 35%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 44%, which would be up almost 2 points year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million, plus or minus [indiscernible]. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 25% to [indiscernible].
In summary, our strong financial performance and the progress we are making towards our long-term model is being supported by sustained investment by our semiconductor and display customers; our precision materials engineering strategy, which is focused on enabling major technology transitions for our customers [ph]; and our focus on improving execution, alignment and speed.

There's a couple of new DRAM fabs that are being built out, and, of course, there's a much discussed build-out from one of the other foundries, who's trying to play a little bit of catch-up on FinFET. Could you guys give us a little bit of perspective on the timing for new orders for those projects? I know, in particular, on the foundry project, different equipment suppliers have seen those orders at different times. So I'm wondering how much of that is still on the come versus how much of that you might have already seen, and then same thing on the DRAM side.",108,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think that you had commented at SEMICON that it was the highest gross margin -- quarterly gross margin in 6 years, then you guys did another nice bump-up this quarter. What are the biggest incremental drivers of gross margin from here? Is it just volume, mix or lower component costs?

Bob, I wanted to ask about the performance of the company this calendar year versus what your financial model is. And I understand that the financial model is a 2016 model, so maybe the answer is just time. But this year, you're going to do with like -- WFE is sort of in the low-30s, maybe it's $32 billion, I think, is what you guys are now saying. You're going to do somewhere in the $1.10 range, if you assume that the January quarter is not like heroically up or down. And your financial model has you doing $1.50 at $30 billion WFE. So my question is, what is going to happen or sort of what has to happen to get from where you are this year to where the financial model says you'll be?

I didn't know if it's $1.50 at $30 billion, frankly. This year, it's about a $31.6 billion to $31.9 billion WFE. So if you look at -- we got a gain [ph]. We said in the model we're going to get to 19.9% wafer fab equipment in SSG. We ended last year at 19.1%. We haven't forecasted it this year. But the year before, it's 17.7%; we gained [ph] 1.4% through last year in wafer fab equipment. We continue to be optimistic that we'll get to the 19.9% [indiscernible] model. The second thing is gross margins. I think at the $30 billion model, we were at like 44%, 45%. In the quarter just ended, we did 45.5%. This year, we'll probably be about 44%. So it's a little higher volume, $31.6 billion versus the $30 billion model. So we're actually getting there. OpEx, I think, in the $30 billion -- I'm doing this from memory, Tim.

Just a little 450 [ph] spend in our numbers and then we've got some managed expenses and inflation a little bit, so we're off [ph] about 100 [ph]. Tax rate, we said, would be 22% in that model.

Q2 is like $30 billion. And then most companies, including you guys, are sort of guiding Q3 down just a touch. So maybe you're sort of in the $30 billion range.

As you're going vertical to the taller 3D types of structures with the tighter design rules, that's where you start seeing the current technologies running out of gas and an opportunity for us to implement the selective removal technology.

One, I think -- the revenues, I was actually, in hindsight, in SSG, relatively pleased. We had strong bookings. Revenues were a little under what we thought, but there were things that transpired in the quarter that happened there that we managed it pretty well. And then if you look at our peers, our guide and our actuals sort of our second quarter, our third quarter and even our third quarter through our fiscal fourth quarter, we compare pretty well, actually. So the revenues in SSG and the company are holding up okay. If you look within SSG revenue mix model, which you're asking on the margin, we're making some progress in most of the products and some margin, cost reduction, efficiency, selling more upgrade products. It's all of the execution things you think about every day. So the gross margins are trending up a little bit. Now what we're very optimistic about is the money we've invested last year, last couple of years, really, in R&D and SSG because we put a heavy weighting of that this year on 300-millimeter products versus 450 last year.

And what we see in both the FinFET and 3D NAND is a real strong transition to both the FinFET as a percentage of that spending and also 3D NAND as a percentage of the NAND flash spending. So in both cases, we think that the spending for those new technologies are going to be around 50%. And as we've said before, that's very positive for us because we have great products in enabling new transistor technologies. And 3D NAND is really materials-enabled versus litho-enabled. So it's very heavy in areas where we have a very strong position. So in both cases, we see about half of the spending next year being those new technologies.

What we've done to date is we've done a lot of good blocking and tackling with places like EES, where we have -- get the cost down, get -- run it back at a rate in business and raise gross margin [ph] that contribute to the company. If you look at display, it reduced their overhead costs and getting valuable products. The whole mix of things have done well. If you look at AGS, trended up a little bit with gross margins there, too. So it's all of the blocking and tackling across the company. So you can't pick a heroic thing, you just look at good blocking-and-tackling and execution and a broad range of activities. Within SSG, specifically, where you're talking about, there's things -- blocking and tackling probably helped us some. The second thing that helps and hurts periodically in the quarter is just mix of the individual products. So we're actually gaining share in etch, which we talked and we're very pleased with. But the gross margins are a little bit lower in these early etch tools. And it's not pricing, it's just etch is always a little bit lower for us the last 20 years. So the mix within quarters, once [indiscernible], the systemic thing in SSG, the blocking and tackling is getting better, new products are coming, which will help SSG, you have timing mix quarter-to-quarter, which is a plus or minus.

I mean, if you think of some of the stuff we pulled onetime today, whether it's the display tools we [indiscernible] the money on, the inventory we pulled in solar, EES, the -- some of the stuff in the customs audit in Korea, there's just a lot of good blocking and tackling across a wide range of people in the company, and it feels like it's building momentum. That's a good thing. In terms of higher-level principles, we are taking more strategic view of the supply chain, I think, in terms of the ramp, IP, costs and sourcing opportunities. I think we're starting to subsegment our supply base into people who have high IP versus low-cost opportunity. I think we're tackling that a little bit [indiscernible]. I think if you look at our new products, as we're going to ship new products, we're taking a deeper view of the IP opportunities in those new products. We have sustainable differentiation ourselves.

In our fourth quarter, Applied Materials delivered revenue and earnings at the midpoint of our target range. This rounds out a strong year for Applied, where we grew sales in our semiconductor business by 25%, and expanded our overall operating margins by 6 points. These results reflect ongoing technology and capacity investments by our semiconductor and display customers, sustainable market share gains in growing markets and significant improvements in our operating performance that we've achieved while increasing investment in new product development.
Our progress towards our strategic and financial goals is made possible by outstanding contributions from our employees around the world. This is a team with tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors.
Over the past 2 years, we have placed Applied on a trajectory of long-term profitable growth and improving financial performance. In 2013, we aligned the business around our precision materials engineering strategy and took steps to shape a more competitive company. We increased our focus on areas that have the biggest impact for customers and generate the best returns for Applied. We shifted spending from low-growth businesses and corporate functions to field resources and product development. We built a stronger organization, bringing in top industry talent, strengthening our business processes for repeatable success and changing our structure to improve alignment and speed. We increased our market share with 1.4 points of overall gains in calendar 2013, and we invested in a pipeline of new products to enable our customers' roadmaps and drive long-term growth for Applied. In 2014, we accelerated this strategy and made strong progress towards our financial model. Our semiconductor business posted the highest revenue since fiscal 2007. And for the calendar year, we expect to gain share or hold share in almost all of our businesses.
We anticipate our largest gains in areas of the market that are growing the fastest. In CVD, we believe we will win at least 3 points of share this year. And in etch, we are on track to deliver almost 2.5x the sales achieved in 2012. These results demonstrate that we have the right strategy and the right team, that we are improving our execution and carrying strong momentum into 2015.
Our merger with Tokyo Electron will enable us to further accelerate this strategy. The detailed plans to bring the 2 companies together are now very well advanced. Our joint integration team is working closely together to make the merger a success, and the progress they've made has far exceeded our expectations.
In terms of the regulatory process, we have been advised to not provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussions. However, I'm pleased to report that the German Competition Authority notified us today that we have received its unconditional approval for the proposed business combination. We are working hard to obtain the remaining approvals as soon as we can. However, we acknowledge that the closing could move into the first quarter of next year.
Turning to our market outlook. Consumer demand for new and better mobile devices with more features and longer battery life remains the primary driver for the semiconductor industry. This is fueling strong foundry investment in leading-edge technology.
Overall, foundry spending in 2014 is on track for 20% to 25% growth year-over-year, and these high spending levels are expected to be sustained in 2015. This year, almost half of the foundry spending was focused on 20 nanometer, and the build-out of this node is nearly complete at the leading customers. 2015 is shaping up to be the year of a FinFET leadership battle, and we anticipate strong investment from our customers as they focus on winning this critical transition.
Memory spending has also been robust in 2014, and we expect higher investment levels next year. NAND bit growth is around 40% this year, driven by increasing bits per box for new mobile devices and strong demand for solid-state storage. The bulk of incremental supply has been provided by advanced planar technology.
In 2015, spending on 3D NAND is expected to be broader and larger, although still not to surpass planar investment until 2016. DRAM investment was stronger than expected at the start of the year, driven by mobile and an enterprise-led PC replacement cycle. DRAM bit growth is around 30%, and with this demand being primarily met by technology conversions. In 2015, we expect supply to remain tight with strong potential for new capacity additions.
Looking at wafer fab equipment as a whole. We maintain that 2014 spending will be up 10% to 20% over 2013. Our current view is that 2015 wafer fab equipment will be higher, driven by the foundry FinFET battle, more customers investing in 3D NAND and increasing DRAM spending.
In addition, over the last 12 months, wafer starts and fab utilization have increased, a trend that we expect to continue in 2015. As the customers aggressively push factory output, we see expanded opportunities for our AGS business. The outlook for the display equipment market also remains very healthy. Attractive price points for 4K TVs are driving a TV refresh cycle, while average screen sizes are growing around twice as fast as historic rates. Demand for higher-resolution, lower-power screens for mobile devices is also a key factor in display, and we are seeing strong LTPS orders for this market. Our quarterly display revenues are at a 3-year high, and we believe we're on track to gain share in our served available market this year.
In both semiconductor and Display, major changes in device technology provide a catalyst for our growth. As we've said before, FinFET and 3D NAND represent the biggest technology transitions in decades. These complex inflections are enabled by materials innovation, and that plays directly to Applied's strengths. They create new precision materials engineering steps, expand our available market and fuel strong demand for our enabling leadership products in transistor and interconnect.
For example, our Epi business posted record sales for the fiscal year. Our metal deposition group delivered its highest annual revenues and operating margins since 2000. And we believe our implant group is on track to reach its highest ever market share.
In logic and memory, the acceleration of materials-enabled scaling is a major driver for etch and deposition. These are large growth opportunities for Applied, where we are building strong momentum and gaining share. We now expect our combined revenues in etch and CVD to grow by almost 50% in calendar 2014.
We see strong customer pull for our next-generation technologies. At SEMICON West, we announced 5 new products that are rapidly gaining traction, and we have now shipped more than 300 of these chambers.  We have also been making improvements to our service and spares business to better support customers as they quickly ramp these new device technologies at the right yield and cost. Our service organization is building momentum and in fiscal 2014, delivered the highest orders and the highest operating margins since 2007.
In summary, for Applied Materials, fiscal 2014 was a year when we grew faster than our markets and made significant progress towards our strategic and financial goals. We accelerated our product momentum and strengthened the organization in key areas.
Looking forward to 2015. We expect a year of industry growth, where we are uniquely positioned to apply our capabilities in precision materials engineering and outgrow the industry. In order to take full advantage of the great opportunities ahead, we remain highly focused on improving execution.
Let me now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional details about our performance and explain the steps we are taking to drive alignment, speed and scale across the organization. Bob?",1279,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6
251230.0,"Applied Materials, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Nov 13, 2014",2014-11-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Applied Materials, Inc.",3600.0,730790.0,32159097.0,Presenter Speech,Bob Halliday,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Gary. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year improvements across many areas of our business and achieved our guidance for revenue and EPS. Since this is the end of our fiscal year, let me begin by framing 2014 in the context of where we have been and where we are going.
We continue to believe that the market environment looks good, particularly for Applied Materials, and remains good for some time. This environment gives us a great opportunity to make money and efficiently return it to investors. There are 3 levers to making more money in our industry: first, understand customers' high-value problems and develop disruptive new products, as Gary described; second, achieve scale around our opportunities. We are doing this by focusing on our biggest opportunities in SSG and Display, winning share and merger with Tokyo Electron; and third, relentlessly grind away on efficiency, execution and cost.
In 2013, we shifted money to our biggest growth opportunities, primarily in SSG and Display. We also gained share in the overall WFE market, primarily by focusing on key battlegrounds, customer support and rapid product iteration. Our new and disruptive products were still early in the development stage.
In 2014, we further accelerated our funding of products that give us the greatest opportunities for growth. For example, we increased the combined funding of our conductor etch and CVD opportunities at 3x the rate of our overall investment. This past year, we began to see strong momentum from these products, as our combined revenue in conductor etch and CVD grew by 60% in fiscal 2014.
Thanks to our employees' efforts, we also kept grinding away on efficiency, execution and cost. For example, in 2014, we shifted an additional $200 million from our corporate functions and lower-return programs to fund our strongest opportunities in 300 millimeter and emerging technologies. We also achieved our 2% of materials cost savings for the year. As a result, we began to see signs of progress toward the target financial model we introduced in 2013. In fiscal 2014, the company recorded revenue of $9.1 billion. Excluding solar, this was the highest company revenue in 7 years, which demonstrated our strong momentum in SSG, Display and AGS.
On a non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin to 44.1%, which was a 7-year high. This gross margin for the year did benefit from 0.5 point of non-run rate items. We increased operating margin by 6 points even as we maintained elevated R&D investments in our new product pipeline. We also achieved a 3-year high in both operating margin and net income. Our tax rate of 22.7% declined by 1.8 points as we implemented our more efficient structure, and we boosted our earnings by over 80% to $1.07 per share.
Now let's take a look at some of our 2014 segment results. SSG revenue grew by 25% to the highest level in 7 years. NAND orders were also at a 7-year high. In AGS, orders were at a 7-year high, which reflects customer pull for advanced service offerings enabled by our tighter collaboration between SSG and AGS. AGS operating margin was the highest since 2007.
In Display, orders achieved a 6-year high as the group took advantage of technology inflections and panel-size increases in the TV and mobile display markets. The Display group gained share and increased its operating margin to its highest level since 2011. EES generated a modest profit for the first time since the solar downturn.
Now what do see entering 2015? Our industry outlook is positive, and while it is too early to know the effects of timing and mix, we expect continued year-over-year growth and progress toward our target model. In 2015, we plan to introduce some of the new and disruptive products from our product pipeline investments. These products will drive share gains in 2015 and over time, but have lower margins initially. In 2015, we are working to further improve our gross margin even with aggressive new product ramps. In the first quarter, we expect gross margins to be lower sequentially, primarily due to share gains in our conductor etch business. Specifically, we expect our etch revenue to grow by almost 60% sequentially in Q1. We expect to increase our gross margins from Q1 through the balance of 2015. Overall, 2015 provides us with a further opportunity to systematically gain share in the fastest growing markets; drive scale in semiconductor display and services, both standalone and in combination with Tokyo Electron; and grind away at execution, efficiency and cost to improve the profitability of the company.
Now I will provide more color on our fourth quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were down 9% sequentially, with decreases primarily in SSG and Display, partially offset by an increase in AGS. Net sales of $2.3 billion were in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased to 44.2%, which included a 0.5 point of non-recurring benefits. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 was in line with our guidance. Our operating cash flow was $407 million or 18% of revenue.
Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.3 billion were down 15%, with decreases in memory and foundry more than offsetting increases in logic and other. SSG net sales of $1.4 billion were down 3%, in line with expectations. AGS orders of $747 million were up 35%, led by service contracts, and were the highest since 2007. AGS net sales of $592 million were better than expected. Display orders declined to $130 million, and we expect the pattern to remain lumpy. Display net sales of $190 million were up 60% as we began to ship the large orders received in the last 6 to 9 months. This quarterly revenue performance is also a 3-year high. EES orders were $44 million, and net sales were $48 million.
Now I will provide our first quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to up 5% sequentially. Our normal seasonal pattern would be for revenue to increase in our second quarter. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be approximately flat. AGS net sales should be down by a couple of points.
We expect Display net sales to be up by about 40% and EES net sales should be up by about $20 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 43%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $560 million, plus or minus $10 million, which includes 1 month of annual merit adjustments and the holiday shutdown. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29.
In summary, 2014 was a year of growth and improved profitability across all of Applied, including 25% revenue growth in SSG and 6 points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement for the whole company.

How -- understanding you're ramping new products, which are a little bit lower margin, and there's some share gain in some lower-margin areas and also, that that's a 2016 model, not a 2015 model, it does look like we'll be at, at least $33.5 billion in WFE in 2015 now. So how much lower than that 2016 model do you think we'd be in 2015 if we do get to the $33.5 billion, given the pushes and pulls on the target model?",110,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Let me walk through it little bit. If you go look at the revenue line, we're actually making pretty good progress on the SSG share. We were probably, a year ago, a little behind on the AGS business, but we're picking up now. We had one of our strongest orders quarters ever. I think we're making real headway. So as you look through '15, '16, I can see reasonable revenue growth there. So we're going to get closer to the model and feel better there. The Display business is doing great, so that feels good. We got market share opportunities there. We're gaining. We have new products, so there's a lot of momentum there. And solar is even picking up a little bit. So I think the revenue line versus '16 is in the ballpark. Some of the new growthy stuff, we got to manage, but that's kind of lower-margin stuff, too. So the rev line's okay. Gross margin, we're kind of ahead of plan last year a little bit. So if you look at the $33.5 billion, I think we're supposed to be like 44.5%, I think, gross margin. We did about 44.1% on the year last year, up from about 40.9% back in '12, the base year. So I think we'll hit the gross margin model, maybe do a little better if we're lucky. So we'll do better I think. And then on expenses, we're a little bit above the expense line right now. I think we're going to work to manage that. We're investing real heavily in products, which drive the revenue line. If you look at where we're spending money, it's all in investment areas, not so much in overhead or cost areas. So overall, I'd say we're in the ballpark. The tax rate, we're making good progress. We should -- we hit 22%. We're probably -- might be a little bit of opportunity there. So net-net, we're in the ballpark. And we got a bunch of cash that we haven't done buybacks with, so the share count will come down, too.",352,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I appreciate that. For the follow-up, relative to the AGS orders, they were up a lot in the October quarter, and I think you said revenue would be down a little bit in that segment in the January quarter. Is that just kind of a seasonal uptick in orders in AGS? Or is there more of a structural component to that as well in terms of the big uptick in orders?",76,6.0,4.0,0.8333333333333334,0.4

I think, really, 2 areas of focus for us within AGS. One is the value that we provide for our customers. And there's been huge improvement in helping our customers get -- providing value for our customers as they ramp these new device technologies. You look at the FinFET or 3D NAND, these are really tough transitions. And getting the tools to the defect level they need to be, uniformity, stability, to the entitlement that the tools are capable of achieving, is really huge value to our customers. So we've actually seen an uptick in our contract revenue. We're combining labor and parts, and that's more sustainable from a service perspective. And there's been a huge focus on the value in helping our customers move through those transitions. The other thing is we're really driving cost. We're driving cost from a parts perspective, labor delivery perspective. So that combination, we think, the value as our customers are moving through these tough transitions and are driving and lowering cost, we think it creates a great combination for sustainable growth in the service business that, frankly, we didn't achieve in the past. But we're pretty optimistic that we can keep driving that going forward.",203,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

When I look at the SSG revenue, it's probably growing somewhere in the low teens. I'm kind of curious, if you're gaining share, where is the disconnect? Is it because rev rec is going to take a while? Or is there something else happening? And then I had a follow-up.",68,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

If you look at it overall wafer fab equipment share, last year, we gained 1.4%. What we said is SSG revenue's up 25% in -- from fiscal year to fiscal year. We haven't given any color certainly in terms of the calendar year. But I also had said earlier that we were pretty optimistic about wafer fab equipment increasing next year and that we would outgrow the industry. So if you look at the data points, kind of what's driving market share, these major technology transitions with FinFET and the memory transitions are really good for us relative to the TAM growth. We have TAM growth in those areas, very strong products. You see this in the foundry business with the record Epi sales, the metal deposition, the implant share. A number of those areas are extremely strong. And really -- so if you look at that, as customers are transitioning to these new transistors, these new FinFET devices, that's good for us. And also, in memory, we are also very well positioned. The etch and CVD share gains this year are going to create momentum for us going forward. As I talked about earlier, we have about 50% revenue growth in etch and CVD that we anticipate this year, and that provides, really, a great opportunity for us. So as these technology transitions happen going forward, we think we can build on the momentum that we have right now.",241,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Overall, what we see for 2015 is still continued strong foundry investment and really heavily weighted to the FinFET transition for customers. That's a really big battle for all of the different companies. We're also seeing some really strong pull even into 10-nanometer pilot. That's a small amount, but really focused on these technology transitions is really, we believe, will sustain strong foundry investment in 2015. Looking at memory investment as being up next year. And so we -- that, we believe, will be a positive, and then logic, we think, is relatively flat versus '14. On the question on first half, second half, we're not really giving any guidance on first half, second half, unless Bob wants to do that. But what we do see is 2015 up.

The -- it really is a huge focus. Every one of our customers in terms of coming out with lower-power, higher-performance devices, but power is a big driver, and so FinFET is a huge focus for every one of our customers. We -- there's always this war for mobility leadership.

On the foundry investment, we think over 50% is going to be for sub-20 nanometer. And as I said earlier, that is a huge battleground for all of our customers. And there's some spending even all the way down to 10 nanometer on the pilot that is being pulled in by some of our customers. In NAND flash, the 3D NAND ramp has been slower than what we had anticipated. This year, the majority of the investment has been for planar NAND. And where we're looking at right now, we still think that in 2015, that the majority of spending will be in planar NAND technology, and the transition to 3D NAND in terms of majority of the CapEx, we think, is more in 2016. What we do see from customers and talking to multiple customers is very good performance with 3D NAND technology. And also, the potential for bit scaling in 3D NAND is pretty significant. It is a tough technology transition, so it's happening slower than I think some of the customers had anticipated. But still, from a performance and cost standpoint, there are very good reasons to make that transition, but we think that one is more in the 2016 time frame, where that becomes the majority of the CapEx spending.",215,-2.0,6.0,0.3888888888888889,0.6

Relative to both of those different markets, the gains for us are weighted, I would say, a little bit more in terms of memory than it is in the other market segments. We have very strong growth, as I talked about earlier. The etch revenue we're forecasting for 2014 is up 2.5x where we were 2 years ago, so very significant growth in terms of etch. And as I had mentioned earlier also, the combined revenue growth for etch and CVD in calendar 2014 is around 50%, we believe, those areas will grow. And we made -- as Bob talked about earlier, we made a lot of investments in new products, and those new products are really helping drive the share gains in both of those different markets. We're very well positioned as our customers are transitioning to new technologies. Part of the gross margin pressure also that Bob talked about is really significant ramp. We talked about 300 chambers for new products that we announced at SEMICON West that we're shipping and really significant growth in those new products right now, which is great from a share standpoint, really positions us well around those technology transitions, providing some gross margin pressure as we're introducing these products to new customers.

I was kind of joking with the guys around here that sometimes we're off on timing, but let's be right -- let's be on the -- we could be on the wrong side of timing once in a while, but let's be on the right side of inevitability. So if you look at the opportunity for us, it's really big on inflections. That's where you make penetration. So if you look at inflections, we've talked about flash storage [ph] around FinFETs, VNAND, very positive for us because that's where we push through the windows with those tools. So if you look at etch and CVD, we're making a lot good progress, gaining a lot in memory, in particular on inflections. And in fact, if the VNAND had been a little more robust this year, we might have gained up to another 0.5 point of WFE this year. So that means it wasn't quite as robust this year, but everybody says it's coming, right? Is it '15, '16? But kind of on the right side of the inflection, right? So -- and then within the specific question you asked about etch and CVD, etch is making great progress. Look at the numbers, up a lot, up in Q1. And the other thing is if you look at -- and memory is where the revenues are, but we're making good progress in qualification at more complicated places like foundries, too. So again, going back to timing and inevitability, if you get the penetrations, get the market share, get the products right, you can also get the gross margins right over time. So you want to be on the right side of the trends, the inflections, the inevitability of these things and then grind out cost and profitability stuff, and that's what we're doing.",312,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I kind of think -- I'll go offline for a second. I kind of think we historically thought like equipment guys. We didn't think about the aftermarket, so we got much tighter alignment between the 2 groups this year. They shared bonus plans. They co-located. And you're starting to see real momentum with the teams. So I think getting people to work closely together, shared objectives, think about the service business has been a big plus. And I think they're just starting to turn the corner on that. I mean, you're starting to see the numbers. We saw it in the behavior, the tight relationships. So what are they tactically doing? They're doing some lower-cost sourcing. They're also doing some much more service contracts. You get sticky service revenues.

So that will -- that is sustainable, and we really think that we're in the early phases of what we can do there. As Bob said, we've reorganized the service groups so that there's a tighter connection between the SSG business units with our service teams to really focus on, as we're ramping Epi for FinFET or the CVD products for deposition on a VNAND type of device, so the VNAND stack, these are tough processes. So to the extent that we can have service together with our business units and a tighter alignment, as customers are moving through these transitions, defects are harder. Uniformity is harder. Stability is harder, all of these different things. And certainly, they're very focused on cost. So that focus on value is really changed, and the alignment between the groups is much better.

So on the OpEx, I'll say what I said at the beginning -- almost exactly a year ago this time. We tend to have a little bit of OpEx pressure early in the year because we give everybody a raise on the same date in early January. So we got about almost a month of that in this quarter, and then we have 3 months of it in the following quarter. And we do have the benefit of the shutdown in this quarter, and we're not planning it on into the second quarter. So there's a little bit of OpEx increased pressures typically for us in Q2. So we have to manage that. But I feel like there's a little bit upward pressure there, and we have to manage it to get within a tolerable range. The other thing is we have a lot of new products coming out, so that's driving the top line growth. In fact, give you more color on that, we think there's an excellent chance that we're going to gain -- grow revenue in every one of our segments last -- next year in '15. But we really have a lot of new products coming out. We have the R&D pipe, and even in AGS, there's some investments in revenue growth. So what's the point? I think expenses have a little bit upward pressure through the year. Part of it's the raises. Part of it's the number of new products coming out. So we have to work on that. In terms of the operating margins, EPS, as you start to get these products, and if you're in a decent WFE environment and we're making progress on the lines below that, including tax, we're starting to knock on the door, getting those higher numbers in terms of EPS.",303,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Are you going to see a broadening of your customer base, the number of players participating in the foundries in '15, do you believe, over '14? And if so, what kind of impact would that have on your overall share in the space?",58,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

We have many of the transistor and interconnect-enabling technologies. That's really driving our Epi, our metal deposition, implants, some of the areas that we talked about earlier that were extremely strong. So foundry spending is really very good for us. We have very good share in really all of the different foundries, so there's not a tremendous difference from one to the next. We do see some broadening relative to the investment in 2015, but the key thing for us, and as we've talked about before, especially in FinFET, as FinFET ramps, our total available market opportunity goes up 25% to 35%. And those are the areas where we have many leadership products. So that is very, very good for us from a growth perspective.",134,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Edwin Mok,,Analysts,72,"So first question on -- just clarification on the commentary about higher memory spending in 2015. Is it mostly driven by DRAM growth that you talked about and less so from NAND? And is that more to do with just, call it, timing of the 3D NAND spending more like in terms [indiscernible] ? I'm just trying to understand if there's more DRAM, less NAND. Or is it pretty balanced for you in 2 buckets?",75,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

In both cases, we see memory spending up next year. As I said earlier, the 3D NAND transition is happening slower than we anticipated, so we see incremental investment in planar NAND. 3D NAND is broadening and is increasing in 2015, but we see both the NAND and DRAM investment up in 2015.",71,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Edwin Mok,,Analysts,74,"And then just kind of going back to etch. I'm trying to understand how much of that is just TAM expansion. It sounds like there's always a little bit more option maybe [ph] there? And I think you mentioned that at least initially, you guys have stronger position in memory, which helped you in etch. I'm thinking your product is -- have higher productivity than your competitor and that is one differentiation. Is that a big driver for customer to adopt that? And is that because -- because, I think, historically, memory customers tend to be more cautious there. Is that -- is productivity a big issue the customer is facing and you guys are able to win on that?",120,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

I think, productivity -- overall cost of ownership is a big focus for everybody with more patterning steps. That's certainly a big focus. We actually have in the new products some very strong technology. If you look at areas like microloading, for instance, we've -- we have some very good capability there. CD uniformity is always a big issue for our customers. So we are seeing, not only on the cost of ownership side but also on the technology side, some really good opportunities for us to grow the business. We've strengthened that team a tremendous amount. It's really an outstanding group, tremendous passion in solving problems for customers -- high-value problems for customers. And as Bob talked about, we've increased investment there, both in R&D for the new products that are ramping now and in the field technical support. So we see very good pull. Certainly, in memory, we are gaining in logic, and we see pull on cost but also on the technology side.",167,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5
