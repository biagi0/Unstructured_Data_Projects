Good afternoon, everyone. Well, we delivered strong financial results for the first quarter, with revenue of $4.15 billion and gross margin at 62.4%, both at the very top end of our guidance. Earnings per share of $3.63 grew by 5% sequentially, while net revenue was essentially flat. Revenue was better-than-expected in all 4 segments. The benefits we achieved through business diversification clearly came through this quarter, with growth in wired, enterprise storage and industrial completely offsetting the typical negative seasonality from wireless. The integration of classic Broadcom has gone very well and is now mostly complete. We remain focused on driving financial performance towards our long-term operating margin and free cash flow targets.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results, starting with wired, our largest segment. In the first quarter, wired revenue came in at $2.09 billion, better-than-expected, and represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up slightly on a sequential basis. We benefited from strong demand for our Ethernet switching and routing product from cloud data center operators. This growth was partially offset by the continuing seasonal decline in demand for our broadband carrier access and set-top box products, which we expect to bottom in this first quarter.
Turning to the second fiscal quarter. We forecast wired revenue to experience sequential growth, a little bit stronger than we what we saw in the prior quarter. We expect the momentum from cloud data center demand to sustain, and expect the seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products.
Now moving on to wireless. In the first quarter, wireless revenue came in at about $1.18 billion, better-than-expected, and the wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was down 13% sequentially, driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from our major North American customer.
Turning now to our projection for the second quarter of fiscal '17. We expect to hit the bottom of the annual product cycle transition at a major North American customer. However, we expect to offset the significant portion of this decline in wireless from a ramp of the next-generation phone at our large Korean smartphone customer. This phone comes with an increase in Broadcom's RF and WiFi connectivity content. As a result, we expect our wireless revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '17 to be still sequentially down but in the high single digits, better than the most difficult double-digit declines we have experienced in prior years.
Let me now turn to enterprise storage, which continues to be strong. In the first quarter, enterprise storage revenue came in at $707 million, and this segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Segment revenue grew 26% sequentially, came in better than expected, driven by stronger shipments of SaaS, RAID and Fibre Channel products. As we foresaw, our hard disk drive and custom solid-state drive controllers also had a very strong quarter. And looking into the second quarter, however, we believe this resurgence of enterprise storage has to taper off and hence, flatten out. Having said that, backlog for enterprise storage products continues up to today to be very strong. But we foresaw -- but we foresee seasonality to start slowing demand in the third quarter if not in this -- late in the second quarter.
Finally, turning to our last segment, industrial. In the first quarter, industrial revenue grew -- came in at $180 million, up 11% sequentially, better-than-expected as we rebuild depleted channel inventory, consistent with stronger product refits. The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue. And as we look into the second quarter, we are anticipating industrial activity to continue to improve seasonally and accordingly, we are expecting industrial segment revenue to increase by high single digits sequentially.
With all that, to sum up -- to simply sum up, this first quarter was strong, with revenue flat from the seasonally high fourth quarter of the preceding year. As we now look into the second quarter, we expect the demand environment for our products to continue to be very healthy and our outlook for this quarter's revenue to be virtually flat to that of the prior quarter. It is becoming evident that our broader and more diversified product portfolio has largely mitigated seasonal impacts to consolidated revenue during the first half of the year. This is certainly an intrinsic goal of our business model, just that we did not expect to achieve this so soon. The integration of classic Broadcom is clearly going well, and we continue to invest across all our franchise products. We are sustaining our technology leadership, and our products are very well-received by our customers.
Our revenue trajectory from the first half of fiscal 2017 could possibly extend into the second half. Nonetheless, we do not expect that the approximate 15% level of year-on-year growth we are guiding for the second quarter to really be sustainable in the long term. Our long-term operating model will continue to assume mid-single-digit annual revenue growth for the consolidated business.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our first quarter fiscal 2017 financials.",868,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2017",2017-03-01,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,3337.0,1149802.0,47589303.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas  Krause,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included in with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.
Let me first start out by saying that we are very pleased with the execution this quarter, and specifically the progress we've made towards our long-term target model, which remains an operating margin target of 45% of net revenue and a free cash flow margin above 35% of net revenue. Further, what Hock was saying, we also believe that we can achieve these long-term operating targets based on a sustainable long-term revenue growth rate of mid-single digits.
Now let me review the Q1 results. Revenue for the first quarter came in at $4.15 billion, approximately flat sequentially. Foxconn was a greater-than-10% direct customer and the first this quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62.4%, about 90 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to revenue at the top end of guidance and a slightly better product mix. This quarter's gross margin also benefited from the impact of approximately $60 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturing rights to a customer in our wired segment, which is included in our original guidance.
Turning to our operating expenses. R&D expenses were $664 million and SG&A expenses were $120 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $784 million or 18.9% of net revenue. As Hock mentioned, we have now largely completed the integration of classic Broadcom, and I would reiterate that we feel comfortable at this level of operating expenses relative to net revenue.
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion and represented 43.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $77 million, slightly above our guidance. This is primarily due to higher-than-expected net income, first quarter interest expense of $110 million and other income net was $8 million. First quarter net income was $1.63 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.63. Our share-based compensation expense in the first quarter was $201 million.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our day sales outstanding were 43 days, a decrease of 5 days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.34 billion, a decrease of $64 million from the beginning of the quarter. We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $313 million for annual employee bonus payments for fiscal year 2016 and approximately $80 million of cash expended on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities, including discontinued operations.
I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, the business already demonstrated the ability to generate free cash flow close to our long-term target model of 35%. While free cash flow in the first quarter was $1 billion approximately, or only 25% of net revenue, this does include, I want to highlight, the impacts from the annual employee cash bonus payment as well as cash restructuring expenses and capital expenditures, that as we discussed before are running higher than our long-term targets. Looking forward, we expect classic Broadcom-related restructuring expenses to continue to decrease as we finish this integration.
Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $325 million or 7.8% of net revenue. However, we expect long-term CapEx, largely as a fabless semiconductor company, to run at about 3% of net revenue, consistent with that fabless business model. As a reminder, for full fiscal year 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations and about $200 million towards purchasing of test equipment for consignment at our CMs. A total of $431 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion.
Now let me turn to non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is the results from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 62% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $789 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $74 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $106 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 452 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $223 million. CapEx will be approximately $290 million. As you'll have seen, our board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in the second fiscal quarter.
We're also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned, and we presently expect to close this transaction in our third quarter of fiscal 2017. I am pleased that we're able to reach an agreement with Arris earlier this quarter for the sale of Brocade's network Edge business for $800 million in cash plus the additional cost of unvested employee stock op. Following Brocade's recent results, we continue to feel very comfortable that Brocade's Fibre Channel San Switching business, the key business that we are focused on, will generate approximately $900 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2018.

Yes, in fact, it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years, which is over the medium term -- long term, I would say, our strength, our franchise in cellular and our RF, in cellular analog, the front-end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in a handset for cellular, that's one area. And the other area in WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity. Those 2 functionalities, those 2 features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation handset evolves, what it involves, in the case of RF cellular, is twofold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further the beyond that, more and more bands, spectral bandwidths get pulled into the phone. And number of SKUs of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so the -- so because of more band, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers, low-noise amplifiers and because of that, necessarily, content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increase fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and particularly driven on bandwidth, on PIO throughput as we move from -- once you gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in WiFi to today's ac, as we move from single-user to multiple users and as we move next-generation from ac into ax and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones becomes correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the near -- into the medium term.",333,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

Not every year necessarily, but long term, 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is, obviously, you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the top line, and it's showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just 1 quarter, and obviously just 1 fiscal year, one point in time. So we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have moved away from our broad model or guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%.

And on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our wired segment, which is our largest segment. But just if you look at our switching and routing side, if I were to put them together, which is really data center, networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because off a very strong data center demand, data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now. And I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up the new generation with high bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents. And as we go later part in the year of our DNX router and aggregation switches. So we see that in this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there on data center expansion, especially into the cloud but also from fact that we are launching a few very key new products in this year.

And then, there, you see components we ship into hard disk drives.

If you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, if you look at the fact that we structured the balance sheet around now fixed-rate debt; if you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and then cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter; and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly; you take out the onetime campus initiative; the onetime tester initiative this year, which will sort of play itself out here over the next couple of quarters; frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway. And of course, that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be second half seasonally uptrends from a revenue perspective.",137,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here.

Beyond that, we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of our being able to put capital to work in an interesting opportunity to drive better returns than our alternative. So we're going to continue to do that. But given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off of the balance sheet, particularly as robust opportunities that arise.",146,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Carrier aggregation, as you well know, is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidths, not necessarily 1, but multiple, and in the of interest of reducing CapEx in infrastructure, is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max -- to combine together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput. And so not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen, simply because, not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters, which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- been able to integrate -- be integrated into modules to allow that maxing and de-maxing of those separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously as you see in China, continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the 2 biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to uplinking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of the reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in our cellular RF demand. So it's great for us, and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world.",242,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Well, it's a very interesting point. And as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction, every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settled out the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as various -- specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume in semiconductor chips. All those various actions, a large -- a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from our scale and our ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin, as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So that's a combination of these 2 things. And in terms of where would it go from here, frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is to probably look at history.",192,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

I think what we're going to do and we've sort of articulated in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory in those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business. Obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you're seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right, consistent with that policy, as we get to the end of the year, if we're able to achieve expectations, then we're going to have -- perhaps we'd be in a position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back the 50% on an LTM basis.",151,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

For my follow-up, I also wanted to dig in the gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers. But I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement for the model from here comes from gross margins. But it's not that much, it's only about, oh, 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are, and this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. So given all the levers that you just talked about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you, why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther? Like, I don't see any reason why I shouldn't expect the gross margins to go even higher than that unless there's something else mix, there's something else that ought to be taking it down.

And if I go all the way back to the original Avago gross margins in the 30s, obviously, we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margins. I think the insightful part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year.

Let me try to explain it on our wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment. And yes, in simple term, broadly, there are 2 groups of products here and end markets here. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out. And that comes from various fronts, from general standard switching and routing as well as ASICs, which is also part in there as would be building block products as well as fiber optic components. That business is very enterprise driven, correctly, and it's actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis, thus, it's growing. As we move from 10 gigabit a few years ago -- a couple of years ago to increasingly 25 and 100 coming up very fast. And that transition happens very fast. Obviously, it's driving. And you all see our products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end, and Jericho. All these are related to data center switching. And that's very, very -- that's driving growth on a -- like, all infrastructure on a very, very stable basis but driving growth very nicely, and close to high single digits, even double digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here, there's set-top box on the CPE side and access gateways, like DSL, PON on the infrastructure side. And here, the business is stable. It's very stable, has been stable for the last couple of years -- a few years and continues to be very stable. And it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of the second half of the year is typically when it drives up. And in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline, hence, in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 was probably -- is probably a very seasonal low point and this gradually picks up seasonally, later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and that starts rolling over again. But if you look at it year-on-year, relatively, very, very stable. So we have a confluence of 2 segments mixed together in our wired business, which is what you are seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing. But nonetheless, both are very, very franchised product, very franchised business and drives stability in this company.",411,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

You're obviously doing quite well in the wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well.

I'm going to be using the opportunity to expound a little propaganda here, again, that we've always articulated. The franchise products we are in -- we are the technology, we are also the market leader in those areas, in those niches. Some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader. And we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said, and I'd say it many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally, in those franchise areas, before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is, because we provide products that are -- allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So we invest very heavily. And you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We have the best engineers out there. We have the best products in this area. So that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our access franchise products.

We push the envelope. And that tends to go very much or actually into the flagship-class phones. That top of the pyramid, where it's -- where a big part of it has been the -- our major North American customer and the Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is. That's where the demand and value we see in our products comes out. As China evolves over time, having said that, the opportunity exist, they'll move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we're beginning to see -- get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it. And that's why they need the technological engineering edge that we provide in our products. Until then, they need less of it, except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation where we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly, premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand.

Especially in the high-end top of the rack, in the one called leaf, and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model is going beyond just selling pieces of silicon. We sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand-in-hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customer, multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So that's a very interesting model for us. And what is overriding all this is obviously the need for more -- larger and larger, more and more throughput. And especially in data centers and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in -- in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs but also interface -- high -- very high-speed interfaces of SerDes, as we call it. So all that plays to our advantage, being able to do it. And we continue to do that. And we continue to -- as it goes from 10 gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe even -- and going on in the future to 200 gigabit to 400 gigabit, we believe we are investing in here heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So -- and with that the expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing your customer more throughput. And it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25 gigabit or 10 gigabit to 100 gigabit in the next 1 or 2 years. And we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar, except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly, simply because it's a much more stable market. Once you hear about now 4K TVs, our video delivery, it's moving on to H -- high definition, HD, and then eventually moving even to 8K. That will be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference but people want that. And if they want that we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a -- we look at it as a much more stable, gradually evolving market even as OTT -- the hype behind OTT and all that comes to play, which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes, start, process and social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter, in current quarter, extraordinarily strength in the demand for switching and routing.",516,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I'm actually quite pleased with our performance for the second fiscal quarter, with solid contributions from a broad number of our franchises. We delivered strong financial results with revenue, gross margin and earnings per share all above the top line -- top end of our guidance.
Second quarter revenue of $4.2 billion grew 1% sequentially and 18% year-on-year. The seasonal sequential decline in our wireless segment was less than expected and more than offset by contributions from all other segments. All segments, even wireless, delivered year-on-year revenue growth. On the income front, earnings per share were $3.69, growing by 2% sequentially and 46% year-on-year.
Let me now turn to the discussion of our results by segment. Starting with wired, our largest segment. In the second quarter, wired revenue was very stable at $2.1 billion, growing 1% sequentially and 3% year-on-year. The wired segment represented 50% of our total revenue. Wired continue to remain a very consistent end market and perform in line with expectations. 
As you may recall in the preceding quarter, wired revenue included approximately $60 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturer's right to a customer. This did not repeat in the second quarter. However, we were able to more than make up for this amount with growth from enterprise networking and the start of a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products. 
Turning to the third fiscal quarter. Though we expect seasonal strength in broadband and sustained cloud data center spend, and consistent with this outlook, we expect wired revenue growth to accelerate into mid-single digits, sequentially. 
Moving on to wireless. Second quarter wireless revenue was $1.15 billion, declining by 2% sequentially but growing 45% year-on-year. Wireless -- the wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenue. The low single-digit sequential decline in revenue was better than expected due to stronger-than-anticipated end-market demand. The sequential decline was driven by the bottom of the annual product cycle transition at our major North American customer, offset by the ramp of the next-generation phone at our large Korean smartphone customer. Generation-to-generation, we also benefited from a significant increase in Broadcom's cellular and WiFi connectivity content.
Moving on now to the third quarter. We expect to see the beginning of the second half seasonal growth in our wireless segment revenue. We expect this growth to be driven by the start of a ramp from a north -- large North American smartphone customer as they transition to their next-generation platform. On top of this, we are also expecting a substantial increase in our total dollar content from the 8 Broadcom products we will be supplying into this new platform. The initial ramp of this next-generation platform, however, appears slower this year compared to prior years, but we believe this will likely accelerate in our fourth quarter. 
Our third fiscal quarter outlook reflects this expectation. And notwithstanding the 40% content growth, we project sequential growth in our wireless revenue to only approach double digits on a percentage basis. This outlook also reflects an expected decline in shipments to our large Korean smartphone customer. 
Let me now turn to enterprise storage. In the second quarter, enterprise storage revenue was $712 million, growing 1% sequentially and 36% year-on-year. Storage segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Surprisingly, this segment continued to hold up and perform as expected. Hard disk drive and custom SSD shipments grew while SaaS and RAID sustained, offset by a seasonal decline in Fibre Channel shipments. 
During our previous earnings call, we expressed a cautionary tone around enterprise storage for the third quarter. However, we continue to see stability and, most of all, sustained bookings. We expect storage revenue to grow in the low single digits sequentially into the third quarter.
And finally, our last segment, industrial. In the second quarter, the industrial segment revenue was $223 million, growing by 24% sequentially, much better than expected primarily due to higher IP, intellectual property that is, licensing revenue from a large deal we closed in the quarter. Industrial revenue grew 23% year-on-year and represented 5% of our total revenue. Resales of our industrial products continued to trend up very firmly in the second quarter and we expect this to continue to be strong into the next quarter. As we look to the third quarter, we expect industrial revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, sequentially.
So in summary, demand in the second quarter, which is historically our weakest seasonal quarter, was stronger than expected. For the third fiscal quarter, end markets in wired, enterprise, storage and industrial continue to be strong, while wireless turns around and starts a slower-than-usual seasonal second half ramp, although we do expect it to accelerate dramatically in the fourth quarter. This leads to a projection of consolidated revenue growth of around 6% sequentially for the third quarter. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our second quarter financials and third quarter outlook.",837,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.
[Audio Gap] 
for the second quarter, starting with revenue of $4.2 billion, which grew by 1% sequentially. Year-on-year growth for the second quarter revenue was 18%, which I would note is -- continues to be well ahead of our long-term growth rate targets of mid-single digits. Foxconn was the only greater-than-10% direct customer in the second fiscal quarter.
Our second quarter gross margins from continuing operations was 63.1%, 70 basis points higher than our prior quarter and 110 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. The improvement in gross margin's primarily due to lower revenue and better-than-expected IP licensing revenue within our industrial and other segment. I would note we do expect to be able to sustain these gross margins going forward.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $677 million and SG&A expenses were $122 million, totaling $799 million or 19% of net revenue for the second quarter. This is slightly higher than guidance as we accrued for a larger projected annual bonus compensation expense driven by better-than-expected operating income. As I mentioned last quarter, we are comfortable at this relative level of operating expense given our current portfolio of businesses.
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.85 billion and represented 44.1% of net revenue. We now have line of sight to achieving our long-term operating margin target of 45%. 
Provision for taxes came in at $78 million, slightly above our guidance. This is primarily due to higher-than-expected net income. 
Second quarter interest expense was $112 million; and other income, net, was $3 million. 
Second quarter net income was $1.67 billion, and earnings per diluted share was $3.69. Our share-based compensation expense in the second quarter was $216 million.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 45 days, an increase of 2 days from the prior quarter due to a reduction in linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.31 billion, a decrease of $25 million from the beginning of the quarter. 
We generated $1.58 billion in operational cash flow, which does include the impact of an increase in working capital. 
Expenditures on classic Broadcom restructuring and integration activities continues to decline, as expected, as we expended approximately by $15 million -- $50 million in cash on these activities in the second quarter.
Free cash flow in the second quarter was $1.33 billion or 32% of net revenue. I would note, we are making very good progress towards our long-term target of 35%. 
Capital expenditure in the second quarter was $256 million or 6.1% of net revenue. As a reminder, we do expect our long-term CapEx to decline to about 3% of net revenue.
A total of $437 million in cash was spent on company dividend partnership distribution payments in the second quarter. 
We ended the second quarter with a cash and short-term investments balance of $4.45 billion. Our cash balance is running at elevated levels, which we expect will continue through the third quarter in anticipation of closing the pending acquisition of Brocade.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only.
Net revenue is expected to be $4.45 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margins is expected to be 63%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $787 million. Our tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $86 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $100 million. Note this reflects anticipated interest expense on our long-term debt of $112 million, offset largely by other income, including interest earned on our cash balance. The diluted share count forecast is for 456 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $255 million. Capital expenditures will be approximately $240 million.
As you will have seen, our board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in this fiscal -- third fiscal quarter. 
We are looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned. And subject to the satisfaction of the remaining closing conditions, we presently expect to close this transaction on or about July 31, 2017.

Let's start with the serious one. We don't forecast beyond one quarter. Bad practice, frankly, because we could be very sadly wrong. But obviously, what we are also saying is from the limited visibility we see, we see the ramp beginning in our fiscal Q3, which, as you know, is an off-calendar ramp by 1 month, July. So we capture a part of that ramp, I believe -- we believe, a small part. And we expect to capture the substantial part of that ramp in Q4. But keep in mind [ comes ] always when you compare year-on-year, we have different content levels from a year ago, substantially, as I pointed out. So that might kind of confuse the numbers somewhat. But enough -- suffice to say, Q3, as we outlined since the beginning of the ramp, may not be the same level of ramp if you compare to a year ago for a couple of reasons I mentioned. But we also see Q4 to even ramp up even more substantially, obviously, because if Q3 is slower, it's more than likely Q4 in any product ramp will just show a stronger quarter compared to Q3.

Obviously, you guys are committed to the mid-single-digit target that you put out a couple of quarters ago, but as you pointed out, you grew 18% in the April quarter. If we take the midpoint of your July quarter guide, I think you guys have the quarter growing about 17%. I realize the growth rate in enterprise, for example, is not necessarily sustainable, but what prevents you from raising the target to, say, high single digits on a long-term basis?",91,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

That's the single most important criteria, sustainable franchises. I mean, they deliver value added and they keep delivering it generation after generation. They're not there to grow like weeds. They're not. And -- but they grew like GDP, pretty much, economic growth. We've  [ an adder ] for the fact that each generation provides further value added, which entitles us to have slight premium but not much, and hence, it's mid-single digits, which is GDP but plus that slight premium. No more than that. And that is, long term, the sustainable basis because it's the nature of the products we invest in, the nature of our business model. What you see now, I think, is a short-term event, which has driven the 18% -- 17%, 18% that you mentioned year-on-year in Q2 from last year is driven by 2 parts, is my view on this whole matter. One is wireless. The Q2 of a year ago, it's not because that Q2 this year is strong as much as the Q2 a year ago in wireless was unusually weak for good reasons, many of which I will not go into but you all know that. And this quarter, it's more of a normal Q2, perhaps somewhat buttressed by a strong launch of our big Korean customer. But it's kind of stronger than we expected, as I mentioned. So there's -- a big part of that double-digit growth is wireless growth driving it, and that's 30% of our total revenues, approximately. So if it grows a lot, it has that impact. And the second part of it is on infrastructure, our business in wired, industrial and enterprise storage, this year, '17 business is just strong. The tide just rose, and I think that's the other part that drove this double-digit growth. But you don't see that every year. In fact, I think this year is fairly unusually strong for infrastructure, apart from wireless infrastructure itself. So that combination is what creates this 18% growth. I would not, for a second, like you guys to think -- believe that this is something we will sustain for the next 5 years. What we feel comfortable we can sustain for the next 5 years is what we had said before and will continue to deliver, hopefully, over the next 5, 10 years, which is mid-single-digit growth on average year after year.",428,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

And for the rest, I might have to take it offline another time because there are a lot of moving parts. And you're correct, in our wired segment, which represents 50% of revenue, we throw in the kitchen sink. Not really. All related to wired. There is actually a couple of chunks on broadband, which is broadband access, carrier access as well as CPE set-top box. And in Q2, those were not that strong, obviously. It starts ramping up seasonally Q3, Q4 -- or Q3 to Q4. So there is that effect that is not that strong. And year-on-year, a year ago -- a year ago, if you recall, that was the Summer Olympics, so we're comparing against the Summer Olympics, which will make it tough. And in Q3, Q4, that's post-Summer Olympics of last year, so it begins to look very good, which is what accelerates this in the second half. In switching and routing, no, we continue to feel very, very good. Whether it's in ASIC or merchant silicon, offtake delivery shipments continue to hit all-time high in those 2 segments. I hope that gives you enough. And then third thing that messes it up is we have building-block products like [ fines, retirements, ] which are more are unique to the designs that have been used, as well as fiber optics, which has gone through very interesting gyrations and cycles. That may mess up the number. But the 2 broadest area, broadband compared to a year ago is a hard compare because of Summer Olympics; but switching and routing, being as it may, continues to be a very, very strong franchise, whether it's in the form of an ASIC or in the form of merchant silicon, even though they are both selling into very different end users.",311,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

But we're happy to enable that for specific large customers in ASICs with customized hardware, which we do even right now, and retraining or inference. But we do that. Then on SSD controllers, yes, we do a huge amount of SSD controllers, relatively speaking, for -- basically, for enterprises only. Large enterprises.

Okay, let me give our definition a franchise, which is very open, and I'm glad you asked, give me a chance to repeat the mantra. No, a franchise basically is a -- we do only components, semiconductor components, and it's just components broadly, is simply that it operates -- that product line operates in a niche. It doesn't have to be mass market. Most times, it's a niche. It's a niche where the markets are -- have been established and will likely to continue to be established for the foreseeable future.

Probably is, but in -- that was probably late '16, early '17. Today, I guess, all this big -- all these increased prices in memory, whether DRAM, flash, is -- not hard drives as much as DRAM and flash, is leading to careful spending by enterprises and operators and cloud guys and data center guys. They all have been very careful. So suddenly, you have -- so demand, that is there. That is needed, but people are not spending. And you go -- you will have these stop and starts going on. So it's all very confusing is what I'm trying to come -- to get on. And I'm not sure we have as much -- any better -- or we have any better visibility than even our customers or our customers have better visibility on -- than us, for that matter. It's just very confusing. And all we can see is that demand has flattened out for our products, be they SSDs or be they -- SSD flash controllers, I should clarify, or be they components, rechannels and [ preempts ] for hard disk drive. All we see is that a quarter ago, we were saying, better -- got to be careful about Q3. Well, Q2 has gone -- come and gone. Q2 was good. Q3 continues to look good. But then, I'm going -- do you want to say Q4 may cave? Who knows. We're still booking Q4, but it may not be as strong. And a big part of that uncertainty lies in the fact that there's more than just simply a shortage of flash or DRAMs that's creating this uncertainty. I think it's much more than that.

Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited.
After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial table describing our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Broadcom's website at www.broadcom.com.
This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for 1 week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website at broadcom.com.
During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2017 results, guidance for our fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments.
Please note that starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we will only provide sequential revenue guidance as a range at the consolidated company level. This is consistent with the majority of our peers and customers. Given the puts and takes at a segment level during a quarter which often end up offsetting each other, segment guidance is often not the best representation of likely results at a company level. We will, of course, continue to report and comment on actual results by segment. This fourth quarter will be a period of transition, and we will provide you with some color on guidance by segment during this call before implementing our new approach to guidance in the first quarter of 2018. 
In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call.

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased actually with our performance for the third fiscal quarter with solid contributions from all our segments. We delivered strong financial results with revenue, gross margin and earnings per share all above the midpoint of our guidance. 
Third quarter revenue of $4.47 billion grew 6% sequentially and 17% year-on-year with all segments delivering year-on-year growth. On the income front, earnings per share were $4.10, growing by 11% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. 
We are also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, and subject to the satisfaction of the remaining closing condition, we presently expect to close this transaction within our fourth fiscal quarter 2017. However, please note that our guidance and commentary today for the fourth quarter does not include any contribution from Brocade.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results, starting with wired, our largest segment. 
In the third quarter, wired revenue was $2.2 billion, growing 5% sequentially, 7% year-on-year. The wired segment represented 50% of our total revenue. Overall, this was a very good quarter for the segment, driven by seasonal strength in set-top boxes and robust demand from data centers for both our merchant and custom silicon products. However, we did start to see softness in demand arising from Chinese operators for our optical and broadband access products.
Turning to the fourth quarter. We do expect wired segment revenues to decline sequentially from -- arising from the seasonal weakness in demand for our broadcast -- broadband access products industry-wide. Notwithstanding this softness, we foresee the wired segment to continue to trend up very well on a year-on-year basis.
Moving on to the wireless segment. In the third quarter, wireless revenue was $1.3 billion, growing 12% sequentially and 27% year-on-year. The wireless segment represented 29% of our total revenues. Third quarter wireless growth was driven by the start of a ramp from our large North American smartphone customer as they started transitioning to their next-generation platform. Revenue growth for us was further augmented by a large increase in Broadcom's total dollar content in this new platform. 
Ramp of this new platform is now in full stride as we begin Q4 fiscal '17. We expect this to drive very strong sequential growth in wireless revenue for our fourth quarter, and year-on-year, we project strong growth in this segment as a result of our content gains. As we also mentioned in our previous earnings call, our product shipment to support the ramp this year of this North American smartphone maker was -- were pushed out compared to prior years as we look to the first quarter accordingly of fiscal '18. Unlike what occurred in the last 2 years, we do -- we presently expect wireless revenue to hold up sequentially.
Turning to enterprise storage. In the third quarter, enterprise storage revenue was $735 million and represented 16% of our total revenue. This segment grew 3% sequentially, 39% year-on-year. Growth in the quarter was primarily from our HDD product, while our server and storage connectivity business continue to hold up well. 
However, as noted in our last earnings call, we do not believe this trend to be sustainable in hard disk drive. And sure enough, we expect a sharp decline in demand for our hard disk drive products in the fourth quarter, driven by the start of an anticipated correction in the hard disk drive market. On the other hand, we expect our server and storage connectivity business to start to benefit from the [ platform ] launch as it starts to ramp during the quarter.
So despite this anticipated sharp correction in hard disk drive, year-on-year, we expect this enterprise storage segment to show double-digit growth. 
Finally, our last segment, industrial. In the third quarter, industrial segment revenue was $238 million and represented 5% of our total revenue. Revenues here grew by 6% sequentially, 18% year-on-year. The strong year-on-year growth, however, included the impact from a large increase in our IP licensing revenue, which as you know, tends to be quite lumpy in nature. Notwithstanding, the industrial resales  continue to trend up very firmly with high single-digit sequential growth and over 10% year-on-year growth, and we expect industrial resales to continue to trend up strongly in the fourth quarter.
So in summary, for the third fiscal quarter, the demand from all our markets continued to be firm, and we delivered mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth that was propelled by the start of the new platform ramp from a North American smartphone OEM. The operating leverage in our model enable us to drive double-digit sequential growth in our earnings per share.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Even as we foresee sequential revenue declines in other segments, we project the strong wireless growth to accelerate our consolidated revenue growth sequentially by over 7%. 
Our year-on-year revenue growth in 2017 has been very robust with double-digit second and third quarter results and projected fourth quarter results in a similar range. Strong end markets, more than just wireless, have contributed to this growth, but it would not be prudent to expect this level of growth to sustain long term. We operate in a relatively -- in relatively mature end markets that we assume are likely to grow over the long term close to GDP rates or in the low single digits. 
Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth. However, we do expect our technology innovations to continue to drive content gains and enable us to push our revenue growth rate above those of end markets, and this leads to our assumption around a very sustainable long-term year-on-year target revenue growth of mid-single digits as we have previously indicated.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook.",985,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and our non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com. 
As Hock mentioned and went through, we did deliver very strong financial results for the third quarter, starting with revenue at $4.57 billion, which grew by 6.3% sequentially. As he also just highlighted, year-on-year growth for the third quarter again was quite substantial at 17.5%, which is well ahead of our sustainable long-term growth rate targets of mid-single digits. Foxconn was the only greater than 10% direct customer in the third fiscal quarter. 
Our third quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 63.3%, 30 basis points above the midpoint of guidance.
Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses were $652 million and SG&A expenses were $116 million, totaling $768 million or 17.2% of net revenue for the third quarter. I'd highlight that this was $19 million below guidance, primarily due to lower than projected -- lower-than-forecasted project expenses and the tail end of synergies that we're realizing from classic Broadcom integration activities. 
Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $2.06 billion and represented 46.1% of net revenue. I am pleased that we were able to achieve our long-term operating margin target of 45% this quarter. 
Provision for taxes came in at $88 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher-than-expected net income. 
Third quarter interest expense was $112 million and other income net was $12 million. 
Third quarter net income was $1.87 billion, and earnings per diluted share was $4.10.
Our share based compensation expense in the third quarter was $251 million.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our days sales outstanding were 49 days, an increase of 4 days from the prior quarter, primarily due to the ramp in wireless revenue late in the quarter. Our inventory at the end of the third quarter was $1.43 billion, an increase of $120 million from the beginning of the quarter, reflecting an inventory build to support the strong growth expected in wireless in the fourth quarter. 
We generated $1.66 billion in operational cash flow, which includes the impact of an increase in working capital. We also expended approximately $50 million in cash on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities in the third quarter. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter was $1.4 billion or 31% of net revenue. Capital expenditures in the third quarter was $255 million or 5.7% of net revenue. I would highlight this includes approximately $90 million expended on campus construction projects. 
As you may recall, our CapEx had been running at elevated levels over the last several quarters, largely due to the construction of the partially built Irvine campus we had acquired as part of the classic Broadcom transaction. I'm pleased to note that earlier this month at the start of our fiscal quarter, we completed a sale and leaseback arrangement for the Irvine campus and received approximately $443 million in sale proceeds. We will continue to have CapEx expenditures at the Irvine campus as we complete improvements to the lease space throughout the balance of the year. 
We expect overall CapEx to decline meaningfully starting in 2018, and we'll provide more color on that topic on our next earnings call.
Moving on to additional items on the cash flow statement. A total of $438 million in cash was spent on company dividend partnership distribution payments in the third quarter. We ended the third quarter with a cash and short-term investment balance of $5.45 billion. Our cash balance remains at an elevated level, which we expect will continue through the fourth quarter in anticipation of closing the pending acquisition of Brocade.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. 
Net revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 63%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $780 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $96 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $100 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 457 million shares. Share based compensation expense will be approximately $261 million. CapEx will be approximately $230 million.

Well, from Q3 to Q4, and we have said that in the last earnings call, we expect probably to drive up our revenue -- careful my choice of words [ right here ], but drive up about 30% to 40% sequentially on wireless alone. And because of the delayed shipment and everything just shifts further out, so we expect in Q1 that the wireless revenue would probably hold close to the same level as what we will see in Q4 fiscal '17.

You mentioned about the CapEx coming down as we go into next year, so I'm not going to ask you for any more details on that. But as we think about a 35% free cash flow target, margin target, and a 45% target for your operating margin, I know there's some deltas in between those 2, but it doesn't seem like it should add up to quite 10 points.

I think that's very fair. As we've seen, operating margins and EBITDA margins continue to expand. And you look at sort of the onetime items this year around the campus activity, some of the things we're doing in the back end, the restructuring activities we've taken on, you're going to see that continue to converge.

Wireless, traditionally, as I think you probably know, does carry a below-average -- below-Broadcom average gross margins.

And it's running very well. And in terms of ramp, see, we have constant upgrades to those products. We have launched since last year Tomahawk and Tomahawk+, the Tomahawk I. We even launched this year Tomahawk II. We should be doing Tomahawk III by end of this year, and it will keep going on as we engineer new innovative next-generation products for our cloud customers, especially our cloud customers who desire higher and higher throughput and bandwidth.

I mean the model continues to focus on investing in value-added product development and delivering better and better value for customers and for us. So I think what you're seeing is a constant increase in margins, both gross margins and then with revenue growth in our operating margins.

And Tom is exactly right in saying that. Think about it. We have 19 product franchises. Each of them are in end -- specific end markets. You might almost say niche markets in some cases. And we always start off as niche markets. Some of them end up as the mass market as the market moves to the niche we happened to have picked. And it's about developing products using technology we have and continuing to evolve the technology, which are the best, superb in those end markets we are in. We are #1 typically in those end markets, #1 in technology leadership, #1 in markets. And we keep investing again and again over the years to develop new product generation. We do not manage this business by numbers. We just manage it based on this model, based on addressing market demands and let the numbers fall where they may, as long as we believe we are getting value and a good return on the investment we make in those niches we are in, we just sustain those niches. And the numbers you see us roll together is what arises as an end result of this business model. We don't try to trade off revenue against margin. That doesn't work. It's the basic business model that says in each of the 19 product groups we are in, we are the best there is, and we get the biggest share. And that market continues to need new product innovation and we supply it. And by doing that, the revenue is whatever the revenue turns out to be, and the margin gets richer and richer as we provide more and more technology. And the end result is consolidating all these 19 divisions, you get what we show you. And you get a gross margin that continues to expand, as I mentioned, because the nature of this technology market enable us to keep evolving new products with higher content and a higher price premium.",337,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And so, yes, I tend to like to agree with you to say that it may extend beyond Q4 to even Q1 next year. But -- and that will likely happen. Having said that, year-on-year, our storage business seems to be what it should be, which is firm but flattish. That's what we'd like to see enterprise storage over the long term. What we see this year, '17, appears to be a bit of a divergence from that, but I think we'll get back to normality perhaps in '18 and to see it being sort of flattish year-on-year, which is where enterprise storage should be as a very stable sustainable volume business.",159,2.0,5.0,0.6111111111111112,0.5

So I can't answer for broadly across, except to say that broadly across, as you go from one generation to the next in those flagship smartphones, the functions we do drives towards more and more complexity, more and more functionality and certainly more and more performance.

You can see how broad it is. And to be honest, yes, we point out -- so there are always puts and takes. A couple of product lines are soft, other product lines are strong. And we'd like to give you a bit of color, but sometimes, I regret giving you too much color because you start picking on me particularly. And really, it does -- it has an impact in this particular quarter, but it may not impact the next quarter. You get what I mean? So broadly, look at it as a broad spectrum of wired combining networking as well as access product lines. And that just moves along in a very, very stable manner, growing anywhere from 5% to 10% on an annualized basis, best way to look at it. Because involved in it are product lines that grow very slowly and some that are very more excited as you guys like to point out. If I talk about the exciting things, you might extrapolate to see the whole 50% of my revenue growing like weeds when it doesn't. So I do want to be very careful in making sure I clarify all this for you guys.",295,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

As you go from 28 nanometers, which seems like history, to 16 nanometers, to now, increasingly, 10 and 7, the cost of designing ASICs is exponentially growing. And you can probably understand why as the process and the process technology and equipment goes up very, very sharply. So unless you are a player, a system guy, with very high volume, a system OEM or even an end user with very large volume of a particular path, it's really expensive for you to want to do ASICs for your particular needs. And if you do, we're happy to address it, but we're finding out at this kind of -- at this stage of very high bandwidth, because you need to address those high bandwidths, high throughputs, you need very advanced CMOS technology, it becomes very, very expensive.

And sure, and we are benefiting from that, from -- and I agree with you. But again, on the overall scheme of things, even in our storage business, it helps add to our total revenue of $700 million to $800 million every quarter, and we love that. But again, the puts and takes in the overall scheme of things. And it helps us get our revenues. Does it move the needle? Some, but not tremendously.

Good afternoon, everyone. Well, we closed our fiscal 2017 on a very strong note with solid financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Fourth quarter revenue of $4.85 billion grew 17% year-on-year and 9% sequentially. On the earnings front, earnings per share were $4.59, growing by 32% year-on-year and 12% sequentially. 
Our business continued to become more profitable through fiscal 2017. We achieved operating margins of 47% in our most recent quarter, comfortably ahead of our long-term operating margin target of 45%, which we had announced at the end of fiscal 2016. And EBITDA rose to 50%. This led to substantially improved free cash flow generation in 2017, which drove the 72% increase in our dividend we announced today. As you may recall, this latest dividend increase comes on top of the doubling in dividend we had announced at the end of fiscal year 2016. We remain very focused on increasing capital returns to our shareholders.
We also continued to successfully execute our M&A strategy having completed the acquisition of Brocade early in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, this current quarter, adding one more business to our broad portfolio of networking and storage franchises. Against this backdrop, clearly, our business continues to be strong. All our 20 product franchises continue to perform extremely well.
Before I turn to a discussion of segment results, please note that commentary today for the fourth quarter does not include any contribution from Brocade.
As I look forward within each of the segment commentary, I will also touch on specific trends and growth drivers for our business in fiscal 2018. Guidance, however, for first fiscal quarter does include a partial quarter of expected contribution from the Brocade Fibre Channel SAN business. Please also note that this first quarter 2018 is a 14-week quarter for us.
Starting on wired, our largest segment. In the fourth quarter, wired revenue was $2.15 billion, growing 4% year-on-year, declining 3% sequentially. The wired segment represented 45% of our total revenue. As expected, wired segment revenue declined sequentially as a result of the typical seasonal decline in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products. Similar to a number of our peers, we also experienced a slowing -- a slowdown in demand for our optical products from access and metro networks. In contrast, however, demand from data centers continued to hold up quite well into the fourth quarter.
Turning to the first quarter of 2018. We expect to see the bottom of the seasonal decline in demand for our set-top box and broadband access. And if we look further into the rest of '18, we are rather excited about the ramp that we are enabling for key -- for our key cloud customers and a couple of OEMs in artificial intelligence.
Okay, in broadband, we are also seeing increasing contraction on 10G technology to support broadband video delivery. Beyond even that point, we see that 10G cable technology going full duplex. 
Moving on to wireless. In the fourth quarter, wireless revenue was $1.8 billion, growing 33% year-on-year and 40% sequentially. This wireless segment represented 37% of our total revenue. Fourth quarter wireless revenue was driven by the ramp in shipments of next-generation platform from a large North American smartphone customer. The growth was partially offset by a decline in shipments to other customers. And the substantial year-on-year growth in revenue was driven by the large increase, as already indicated, in Broadcom's total dollar content in this new platform. As we look into first quarter 2018, unlike the last 2 years, we expect wireless revenue to continue to grow sequentially as the ramp in demand from our North American customer this year was pushed out compared to prior years.
Going beyond that into '18 -- into the rest of 2018, we see significant increase in FBAR content driven by the need for additional filtering at the antenna. We are also very excited by the launch, the second half of '18, of the next-generation WiFi product, the 802.11ax, which we expect to see happen at retail and progressing to handsets.
Let me now turn to our enterprise storage segment. In the fourth quarter 2017, enterprise storage revenue was $645 million, growing 15% year-on-year and declining 12% sequentially. The storage segment represented 13% of our total revenue. Sequential decline in storage revenue was driven by an anticipated correction in demand for hard disk drive products. In contrast, our server and storage connectivity business, the MegaRAID business, experienced an increase in demand driven by the Purley server launch cycle. 
Looking into the first quarter of 2018, we are seeing this Purley launch continue to gain traction and drive very strong growth in demand for our server storage connectivity products. We also expect hard disk drive demand to have bottomed in the first quarter and start to recover. Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the enterprise storage segment -- this enterprise storage segment will include Brocade's Fibre Channel SAN business, which is expected to generate a partial quarter revenue contribution of $250 million in Q1 fiscal '18. 
Beyond this, as we look into 2018, we see the storage landscape being driven very well by our products supporting the adoption of all-flash arrays in storage appliances infrastructure with our PCI Express and NVMe technology. 
Finally, our last segment, industrial. Fourth quarter industrial segment revenue was $257 million, representing 5% of total revenue. Revenue for this segment grew 59% year-on-year, 8% sequentially. And this strong year-on-year growth, however, included the impact from a large increase in our IP licensing revenue, which as you know tends to be quite lumpy in nature. What is significant is that sustainable industrial resales continue to grow double digits year-on-year. And looking into the first quarter, while we expect IP licensing revenue to decline sequentially, industrial shipments and resales are likely to continue to trend as they did in the preceding quarter. And in fact, for the rest of 2018, we see strong adoption and ramp of our optical isolation product to continue to drive growth coming from electric vehicles.
So in summary, fourth quarter -- for the fourth fiscal quarter, we believe we delivered very strong financial results. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 revenue continues to be good as we see an outlook of $5.3 billion, which includes the partial quarter contribution from Brocade. This will position us, we believe, for a very strong start to the new fiscal year. We made great progress, I believe, in executing to all key parts of our strategy through fiscal 2017. Solid revenue growth and improved profitability, which ended up exceeding our current financial target, led to a significant increase in capital return to our shareholders. These achievements, coupled with the expected rapid integration of Brocade and a background of continuing strength in our various businesses, will allow us to now improve on our long-term target operating model, particularly as it applies to 2018. While we will continue, having said all that, to target long-term sustainable revenue growth of just 5%, even as in the first quarter fiscal '18 we are seeing double-digit growth, we are increasing the gross margin target to 65%. We expect to sustain R&D expenses at about 15% of net revenue and drive SG&A expenses below 3% of net revenue. This positions us to increase the target for operating profit margin to be 47.5% and sustain a 50% EBITDA margin for this company.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financials and first quarter outlook. Tom?",1264,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
25016048.0,"Broadcom Limited, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 06, 2017",2017-12-06,48.0,Earnings Calls,Broadcom Inc.,2976.0,1359774.0,54416095.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas  Krause,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included in the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at broadcom.com.
Let me start first with comments on the progress we have made towards our long-term target operating model. As Hock outlined and I'm pleased to report, for fiscal '17, we did exceed our long-term target of greater than 60% gross margins and 45% operating margins. We delivered fourth quarter 2017 gross margins of 63.3%, a 250 basis point increase from the same quarter last year, and operating margin of 47.3%, which was a 580 basis point increase from the same quarter of last year. 
On capital returns, as you recall, starting last year, we did increase the target for aggregate dividends to 50% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. And a result of that financial policy, we did double our dividend at the end of fiscal 2016. 
Leveraging the significant improvement in profitability and operating cash flow generation in fiscal 2017, we announced today a 72% increase in dividends. This increase takes our interim dividend to $1.75 per share or $7 per share on a full year basis and represents an approximate return of $3 billion annually to shareholders.
We closed the acquisition of Brocade about 3 weeks ago -- excuse me, 3 weeks into the fiscal quarter of 2018. We completed the divestiture of Brocade's campus WiFi and switch business to Arris for $800 million in cash in the first fiscal quarter of '18. And we also sold Brocade's headquarter building in Santa Clara for approximately $225 million in cash, also in the first quarter. These transactions, along with the completion of other -- several other smaller deals, marks the completion of portfolio rationalization activities for the Brocade acquisition and resulted in lowering the total consideration for Brocade to approximately $5 billion. We look forward to fully integrating Brocade over the next few quarters and expect our total operating expenses in fiscal '18, including Brocade, to remain within our target of 17.5% of net revenue. 
Let me take a moment to reiterate our financial policies, which we'll remain committed to going forward. We expect to continue to target long-term permanent gross leverage of approximately 2x EBITDA as long as the cost of that debt remains attractive. We also plan to continue to target aggregate dividends of approximately 50% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. Given our free cash flow generation, we believe that this will also allow us sufficient balance sheet flexibility to pursue acquisitions that are consistent with our proven business model. As we look forward, the credit quality of the business continues to strengthen, and we remain focused on maintaining and improving our investment grade ratings, including on our current debt.
As Hock mentioned, we're also updating our long-term target operating model. Sustainable long-term revenue growth remains at 5% on an annual basis. Gross margin target increases to 65%, and operating margin targets increase to 47.5%. Target free cash flow as a percent of revenue increases from 35% to 40%. And I would note that includes our long-term CapEx target remaining at 3% of net revenue.
With that, let me quickly summarize our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, focusing primarily on balance sheet and cash flow items. We delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter starting with revenue at $4.85 billion, which grew by 8.5% sequentially and 16.9% year-on-year. Our days sales outstanding were 46 days, a decrease of 3 days from the prior quarter. Our inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.447 billion, flattish from the prior quarter. We generated $1.959 billion in operational cash flow, which includes the impact of a $345 million payment to fund our legacy pension plan in the U.S. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $1.726 billion or 35.6% of net revenue. I am pleased that even with the impact from the pension payment, which is approximately 7% net revenue, we were able to drive free cash flow conversion above the 35% target we'd set last year.
Capital expenditure on the fourth quarter was $233 million or 4.8% of net revenue. As we have indicated on prior calls, we expect overall CapEx to decline meaningfully starting in 2018. We expect CapEx to approach our long-term target of 3% of net revenue in the second half of fiscal '18. 
Moving on to additional items in the cash flow statement. A total of $439 million in cash was spent on the company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the fourth quarter. We received approximately $4 billion from the issuance of long-term debt to finance the Brocade acquisition. And we also received approximately $440 million from the sale and leaseback of the Irvine campus. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion, but I would note that cash balance is at an elevated level through the fourth quarter in anticipation of closing the acquisition of Brocade. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which includes expected contributions from Brocade's Fibre Channel SAN business for a portion of the quarter. Also to note, this is a 14-week fiscal quarter. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $5.3 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 64%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $900 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $106 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $126 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 458 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $300 million. CapEx will be approximately $210 million. And as a reminder, our first quarter is generally a weaker quarter for operating cash flow due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year. In addition, we do expect to start incurring cash restructuring expenses related to integrating Brocade.
Okay. Finally, before we open up the call for questions, I do want to briefly address where we stand on redomiciliation and Qualcomm. First, on redomiciliation. On November 2, I think as everybody knows, we announced our intent to initiate a redomiciliation process to change the parent company of the Broadcom corporate group from a Singapore company to a U.S. corporation. The redomiciliation will occur whether or not there is corporate tax reform in the United States. The redomiciliation is subject to a shareholder vote and is expected to be effected in a manner intended to be tax-free to shareholders. We are confident that our shareholders will support this move. The final form and timing of the redomiciliation and the shareholder vote will depend in part on tax reform efforts in the United States.
On the Qualcomm front, on November 6, we made a proposal to acquire Qualcomm for a per share consideration of $70 in cash and stock. Our proposal represents a 28% premium over the closing price of Qualcomm common stock on November 2, 2017, the last unaffected trading day, and a premium of 33% to Qualcomm's unaffected 30-day volume-weighted average price. We expect that the proposed transaction will be completed within approximately 12 months following the signing of the definitive agreement. Earlier this week, on December 4, we notified Qualcomm of our intention to nominate a slate of 11 independent, highly qualified individuals for election to the Qualcomm board at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which Qualcomm has announced will be held on March 6, 2018. The highly qualified slate brings significant technology sector, financial and operational experience. While we have taken this step, it remains our strong preference to engage in a constructive dialogue with Qualcomm. We firmly believe that this complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader, enabling us to deliver more advanced integrated solutions for our global customers and drive enhanced shareholder value. We continue to receive positive feedback from stockholders and customers. In addition, after having had initial meetings with certain relevant antitrust authorities, we remain confident that any regulatory requirement necessary to complete a combination will be met in a timely manner. Given our common strengths and shared focus on technology innovation, we are confident we can quickly realize benefits for all stakeholders. 
As a reminder, the purpose of today's call was to discuss our quarterly earnings. Please keep your questions focused on today's financial results. We will not be commenting in the Q&A on Qualcomm or the redomiciliation activities. With that, let me turn it back to the operator. Operator?",1489,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

For my follow-up, I wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance and particularly the segments. You said wireless was up. I wasn't sure if that was because of the extra week or if that was normalized for the extra week. And I guess given the metrics, wireless seems like it's strong; storage looks like it's bottomed, and other pieces are growing. It seems to me the wired infrastructure may still be down sequentially, I guess, if I normalize for the extra week, given the drivers that Hock talked about. I guess, could you give us a little more color on, I guess, how much of the strength in wireless is extra week versus normalized? And I guess, what do those drivers for the rest of the guidance imply for wireless as we go into the January -- for wired as we go into the January quarter?",152,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Best way to describe it, to expand a bit on what Tom was saying, 80% of our revenues is direct OEM revenues. And so the extra week has very little impact for Q1 in terms of top line revenue. In this  [indiscernible]  revenue does have an impact, obviously, on the basis that resale is very time based. And so you might say on an overall revenue basis, if I were to hazard an estimate, that additional week provides probably an additional 1/3 addition of a week's revenue, is the way I look at it. But as Tom indicated, expenses, we will be showing a full week of expenses, which are largely for a company of our nature, obviously, salaries, people costs. So full week of expenses, probably 1/3 of a week of top line is the best estimate to put it on a conservative basis. And based on that, to answer your question on wireless, it really doesn't make much difference. Our wireless business is all direct largely. It makes very little difference that there's an additional 1 week. But it is strong, as I indicated in my remarks. It is strong because of the fact that unlike the year before and the year before that as well, the rollover of the product life cycle of a North American -- large North American smartphone manufacturer has been sort of pushed up, pushed up by over 1 month.",238,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The last couple of quarters, on average, you've been kind of the low to slightly below mid-single-digit growth in that business. You talked a little bit about what the broadband access and set-top box has done. You talked about optical in the AI side. If we think about those 3 buckets as we look into fiscal '18, can you just talk about the direction that they should go? Is there going to be the optical side snapping back? Or this year, it seemed like you had a number of headwinds that might not persist into next year? So any color you can get on an annual basis would be helpful.",122,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And you did touch on that, saying that is true. In '17, especially the second half of '17, in our wired business, which we run into a lot of puts and takes but quite a bit of headwinds in that whole regard, simply because -- especially in the second half, you start to see declines, seasonal declines in broadband, [ permanent ] broadband then -- and especially in optical, we all have seen the slowdown in demand from metro and access networks, particularly out of China. But against that, we see data centers continue to perform very well. And the net result of it was -- has been a relatively slow to flattish -- if you look at the whole year, flattish -- slow single-digit growth in wired in '17 with those headwinds. '18, the sense we have is we've seen a lot of those headwinds. The worst of those headwinds seems to be over. Data centers continue to be very well -- presenting itself very well, not just from switching, routing, which has always been very good throughout this period but also the additional push from deep learning chips that we are providing for a couple -- a few large customers. And against that, given that we have seen the worst on broadband, I think our wired business in '18 will probably grow over 5%.",227,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Tom, switching gears over to your side for a moment. The free cash flow target increasing from 35% to 40%, the dividend increase was a bit more than I expected at 72%. It seems like you guys actually were closer to 60% of free cash flow. So I guess, as we go forward, one, did the policy change at all? Are you giving back more? And then 2, what's the biggest driver of that free cash flow margin increasing? Is it onetime charges going away, profitability increasing?

So Ross, obviously, you can do the calculation on the free cash flow just based on the cash flow statement. So there were a couple of things that we took into consideration. One, I think you know we had a big campus initiative both in Southern California, around the Irvine campus, and then up here in San Jose. And a lot of that has tailed off, and then we went off and actually monetized the Irvine campus, which we just reported. So we thought we should give back that portion as well to shareholders in the form of a dividend. So I think that's the biggest driver. The CapEx initiatives beyond that were really around the test program, the consignment work we did, which I think is largely done. And then, of course, we delevered. We delevered around the pension. So we've had the Agere pension, which is the LSI pension that we inherited when we both LSI several years ago. We took steps toward derisking that pension by fully funding it in effect and then turning it more into a fixed income-based portfolio. So we think that was the right thing to do. But it's also a onetime event that hit free cash flow, and so we backed that out. Going forward, really, it's all about the business model and the financial model that gets put out of that business model that Hock articulated earlier. CapEx is coming down to 3% as a percentage of revenue, which is consistent with established -- largely established businesses model. And given the operating margins of the business, the balance sheet that's got 2x gross leverage less than 4% sort of average cost of debt capital, we think 40% is a very achievable target.",292,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

It is for certain customers with mission-critical data set storage requirements. They need to use Fibre Channel SAN, storage area network. The more conventional, so to speak, basis of [ ice casting ] , IP networking stuff are not of a performance level, quality level that will address those mission-critical requirements that financial institutions know. As an example, agencies, governments need to make work in those storage systems. So it's fairly unique in some regard, but it's a nice addition to our store -- enterprise storage portfolio, which tends to address more conventional storage requirements. And we see this business as a business that will continue into the foreseeable future and not just in America, worldwide, simply because this storage is -- this kind of storage system and network fiber channel is literally bulletproof mission-critical systems and practically not hackable.",163,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And by the way, to answer your question, it's not the same old story again about more FBAR, more bands. This is not -- this is actually -- think of filtering as being stage. This is -- most of the front-end modules we talked about in the past where we have power amplifiers and FBAR filters, we tend to put it close to the transceivers, where you filter signals that are channeled by the antenna. What we are seeing here is going in and filtering the signals close to the antenna before it channels down the front-end module. That's the thing that actually -- it's almost like you're creating an additional level of filter, level of stage of filtering, which in effect -- and hence is increasing -- increases the amount of filters unique. And these FBARs are the only things that can do very effectively those filtering. We call it extraction of signals at the antenna.

That also enables to track if there's overshipment in terms of -- in the sense that a customer take on more products than they truly need, because it adjusts itself very, very quickly, so just doing it directly as opposed to going through any distributor or middleman. And as far as the question on wireless, yes, I guess the answer is it's nothing to do with conservatism. Since we last talked a quarter ago, visibility has obviously come full -- crystal clear. And we're just -- in the interest of being transparent, we're just passing on what we see today.",161,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

And then for my follow-up, Tom, you raised your long-term targets on margins. When I look at the gross margins versus what you reported in Q4, there seems to be another, I think, 170 basis points of upside to the 65% target. But on operating margins, you're already above the target. So I'm just curious what's driving that delta?",61,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

But basically, as you look at it with Brocade, you're right, we're running 64-ish on the guide. I think what you see consistently and part of the key driver of the overall financial model and the new targets is our ability to continue to drive gross margin expansion. And I think a lot of that ties back to the business model, and we continue to introduce more and more content-rich products that carry higher values. And I think that's what's driving it, consistent for a very long period of time. And obviously, given the scale of the company, we'll continually invest in R&D at a very healthy clip, 15% of expanded revenue. But we're growing mid-single digits, obviously, did better last year. We're keeping SG&A lean and simple, which is consistent with our model, and that gives us leverage. So you're right. I mean, I think we'll continue to monitor the long-term model. We've obviously updated it a number of times over the past several years. But right now, we're very comfortable with a target of 65%, 47.5% operating margins.",189,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

But when you try to run it over time, it becomes very hard. And I'm very lost to give you misleading answers, but all it does is it's definitely directionally pushing in the right direction. As I've always indicated to you guys, on a long-term basis, which is what you're asking, year-on-year, we're seeing the dollar content increase. Which I would say a large part of it is content increase, driving top line dollar -- revenues in wireless closer to the range north of 10% -- 10%, 15% annually on an annual growth rate basis. And that's all content increase in our view. Whether it's an improvement of WiFi connectivity through 802.11ax or -- and/or more FBAR as we enhance the RF experience on smartphones, it all comes back to the same thing. We seem to see, based in history, empirically, that last 5 years CAGR -- compounded annual growth rate, CAGR, is around the mid-teens. And using that -- and using the trends in architecture and designs and the needs of phones, that the next 5 years, we'll see that same CAGR of mid-teens.",188,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think the benefit of being able to spend a little extra time between sign to close and, of course, the benefit of being able to announce a number of the sale processes, which were in effect restructuring activities at the same time has helped us get to our target model with Brocade a factor. Now that doesn't mean there isn't more to do. I would suggest we probably got about $20 million a quarter in operating expenses in the business right now on a run rate basis that still need to come out of the model, but we are ahead of schedule relative to where we normally would be when we close a deal. And I'd expect over the next 6 months or so, we'll be trending toward sort of getting that $20 million out of the business on a quarterly basis.",151,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

And Hock, a question for you. As we speak with many of your data center customers, they're all anxiously awaiting Tomahawk III, 12.8 terabits of total switching throughput. I think the bigger opportunity here is that you're moving the market to 50 gigabits per switch port using this new PAM-4 technology, which means that you not only change the switch silicon, but you have to change the PHY and NIC products and after components as well. So you've got a lot of potential for content enhancement here for you and the team. So I guess the question is, are you still on track to get Tomahawk III to customers end of this year, beginning of next year.

Very much on track. And as far as how big the impact will be, well, to be fair I think -- let's not get -- I hope let's -- me not get carried away. Tomahawk III, which goes to 12.8 terabit throughput, will just replace, to a large extent, the existing versions of Tomahawk II, which is faster to be fair, and Tomahawk I, which is 3.2. Now, of course, it replaces 8 by 4x and gives us therefore room opportunity for delivering more value to our customers. But at the end of the day, the number of sockets -- there's a certain level of replacement of existing sockets. With higher throughput equipment, silicon no doubt, which gives us some enhanced dollar value, but it's not a total add-on in the overall scheme of things.",161,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5
