We had an outstanding quarter and fiscal 2018 led by strong growth in our gaming and data center businesses. Q4 revenue reached $2.91 billion, up 34% year-on-year, up 10% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.65 billion. All measures of profitability set records. They also hit important milestones. For the first time, gross margins strongly exceeded 60%, non-GAAP operating margins exceeded 40% and net income exceeded $1 billion. Fiscal 2018 revenue was $9.71 billion, up 41% or $2.8 billion above the previous year. Each of our platforms posted record full year revenue, with data center growing triple digits. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 33% from last year to $2.46 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 75% to $450 million.
Let's start with our gaming business. Q4 revenue was $1.74 billion, up 29% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially with growth across all regions, driving GPU demand were a number of great titles during the holiday season, including Player's Battleground (sic) [ PlayerUnknownâ€™s Battlegrounds n], PUBG, Destiny 2, Call of Duty: WWII, Star Wars Battlefront II. PUBG continued its remarkable run, reaching almost 30 million players and recording more than 3 million concurrent players. These games deliver stunning visual effects that require strong graphics performance which has driven a shift toward the higher end of our gaming portfolio and adoption of our Pascal architecture.
eSports continues to grow, expanding the overall industry and our business. In one sign of their popularity, Activision's Overwatch League launched in January and reached 10 million viewers globally in its first week.
We had a busy start to the year with a number of announcements at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We introduced NVIDIA BFGDs, big-format gaming displays, in a partnership with Acer, ASUS and HP. These high-end 65-inch 4K displays enable ultralow latency gaming and integrate our SHIELD streaming device, offering popular apps such as Netflix, gaming video (sic) [ Amazon Video ], YouTube and Hulu. The BFGD won 9 Best of Show awards for various publications. We expanded the free beta of GeForce NOW beyond Max to Window-based PCs, and we enhanced GeForce Experience with new features, including NVIDIA freestyle for customizing gameplay with various filters, and updated NVIDIA Ansel's photo mode and support for new titles with ShadowPlay highlights for capturing gaming achievements. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch gaming console contributed to our growth as it became the fastest-selling console of all time in the U.S.
Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business, and some was met with our gaming GPUs. This contributed to lower than historical channel inventory levels of our gaming GPUs throughout the quarter. While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter. That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile.
Moving to data center. Revenue of $606 million was up 105% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. This excellent performance reflected strong adoption of Tesla V100 GPUs based on our Volta architecture which began shipping in Q2 and continued to ramp in Q3 and Q4. V100s are available through every major computer maker and have been chosen by every major cloud provider to deliver AI and high-performance computing. Hyperscale and cloud customers adopting the V100 include Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure, Oracle and Tencent.
We continued our leadership in AI-trending markets where our GPUs remain the platform of choice for training deep learning networks. During the quarter, Japan's Preferred Networks trains the ResNet-50 neural network for image classification in a record of 15 minutes by using 1,024 Tesla P100 GPUs. Our newer-generation V100s delivered even higher performance, with the Volta architecture offering 10x the deep learning performance of Pascal. We also saw a growing traction in the AI inference market where NVIDIA's platform can improve performance and efficiency by orders of magnitude over CPUs. We continue to view AI inference as a significant new opportunity for our data center GPUs. Hyperscale inference applications that run on GPUs include speech recognition, image and video analytics, recommender systems, translation, search and natural language processing.
The data center business also benefited from strong growth in high-performance computing. The HPC community has increasingly moved to accelerated computing in recent years as Moore's Law has begun to level off. Indeed, more than 500 HPC applications are now GPU-accelerated, including all of the top 15. NVIDIA added a record 34 new GPU-accelerated systems to the latest TOP500 supercomputer list, bringing our total to 87 systems. We increased our total petaflops of list by 28%, and we captured 14 of the top 20 spots on the Green500 list of the world's most energy-efficient supercomputers.
During the quarter, we continued to support the buildout of major next-generation supercomputers. Among them is the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit system, expected to be the world's most powerful supercomputer when it comes online later this year. We also announced new wins such as Japan's fastest AI supercomputer, the ABCI system, which leverages more than 4,000 Tesla V100 GPUs. Importantly, we are starting to see the convergence of HPC and AI as scientists embrace AI to solve problems faster. Modern supercomputers will need to support multi-precision computation for applying deep learning together with simulation and testing. By combining AI with HPC, supercomputers can deliver increased performance that is orders of magnitudes greater in computations ranging from particle physics to drug discovery to astrophysics. We are also seeing traction for AI in a growing number of vertical industries, such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities and health care. We announced engagements with GE Health and Nuance in medical imaging; Baker Hughes, a GE company, in oil and gas; and Japan's Komatsu in construction and mining.
Moving to professional visualization. Fourth quarter revenue grew a record -- to a record $254 million, up 13% from a year ago, up 6% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 30% of pro visualization sales. We saw strength across several key industries including defense, manufacturing, energy, health care and Internet service providers. Among key customers, high-end Quadro products are being used by GlaxoSmithKline for AI and by Pemex oil and gas for seismic processing and visualization.
Turning to automotive. In automotive, for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 3% year-on-year to $132 million and was down 8% sequentially. This sequential decline reflects our transition from infotainment, which is becoming commoditized, to next-generation AI cockpit systems and complete top-to-bottom self-driving vehicle platforms built on NVIDIA hardware and software. At CES, we demonstrated our leadership position on autonomous vehicles with several key milestones and new partnerships that point to AI self-driving cars moving from deployment to production. In a standing-room only keynote that drew nearly 8,000 attendees, Jensen announced that DRIVE Xavier, the world's first autonomous machine processor, will be available to customers this quarter. With more than 9 billion transistors, DRIVE Xavier is the most complex system on a chip ever created. We also announced that NVIDIA DRIVE is the world's first functionally safe AI self-driving platform, enabling automakers to create autonomous vehicles that can operate safely, a necessary ingredient for going to market.
Additionally, we announced a number of collaborations at CES, including with Uber, which has been using NVIDIA technology for the AI computing system in its fleets of self-driving cars and freight trucks. We announced that ZF and Baidu are using NVIDIA DRIVE self-driving technologies to create a production-ready AI autonomous vehicle platform for China, the world's largest automotive market. Production vehicles utilizing this technology, including those from [ China ], are expected on the road by 2020. We also announced a partnership with Aurora, which is working to create a modular, scalable, Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform, incorporating the NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier processor. Jensen was joined on stage by Volkswagen CEO, Herbert Diess. They announced the new generation of intelligent VW vehicles will use the NVIDIA DRIVE intelligent experience, or DRIVE IX, platform to create the new AI-infused cockpit experiences and improved safety. Later at CES, Mercedes Benz announced that MBUX, its new AI-based smart cockpit uses NVIDIA's graphics and AI technologies. The MBUX user experience, which includes beautiful touchscreen displays and a new voice-activated assistant, debuted last week at Mercedes-Benz A-Class compact car and will ship this spring. And earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Continental to build AI self-driving vehicle systems from enhanced Level 2 to Level 5 for production in 2021. There are now more than 320 companies and research institutions using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. That's up 50% from a year ago and encompasses virtually every carmaker, truck maker, robotaxi company, mapping company, sensor manufacturer and software startup in the autonomous vehicle ecosystem. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the intermediate to long-term opportunities for autonomous driving.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins were 61.9%, and non-GAAP was 62.1%, records that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $728 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $607 million, up 28% and 22% year-on-year, respectively. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive. GAAP EPS was $1.78, up 80% from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a lower-than-expected tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.7% compared with our expectation of a tax rate of 17.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.72, up 52% from a year ago, reflecting a quarterly tax rate of 10.5% compared with our expectation of 17.5%. We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $1.36 billion, bringing our fiscal year total to a record $3.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $416 million for the fourth quarter, inclusive of $335 million associated with the purchase of our previously financed Santa Clara campus building.
Let me take a moment to provide a bit more detail on the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on the quarter and our go-forward financials. In Q4, we recorded a GAAP-only one-time net tax benefit of $133 million or $0.21 per diluted share. This is primarily related to provisional tax amounts for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We previously accrued for taxes on a portion of forward earnings in excess of the provisional tax amount recorded for the transition tax, hence, the one-time benefit.
For fiscal 2019, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be around 12%, which is down from approximately 17% previously. This does not take into effect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation which, depending on stock price and vesting schedule, could increase or decrease our tax rate and GAAP in a given quarter.
In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first and foremost on investing in our business as we see significant opportunities ahead. Our lower tax rate strengthens our ability to invest in both OpEx, such as adding engineering talent; as well as CapEx, such as investing in supercomputers for internal AI development. In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, with our plan remaining at $1.25 billion for fiscal 2019.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.7% and 63%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $770 million and $645 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 12%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items.
For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect our operating expenses to grow at a similar pace as in Q1. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available in our IR website.
In closing, I'd like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference on February 13 and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on February 26. We will also be hosting our annual Investor Day on March 27 in San Jose, on the sidelines of our annual GPU Technology Conference, which we are very excited about.

But I think the larger dynamics that are happening relate to just the really amazing games that are out right now. PUBG is just -- is doing incredibly well, as you might have known, and it's become a global phenomenon. And whether it's here in the United States or in Europe, or in China, in Asia, PUBG is just doing incredibly well. And we expect other developers to come up with similar genre, like PUBG, that are going to be coming out in the near future. And I'm super excited about these games. And then, of course, there's Call of Duty, there's Star Wars. There's just so many great games that are out in the marketplace today, Overwatch and League of Legends, still doing well. There's just a countless number of great franchises that are out in the marketplace. And the gaming market is growing, and production value is going up. And that's driving increased unit sales of GPUs as well as ASPs of GPUs. And so I think those are -- that's probably the larger dynamic of gaming.",205,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

It is probably the single biggest innovation we had last year in data centers. Our GPUs, the equivalent performance to one of our GPUs -- one of our Volta GPUs would take something along the lines of 20-plus CPUs or 10-plus nodes. And so 1 GPU alone would do deep learning so fast that it would take 10-plus CPU-powered server nodes to keep up with. And then Tensor Core comes along last year, and we increased the throughput of deep learning, increased the computational throughput of deep learning by another factor of 8. And so Tensor Core really illustrates the power of GPUs. It's very unlike a CPU where the instruction set remains locked for a long time, and it's hard -- it's difficult to advance. In the case of our GPUs and with CUDA, that's one of its fundamental advantages, we can continue to -- year in and year out, continue to add new capabilities to it. And so Tensor Core's boost of the original great performance of our GPU has really raised the bar last year. And as Colette said earlier, our Volta GPU has now been adopted all over the world, whether it's in China with Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, iFLYTEK, to here in the United States, Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft and IBM and Oracle in Europe, in Japan. The number of cloud service providers that have adopted Volta has been terrific, and I think everybody really appreciates the work that we did with Tensor Core. And although the updates that are now coming out from the frameworks, Tensor Core is a new instruction set, it's a new architecture. And the deep learning developers have really jumped on it. And almost every deep learning framework is being optimized to take advantage of Tensor Core on the inference side, and that's where it would play a role in video games. You could use our deep learning now to synthesize and to generate new art. And we've been demonstrating some of that at GTC, if you've seen some of that. Whether it's improve the quality of textures, generating artificial characters, animating characters, whether it's facial animation with -- for speech or body animation, the type of work that you can do with deep learning for video games is growing. And that's where Tensor Core could be a real advantage. If you take a look at the computational capability that we have in Tensor Core, compare that to a nonoptimized GPU or even a CPU, it's now 2-plus orders of magnitude greater computational throughput. And that allows us to do things like synthesize images in real time, synthesize virtual worlds, animate characters, animate faces, bring a new level of virtual reality and artificial intelligence to these video games.",473,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Near term, you had, had a number of strong quarters in data center. How is the utilization of these GPUs? And how do you measure whether you're over or under from a supply perspective? And then longer term, there seems to be a lot of money going into startups developing silicon for deep learning. Is there any advantage they have in taking a clean-sheet approach? Or is GPU the most optimal answer? Like if you were starting a new company looking at AI today, would you make another GPU? Or would you make another ASIC or some other format?

In the near term, the best way to measure customers that are already using our GPUs for deep learning is repeat customers. When they come back another quarter, another quarter, and they continue to buy GPUs, that would suggest that their workload has continued to increase. The -- with existing customers that already have a very deep penetration, another opportunity for us would be using our GPUs for inference, and that's an untapped growth opportunity for our company that's really, really exciting, and we're seeing traction there. For companies that are not at the forefront, the absolute forefront, of deep learning, which -- with the exception of 1 or 2 or 3 hyperscalers, almost everybody else I would put in this category, and their deployment, their adoption of deep learning applying deep learning to all of their applications is still ongoing. And so I think the second wave of customers is just showing up. And then there's the third wave of customers which is -- they're not hyperscalers, they -- they're Internet service applications, Internet applications for consumers. They have enormous customer bases and -- that they could apply artificial intelligence to. But they run their application in hyperscale clouds. That third phase of growth is now really spiking, and I'm excited about that. And so that's kind of the way to think about it. There's the pioneers, the first phase, are the returning customers. Then there's the second phase that's now ramping. The third phase that's now ramping. And then for everybody, we have an opportunity to apply our GPUs for inference. If I had all the money in the world and I had, for example, billions and billions of dollars of R&D, I would give it to NVIDIA's GPU team, which is exactly what I do. And the reason for that is because the GPU was already inherently the world's best high-throughput computational processor. A high-throughput processor is a lot more complicated than linear algebra done that you instantiate from a synopsis tool, it's not quite that easy. The computation throughput, keeping everything moving through your chip with supreme levels of energy efficiency with all of the software that's needed to keep the data flowing, with all of the optimizations that you do with each and every one of the frameworks, the amount of complexity there is just really enormous. The networks are changing all the time. It started out with just basically CNNs, and then all kinds of versions of CNNs now. It started out with RNNs and simple RNNs, and now there's all kinds of LSTMs and gated RNNs, all kinds of interesting networks that are growing. It started out with just 8 layers, and now it's 152 layers going to 1,000 layers. It started with mostly recognition, and now it's moving to synthesis with GANs. And there's so many versions of GANs. And so all of these different types of networks are really, really hard to nail down. And we're still at the beginning of AI. So the ability for our GPUs to be programmable to all of these different architectures and networks is just an enormous advantage. You don't ever have to guess whether NVIDIA GPUs could be used for one particular network or another. And so you could buy our GPUs at will and know that every single GPU that you buy gives you an opportunity to reduce the number of servers in your data center by 22 nodes, by 10 nodes, 22 CPUs. And so the more GPUs you buy, the more money you save. And so I think that capability is really quite unique. And then if I could just give you one example from last year or from previous year, we introduced 16-bit mix precision, we introduced 8-bit integer, we introduced NVLink the year before this last year. This year -- this last year, we introduced Tensor Core, which increased it by another factor of nearly 10. Meanwhile, our GPUs get more complex, energy-efficient. Efficiency gets better and better every single year, and the software richness gets more amazing. And so it's a much harder problem than just a multiply accumulator. Artificial intelligence is the single most complex mode of software that the world has ever known. That's the reason why it's taken us so long to get here. And these high-performance supercomputers is an essential ingredient and an essential instrument in advancing AI. And so I don't think it's nearly as simple as linear algebra. But if I had all the money in the world, I would invest it in the team that we have.",767,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So if I correct for the Switch revenue growth in the quarter, it means the gaming business [ x ], which was up, I don't know maybe $140 million, $150 million. In your Q3 commentary, you did not call out crypto as a driver, you are calling it out in Q4. Is it fair to say that like that incremental growth is all crypto? And I guess going forward, you mentioned pent-up demand. Normally, your seasonality for gaming will be down probably double digits. Do you think that pent-up demand is enough to reverse that normal seasonal pattern -- or normally down? And frankly, do you think gamers can even find GPUs at retail at this point to buy in order to satisfy that pent-up demand?",132,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

We did talk about our overall crypto business last quarter as well. We indicated how much we had in OEM boards, and we also indicated that there was definitely some also in our GTX business. Keep in mind, that's very difficult for us to quantify down to the end customer. It is. But yes, there is also some in our Q3, and we did comment on it. So here we are commenting in terms of what we saw in terms of Q4. It's up a bit from what we saw in Q3, and we do again expect probably going forward.

First of all, just a comment about inference. The way that it works is you take the output of these frameworks. And the output of these frameworks is a really complex, large computational graph. When you think about these neural networks, and they have millions of parameters, millions of anything is very complex. And these parameters are waves and activation layers and -- activation functions, and there are millions of them. And it's millions of them that composes -- consists of this computational graph. And this computational graph has all kinds of interesting and complicated layers. And so you take this computational graph that comes out of each one of these frameworks, and they're all different. They're in different formats, they're in different styles, they have different architectures. They're all different. And you take these computational graphs, and you have to find a way to compile it, to optimize this graph, to rationalize all of the things that you could combine and fold, reduce the amount of conflict across all of the resources that are in your GPUs -- or in your processor. And these conflicts could be on-chip memory and register files and data paths, and it could be the fabric, it could be different buffer interface, it could be the amount of memory. I mean you got -- this computer is really complicated across all these different processors and the interconnect between GPUs, the network that connects multiple nodes. And so you've got to figure out what all these different conflicts are, resources are, and compile and optimize to take advantage of it to keep it moving all the time. And so TensorRT is basically a very sophisticated optimizing graph compilation -- graph compiler. And it targets each one of our processors. The way it targets Xavier is different in the way it targets Volta, the way it targets our inference, the way it targets for low energy, for different precisions. All of that targeting is different. And so first of all, TensorRT, the software of inference, that's really where the magic is. Then the second thing that we do, we optimize our GPUs for extremely high throughput and to support different precisions because some networks could afford to have 8-bit integer or even less, some really could barely get by with a 16-bit floating point and some, you really would like to keep it at 32-bit floating point so that you don't have to second-guess about any precision that you lost along the way. And so we created an architecture that consists of this optimizing graph, computational graph compiler, to processors that are very high throughput, that are mix precision. Okay, so that's kind of the background. We start -- we've been sampling our Tesla P4, which is our data center inference processor, and I -- we're seeing just really exciting response. And this quarter, we started shipping. We -- looking outwards, my sense is that the inference market is probably about as large in the data centers as training. And the wonderful thing is everything that you train on our processor will inference wonderfully on our processors as well. And the data centers are really awakening to the observation that the more GPUs they buy for offloading inference and training, the more money they save. And the amount of money they save is not 20% or 50%, it's factors of 10. The money savings for all of these data centers that are becoming increasingly capital constrained is really quite dramatic. And then the other inference opportunity for us is autonomous machines, which is self-driving cars. TensorRT also targets Xavier. TensorRT targets our Pegasus robotaxi computer. And they all have to inference incredibly efficiently so that we can sustain real time, keeping energy level low and keep the cost low for car companies, okay? So I think inference is a very important work for us. It is very complicated work, and we're making great progress.",663,7.0,9.0,0.8888888888888888,0.9

And so the best way to think about that is Pascal is the best gaming platform on the planet. It is the most feature-rich, the best software, the most energy-efficient. And from $99 to $1,000, you could buy the world's best GPUs, the most advanced GPUs. And if you buy Pascal, you know you've got the best. Seasonality is a good question and increasingly because gaming is a global market and because people play games every day. It's just part of their life. There's no -- I don't think there's much seasonality in TV or books or music. People just -- whenever new titles come out, that's when a new season starts. And so in China, there's iCafes and there's Singles' Day, November 11, there's Back to School in the United States, there's Christmas, there's Chinese New Year. Boy, there are so many seasons that it's kind of hard to imagine what the exact seasonality is anymore. And so hopefully, over time, it becomes less of a matter.

The NVIDIA TensorRT is really the only optimizing inference compiler in the world today, and it targets all of our platforms. And we do inference, in the data center that I mentioned earlier, in the embedded world, the first embedded platform we're targeting is self-driving cars. In order to drive the car, you basically inference or you try to predict or perceive what's around you all the time. And that's a very complicated inference matter. It could be extremely easy, like detecting the car in front of you and applying the brakes, or it could be incredibly hard which is trying to figure out whether you should stop at an intersection or not. If you look at most intersections, you can't just look at the lights to determine where do you stop. There are very few lines. And so using scene understanding and using deep learning, we have the ability to recognize where to stop and whether to stop. And then for Jetson, we have a platform called Metropolis. And Metropolis is used for very large scale smart cities where cameras are deployed all over to keep the city safe. And we've been very successful with smart cities, just about every major smart city provider, and what is called intelligent video analysis company, whether -- almost all over the world is using NVIDIA's platform to do inference at the Edge, AI at the Edge. And then we've announced recently success with FANUC, the largest manufacturing and robotics company in the world; Komatsu, one of the largest construction equipments company in the world to apply AI at the Edge for autonomous machines. Drones, we have several industrial drones that are inspecting pipelines and inspecting power lines, flying over large spans of farms to figure out where to spray insecticides more accurately. There's all kinds of applications. So you're absolutely right that inference at the Edge or AI at the Edge is a very large market opportunity for us, and that's exactly why TensorRT was created.",339,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

One of your GPU competitors basically said that the constraint was memory. I just want to make sure that, that was correct. And then in the CFO commentary, you mentioned opportunities for professional vis, like AI and deep learning.

We are -- we're just constrained. Obviously, we're 10x larger of a GPU supplier than the competition. And so we have a lot more suppliers supporting us and a lot more distributors taking our products to market and a lot more partners distributing our products all over the world. And so we -- I don't know how to explain it aside from the demand is just really great. And so we've just got to keep our nose to it and catch up to the demand. With respect to Quadro, Quadro is a workstation processor. The entire software stack is designed for all of the applications that the workstation industry uses. And it's used -- the quality of the rendering is, of course, world-class because of NVIDIA and -- but the entire software stack has been designed so that mission-critical applications or long-life industrial applications and companies that are enormous and gigantic manufacturing and industrial companies in the world could rely on an entire platform which consists of processors and system and software and middleware and all the integrations into all of the [ CAD ] tools in the world to know that the supplier is going to be here and can be trusted for the entire life of the use of that product which could be several years, but the data that is generated from it has to be accountable for a couple of decades. You need to be able to pull up an entire design of a plane or a train or a car a couple of decades after it was sent to production to make sure that it's still in compliance, and if there are any questions about it, that it can be pulled up. NVIDIA's entire platform was designed to be professional class, professional grade, long life. Now the thing that's really exciting about artificial intelligence is we now can use AI to improve images. Like, for example, you could fix a photograph using AI. You could fill in on damaged parts of a photograph or parts of the image that hasn't been rendered yet, you want to use AI to fill in the dots, predict the future, rendering results, which we announced and which we demonstrated at GTC recently, you could use that to generate designs. You sketch up a few strokes of what you want your car to look like. And based on the inventory, safety, physics, it could -- it has to learn how to fill in the rest of it, okay, design the rest of the chassis on your behalf. It's called generative design. We're going to see generative design in product design and building design and just about everything. The last, if you will, 90% of the work is after the initial inspiration or the conceptual design is done. That part of it can be highly automated through AI. And so Quadro could be used as a platform that designs as well as generatively designs. And then lastly, a lot of people are using our workstations to also train their neural networks for these generative designs. And so you could train and develop your own networks and then apply it in the applications, okay? So AI, think of AI really as, in the final analysis, the future way of developing software. It's a brand-new capability where computers can write its own software. And the software that's written is so complex and so capable that no humans could write it ourselves. And so you could teach, you could use the data to teach a software to figure out how to write the software by itself. And then when you're done developing that software, you could use it to do all kinds of stuff, including design products. And so for workstations, that's how it's used.",632,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Thanks a lot, Craig. In the last several years, several dynamics happened at the same time. And all of it were the favorable contributions to today. First of all, gaming became a global market, and China became one of the largest gaming markets in the world. But second, because the market became so big, developers could invest extraordinary amounts into the production value of a video game. They could invest a few hundred million dollars and know that they're going to get a return on it. Back when the video game industry was quite small or when PC industry -- PC gaming was small, it was too risky for a developer to invest that much. And so now an investor, a developer can invest hundreds of millions of dollars and create something that is just completely photorealistic and immersive and just beautiful. And so the production -- when a production value goes up, the GPU technology that's needed to run it well goes up. It's very different than music, it's very different than watching movies. Everything in video games is synthesized in real time. And so when the production value goes up, the ASP or the technology has to go up. And then lastly, the size of the market, people have wondered how big the video game market is going to be. And I've always believed that the video game market is going to be literally everyone. In 10 years' time, 15 years' time, there's going to be another 1 billion people on earth. And those people are going to be gamers. We're going to see more and more gamers. And not to mention that, almost every single sport could be a virtual-reality sport. So video games is every sport. So eSport can be any sport and every sport and every type of sport. And so I think when you consider this and put that in your mind, I think the opportunity for video games is going to be quite large, and that's essentially what we are seeing.",339,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So any guidance as to when we might see these 2 factors start to accelerate revenue in that end market?",108,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks a lot, Will. I wish I had more precision for you, but here are some of the dynamics that I believe in. I believe that autonomous capabilities -- autonomous driving, is the single greatest dynamic next to EVs in the automotive industry. And transportation is a $10 trillion industry. Between cars and shuttles and buses, delivery vehicles, I mean, it's just an extraordinary, extraordinary market. And everything that's going to move in the future will be autonomous. That's for sure. And it will be autonomous fully, or it will be autonomous partly. The size of this marketplace is quite large. In the near term, I -- our path to that future, which I believe starts in 2020 -- 2019, 2020, but starts very strongly in 2022, I believe the path to that, in our case, has several elements. The first element is that in order for all these companies, whether they're Tier 1s or startups or OEMs or taxi companies or ride-hailing companies or tractor companies or shuttle companies or pizza delivery shuttles, in order to deliver -- in order to create their autonomous driving capability, the first thing you have to do is train a neural network. And we've created a platform we call the NVIDIA DGX that allows everybody to train their neural networks as quickly as possible. So that's first. The development of the AI requires GPUs, and we benefit first from that. The second is -- which we'll start this year and next year, is development platforms for the cars themselves for the vehicles themselves. And finally, Xavier's here. We have first silicon at Xavier's, the most complex SOC that was ever made. And we're super excited about the state of Xavier, and we're going to be sampling it in Q1. And so now we'll be able to help everybody create development systems. And there'll be thousands and tens of thousands of quite expensive development systems based on Xavier and based on Pegasus that the world is going to need. And so that's the second element. The third element, in the near term, will be development agreements. Each one of these projects are engineering-intensive, and there's a development agreement that goes along with it. And so these 3 elements, these 3 components, are in the near term. And then hopefully, starting from 2019, going forward and very strongly going from 2022 and beyond, the actual car revenues and economics will show up. Appreciate that question. And I think this is our last question, yes? 
Well, we had a record quarter, wrapping up a record year. We have a strong -- we had strong momentum in our gaming, AI, data center and self-driving car businesses. It's great to see adoption of NVIDIA's GPU computing platform increasing in so many industries. We accomplished a great deal this last year, and we have big plans for this coming year. Next month, the brightest minds in AI and the scientific world will come together at our GPU Technology Conference in San Jose. GTC has grown tenfold in the last 5 years. This year we expect more than 8,000 attendees. GTC is the place to be if you're an AI researcher or doing any field of science where computing is your essential instrument. There will be over 500 hours of talks of recent breakthroughs and discoveries by leaders in the field, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and many others. Developers from industries ranging from health care to transportation to manufacturing and entertainment will come together and share state-of-the-art and AI. This is going to be a great GTC.

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, May 10, 2018",2018-05-10,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3877.0,1462671.0,58115967.0,Presenter Speech,Colette Kress,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter, with growth across all our platforms, led by gaming and data center. Q1 revenue reached a record $3.21 billion, up 66% year-on-year, up 10% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.9 billion. Once again, all measures of profitability set records, with GAAP gross margins at 64.5%, operating margins at 40.4%, and net income at $1.24 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 77% from last year, to $2.77 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 33% to $442 million. 
Let's start with our gaming business. Revenue was $1.72 billion, up 68% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Demand was strong and broad-based across regions and products. The gaming market remains robust and the popular Battle Royale genre is attracting a new wave of gamers to the GeForce platform. We also continued to see demand from upgrades, with about 35% of our installed base currently on our Pascal architecture. The launch of popular titles, like Far Cry 5 and FANTASY -- FINAL FANTASY XV, continued to drive excitement in the quarter. Gamers are increasingly engaging in social gameplay and gaming is rapidly becoming a spectator sport, while the production value of games continues to increase. This dynamic is fueling a virtuous cycle that expands the universe of gamers and drives a mix shift to higher end GPUs. 
At the recent Game Developers Conference, we announced our real-time ray-tracing technology, NVIDIA RTX. Ray tracing is movie-quality rendering technique that delivers lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows. It has long been considered the Holy Grail of graphics and we've been working on it for over 10 years. We look forward to seeing amazing, cinematic games that take advantage of this technology come to the market later this year, with the pipeline building into next year and beyond. And we expect RTX, as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality, to continue driving gamers' requirements for higher GPU performance. 
While supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing. As a result, we are pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price. Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business, at $289 million. As a result, we could protect the vast majority of our limited gaming GPU supply for use by gamers. Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about 1/3 of its Q1 level.
Gaming notebooks also grew well, driven by an increasing number of thin and light notebooks based on our Max-Q design. And Nintendo Switch contributed strongly to year-on-year growth, reflecting that platform's continued success. 
Moving to data center. We had another phenomenal quarter, with revenue of $701 million, up 71% year-on-year, up 16% sequentially. Demand was strong in all market segments, and customers increasingly embraced our GPUs and CUDA platform for high-performance computing and AI. Adoption of our Volta architecture remained strong across a wide range of verticals and customers. In the public cloud segment, Microsoft Azure announced general availability of Tesla V100 instances, joining Amazon, IBM and Oracle. And Google Cloud announced that the V100 is now publicly available in beta. Many other hyperscale and consumer Internet companies also continued their ramp of Volta, which delivers 5x the deep learning performance of its predecessor, Pascal. Volta has been chosen by every major cloud provider and server maker, reinforcing our leadership in AI deep learning.
In high-performance computing, strength from the broad enterprise vertical more than offset the ramp down of major supercomputing projects such as the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit System. We see a strong pipeline across a number of vertical industries from manufacturing to oil and gas, which has helped sustain the trajectory of high-performance computing next quarter and beyond.
Traction is also increasing in AI inference. Inference GPU shipments to cloud service providers more than doubled from last quarter. And our pipeline is growing into next quarter. We dramatically increased our inference capabilities with the announcement of the TensorRT 4 AI Inference Accelerator Software at our recent GPU Technology Conference in San Jose. TensorRT 4 accelerates deep learning inference up to 190 times faster than CPUs for common applications such as computer vision, neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis and recommendation systems. It also dramatically expands the use cases prepared with the prior version. With TensorRT 4, NVIDIA's market reach has expanded to approximately 30 million hyperscale servers worldwide. 
At GTC, we also announced other major advancements in our deep learning platform. We doubled the memory of Tesla V100 to 32 GB DRAM, which is a key enabler for customers building large neural networks through larger data sets. And we announced a new GPU interconnect fabric called NVIDIA NVSwitch. [indiscernible] 16 Pascal V100 GPUs at a speed of 2.4 terabytes per second, or 5x faster than the best PCIe switch. We also announced our DGX-2 system, which leverages these new technologies and its updated, fully-optimized software stack to deliver a 10x performance boost beyond last year's DGX. DGX-2 is the first single server capable of delivering 2 petaflops of computational power. We are seeing strong interest from both hyperscale and [indiscernible] customers, and we look forward to bringing this technology to cloud customers later this year. 
At our Investor Day in March, we updated our forecast for the data center and the rest of the market. We see the data center opportunity as very large, fueled by growing demand for accelerated computing and applications ranging from AI [indiscernible] multiple market segments and vertical industries. We estimate the TAM at $50 billion by 2023, which extends our previous forecast of $30 billion by 2020. We see strong momentum in the adoption of our accelerated computing platform and the expansion of our development ecosystem to serve this rapidly growing market. About 8,500 attendees registered for GTC, up 18% from last year. CUDA downloads have continued to grow, setting a fresh record in the quarter. And our total number of developers is well over 850,000, up 72% from last year.
Moving to pro visualization. Revenue grew to $251 million, up 22% from a year ago and accelerating from last quarter, driven by demand for real-time rendering as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. Strength extended across several key industries, including public sector, health care and retail. Key wins in the quarter included Columbia University, using high-end Quadro GPUs for AI, and Siemens, using them for CT and ultrasound solutions. 
At GTC, we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with NVIDIA RTX technology, capable of delivering real-time ray tracing to the more than 25 million artists and designers throughout the world. RTX makes computational intensive ray tracing possible in real time when running professional design and content creation applications. This allows media and entertainment professionals to see and interact with their creations with correct light and shadows and do complex renders up to 10x faster than a GPU -- a CPU alone. And the NVIDIA OptiX AI denoiser built into RTX delivers almost 100x the performance of CPUs for real-time noise-free rendering. This enabled customers to replace racks of servers in traditional render farms with GPU servers at 1/5 the cost, 1/7 the space, and 1/7 the power. 
Lastly, automotive. Revenue grew 4% year-on-year to a record $145 million. This reflects the ongoing transition from our infotainment business to our growing autonomous vehicle development and production opportunities around the globe.
At GTC and Investor Day, we made key product announcements on the advancement of autonomous vehicles and established a total addressable market opportunity of 60 billion by 2035. We believe that every vehicle will be autonomous one day. By 2035, this will encompass 100 million autonomous passenger vehicles and 10 million robo-taxis.
We also introduced NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a platform that will help car companies, carmakers, tier 1 suppliers, and others developing autonomous vehicles test and validate their systems in a virtual world across a wide range of scenarios before deploying on the road. Each year, 10 trillion miles are driven around the world. Even if test cars can eventually cover millions of miles, that's an insignificant fraction of all the scenarios that require testing to create a safe and reliable autonomous vehicle. DRIVE Constellation addresses this challenge by [indiscernible] cars to safely drive billions of miles in virtual reality. 
The platform has 2 different servers. The first is loaded with GPUs and simulates the environment that the car is driving in, as in a hyper-real video game. The second contains the NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus Autonomous Vehicle Computer, which possesses the simulated data, as if it were coming from the sensors of a car driving on the road. Real-time driving command from the DRIVE Pegasus are fed back to the simulation for true hardware-in-the-loop verification. Constellation will enable autonomous vehicle industry for safety test and validate their AI self-driving systems in ways that are not practical or possible with on-road testing. 
We also extended our product roadmap to include our next-generation DRIVE Autonomous Vehicle Computer. We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of autonomous driving, from traffic jams, pilots, to level 5 robo-taxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are now using NVIDIA's automotive platform. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for autonomous driving business. 
Now moving to the rest of the P&L. Q1 GAAP gross margins were 64.5% and non-GAAP was 64.7%, records that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $773 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $648 million, up 25% year-on-year. We continue to invest in key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive. GAAP net income was a record $1.24 billion and EPS was $1.98, up 145% and 151% respectively from a year earlier. Some of the expenses [indiscernible] by a tax rate of 5% compared to our guidance of 12%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.29 billion and EPS was $2.05, both up 141% from a year ago, reflecting the revenue strength as well as gross margins and operating margin expansion on slightly lower tax. Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $1.45 billion. Capital expenditures were $118 million. 
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $3.1 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.6% and 63.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $810 million and $685 million, respectively. GAAP...

Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website. 
In closing, I'd like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the JPMorgan Technology Conference next week on May 15, and at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5. We will also hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders online on May 16.

Stacy, so let's see. Q1, as you probably know, Fortnite and PUBG are global phenomenons. The success of Fortnite and PUBG are just beyond, beyond comprehension, really. Those 2 games, a combination of Hunger Games and Survivor, has just captured imaginations of gamers all over the world. And we saw the uptick and we saw the demand on our GPUs from all over the world. Surely, there was scarcity as you know. Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter, and it drove prices up. And I think that a lot of the gamers weren't able to buy into the new GeForces as a result. And so we're starting to see the prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. And the prices are starting to normalize. It's still higher than where they should be. And so obviously, the demand is still quite strong out there. But my sense is that there's a fair amount of pent-up demand still. Fortnite is still growing in popularity. PUBG is doing great. And then, we've had some amazing titles coming out. And so my sense is that the overall gaming market is just really -- is super healthy. And our job is to make sure that we work as hard as we can to get supply out into the marketplace. And hopefully, by doing that, the pricing will normalize and the gamers can buy into their favorite graphics card at a price that we hope they can get it at. And so I think there's a fair -- so I mean, the simple answer to your question is Fortnite and PUBG. And the demand is just really great. They did a great job.",289,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Joe, so as you know, there are 30 million servers around the world. And they were put in place during the time when the world didn't have deep learning. And now with deep learning and with machine learning approaches, the accuracy of prediction, the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much that just about every Internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach. And in order to take this newer network -- and the software that's written by deep learning, these frameworks, are massive software. The way to think about these deep neural nets is, it has millions and millions and millions of parameters in it, and these networks are getting larger every year. And they're enormously complex. And the output of these neural nets had to be optimized for the computing platform that it targets. How you would optimize the neural network for a CPU or a GPU is very, very different. And how you optimize for different neural networks, whether it's image recognition, speech recognition, natural language translation, recommendation systems, all of these networks have different architectures, and the optimizing compiler that's necessary to make the neural network run smoothly and fast is incredibly complex. And so that's why we created TensorRT. That's what TensorRT is. TensorRT is an optimizing graph neural network compiler. And it optimizes for our -- each one of our platforms. And each -- even each one of our platforms has very different architectures. For example, we invented recently -- reinvented the GPU and it's called the Tensor Core GPU, and the first of its kind is called Volta. And so TensorRT 4.0 now supports, in addition to image recognition, all of the different types of neural network models. The answer to your question is internal consumption. Internal consumption is going to be the first users. Video recognition, detecting for inappropriate video, for example, all over the world, making recommendations from the videos that you search or the images that you're uploading, all of these types of applications are going to require an enormous amount of computation.",358,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

One from a growth, and the second, from a competition perspective. So from the growth side, you guys are doing about, say, $3 billion or so annualized, but you have outlined a market that could be $50 billion. What needs to happen for the next inflection? Is it something in the market that needs to change? Is it something in the product set that needs to? How do you go and address that $50 billion market, right? Because you're only a few percent penetrated today in that large market. So what needs to change for the next inflection point? And then, on the competition side, as you are looking at that big market, how should we think about competition that is coming from some of your cloud customers, like a Google announcing a TPU 3 or perhaps others looking at other competing technologies?

First of all, at its core, this is something we all know now, that CPU scaling has really slowed. And if you think about the several hundred billion dollars worth of computer equipment that's been installed in the cloud, in data centers all over the world, and as these applications for machine learning and high-performance computing approaches come along, the world needs a solution. CPU scaling has slowed. And so here's the approach that we pioneered 1.5 decades ago called GPU computing. And we've been determined to continue to advance it during this time because we saw this day coming and we really believed that it was going to end. I mean, you can't deny physics. And so we find ourselves in a great position today. And as Colette already mentioned, we have something close to 1 million developers on this platform now. It is incredibly fast, speeding up CPUs by 10, 20, 50, 100x, 200x sometimes, depending on the algorithm. It's everywhere. The software ecosystem is just super rich. And as Colette mentioned, that there is already almost 1 billion -- 1 million developers around the world, that's grown 70% year-over-year. And so I think at the core, it's about the fact that the world needs a computing approach going forward. With respect to the -- our ability to address the TAM, there are 3 major segments. There's more than that, but there's 3 major segments. One is, of course, training for deep learning. The other is inferencing, and TRT 4 is intended to do just that, to expand our ability to address all of the different types of algorithms, machine learning algorithms that are now coming -- that are running in the data centers. The third is high-performance computing, and that's molecular dynamics, to medical imaging, to earth sciences, to energy sciences. The type of algorithms that are being run in supercomputers all over the world is expanding. And we're doing more and more of our product designs in virtual reality. We want to simulate our products and simulate its capabilities in simulation in this computer rather than build it in the beginning. And then, the last category would be graphics virtualization. We've taken with GRID and our Quadro virtual workstation and now with Quadro -- with NVIDIA RTX, we turned the data center into a powerful graphic supercomputer. And so these are the various applications and segments of data center that we see. I think, in the case of training, we're limited by the number of deep learning experts in the world. And that's growing very quickly. The frameworks are making it easier. There's a lot more open source and open documentation on sharing of knowledge. And so the number of AI engineers around the world is growing super fast. The second is inference. And I've already talked about that. It's really limited by our optimizing compilers and how we can target these neural network models to run on our processors. And if we could do so, we're going to save our customers enormous amounts of money. We speed up applications, we speed up these neural network models 50x, 100x, 200x over a CPU. And so the more GPUs they buy, the more they're going to save. And high-performance computing, the way to think about that is, I think, at this point, it's very clear that going forward, supercomputers are going to get built with accelerators in them. And because of our long-term dedication to CUDA and our GPUs for acceleration, of all these codes and the nurturing of the ecosystem, I think that we're going to be -- we're going to do super well in the supercomputing world. And so these are the different verticals. With respect to competition, I think it all starts with the core. And the core is that the CPU scaling has slowed. And so the world needs another approach going forward. And surely, because of our focus on it, we find ourselves in a great position. Google announced GPU 3 and it's still behind our Tensor Core GPU. Our Volta is our first generation of a newly reinvented approach of doing GPUs. It's called Tensor Core GPUs. And we're far ahead of the competition. And -- but more than that, more than that, it's programmable. It's not one function. It's programmable. Not only is it faster, it's also more flexible. And as a result of the flexibility, developers could use it in all kinds of applications, whether it's medical imaging or weather simulations or deep learning or computer graphics. And as a result, our GPUs are available in every cloud and every data center, everywhere on the planet. And which developers need, so that accessibility so that they could develop their software. And so I think that on the one hand, it's too simplistic to compare a GPU to just one of the many features that's in our Tensor Core GPU. But even if you did, we're faster. We support more frameworks. We support all neural networks. And as a result, if you look at GitHub, there are some 60,000 different neural network research papers that are posted that runs on NVIDIA GPUs. And it's just a handful for the second alternative. And so it just kind of gives you a sense of the reach and the capabilities of our GPUs.",892,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Thanks for the question, Toshiya. At the core, the program was about making sure that gamers who buy graphics cards knows exactly the GPU brand that's inside. And the reason for that is because we want gamers to -- the gaming experience of a graphics card depends so much on the GPU that is chosen. And we felt that using one gaming brand, a graphics card brand and interchanging the GPU underneath causes it to be less -- causes it to be more opaque and less transparent for gamers to choose the GPU brand that they wanted. And most of the ecosystem loved it. And some of the people really disliked it. And so instead of all that distraction, we're doing so well, and we're going to continue to help the gamers choose the graphics cards like we always have, and things will sort out. And so we decided to pull the plug because the distraction was unnecessary and we had too much good stuff to go do.",169,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thanks for the question. HPC. First of all, at the core, CPU scaling has stalled and it's reached the limits of physics. And the world needs another approach to go forward. We created the GPU computing approach 1.5 decades ago, and I think at this point, with the number of developers jumping on, the number of applications that's emerging, it's really clear that the future of HPC has accelerated. And our GPU approach, because of its flexibility, because of its performance, because of the value that we create, that as a result of the throughput of a data center, we save people so much money just in cables alone. Oftentimes, more than pays for the GPUs that they buy. And the reason for that is because the number of servers is reduced dramatically. And so I think the future of HPC is about acceleration, and the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs are really in a great position to serve this vacuum that's been created. With respect to benchmarks, you might have seen that earlier this week, we released 3 speed records. The fastest single GPU, the fastest single node -- single computer node. A definition of a computer node is something that fits in a box that runs one operating system, one node. And one instance, one cloud instance. We now have the fastest speed record for 1 GPU, 1 node and 1 instance. And so we love benchmarks. Nothing is more joyful than having a benchmark to demonstrate your leadership position. And in the world of deep learning, the number of networks is just growing so fast because the number of different applications that deep learning is able to solve is really huge. And so you need a lot of software capability and you're -- the versatility of your platform needs to be great. We also have a lot of expertise in the company and software. I mean, NVIDIA is really a full-stack computing company. From architecture, to system software, to algorithms, to applications, we have a great deal of expertise across the entire stack. And so we love these complicated benchmarking -- benchmarks that are out there, and I think this is a great way for us to simplify our leadership position. I think long term, the number of networks that are going to emerge will continue to grow. And so the flexibility of ASICs is going to be its greatest downfall. And if someone were to create a general-purpose parallel accelerating processor like ours, and had it designed to be incredibly good at deep learning, like recently what we did with our Tensor Core GPU, which is a reinvented GPU, and Volta is the first one, I -- it's going to be hard. It's going to be expensive, and we've been doing it for a long time. And so I think this is a -- it's a great time for us.",483,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And beyond autos, when you look at sizing that TAM, what are the other big areas that you think you can penetrate with GPUs and inference, besides auto?",41,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

The largest inference opportunity for us is actually in the cloud and the data center. That's the first great opportunity. The reason for that is there's just an explosion in the number of different types of neural networks that are available. There are image recognition, there's video sequencing, there's video -- there's recommender systems. There's speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language understanding. There's just so many different types of neural networks that are being created. And creating one ASIC that can be adapted to all of these different types of networks is just a real challenge. And by the time that you create such a thing, it's called a Tensor Core GPU, which is what we created. And so I think the first opportunity for us in -- large-scale opportunity will be in the data center and the cloud. The second will be in vertical markets. The vertical market that you mentioned is self-driving cars. And we see a great opportunity in autonomous vehicles, both in the creation of autonomous vehicles. And I mentioned that before, between now and the time that we ramp our AV computers we call DRIVE, we're going to be selling a whole lot of servers so that the companies could develop their neural network models for their self-driving cars as well as simulating the virtual reality -- in virtual reality, there are various test drives as well as testing their neural network and their self-driving car stack against billions and billions of miles of saved-up prerecorded videos. And so in the vertical markets, we're going to see inference both in the data center for developing the self-driving car stack as well as in the self-driving cars themselves. Now in the self-driving cars, the ASPs for level 2 could be a few hundred dollars to a level 5 self-driving car, taxi or driverless taxi being a few thousand dollars. And I expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019, and self-driving cars probably somewhere between 2020 and 2021. And I think the size of the market is fairly well modeled. And the simple way to think about that is, I believe that every single -- everything that moves someday will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And so the 100 million cars, the countless taxis, all the trucks, all the agriculture equipment, all the pizza delivery vehicles, you name it, everything is going to be autonomous. And the market opportunity is going to be quite large. And that's the reason why we're so determined to go create that market.",428,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

So first of all, Volta is a reinvented GPU. Volta is the world's first GPU that has been designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it the Tensor Core GPU. It has still retained all of the flexibilities of all -- everything that CUDA has ever run is backwards compatible with everything that runs on CUDA. But it has new architectures designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it a Tensor Core GPU. And that's the reason why it has all of the benefits of our GPU, but none of the ASICs can catch up to it. And so Volta is really a breakthrough. We're going to be very successful with Volta. Every cloud will have it. The initial deployment is for internal consumption. Volta has been shipping to the cloud service -- cloud providers, the Internet service companies, for the vast majority of last quarter, as you guys know. And they're using it internally.

DGX-2 and DGX-1 will both be in the market at the same time. And DGX is a few hundred million dollar business. It's -- it was introduced last year. So its growth rate is obviously very high. It's designed for enterprises where they don't -- they need to have their computers on-premise, but they don't want to build a supercomputer and they don't have the expertise to do so. And they would like to pull a supercomputer out of a box, plug it in, and start doing supercomputing. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises. It's designed for car companies. It's designed for health care companies doing life sciences work or medical imaging work. We recently announced a project called Project Clara, which basically takes medical imaging equipment, virtualizes them, containerizes the software, and turns it into a -- and most medical imaging equipment today are computational and they -- a lot of them run on NVIDIA CUDA anyways. And so we put that -- we can put that into the data center, we can virtualize their medical instruments and it gives them the opportunity to upgrade the millions of instruments that are out in the marketplace today. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises and we're seeing great success there. It's really super easy to use and it comes with direct support from HPC and AI researchers at NVIDIA.

And you guys did almost $300 million there. And perhaps I think there could actually be some in gaming as well, which would imply that you guys have 2/3 or more of that market? So I guess, what's going on there? Is there a pricing dynamic that's allowing you to have such share there? Or do you think it's your competitors that don't know what's actually being sold to miners versus gamers? Why such implied share in that market?",98,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Because the technology looked like it was very high fidelity, and I think you noted at that time that it was very computationally intensive. So the question is, as we think about the gaming business and the potential for ray tracing to enter that platform group, what does it mean for dynamics that we've seen in the past, for example, the ability to really push the high end of the market with high-end capability, 1070. Ti launched late last year. It was very successful. Does this give you further flexibility for those types of launches as you bring exciting and very high-end technology to market?",123,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I appreciate it. NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics invention in the last 15 years. It took us 1 decade to do. We literally worked on it continuously for 1 decade. And to put it into perspective, it's basically film rendering, cinematic rendering, except it's in real time. It merges the style of computer graphics, rasterization, and light simulation, what people call ray tracing, as well as deep learning and AI, merged it into one unified framework so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time. What it currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame. So it takes a server, one node of a server, several hours to render one frame. And in order to render 30 frames per second, just imagine the number of servers you need. If it takes several hours per frame, and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real-time, it basically takes a high-performance computer, a supercomputer, a render farm, that's why they call it a render farm, it's a full data center designed just for rendering. And now we've created NVIDIA RTX which makes it possible to do in real time. We demonstrated RTX on 4 Quadro GV100s. It takes 4 of our latest generation Volta Tensor Core GPUs to be able to render 30 frames per second, the Star Wars cinematic that people enjoyed. And so the amount that we saved, we basically took an entire data center, reduced it into one node. And we're now doing it in real time. And so the amount of money that we can save people who create movies, people who do commercials, people who use film rendering to create the game content, almost every single game is done that way. There's quite a bit of offline rendering to create the imagery and the textures and the lighting. And then, of course, architectural design and car design, the number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. And I'm certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them. And so that's our starting point, is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it, and hopefully, more GPU servers will get -- will be purchased. And of course, better content will be created. Long-term, we've also now plotted the path towards doing it in real time. And someday, we will be able to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. So we're super excited about RTX.",468,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

I want to follow up, again, on the seasonality, understanding the prior comments. Normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto declined into Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around data center and the Volta ramps, I can't bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the guidance -- the context of your guidance envelope. So how should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter?",113,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

Let me see if I can bridge together Jensen and then some comments here. Unfortunately, they are moving quite fast to the next question, so I wasn't able to add on. But let me see if I can add on here and provide a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality. Remember, in Q1, we outgrew seasonality significantly. We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of the channel. We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available. We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately, and then you can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency-only boards. So we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand. So that then takes you now to Q2. But if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1, we don't have to do those channel-fill dynamics again as we get into Q2. But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available. So putting together Q1 and Q2 together, yes, we are within normal seasonality, again, for our guidance. And we'll see how we'll finish in terms of the quarter. But you should be in that range. So yes, from a normal seasonality, at a year-to-date inclusive of Q2, yes, we're on that overall seasonality. Always keep in mind, generally, our H2s are usually higher than our overall H1s, and that's what you should think about our overall guidance. Gaming is still strong. We have to comment that our overall drivers that have taken us to this place over the last 3 to 5 years with phenomenal growth and our ability to grow that overall market is still here and all of those things are together. We've just had a few quarters in terms of making sure that we get the overall channel correct and put our miners separately. I hope that clarifies in terms of where we are, in terms of gaming seasonality.",358,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But overall, our data center business did phenomenal. Volta is doing extremely well. And even now with 32-bit, we're seeing tremendous adoption throughout. Again, remember it's very different than the overall consumer business. You have significant amount of time for qualification, and that is moving extremely fast based on a lot of other industries and their ability to qualify. So no, there is not a supply challenge at all in terms of our data center. And our overall growth in data center, we're extremely pleased with in terms of how the quarter came out.

The reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world. One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it's not any sovereign currency. And it's, in the digital world, it's distributed. And GeForce is the single largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet. Every gamer has a supercomputer in their PC. And GeForce is so broadly distributed, it's available everywhere. And so GeForce is really a good candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along. We try the best we can to go directly to the major miners, and the major miners. And they represent the vast majority of the demand. And to the best of our ability, serve their needs directly and we call that CMP, and that's why it's not called GeForce. They're called CMP. And we can serve those miners directly, hopefully, to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market. Because ultimately, what we would like is, we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down so that the gamers could benefit from the GeForces that we built for them. And the gaming demand is strong. I mean, the bottom line is, Fortnite is a home run. The bottom line is, PUBG is a home run. And the number of gamers that are enjoying these games is really astronomic, as people know very well. And it's a global phenomenon. These 2 games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe, as it is in the United States. And because you team up and this is a Battle Royale, you'd rather play with your friends. So it's incredibly social. It's incredibly sticky. And more and more -- more gamers that play, more of their friends join, and more of their friends join, more gamers that play. And so it's this positive feedback system, and the guys at Epic did a fantastic job creating Fortnite, and it's just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying. And so I think at the core of it, gaming is strong and we are looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel, so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce cards that has now been in short supply for over a quarter. And so the pent-up demand is quite significant, and I'm expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon.",411,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

This is a big week for NVIDIA. We just announced the biggest leap in GPU architecture in over a decade. We can't wait to tell you more about it, but first, let's talk about the quarter.
We had another strong quarter, led by data center and gaming. Q2 revenue reached $3.12 billion, up 40% from a year earlier. Each market platform, gaming, data center, pro visualization and automotive, hit record levels with strong growth both sequentially and year-on-year. These platforms collectively grew more than 50% year-on-year. Our revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $100 million while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $18 million, and we now expect a negligible contribution going forward.
Gross margins grew nearly 500 basis points year-on-year while both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. Profit nearly doubled.
From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 40% from last year to $2.66 billion. Tegra processor revenue grew 40% to $467 million. Let's start with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up 52% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. Growth was driven by all segments of the business with desktop, notebook and gaming consoles up all strong double-digit percentages year-on-year. 
Notebooks were a standout this quarter, with strong demands for thin and light form factors based on our Max-Q technology. Max-Q-enabled gaming PC OEMs to pack a high-performance GPU into a slim notebook that is just 20 millimeters thick or less. All major notebook OEMs and ODMs have adopted Max-Q for their top-of-the-line gaming notebooks, just in time for back-to-school. And we expect to see 26 models based on Max-Q in stores for the holidays.
The gaming industry remains vibrant. The eSports audience now approaches 400 million, up 18% over the past year. The unprecedented success of Fortnite and PUBG has popularized this new battle royale genre and expanded the gaming market. In fact, the battle royale mode is coming to games like the much-anticipated Battlefield V. We are thrilled to partner with EA to make GeForce the best PC-gaming platform for the release of Battlefield V in October. 
We have also partnered with Square Enix to make GeForce the best platform for its upcoming Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Monster Hunter: World arrived on PCs earlier this month and it was an instant hit. And many more titles are lined up for what promises to be a big holiday season.
It's not just new titles that are building anticipation. The gaming community is excited over the Turing architecture announced earlier this week at SIGGRAPH. Turing is our most important innovation since the invention of the CUDA GPU over a decade ago. The architecture includes new dedicated ray-tracing processors or RT cores and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing, which together will make real-time ray-tracing possible for the first time. We will enable the cinematic quality gaming, amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models.
Turing will reset the look of video games and open up the 250 billion visual effects industries to GPUs. Turing is the result of more than 10,000 engineering years to -- of effort. It's -- delivers up to 6x performance increase over Pascal for ray-traced graphics and up to 10x boost for peak inference flops. This new architecture will be the foundation of a new portfolio of products across our platforms going forward.
Moving to data center. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $760 million, accelerating to 83% year-on-year growth and up 8% sequentially. This performance was driven by hyperscale demand as Internet services used daily by billions of people increasingly leverage AI. Our GPUs power real-time services such as search, voice recognition, voice synthesis, translation, recommender engines, fraud detection and retail applications. 
We also saw a growing adoption of our AI and high-performance computing solutions by vertical industries, representing one of the most fastest areas of growth in our business. Companies in sectors ranging from oil and gas to financial services through transportation are harnessing the power of AI and our accelerating computing platform to turn data into actionable insights. 
Our flagship Tensor Core GPU, the Tesla V100, based on Volta architecture, continue to ramp for both AI and high-performance computing applications. Volta has been adopted by every major cloud provider and hyperscale data center operator around the world. Customers have quickly moved to qualify the new version of V100, which doubled the on-chip DRAM to 32-gig to support much larger data sets and neural networks. Major server OEMs, HP Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, Cray and Supermicro also brought the V100 32-gig to market in the quarter.
We continue to gain traction with AI inference solution, which helped expand our addressable market in the data center. During the quarter, we released our TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software for general availability. While prior versions of the TensorRT optimized image and video-related workloads, TensorRT 4 expands the aperture to include more use cases such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation and recommendation systems. This means we can now address a much larger portion of deep learning inference workloads, delivering up to 190x performance speed-up, relative to CPUs.
NVIDIA and Google engineers have integrated TensorRT into the TensorFlow deep learning framework, making it easier to run AI inference on our GPUs. And Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA Tesla P4 GPU, our small form factor GPU for AI inference and graphic virtualization, is available on Google Cloud Platform. 
Data center growth was also driven by DGX, our fully optimized AI server, which incorporates V100 GPUs, our proprietary high-speed interconnect and our fully optimized software stack. The annual run rate for DGX is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. DGX-2 announced in March at our GPU Technology Conference is being qualified by customers and is on track to ramp in the third quarter.
At GTC Taiwan in June, we announced that we are bringing DGX-2 technology to our HGX-2 server platform. We make HGX-2 available to OEM and ODM partners so they can quickly deploy our newest innovations in their own server designs. In recent weeks, we announced partnerships with NetApp and Pure Storage to help customers speed AI deployment from months to days or even hours, with highly integrated optimized solutions that combine DGX with the company's all-flash storage offerings and third-party networking.
At GTC Taiwan, we also revealed that we are -- set 5-speed records for AI training and inference. Key to our strategy is our software stack. From CUDA to our training and inference SDKs as well as our work with our developers to accelerate their applications, it is the reason we can achieve such dramatic performance gains in such a short period of time. And our developer ecosystem is getting stronger. In fact, we just passed 1 million members in our developer program, up 70% from 1 year ago.
One of our proudest moments this quarter was the launch of the Summit AI supercomputer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Summit is powered by over 27,000 Volta Tensor Core GPUs and helped the U.S. reclaim the #1 spot on the TOP500 Supercomputer list for the first time in 5 years. 
Other NVIDIA power systems joined the TOP500 list were Sierra at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the third spot, and the ABCI, Japan's fastest supercomputer in the fifth spot. NVIDIA now powers 5 of the world's 7 fastest supercomputers, reflecting the broad shift in supercomputing to GPUs. Indeed, the majority of the computing performance added to the latest Top 500 list comes from NVIDIA GPUs, and more than 550 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated. With our Tensor Core GPUs, supercomputers can now combine simulation with the power of AI to advance many scientific applications from molecular dynamics to seismic processing to genomics and materials science.
Moving to pro visualization. Revenue grew to $281 million, up 20% year-on-year and 12% sequentially driven by demand for real-time rendering and mobile workstations as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 35% of pro visualization sales. 
Strength extended across several key industries, including health care, oil and gas and media and entertainment. Key wins in the quarter include Raytheon, Lockheed, GE, Siemens and Philips Healthcare. 
In announcing the Turing architecture at SIGGRAPH, we also introduced the first Turing-based processors, the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs, bringing interactive ray tracing to the world years before it's been predicted. We also announced that the NVIDIA RTX server, a full ray-tracing global illumination rendering server that will give a giant boost to the world's render farms as Moore's Law ends.
Turing is set to revolutionize the work of 5 -- 50 million designers and artists, enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real time and add new AI-based capabilities to their work flows. Quadro GPUs based on the Turing will be available in the fourth quarter. Dozens of leading software providers, developers and OEMs have already expressed support for Turing. Our pro viz partners view it as a game-changer for professionals in the media and entertainment, architecture and manufacturing industries.
Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was a record $161 million, up 13% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagements around the globe as well as the ramp of next-generation AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions. 
We continue to make progress on our autonomous vehicle platform with key milestones and partnerships announced this quarter. In July, Daimler and Bosch selected DRIVE Pegasus as the AI brain for their Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous fleets. Pilot testing will begin next year in Silicon Valley. This collaboration brings together NVIDIA's leadership in AI and self-driving platforms, Bosch's hardware and systems expertise as the world's largest Tier 1 automotive supplier and Daimler's vehicle expertise and global brand synonymous with safety and quality.
This quarter, we started shipping development systems for DRIVE Pegasus, an AI supercomputer designed specifically for autonomous vehicles. Pegasus delivers 320 trillion operations per second to handle diverse and redundant algorithms and is architected for safety as well as performance. This automotive-grade functionally safe production solution uses 2 NVIDIA Xavier SoCs and 2 next-generation GPUs designed for AI and visual processing, delivering more than 10x greater performance and 10x higher data bandwidth compared to the previous generation. With co-designed hardware and software, the platform is created to achieve ASIL D ISO 26262, the industry's highest level of automotive functional safety.
We had created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of automated and autonomous driving from traffic jam pilots to Level 5 robo-taxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are using NVIDIA's automotive platform. With this growing momentum and accelerating revenue growth, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for autonomous driving business.
This quarter, we also introduced our Xavier platform for Jetson for the autonomous machine market. With more than 9 billion transistors, it delivers over 30 trillion operations per second, more processing capability than a powerful workstation while using 1/3 the energy of a lightbulb. Jetson Xavier establishes customers to deliver AI computing at the edge, powering autonomous machines like robots or drones with applications in manufacturing, logistics, retail, agricultural, health care and more.
Lastly, in our OEM segment, revenue declined by 54% year-on-year and 70% sequentially. This was primarily driven by the sharp decline of cryptocurrency revenues to fairly minimal levels.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP was 63.5%, in line with our outlook. GAAP operating expenses were $818 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $692 million, up 30% year-on-year. We can continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive. 
GAAP net income was $1.1 billion and EPS was $1.76, up 89% and 91%, respectively, from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate near 7% compared to our outlook of 11%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.21 billion and EPS was $1.94, up 90% and 92%, respectively, from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross and operating margin expansion and lower taxes. Quarterly cash flow from operations was $913 million. Capital expenditures were $128 million.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We are including no contribution from crypto in our outlook. We expect revenue to be $3.25 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.6% and 62.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $870 million and $730 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $20 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million to $150 million.
Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, I'd like to highlight some of the upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Citi's Global Technology Conference on September 6 and meeting with the financial community at our GPU Technology Conferences in Tokyo on September 13 and Munich on October 10. And our next earnings calls to discuss our financial results is in the third quarter of 2019 will take place on November 15.

So first of all, Turing, as you know, is the world's first ray-tracing GPU. And it completes our new computer graphics platform, which is going to reinvent computer graphics altogether. It unites 4 different computing modes: rasterization, accelerated ray tracing, computing with CUDA and artificial intelligence. It uses these 4 basic methods to create imagery for the future. There's 2 different -- 2 major ways that we'll experience the benefits right away. The first is for the markets of visualization today, they require photorealistic images. Whether it's an IKEA catalog or a movie or architectural engineering or product design, car design, all of these types of markets require photorealistic images. And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray tracing with physically based materials and lighting. The technology is rather complicated. It's been computing-intensive for a very long time. And it wasn't until now that we've been able to achieve it in a productive way. And so Turing has the ability to do ray tracing, accelerated ray tracing, and it also has the ability to combine very large frame buffers because these data sets are extremely large. And so that marketplace is quite large and it's never been served by GPUs before until now. All of that has been run on CPU render farms, gigantic render farms in all these movie studios and service centers and so on and so forth. The second area where you're going to see the benefits of ray tracing, we haven't announced.",252,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

And this platform has those 4 computation methods that I described for generating images. We've put that platform out with the support of Microsoft. They call it the Microsoft DirectX Raytracing and the major game engine companies. Epic has implemented real-time ray tracing and the RTX into the Epic engine, the Unreal Engine. And at GDC and GTC, we demonstrated, for the very first time, on 4 Volta GPUs, on 4 Volta GPUs, the ability to do that. And it was the intention of -- to get this platform out to all of the game developers. And we've been working with game developers throughout this time. Thus, this week at SIGGRAPH, we announced Quadro, which is the first -- the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000, the world's first accelerated ray-tracing GPUs. And I demonstrated one Quadro running the same application that we demonstrated on 4 Volta GPUs running in March. And the performance is really spectacular. And so I think the answer to your question is developers all have access to RTX. It's in Microsoft's DirectX. It's in the most popular game engine in the world, and you're going to start to see developers use it. On the workstation side, on the professional digitalization side, all of the major ISPs have jumped on to adopt it. And at SIGGRAPH this year, where you could see a whole bunch of developers demonstrating the NVIDIA RTX with accelerated ray tracing, generating photorealistic images. And so I would say that in no platform in our history has, on day 1 of announcement, had so many developers jump onto it. And stay tuned, we've got a lot more stories to tell you about RTX.",303,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

But if you look at the balance sheet, I think the inventory level is up by around mid-30s percent sequentially and you're guiding revenue up 3% or so. Maybe you could help us sort of walk through the contribution to that inventory and what it might mean for future products. And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the gaming channel in terms of inventory, how things are looking in the channel as you guys see it during this period of product transition.",120,-3.0,6.0,0.3333333333333333,0.6

Thanks for your question. So when you look at our inventory on the balance sheet, I think it's generally consistent with what you have seen over the last several months in terms of what we will be bringing to market. Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture, and as you know, it will be with us for some time. So I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that. And don't forget our work in terms of data center and what we have for Volta is also a very, very complex computer, in some cases, in terms of what we have also in terms of there. So just those things together, plus our Pascal architecture is still here, makes up almost all of what we have there in terms of inventory.",134,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And that inventory is well positioned for back-to-school and the building season that's coming up on Q3. And so I feel pretty good about that. The rest of our product launches and the ramp-up of Turing is going really well. And so I think the rest of the announcements we haven't made, but stay tuned.

On the clarification, Colette, if you could also help us understand the gross margin sequencing from Q2 to Q3. And then, Jensen, how would you contrast the Pascal cycle, the Turing cycle? Because I think in your remarks, you mentioned Turing is a very strong advancement over what you had before. But when you launched Pascal, you had guided to very strong Q3s and then Q4s. This time, the Q3 outlook, even though it's good on an absolute basis, on a sequential and a relative basis, it's perhaps not as strong.

Let me start first with your question regarding gross margins. We have essentially reached, as we move into Q3, a normalization of our gross margins. I believe, over the last several quarters, we have seen the impacts of crypto and what that can do to elevate our overall gross margins. We believe we had reached a normal period as we're looking forward to essentially no cryptocurrency as we move forward.",78,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Pascal, relative to Maxwell, was a leap in fact. And it was a really significant upgrade. The architectures were largely the same. They were both programmable shading, they were both at the same generation programmable shading. But Pascal was much, much more energy efficient. I think it was something like 30%, 40% more energy-efficient than Maxwell, and that translated to performance benefits to customers. The success of Pascal was fantastic. There's just simply no comparison to Turing. Turing is a reinvention of computer graphics. It is the first ray-tracing GPU in the world. It's the first GPU that will be able to ray trace light in an environment and create photorealistic shadows and reflections and be able to model things like area lights and global illumination and indirect lighting. But the images are going to be so subtle and so beautiful, it -- when you look at it, it just looks like a movie. And yet it's backwards compatible with everything that we've done. This new hybrid rendering model, which extends what we've built before but added to it 2 new capabilities, artificial intelligence and accelerated ray tracing, is just fantastic. So everything of the past will be brought along and benefits, and it's going to create new visuals that were impossible before. We also did a good job on laying the foundations of the development platform for the developers. We've partnered with Microsoft to create DXR. Vulkan RT is also coming, and we have optics that are used by pro viz renderers and developers all over the world. And so we have the benefit of laying the foundation stack by stack by stack over the years. And as a result, on the day that Turing comes out, we're going to have a richness of applications that gamers will be able to enjoy. You mentioned guidance. I actually think that on a year-over-year performance, we're doing terrific. And I'm super excited about the ramp of Turing. It is the case that we benefited in the last several quarters from an unusual lift from crypto. In the beginning of the year, we thought and we projected that crypto would be a larger contribution through the rest of the year, but at this time, we consider it to be immaterial for the second half. And so that makes comparisons on a sequential basis on, I guess, a quarterly sequential basis harder. But on a year-to-year basis, I think we're doing terrific. Every single one of our platforms are growing. High-performance computing, of course, data centers is growing. AI, the adoption continues to sweep from one industry to another industry. The automation that's going to be brought about by AI is going to bring productivity gains to industries like nobody's ever seen before. And now with Turing, we're going to be able to reignite the professional visualization business, open us up to photorealistic rendering for the very first time, render farms and everybody who's designing products that has to visualize it photo realistically, to reinventing and resetting graphics for video games. And so I think we're in a great position, and I'm looking forward to reporting Q3 when the time comes.",535,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

You are correct that our data center results that we see is always a tremendous unique mix every single quarter in terms of what we're seeing. There's still some underlying points of that, that will likely continue. The growth in terms of use by the hyperscales, continued industry by industry coming on board essentially just because the needs of accelerated computing for the workloads and for the data that they have is so essential. So we still expect, as we go into Q3, for data center to grow both sequentially and year-over-year.

Atif, let me just add a little bit more to that. I think the one simple way to think about that is this. In the transportation industry, let's take one particular vertical. There are 2 dynamics that are happening that are very abundantly clear and that will transform that industry. The first, of course, is ride hailing and ride sharing. Those platforms, in order to make the recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger to which customer, is a really large computing problem. It's a machine-learning problem. It's an optimization problem, a very, very large scale and in every -- in each and every one of those instances, you need high-performance computers to use machine learning to figure out how to make that perfect match or the most optimal match. On the second -- the second is self-driving cars. Every single car company that's working on robo-taxis or self-driving cars needs to collect data, label data, train a neural network or train a whole bunch of neural networks and to run those neural networks in cars. And so you just make your list of how many people are actually building self-driving cars. And every single one of them will need even more GPU-accelerated servers. And that's just for developing the model. Then the next stage is to simulate the entire software because we know that the industry or the world travels 10 trillion miles per year. And the best we could possibly do is to drive several million normal miles. And what we really want to do is to be able to simulate and stress, stress-test our software stack and the only way to do that is doing virtual reality. And so that's another supercomputer that you have to build for simulating all your software costs, those billions and billions of virtually created challenging miles. And then lastly, before you OTA the software, you're going to have to re-sim and replay against all of the miles that you've collected over the years to make sure that you have no regressions before you OTA the new models into a fleet of cars. And so transportation is going to be a very large industry. Health care is the same way, from medical imaging does now using AI just about everywhere to genomics that has discovered deep learning and the benefits of artificial intelligence and in the future, pathology. The list goes on. And so industry after industry after industry, we're discovering the benefits of deep learning and the industries could be really revolutionized by it.",428,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

So for short term, as you think about your gaming guide, are you embedding any drawdown of channel inventory there? And then longer term, as you think about Turing Tensor Cores, can you talk a bit about differentiation versus Volta -- V100, especially as you think about 8-bit integer and the opportunities there for inferencing?",63,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

We are masters at managing our channel, and we understand the channel very well. As you know, the way that we go to market is through the channels around the world. We're not concerned about the channel inventory. As we ramp Turing, any -- whenever we ramp a new architecture, we ramp it from the top down. And so we have plenty of opportunities as the -- as we go back to the back-to-school and the gaming cycle to manage the inventory, so we feel pretty good about that. As a result, comparing Volta and Turing, CUDA's compatible. That's one of the benefits of CUDA. CUDA -- all of the applications that take advantage of CUDA that are written on top of cuDNN, which is our deep neural network platform to TensorRT that takes advantage -- that takes the output of the frameworks and optimize it for run time. All of those tools and libraries run on top of Volta and run on top of Turing and run on top of Pascal. What Turing adds over Pascal is the same Tensor Core that is inside Volta. Of course, Volta is designed for large-scale training. 8 GPUs could be connected together. They have the fastest HBM2 memories, and it's designed for data center applications, has 64-bit double-precision ECC, high-resilience computing and all of the software and system software capability and tools that make Volta the perfect high-performance computing accelerator. In the case of Turing, it's really designed for 3 major applications. The first application is to open up pro visualization, which is a really large market that has historically used render farms and were really unable to use GPUs until we now have the ability to do full path trace, global illumination with very, very large data sets. So that's one market that's brand new as a result of Turing. The second market is to reinvent computer graphics, real-time computer graphics, for video games and other real-time visualization applications. When you see the images created by Turing, you're going to have a really hard time wanting to see the images of the past. It just looks amazing. And then the third, Turing has a really supercharged Tensor Core. And this Tensor Core is used for image generation. It's also used for high throughput deep learning inferencing for data centers. And so these applications for Turing, which suggest that there are multiple SKUs of Turing, which is one of the reasons why we have such a great engineering team, we could scale one architecture across a whole lot of platforms at one time. And so I hope that answers your question. The Tensor Core inference capability of Turing is going to be off the charts.",463,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It's hard to estimate no matter what. But the second question, the answer is we're expecting -- we're projecting 0 basically. And for the first question, how much of GeForce could have been used for crypto, a lot of gamers at night, they could -- while they're sleeping, they could do some mining. And so whether they buy it for mining or do they buy it for gaming, it's kind of hard to say. And some miners were unable to buy our OEM products, and so they jumped onto the market to buy it from retail. And that probably happened a great deal as well. And that all happened in the last -- the previous several quarters, probably starting from Q -- late Q3, Q4, Q1 and very little last quarter, and we're projecting no crypto mining going forward.",169,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

Jensen, I was hoping you could remind us how meaningful your inference business is today within data center and how you would expect growth to come about over the next 2 years as you -- as your success at accounts like Google proliferate across a broader set of customers. And then for Colette, if you can give directional guidance for each of your platforms. I know you talked about data center a little bit, but if you can talk about the other segments. And on gaming specifically, if you can talk about whether or not new products are embedded in that guide.",111,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Aug 16, 2018",2018-08-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3732.0,1546024.0,61054334.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,28,"Thanks, Toshiya. Inference is going to be a very large market for us. It is surely material now in our data center business. It's not the largest segment, but I believe it's going to be a very large segment of our data center business. There are 30 million servers around the world, let's kind of estimate, in the cloud, and there are a whole lot more in enterprises. I believe that almost every server in the future will be accelerated. And the reason for that is because artificial intelligence and deep learning software and neural net models are going to -- prediction models are going to be infused into software everywhere. And acceleration has proven to be the best approach going forward. We've been laying the foundations for inferencing for a couple -- 2, 3 years. And as we've described at GTCs, inference is really, really complicated. And the reason for that is you have to take the output of these massive, massive networks that are output of the training frameworks and optimize it. This is the -- probably the largest computational graph optimization problem the world's ever seen. And this is brand-new invention territory. There are so many different network architectures from CNNs to RCNNs to autoencoders to RNNs and LSTMs, there is just so many different species of neural networks these days, and it's continuing to grow. And so the compiler technology is really, really complicated. And this year, we announced 2 things. Earlier this year, we announced that we've been successful in taking the Tesla P4 low-profile high-energy efficiency inference accelerator into hyperscale data centers. And we announced our fourth generation TensorRT optimizing compiler -- neural network optimizing compiler. And TRT 4 goes well beyond CNNs and image recognition in the beginning. It now allows us to support and optimize for voice recognition or speech recognition, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, translation. And all of these applications are really pervasive from Internet services all over the world. And so now from images to video to voice to recommendation systems, we now have a compiler that can address it. We are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack. And the reason for that is because they need high throughput and, very importantly, they need low latency. Voice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that. And then this last week -- this week, we announced Turing. And I announced that the inference performance of Turing is 10x the inference performance of Pascal, which is already a couple of hundred times the inference performance of CPUs. And so you take a look at the rate at which we're moving, both in the support of new neural networks, the ever-increasing optimization and performance output of the compilers and the rate at which we're advancing our processors, I think we're raising the bar pretty high, okay? So with that, Colette?",508,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

So when you look at our overall segment, as you will have seen our results in terms of this last Q2, there was growth across every single one of our platforms from a year-over-year standpoint. We probably possibly see that again in our Q3 guidance, the year-over-year growth across each and every one of those platforms. Of course, our OEM business will be down likely year-over-year again just due to the absence of cryptocurrency in our forecast. When we think about sequentially, our hopes is absolutely, our data center will grow and we'll likely see the growth of our gaming business as well. It's still early, still we've got many different scenarios and -- on our pro viz and auto.

Colette, I just want to make sure I understood, July to October gross margins down. I know you've been getting a benefit from crypto, but it's pretty de minimis in July. Just is there any other moving pieces? And then kind of longer picture here, how do you think about the ramp of Turing affecting gross margins? You're obviously enabling a lot of capabilities. You get paid for it, 12-nanometers, fairly stable. Just kind of curious how to think about over the next couple of quarters gross margin with that ramp.",95,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So let me take your first part of the question regarding our gross margins and what we had seen from crypto. Although crypto revenue may not be large, it still has a derivative impact on our stock in terms of what we are selling to both replenish the overall channel and such. So over the last several quarters that we have stabilizing that overall channel, we did get the great effect of selling just about everything, and our margins really been able to benefit from that. Again, when we look at the overall growth year-over-year for Q2, you have 500 basis points in terms of growth. We're excited about what we have now here for Q3 as well, which is also significant growth year-over-year. Of course, we have our high value-added platforms as we move forward, both those in data center, those in terms of what we expect the effects of Turing in terms of -- on our Quadro piece as well. But that will take some time for that all to partake. So we'll see how that goes. We haven't announced anything further at this time.

Demand is continuing to grow at historical levels of 10x computing demand. Computing demand is increasing at historical levels of 10x every 5 years. 10x every 5 years is approximately Moore's Law. And computing demand continues to grow at 10x every 5 years, however, Moore's Law stopped. And so that gap in the world in high-performance computing, in medical imaging, in life sciences computing, in artificial intelligence, that gap -- because those applications demand more computing capability, that gap can only be served in another way. And NVIDIA's GPU accelerated computing that we pioneered really stands to benefit from that. And so at the highest level, whether it's supercomputing -- and this year, you heard Colette say earlier that NVIDIA GPUs represented 56% of all the new performance that came into the world's TOP500. The TOP500 is called the TOP500 because it reflects the future computing. And my expectation is that more and more from one vertical industry after another -- and I mentioned transportation, I mentioned health care, the vertical industries go on and on, that as computing demand continues at a factor of 10x every 5 years, developers are rational and logical to have jumped on NVIDIA's GPU computing to boost their demand. I think that's probably the best way to answer it.",240,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

HGX-2 is doing incredibly well for all the reasons that you mentioned. It is -- and even the largest hyperscale data centers can't afford to create these really complicated motherboards at the scale that we're talking about. And so we created HGX-2 and it was immediately adopted by several most important hyperscalers in the world. And we were at GTC Taiwan, and we announced basically all of the leading server OEMs and ODMs supporting HGX-2 and are ready to take it to market. So we're in the process of finishing the -- finishing HGX-2 and ramping it into production. And so I think HGX-2 is a huge success for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. We could use it for essentially a standard motherboard like the ATX motherboard for PCs that could be used for hyperscalers, it can be used for HPC, it could be used for data centers.

Well, the crypto mining market is very different today than it was 3 years ago. And even though new cards -- at the current prices, it doesn't make much sense for new cards to be sold into the mining market. The existing capacity is still being used, and you could see that the hash rates continue. And so my sense is that the installed base of miners will continue to use their cards. And then probably the more important factor though is that we're in the process of announcing a brand-new way of doing computer graphics. And with the -- with Turing and the RTX platform, computer graphics will never be the same. And so I think this -- our new generation of new GPUs is really going to do great. I also think that I appreciate Elon's comments about our company, and I also think Tesla makes great cars, and I drive them very happily. And with respect to the next generation, it is the case that when we first started working on autonomous vehicles, they needed our help. And we used the 3-year-old Pascal GPU for the current generation of autopilot computers. And it is very clear now that in order to have a safe autopilot system, we need a lot more computing horsepower. In order to have safe computing -- in order to have safe driving, the algorithms have to be rich, it has to be able to handle corner conditions in a lot of diverse situations. And every time that there's more and more corner conditions or more subtle things that you have to do or you have to drive more smoothly or be able to take turns more quickly, all of those requirements require greater computing capability. And that's exactly the reason why we built Xavier. Xavier is in production now. We're seeing great success, and customers are super excited about Xavier. And that's exactly the reason why we built it. And I think it's super hard to build Xavier and all the software stack on top of it. And if it doesn't turn out -- for whatever reason, it doesn't turn out for them, you can give me a call, and I'd be more than happy to help.",375,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Q3 revenue reached $3.18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier, with all 4 of our market platforms growing double digits. Data center, professional visualization and automotive all hit record levels. However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize. 
Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipments in the midrange Pascal segment to allow channel inventory to normalize. In Q4, we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle. While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind, it does not change our long-term fundamentals. Our competitive position is as strong as ever, and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcements. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars.
GAAP gross margins grew 90 basis points year-on-year and non-GAAP gross margins rose 130 basis points. This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter. 
From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $2.77 billion. Tegra processor revenue was down 3% to $407 million.
Let's continue with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.76 billion was up 13% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales, which more than offset gaming console declines. In mid-September, we began shipping GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture. Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor, Pascal, and 6x more for ray-traced graphics. These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs.
The first 2 GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080, delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles, a major milestone for gamers. This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points. These 2 end -- 2 high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce [ 27 D ]. NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before. The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing, enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs. With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features, RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture.
Although the cryptocurrency wave has ended, the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize. Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX. However, on midrange Pascal gaming cards, both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected. Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays, and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or 2.
Moving to data center. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $792 million, up 58% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. Demand remains strong for Volta architecture products, including Tesla V100 and VGX systems, and our inference business continued to grow, benefiting from the launch of the Turing T4 Cloud GPU during the quarter. Just 2 months after its launch, the T4 has received the fastest adoption of any server GPU. It is integrated into 57 server designs and it is already on the Google Cloud Platform, its first cloud availability. The T4 delivers world record performance for deep learning inference and accelerates diverse cloud workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, machine learning, data analytics and graphics.
We also announced an updated TensorRT software stack and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Platform. This new software includes 2 critically important capabilities that can drive deployment of the NVIDIA inference platform at scale in hyperscale data centers. First, it enables multiple models and multiple frameworks to run on the same GPU at the same time. This can drive higher data center utilization, directly translating to significant savings. Second, it integrates with Kubernetes, the leading orchestration layer for hyperscale data centers.
Completing our inference platform, the new T4 GPU delivers 12x the peak inference performance of its T4 predecessor. All told, our inference platform delivers 40x faster performance in CPUs. And with the TensorRT software stack, it is ideally suited for hyperscale data centers. With this launch, NVIDIA is poised to take the data center inference market, targeting every server node in the hyperscale data centers.
Another important launch for the quarter was the NVIDIA RTX Server reference architecture, which incorporates up to 8 Turing-based RTX 8000. With this product, Turing opens a new market to GPOs, photoreal rendering or the creation of computer-generated images that look real. Rendering is instrumental to large industries, such as media and entertainment, retail, product designs, manufacturing and architecture. Yet prior to Turing and its ray-tracing capabilities, GPUs were not able to address this workload. So most rendering at -- up to this point has been done on CPUs. An RTX-accelerated render farm compared with an equivalent performance CPU render farm is 1/4 the cost, 1/10 the space and 1/11 the power. NVIDIA's RTX platform has garnered major industry support, including from key developers such as Adobe, ANSYS, Autodesk, Dassault and many others.
Lastly, NVIDIA announced a GPU acceleration platform for data science and machine learning called RAPIDS, which enables companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed. Up until now, data analytics and machine learning has been the largest high-performance computing applications not to have been accelerated. Virtually all enterprise use data analytics to extract insight from big data for a wide range of use cases, such as predicting credit card fraud, forecasting retail inventory and understanding customer buying behavior. RAPIDS is an open source suite of libraries for GPU-accelerated analytics, machine learning and, soon, data visualization. With RAPIDS, NVIDIA GPUs can now accelerate machine learning, as we have done with deep learning, with performance up to 50x faster than CPUs. The RAPIDS launch opens up a $20 billion server market used for data analytics and machine learning workloads to GPUs, and it's received broad industry support, including from Oracle, IBM, SAP, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure machine learning, Google, Q-Flow as well as the open source community.
With one unified architecture and ecosystem, NVIDIA GPUs can address the redefined high-performance computing market, including scientific computing, deep learning and machine learning. Our GPUs and software stack accelerate a broad and diverse set of workloads, ranging from scale-up software in supercomputers to scale out deployments in hyperscale data centers. Just earlier this week, this capability was on display at Supercomputing Conference in Dallas, where the number of systems on the TOP500 supercomputer list using NVIDIA GPUs jumped 48% from last year, including the #1 and #2 systems in the world.
Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached a record $305 million, up 28% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Strength extended across the desktop and mobile as well as several key industries, including the public sector, manufacturing and architecture, engineering and construction. 
At SIGGRAPH in August, we announced our Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs based on the Turing architecture. And earlier this week, we introduced the Quadro RTX 4000, the most advanced professional GPU priced under $1,000. These GPUs will revolutionize the work of 50 million designers and artists by enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real-time and leveraging AI in their workflows. The Quadro RTX series started shipping in Q3, with the server-grade, high-end products recognized in data center. We already engaged with a range of customers on RTX, including the major movie studios and game developers, and the reaction has been very positive.
Finally, turning to automotive. Automotive sales in Q3 reached $172 million, up 19% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagement in addition to the ramp of next-generation, AI-based cockpit infotainment systems.
At GTC Europe, we announced that Volvo Cars selected NVIDIA's DRIVE AGX Xavier next-generation -- for next-generation Volvo Cars. The initial production release slated for the early 2020s will deliver Level 2+ assisted driving features, integrating 360-degree surround perception and a driver monitoring system. This is our first Level 2 mass-market car design win. In addition to Volvo, global automotive suppliers, Continental and Veoneer, announced that they have selected NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for their autonomous driving systems. Lastly, our DRIVE AGX Xavier development kit started shipping in this quarter. This is the world's first autonomous driving platform, and it can run our NVIDIA DRIVE software for autonomous driving, including data collection, 360-degree surround perception, advanced driver monitoring and in-vehicle visualization. With this platform, customers have developed and test their autonomous driving solutions and then easily move into production. We are excited about the AV opportunity as we look into next year and beyond.
Moving to the rest of the P&L and the balance sheet. Q3 gross margins was 60.4% and non-GAAP was 61%, below our outlook due to the $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff in crypto demand. GAAP operating expenses were $863 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $730 million, up 28% year-on-year. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, data center and automotive. 
GAAP net income was $1.23 billion, and EPS was $1.97, up 48% from a year earlier. GAAP net income benefited from the reduction of $138 million in our U.S. tax reform transition tax amount as well as other discrete tax items. Non-GAAP net income was $1.15 billion and EPS was $1.84, up 38% from a year ago, reflecting revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as lower income tax expense. 
Accounts receivable was $2.22 billion compared to $1.66 billion in the prior quarter as Turing's RTX shipments began in the latter part of the quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $1.42 billion compared to $1.09 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting the ramp in production of Turing products.
Quarterly cash flow from operations was $487 million. Capital expenditures were $150 million. This fiscal year, we have returned $1.13 billion to shareholders through the end of Q3. We've announced a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 effective in Q4 of fiscal 2019. We are also pleased to announce an increase of $7 billion to our share repurchase authorization and that we intend to return an additional $3 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2020.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As noted earlier, our revenue outlook is impacted by the expected work-down of Pascal midrange gaming card inventory in the channel. In addition, we expect a decline in our gaming console revenue given seasonal build patterns. Keep in mind that the midrange desktop portfolio is typically about 1/3 of our gaming business. Our outlook assumes that channel inventory weeks approach normal levels exiting Q4 and that gaming and demand increases in Q4 compared with Q3.
Now in total, we expect revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.3% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $915 million and $755 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $21 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $190 million to $210 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. 
In closing, I'd like to highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 6, and we will be meeting with the financial community at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 8 through 11. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 will take place on February 14.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?",2113,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

There seems to be some concern around a near-term slowdown in cloud spending. But on the flip side, we're hearing that the NVIDIA team is actually seeing pretty strong demand, near term, from some of your China cloud customers for your Tesla-based products. So I just wanted to get your views on cloud data center dynamics and the trajectory into the January quarter.",82,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The -- if you look at the background of what's happening, we know that Moore's Law has ended. And while demand for computing continues to grow and more and more of the data center is running machine learning algorithms, which is computationally really intensive, the only way to increase computational demand -- or computational resource is to buy more computers, buy more CPUs because each one of those CPUs aren't getting much faster. And so as a result of that, the data center CapEx would have to go up. The alternative, which is the alternative that we offer and is one of the reasons why the adoption of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform is growing so fast, is because the approach that we provide allows for a path forward beyond Moore's Law. There are several things that we have done this last quarter that I think is really fantastic. The first is the introduction of a new computing platform, new accelerated platform called RAPIDS. And as you know very well that the vast majority of the industry today, although are super excited about deep learning, deep learning as a method for artificial intelligence is very data-intensive. And in areas where there's a lot of domain expertise, where there's -- whether it's in retail or whether it's in financial services or health care, logistics, there's a fair amount of domain expertise, and the amount of data that they have to fuse together to train a model is quite high. The approach using traditional machine learning is quite successful. That has never been accelerated before. And we worked with the open source community over the course of the last several years to pull together an entire stack that starts from Apache Arrow, the Dask parallel distributed computing engine, and then all of our CUDA and all of our algorithms that run on top of that. We now have an accelerated machine learning platform. That's a brand-new platform, and the excitement around that is really quite incredible. The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much, much more affordable way than Moore's Law would have allowed. And then the third, which we just announced recently, is our first Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU. And along with all of the software stack that we've put on top of it, Kubernetes, the Docker, the TRT inference engine, our second-generation Tensor Core, AI accelerator, all of that together has created a lot of excitement in data center. So I'm expecting our data center business to be -- to continue to do quite well.",443,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And then just on the high-end Turing products that the team started rolling out in October, early demand actually seems to be quite strong. And I think part of it is just the lineup of AAA-rated games. eSports continue to be strong as well, obviously a big motivator for your enthusiast-class gamers. I know the team is, near term, kind of working down midrange Pascal cards, but do you anticipate your Turing-based RTX product families to drive sequential growth in the January quarter just what appears to be pretty strong demand pull for these products?",96,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

It introduced real-time ray-tracing. It's the first GPU to -- gaming GPU to include artificial intelligence. At every single price point it serves, it is substantially higher performance than the last and it's the highest performance GPU in the world. And all the great content are coming. Today, I think it is -- or yesterday, I think it was, the Battlefield V was released with real-time ray-tracing, the world's first application to support real-time ray-tracing. So I -- we expect Turing to do really well. As we go on, surely, we'll bring Turing deeper into the mainstream. And so we don't have anything to announce today, but as usual, we want to bring a brand-new architecture to as many gamers as possible.",142,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I commented about the overall size of what we have traditionally seen in terms of the midrange over a fairly large period of time because keep in mind, the launches of products quarter-to-quarter have changed that. So it has been about 1/3 consistently over, let's say, about an 8-quarter period of time. And we think that's a good number for you to use as we look at our guidance in terms of Q4. From an overall console perspective, we again have seen about -- in the hundreds and sometimes more than that in prior quarters.

The ProVis platform, more -- there's more content ever being created that is digitally created. And most photographs -- what appears to be photographs are rendered in software. Almost every catalog, every video, every movie, every TV show now has a great deal of digital rendering in it. And until now, it's not been possible to do the rendering in an accelerated way. So RTX is the world's first accelerated ray-tracing GPU, and the enthusiasm from the digital content creation market is really, really great. I surely expect that -- and as I was mentioning earlier, that it's been close to a decade that the workstation industry has not had a fundamental platform architecture change.

We expected the pricing in the marketplace to decline. It declined slower than we expected and -- but while it was declining, we were expecting sales volume to grow, demand to grow and for pricing to be -- for volume to be elastic with pricing. I think it just took longer than -- the pricing took longer than we expected, and the volume increase took longer than we expected. At this point, most of the pricing has come down to its -- and slightly below its prelaunch levels. And so I'm hoping that -- I'm hopeful that now that pricing has stabilized, that customers will come back and buy. I guess when pricing is volatile in the channel, it probably freezes some people waiting for prices to stabilize, and that took longer than we expected frankly. But now that it's at the right levels, our expectation is that the market will return to normal. 1060 is the #1 selling graphics card in the world, and we decided not to sell any more into the channel for the upcoming quarter to give the channel an opportunity to sell through the inventory it has.

Prices started to drift down, and we expected to come down much more quickly than it did and -- but -- and when it went down, we expected demand to come up much more quickly than it did. And so I think the channel wanted to protect its price. People were uncertain about crypto, and demand was uncertain about when the price will be stabilized. And so all of that uncertainty, I think, froze the market a little longer than we expected. Pricing is now down to below prelaunch normal levels. And so I am hopeful that we're going to see demand come back and the sell-through will happen through the holidays. And we're seeing that.

This is the most substantial new technology that computer graphics has seen in a decade. Real-time ray-tracing is something that everybody had dreamed about for a long time. It's never seen before. And today with Battlefield V, people are enjoying real-time ray-tracing for the very, very first time. And the images are beautiful. So the ramp is great. Of course, Turing ramped into -- towards the end of the quarter and into a much more different situation than any GPU of the past. But nonetheless, the demand on the high-end products are fantastic. The 2080 Tis are largely sold out. I think it's still sold out everywhere. And so I think that the demand is great. I'm expecting it to be just a fantastic new generation. In terms of the content, you saw the first one. FINAL FANTASY is also out. And we have a pipeline, about 30 of them. We're working hard on that. And so when they -- when these games get released, RTX will be enabled. But I will say one last thing, which is content aside, RTX is higher performing at the same price point than any graphics card on the planet. And so at every single graphics -- every single price point, it is the highest performing graphics card. So it is unambiguously the highest performance GPU in the world and then -- and of course, all of these great new features will be coming.",258,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And so it played no role in its transition. It's all about crypto hangover. This is the new experience as we made this transition. If you look at Turing on -- just on the basis of Turing, it had a great launch. We ramped it at the end of the quarter, as we expected. It was back-end loaded, as we expected, and the ramp was great. Everybody did a great job. And the performance is fantastic, and the excitement is great. And so I think Turing's ramp was a big success. It's -- underneath Turing was choppy, as we're talking about. And we really didn't see that until towards the end of the quarter. And as we looked out into this quarter, this coming quarter, we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is just not to ship any more products into this segment of the marketplace because there's a fair amount of inventory and let the channel sell through the midrange Pascals. And then a quarter's time, we'll get back to business. And so I think -- I knew this is surely a setback, and I wish we had seen it earlier, in the final analysis can't be exactly sure what we would have done different. But between the unexpected, unanticipated slow decline of pricing in the channel and even after the prices came down, it took a little longer than we expected for volume to kick up.

If I look back over the past several quarters, let's say you've been running at roughly a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion revenue level since the October '17 quarter. Prior to that, you were at $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We look like we're now going back to that level. I guess, the question is, do we build off of that level? Do we bring back half of the inventory burn? How do I think about the return of year-over-year growth in that gaming piece of the business as we start to look into fiscal 2020? 
And then a quick second question. Over the past few years, you've had really strong seasonal sequential growth in the data center business, in Q4, about 20% sequentially. I'm just curious, how is your guide factoring in the sequential growth in that piece of the business into this current quarter?",159,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Let me take the second one first. Our data center business is doing great. I mean, the fundamental dynamics of accelerated computing is spot on. And with Moore's Law coming to an end, it's the path forward. Take a look at the number of systems in the TOP500, 127 systems, I think, this year was, a growth of nearly 50% year-over-year. We're the #1 system in United States and the world, in Europe, in Japan. We're 22 out of the top 25 most energy-efficient computers in the world. And then this quarter, we announced 3 new initiatives that's going to expand us into a broader part of the high-performance computing market with machine learning, which is -- as we know, is the largest part of artificial intelligence today, which has not been accelerated and now it is. The second is the ability to do rendering for film, photorealistic rendering for the first time. And then the third is a brand-new cloud GPU, we call T4, that the enthusiasm around it is just incredible. And from the time that we went to production to the time that Google put it in their cloud was literally 30 days. It's just an incredible speed of adoption. And so I expect T4 to do quite well. So I think our data center business dynamics are really quite great. In terms of forecast, we'll just see how it turns out. But I think the fundamental dynamics are great.

There's nothing fundamentally different about the gaming market that we know. Cryptocurrency is an extraordinary factor that we all have to just internalize as it is. And we thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics. But when the prices came down -- started to come down and we hoped the demand would start to reflect the declining price, it just took longer than we expected. And that's what we're experiencing. In terms of the gaming marketplace, if you take a look at some of the dynamics, our notebook gaming, which is not affected by crypto, grew 50% year-over-year in China. And so the gaming market seems quite robust. RTX is going to unquestionably redefine gaming computer graphics. And so I think that the dynamics are good. We have to work through the channel inventories. This quarter, of course, we had the simultaneous decision of not shipping any more midrange products into the channel as well as seasonal -- normal seasonal console build plans. And they tend to build out a quarter before the holiday season. So you have these 2 simultaneous effects.

And the inference model is really complicated. This is one of the things that I've talked about in the past that on the one hand, people think that inference appears to be simple because there are so many ASICs built being talked about. The vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top. The TensorRT, fifth-generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took 3, 4 years to build. And then on top of that, in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google -- Google's cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server, an inference server, that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud. That piece of software is also super complicated to write. And so the pieces of technology that we're putting together have come together. And now we're engaged with Internet companies around the world to port their most heavy workload applications on top -- or models on top of T4. And so we're working hard on that. And when that happens, it comes down to their decision of how many they would like to buy, and that tells us about our adoption rate. I think from a high-level perspective, if we step back for a second, the high-level -- the way to look at it is this: that we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end, and at the same time, we also know that more and more data centers are deploying deep learning models and machine learning models into their data center. And it's computationally really intensive. And at this time and as we look out into the horizon, the T4 Cloud GPU is just unquestionably the most effective. It can run models, whether it's an image model or a recommendation model or a speech synthesis model. It is the highest throughput processor in the world at 70 watts, which fits into a hyperscale data center OCP server. It is also the lowest latency of any processor at inferencing in the world at less than 1 millisecond. And so between the architecture, all of the software technology and all of the software capabilities we put in place and the fact that the conditions would suggest that Internet companies need an accelerated path forward, I think T4 is really well positioned.

Volvo is our first announcement, our first win in high-volume, early 2020s production ramp. And I'm expecting many more.

And if so, could they present any kind of inventory risk either later this year or in early fiscal '20? 
And then the question really, Jen-Hsun, is trying to get a better understanding of how you see the intermediate-term growth rate of the data center business. You had spectacular high-performance compute TOP500 accelerator penetration performance up 50-plus percent. That about matches the growth in the data center business. Those may be somewhat coincidental, but can you just talk about where you see penetration across key end markets like HPC, like cloud and hyperscale and like enterprise? Which offer you the best growth from here? And where do you feel like your penetration may be more mature? I'm just trying to get a sense if there's an acceleration coming off of the 50% year-on-year growth that we're seeing now or if, consistent with the recent trend, we might be moderating potentially down into the 40% or 30% range as we go into the next calendar year.",201,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And we did a fairly good job making sure that -- with that transition before we ramped up the high-end Turing products. The -- our data center business, I would say that Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3, this last quarter, the inventory setback aside, I actually have to say that it's one of the best quarter we've ever experienced. And the reason for that is because our data center position, our accelerated computing position as a company, which is the foundation of this company, the accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways. For the first part of our journey into accelerated computing, it was really following scientific computing, simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes. About 5 years ago, deep learning came into the fore, and we were alert and agile to have invested a great deal and mobilized the company to go help the world put deep learning into software developers' hands all over the world. The area where I'm super excited about right now are the 3 that I've mentioned that we've opened up in this last quarter with the launch of Turing and with the launch of RAPIDS. The first is our film rendering opportunity is -- we think that there's about 10 million CPU nodes around the world that are used for film rendering. They can now benefit from accelerated computing as Moore's Law comes to an end. The second is opening up inference. The hyperscale data center marketplace is something along the lines of 15 million CPUs sold this year. And it was growing -- let's call it, growing at about 15% per year and -- the number of CPUs. And we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end and those servers are going to have to be accelerated going forward. And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that. It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very, very compressed and very condensed and power-sensitive environment, which these hyperscale data centers tend to be. And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers, to a TRT compiler, to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and containerized in the cloud, certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers, that process took us several years and it's put us in a really great place. So T4 is really fantastic. And so that's -- the second segment of high-performance computing is deep learning. The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning. This is where Hadoop goes. This is where Spark goes. This is where scikit-learn, Python, pandas. All of the data scientists around the world in retail, in transportation and logistics, in health care, in financial services that are using algorithms like random forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now. And this took a couple, 2, 3 years for us to pull together. RAPIDS has been open sourced. You can go into the NGC cloud, download it. IBM is going to integrate it into their machine learning platform. SaaS, SAP, Oracle, the cloud providers are all integrating the RAPIDS open source SDK into their machine learning platform. And so this is a new segment for us. 
The answer about our growth rate is, I believe, that our accelerated computing, our data center opportunity has significantly expanded during the quarter. Between the T4 hyperscale cloud GPU and RAPIDS machine learning platform, it has -- and our RTX server film rendering, we surely have expanded our data center opportunity. And so I fully expect us to continue to do well in accelerated computing for data centers.",651,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

To sum up, the crypto hangover has left the industry with excess inventory -- excess channel inventory. It will take 1 or 2 quarters to work through it. This is an unexpected near-term setback and doesn't change the fundamental dynamics of our company. The end of Moore's Law has cleared a way for NVIDIA accelerated computing as a great path forward. Turing opens up 3 exciting markets for us with ray-tracing games, film rendering and hyperscale inference. And with our first win in mainstream Level 2 self-driving cars with Volvo, our DRIVE AV platform is gearing up for the mass market, and our competitive position has never been stronger. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you.",122,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6
