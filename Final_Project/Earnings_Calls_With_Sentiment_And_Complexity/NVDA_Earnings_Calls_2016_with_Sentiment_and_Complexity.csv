Revenue reached a record in the fourth quarter, totaling $1.4 billion, up 12% from a year earlier, up 7% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.3 billion. Our full year revenue crossed above $5 billion to a record $5.01 billion, which was up 7% on the previous year. Quarterly growth was broad-based with expansion across each of our 4 market platforms: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive. Pacing games were our GTX gaming platform, our Datacenter platform powered by Deep Learning's growing adoption and automotive. 
View it from a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 10% to $1.18 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue was up 40% to $157 million. NVIDIA's strategy remains sharply focused on creating platforms for our key markets. Our progress stems from our success in creating strong products that are targeted at growth markets. 
In Q4, our 4 market platforms contributed more than 85% of revenue, up from 78% a year earlier. Our growth platforms collectively increased 23% year-over-year. 
First, let's start with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue rose 25% year-on-year to $810 million with good momentum carrying forward from the previous quarter. Maxwell-based GeForce GTX processors continue to lead our gaming growth combined with growing anticipation for VR and the launch of holiday blockbuster games. The GeForce GTX 970 GPU stands as the world's most popular graphics card on the Steam gaming platform and we continue to get strong traction with our GeForce GTX GPUs that power gaming networks. That includes the recently launched GTX 980 for notebooks, which is enabled a new category enthusiast class VR capable gaming notebooks. 
Excitement is growing around VR gaming. A key theme of last month's Consumers Electronics Show. We unveiled there our GeForce GTX VR Ready program to help gamers choose the best hardware for an immersive VR experience. And Oculus, which is now opened to preorders for the Rift headsets, has exclusively certified GeForce GTX systems as being ready for VR. 
GeForce sales are driven by the launch of great gaming titles and that again proved true this past holiday season. Fallout 4 was among the standouts, recording more than $750 million in sales in its first 24 hours. Other major hits were Star Wars: Battle Front, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and Rainbow Six. We remain pleased with the continued success of GeForce Experience. Our gaming platform that automatically optimize your PC settings for each game and downloads the greatest game-ready drivers. At the end of January, just 2.5 years after its introduction, GeForce Experience subscribers stood at 76 million, up 37% on the year. 
Moving to Professional Visualization. Quadro revenue increased 7% both sequentially and year-over-year to $203 million. The refresh cycle of workstations continued to improve during the quarter, driven in part by new workstation configurations in the market. While VR is often portrayed as a consumer play, we are also excited by its potential in enterprise, particularly in areas such as medicine, architecture, education and product design. 
Audi now has 20 virtual showrooms, with several hundred expected later this year, that let customers experience new models, customize them in real time and take them for a virtual spin. 
In a very different application, a startup called Surgical Theater, uses flight simulator technology and multiple GPUs to allow surgeons to use VR to fly through a patient's anatomy and rehearse complicated procedures before making the first cut. 
In Datacenter, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 18% sequentially to a record $97 million, up 10% year-on-year. This reflects the extraordinary rise of Deep Learning, a field in which we are now engaged with nearly 3,500 companies and organizations, as well as growth in the number of high-performance computing applications that are GPU accelerated. 
During the quarter, we launched key products for this market. And a number of the partners provided updates to their own work in this area that underscores the central role of the accelerated GPU platform. A deep -- a key development came during November's Supercomputing 2015 Conference, with the release of the latest list of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers. It showed that more than 100 of these systems are now using accelerators. 2/3 of these use NVIDIA accelerators, up 50% on the year. 
For hyperscale data centers, we announced a platform that lets web services companies accelerate machine learning. It consists of both the NVIDIA Tesla M40, the most powerful accelerator designed for training, deep neural networks and the NVIDIA Tesla M4, a low power, small form factor accelerator for machine learning inference. Web services companies have enthusiastically embraced this trend. Shortly after our hyperscale announcement, Facebook disclosed that it will use the Tesla M40s to power its next-generation computing system for machine learning applications. And earlier this month, AliCloud, Alibaba's cloud computing business, announced it will work with us to promote China's first GPU accelerated cloud-based high-performance computing platform. They joined other web services giants embracing GPUs for machine learning. 
During the quarter, Google outsourced its tensor-flow deep learning framework which can be accelerated on GPUs. Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit was integrated with Azure's GPU lab enabling neural nets for speech recognition that are up to 10x faster than their predecessors. And IBM revealed that its Watson systems are now using GPUs. 
Progress continues to be made in our GRID virtualization platform which enables companies to deliver graphics-rich applications to employees on any device, anywhere. More than 100 companies are participating in an accelerated deployment program. 
Turning to Automotive. Automotive revenue was a record $93 million, up 18% sequentially and up 68% year-over-year. One of the biggest stories at CES was the introduction of our NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2, self-driving car platform, which utilizes artificial intelligence to address the profoundly complex challenge of autonomous driving. 
As many of you saw, DRIVE PX 2 is a supercomputing platform the size of a lunchbox that processes 24 trillion deep learning operations a second and delivers 8 teraflop of processing power, equivalent to that of 150 MacBook Pros. It is a flexible platform that automotive developers can scale from 1 to 4 processors. And it can utilize passive cooling or integrate seamlessly with the water cooling systems of self-driving EVs. Capable of fusing data from cameras, LIDAR, radar and ultrasonic sensors it creates a full 360-degree understanding of what is happening around the vehicle. It localizes the vehicle on an HD map and it determines a safe path forward for using deep learning techniques. 
Volvo, well-known for its safety and reliability, will be the first to develop DRIVE PX 2, using it as the brain for its fleet of 100 self-driving cars to be publicly available next year in its hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. Just a couple of weeks ago, the first autonomous shuttle, the WE pod, incorporating our Deep Learning platform, took its inaugural trip on public roads in the Netherlands where it can be summoned with a smartphone app. The DRIVE PX 2 launch generated enormous interest around the world from car makers, Tier 1 suppliers and others. We are now collaborating with more than 70 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies. 
Finally, our OEM and IP business was $198 million, up 3% sequentially, driven by the seasonal demands for notebooks. 
Now turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP quarterly gross margin was 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 57.2%, slightly above our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were 535 -- $539 million, inclusive of $34 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses, including litigation charges, were $445 million, in line with our outlook. 
For full fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.72 billion, including litigation costs. Our focus on rigorous execution and enhancing efficiencies enabled our core operating expenses to remain flat from fiscal 2015 as we focused on expanding operating margins. 
GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $252 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $356 million, up 26% from $283 million a year earlier. GAAP net income was $207 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.35, including $0.04 of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of 21% year-over-year. 
Now turning to some key balance sheet items. At the end of Q4, our cash and marketable securities balance was just over $5 billion. During the quarter, we paid $62 million in cash dividends and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.3 million shares returned. As a result, we have returned to shareholders an average of $800 million in fiscal 2016, meeting our intention we communicated at the start of the fiscal year. 
Over the past 4 years, we've returned more than $3 billion to shareholders, representing 98% of our free cash flow. As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, our intention is to return $1 billion in fiscal year '17 through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. 
For fiscal year 2016, revenue reached a record $5 billion, up 7%. Our growth platforms increased 26% year-on-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 56.8%, up 100 basis points on the year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 18% to $1.13 billion, with operating margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to 22.5%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 18%. 
Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 -- 2017. We remain excited about our business prospects, gaming remained strong and eSports, VR and new exciting games will lift it further. GPU-accelerated data centers are expanding on both HPC and cloud, driven by the growth of deep learning. And autonomous driving continues to move forward. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets. 
We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2017 to be $1.26 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.2% and 57.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%.

First of all, I think you captured the essence of it in your question. GeForce is really not a chip business anymore. It's really a gaming platform business. And when you think about it from a gaming platform business, it's -- it has to be thought of in a context of the whole gaming ecosystem in the gaming industry. It's $100 billion large. And when you think about it that way and you drive the business that way, and you create value that way, I think the prospects for growth there is still quite significant. There are several different ways that we can grow the market. First of all, when we introduced new game platforms in this year -- this last couple of years, we've introduced Maxwell. It's the most successful gaming platform we've ever introduced. The installed base of about 100 million GeForce gamers in the world has an opportunity to upgrade to a new platform. Another reason why we can grow is because the production value continues to increase. The graphics richness continues to increase. And we do that by inspiring the industry, providing a technology that helps it include our technology in a much easier way. And the way that we do that is called GameWorks. All the physics simulations, all of the visual simulations, all of the lighting simulations and all of the things that makes games beautiful today are easily to include by just supporting GameWorks. And that's been an enormous success for us. And of course, developing countries are still doing incredibly well. There are many countries around the world that are just starting to get into PC gaming. South East Asia is growing incredibly. And then not to mention that gaming is no longer just gaming. Gaming is all about sports now. But we're starting to see a new culture, new dynamic in gaming, even beyond that. It's really becoming a platform by which people could share and a platform by which they could artistically express themselves. If you look at some of these games today, it's something that you enjoy well beyond just playing the game. You use the game as an editor to tell stories. And so these games like GTA V, is just fantastic for telling stories. So you can see now that the gaming platform is going beyond games, it's going beyond sports and now it's a creative platform. And so there's just all these wonderful ways that the game industry has continued to be vibrant and my sense is that we're going to continue to grow with it.",435,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

And as a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, on your Automotive business, as you move from infotainment systems that are graphics-intensive to more advanced computing systems, do you think it changes the competitive environment? And what I'm referring to is we have seen Qualcomm and others enter this segment and they are making the case that they can integrate a lot of different piece parts and tie back to their processor. And I'm trying to drop out a little bit what you had on the smartphone side where you were specializing in 1 part but others could integrate other parts and become more successful. Is there going to be a similar situation in autos? Or do you think we should read it in a different way as to how your competitive situation can evolve in autos as computing becomes a bigger part of the application?",144,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,4702.0,936645.0,39905242.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,7,"Well, we have to be mindful of competition. And there's a lot of different ways to compete. There's a lot of different ways to bring value. And surely, what you described is one way to compete. Those aren't really the segments in the market that we'll address. The way that we think about infotainment is, there are segments of the infotainment market, surely, that the parts in the market that we serve incredibly well. Where the richness of the displays, the number of displays and how the displays are going to be used in the coming years are going to continue to expand. You know that display costs are coming down and OLED displays are becoming cheaper. There's so many different ways to bring visualization into the car to enhance the driving experience. You also -- you can also imagine how artificial intelligence technology could change the way infotainment systems are even used. And one of our strategies of course is to bring artificial intelligence technology to enhance how the driver communicates with the car. And so there's all kinds of new technologies that we're going to deploy into the infotainment system, leveraging our expertise in deep learning. And then the part of the market that you're starting to talk about is the segment of the market that we really introduced into the marketplace, which is the autonomous driving computer. We started talking about it several years ago. I think it was like 3 years ago at CES, when I introduced the DRIVE PX where we imagined that in the future, a car would also have a supercomputer inside that is powered by deep learning, it's powered by artificial intelligence. And that takes in the center input continuously from all -- from the car, what's surrounding the car. And infer from it the appropriate thing to do. That vision 3 years ago seemed a little bit, if you will, outer space. But I think that it is very clear now that the technology that we're bringing to bear, deep learning, is really the best approach for helping car companies go beyond ADAS, which is going to be a commodity in the coming years as you can imagine. Go beyond ADAS and move towards assisted-driving to full autonomous driving. And so I think that we can add a lot of value there. PX 2 was really invented to allow OEMs to scale that entire range from assisted driving all the way to fully assisted-driving. And that's one of the reasons why we can support 1 chip all the way up to 4 chips, from passive cooling all the way up to integrating directly into the self-driving eco that's quite available for most EV cars with liquid cooling. And so I think that our strategy there is going to work out quite well. We add a lot of value. It's very algorithm-rich. It's very software-rich and I think our DRIVE PX platform is really quite state-of-the-art.",494,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

There are a lot of moving parts in our gross margins business -- gross margins. Of course, our enterprise businesses is richer in gross margins. Our consumer business tends to be lower in gross margins. But the way I would -- at the highest level, the way I would think about our company's gross margins is really the nature of our business model is changing. If you think about our business model, a long time ago, we used to be a chip business. But today, we're really a differentiated specialty platform business. And what I mean by platform business is it's of course the chips, the systems, but it's largely about the differentiated software that's on top of it. And so increasingly, you're going to find that our business is software-rich, it's services-rich. And if that's the case, one would think that our business model would become increasingly of that nature. And I think you're just seeing the reflection of that. As our company continues to move towards our differentiated platforms, which was, call it 50%, just a few years ago and it's now reaching some 80% now, as we move into these specialty differentiated platforms, the software content is just much, much higher and customers who work with us are not buying chips for their systems -- for their commodity systems but they're looking for a platform to solve a particular problem. And those -- the problems that we help solve, the solution that we bring to bear is so high valued that I think that increasingly, you should expect that -- well, you should hope and I hope myself that that our gross margins continue to move along with the change in our business model.",291,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thank you. Our high-performance computing business is -- uses an architecture we call accelerated computing. Accelerated computing is a model of computing that we invented almost 10 years ago. And it's a very unique way of doing computing and it takes advantage of the strength of the CPU as well as the advantage of the world's most parallel processor called the GPU. It is very software intensive. it's very computation -- mathematics intensive, it's very algorithm intensive. And it's a problem that when applied to some verticals can accelerate computing dramatically. We see accelerations of 5x, 10x, 20x, quite normally, quite regularly. And the way that you translate this benefit to a customer is that it reduces their cost. Instead of building a supercomputer that may cost as much as $500 million, the supercomputer would be the world’s best at $100 million. That's a pretty substantial reduction in expenses. The power build that they would spend on a regular basis would be dramatically reduced. And so data centers and supercomputing centers save an enormous amount of money. On the other hand, the researchers see substantial boost in their application throughput. And so that's one of the reasons why accelerated computing is doing really well. And we're seeing a couple of different drivers for accelerated computing and high-performance computing, our data center business. Accelerated computing itself for supercomputing applications, whether it's weather simulation or molecular dynamics simulation, continues to grow. But the big killer app that we are starting to see, and we've been cultivating this for several years now and it's now really turning the corner and going into turbocharge and growth is deep learning. Almost in every field of science as well as for web services companies, artificial intelligence helps them wade through, comb through just the massive mounts and oceans of data to find -- to discover insight. And so deep learning and using artificial intelligence technology across all fields of science, I'm super excited about the work that's going to be done in medicine. It's really going to see some great adoption. I think we mentioned that in just a couple of years ago, we had 100 companies working with us in the area of deep learning and now it's ballooned to 3,500. That's quite a large scale growth. And it's an industry all the way from life sciences to supercomputing, of course, to web services, of course, to even industrial. And the application for industrial would be Internet of Things. All of these sensors all around the world collecting data needs artificial intelligence software -- deep learning software to reveal insight. In terms of our positioning relative to the competition, this is an area that we have a real advantage. And we have a real advantage for several reasons. The incremental cost to our company, the incremental cost of engineering, accelerated computing, into our normal course of running our GPU business, GeForce business, is incremental. And so that the system, the entire system, the 10,000 people in our company, can very -- can quite easily,  if you will, continue this rhythm, a quite a high velocity rhythm of bringing out new GPUs that are great for accelerated computing and great for gaming, of course, and great for workstations. And it's natural course of doing work. This is not an adjunct business to us. This is our core business. And at the core, that this our fundamental advantage. That it is a singular motion, singular execution, singular investment, singular architecture, incredibly leveraged and the execution, as a result is just absolutely flawless.

And the thing that's really exciting for me is to see them transition their business -- not transition but transform their business from one that is really focused on supercomputing centers to one that is also working on big data. This is an area where we can add a lot of value to them. We have a lot of expertise in this area. And as they continue to evolve their market footprint beyond supercomputing centers and now into large enterprises, I think they could find a lot of success. And so they're seeing a lot of success in this area, big data analytics is square in their bull's-eye and I'm quite excited for them in the work that they're doing there. And so they're a good customer for us, a great partner of ours and I'm excited to see their ongoing success. The thing that we're all seeing is that big data analytics -- the most powerful weapon for big data analytics has recently been discovered. Deep learning is just a fantastic new computing model. It is able to discover insight that is provably now superhuman. Its dimensionality in thinking through data is unrivaled than any approach that we've learned in the past. And now that's one of the reasons why industries all over the world from life sciences to industry to manufacturing to supercomputing are jumping on to deep learning bandwagon.

At the core of it, fundamentally, philosophically, we believe that it is inappropriate and it's wrong for Samsung to use NVIDIA's technology, technology that has cost us billions of dollars to invent, and use it without compensating us. At the core, I just think that's just wrong. And we think it's wrong and that's the reason why we decided to litigate, to sue Samsung. The ITC has passed its early decisions and we disagree with them, we are disappointed by them. It is unfortunate that the business courts couldn't see through the, obviously, complex data associated with the technology. But we're disappointed by it. We have appealed for a review. And hopefully in the near term we'll discover what the ITC will do. And -- but I still believe that it was the wrong thing to do for Samsung to use technology that companies who are specialized in these fields invent and to use it without compensation. And I'm disappointed with the decision from the ITC but so be it. Next year, we have plenty of things to go invest in and we have plenty of growth drivers. You know that we have 4 powerful growth drivers in our company.

First of all, our pipeline. We've talked about our pipeline several times. We've shipped probably 5 million, 6 million cars. We have another 20 million, 25 million cars to ship in our pipeline. And so these are design wins that took quite a few years to have won and quite a few years of engineering to ramp into production. So we have a pretty good view of -- pretty good visibility of the pipeline and the opportunities that are ahead of us. Probably, there's some market dynamics that's helpful to some of the design wins, the segments that we've served. Of course, at the time, long time ago, it's hard to tell. But it's very clear now that the computerization of cars is a highly desirable end user feature. And the customers, the partners that we worked with, the car companies we worked with, to computerize their cars, whether it's Audi or Tesla, whose cars are heavily computerized. Their growth prospects in the coming years are quite good. And so I think that that's one. We have a lot -- we have a clear view of the pipeline and I think the megatrends of the computerization of cars is in our favor. Now you mentioned, secondarily, we introduced this platform called DRIVE PX. It's our autonomous driving car computer platform. And the recent success of ADAS has really inspired just about every car company in the world to look beyond ADAS. And what's beyond ADAS is self-driving cars and it could be partially assisted, it could be mostly assisted, and it could be completely assisted. And in each one of those levels of autonomy, a different amount of computation would have to be deployed. And we've created a scalable architecture that allows car companies to develop cars that are partially assisted, all the way to completely assisted. We're working with quite a large number of customers now. Customer -- car companies, startup companies, companies that are largely cloud-based and have an enormous amount of data that they could transform into an automotive service, transportation as a service. And so we're working with a whole lot of different types of companies and I think this is going to be an area of quite, quite a significant industrial revolution. And arguably, quite a gigantic society good in the long term. So anyways, we're working on a lot of projects there.",402,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

In terms of the deep learning, machine learning opportunity. I was wondering if you could help quantify sort of the longer-term silicon TAM for the opportunity, both in data center and on automotive.

I think part of the answer is I'm not sure. Part of the answer is I'm not sure. So I -- let me just -- with that as a disclaimer, let me tell you why I'm so enthusiastic about it. There are many problems that computer science has been trying to solve, which, algorithmically, is just impossible to solve. There's no known way of a human-described algorithm that completely captures the noisy and long tail of society. And it could be almost any problem. It could be weather-related type problems, it could be market-related type problems, it could be all kinds of purchasing-related challenges. And all kinds of data could be life sciences, as we know that the human body is not in a perfect condition all the time. There's that randomness that plays a role in understanding molecular science. And so there are so many different types of areas where there's no simple Newtonian physics equation that can describe the nature. And so in that particular case, using an enormous amount of data to train the neuro-net, to train software, to rewrite the software, if you will, using an enormous amount of computation is a pretty exciting computation model. I think this is a brand-new computing model, one that is going to augment the traditional model of symbolics and computer programming. This is going to be a data-driven type of computing model. In this particular case, GPU-accelerated computing is really quite ideal. And the computing model that we've invented some 10 years ago is really quite ideal. How big is it? I think that it could be quite significant. And we're starting to see, of course, the type of companies that are jumping on top of the deep learning bandwagon. They're great companies, from Google to Facebook to Baidu to IBM to Alibaba to -- well, just about every hyperscale web services company in the world is jumping on this because they have enormous amounts of data and that has very, very long tails, is too contrived of an approach to find great insight. Now that the companies with a great deal of web-based data, cloud-based data is already starting to engage in this area, they're starting to implement artificial intelligence into one application after another. And I think we've already heard them announce that it's very likely they'll put artificial intelligence into every single application they have. We're starting to see this sweep across industries. The automotive industry, of course, has the longest tail, as the world is a very noisy place. And in order to create a car that can navigate through it, the long tail of a very complicated world has to be handled somehow. Writing software programs is just not going to do it. And so by using an ongoing learning artificial intelligence network could be exactly the solution for it. Life sciences, industries, manufacturing, supercomputing, the financial services. I mean, the list goes on and on and on, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm there. Before everybody can use deep learning, they have to train the network. And this is an area where we have quite a great deal of expertise. This year, as you know, we also announced our first hyperscale inferencing engine. It's our first end-to-end training to inferencing -- inferencing is predictions, the application of the network. And so from training all the way to inferencing, we now have a complete architecture that is architecturally compatible. The Tesla M40 is for training and the Tesla M4 is for inferencing. The M4 is a little tiny credit card-sized GPU and very low-powered, incredibly energy-efficient, and you can connect it into just about any hyperscale data center in the world, and we're sampling customers now. The results are quite exciting. Customers are very enthusiastic about it. And I think we could dramatically reduce the cost of data centers all over the world as they start to ramp up artificial intelligence in their everyday workload.",664,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Our inventory levels that we are holding here, they're definitely going to swing a bit in terms of the mix, in terms of our platforms. But what we have right now, we do have a very healthy level of inventory, and we have a great team of people managing all of those different pieces, both for the channel, for our partners and, definitely, for what we need to ship going forward. So I don't think we look at a number to exactly optimize in any single 1 quarter, as we do make sure that we are prepared for the platforms coming down the pipeline as well as what customers need.

Here's my guess. I think, long term, training will be half of the overall market. And the reason for that is because training is so heavyweight. And in the long term, well, not long term now, you're training your network constantly. You create a network, you want to learn about -- you want to improve this network as fast as you can because you have so much valuable data and so much insight that you can go after. And you deploy the network for inferencing, which collects brand-new data. And the world looks completely different to you. You now collect that data and you use that data to train your network. I think that network training is going to be a continuous basis, and we're seeing that, absolutely. Also, there are more types of networks. The type of networks that are being created, the rate of revolution, the rate of innovation of networks, the network styles, network types, network configurations, network depths, it's happening every single week. I'm actually not exactly sure how you would design a custom chip for it, which explains why there are only 2 chips today that are successful in inferencing. One of them is the Intel Xeon and the other one is the Tesla M40 and M4. And so I think that the ability to adapt to new algorithms quickly is really quite vital as we go through the next several years of this artificial intelligence revolution. And there's just so much algorithms being developed. And I think you guys are reading about it constantly, new breakthroughs in AI, new breakthroughs in network design. I just -- at the moment, I just really don't know how someone would settle down and design a custom chip for it. And so I happen to believe that, long term, artificial intelligence is not a chip. Artificial intelligence is a computing model, and a computing model needs processors. And processors are programmable. And these programmable processors need to have rich software development environments around it, and these platforms need to be available all over the world. And today, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform is available in a PC, in a workstation, in a laptop, in the cloud, in the car, in robots, in embedded environments, and it's all exactly the same architecture. I think that, that's really one of our advantages, that we have the ability to be adaptable, programmable and yet, we're available in literally every single computing platform form factor you can imagine, and the accessibility of NVIDIA's architecture is literally global, worldwide and within reach for anybody.",432,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Given the 37% growth in the gaming business last year and the success of Maxwell, it actually does appear that you did drive some meaningful upgrade in the installed base. So the question for you is, is there any updates to your views on where the installed base sits at from an upgrade opportunity? And then the second question is, do you get a sense that the cadence of these upgrades will be accelerating, given the advancements you and your gaming engine partners are bringing to the market every year?",126,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We have the Maxwell architecture and we have the Kepler architecture and we have the Tesla architecture. All those -- all of those -- excuse me, the Fermi architecture. And those architectures are all running in the installed base at the moment. We've managed to upgrade about 1/3 of the installed base. Meanwhile, it is the case that ASPs of our GPUs are going up because the graphics richness and the graphics production value is going up. The quality of games, because of the -- because the market for games are so high, game developers can really create much, much more beautiful games and take the risk to do that. The developing markets are growing. The number of genres, like eSports, of games are growing. And so there's a lot of different growing vectors. And meanwhile, all of that is on top of our desire to upgrade our installed base so that they can enjoy games the way that it ought to be enjoyed.

Thanks for the question. I was delighted myself. I'll just put that out there. We worked really hard to improve and to prove our Quadro business. The team works incredibly hard. We've invented new technology for rendering called Iray. It's the world's first physically modeled photorealistic renderer that is accelerated by GPU. It -- the results of it is really quite remarkable, and they continue to add new capabilities to it. We, this last quarter, also benefited from the enthusiasm and excitement around VR, and we have VR SDKs and collaborations with just about every ISV in the world that are working on VR. And so I think there's a lot of good reasons to be enthusiastic about Quadro. We don't believe for a moment that the design quality and design production value of movies or games or architecture or manufacturing will continue. We believe, absolutely, that it's going to continue to improve. And visual realism and the productivity of the engineers that are involved, the artists that are involved needs to continue to increase. And so we think that this is going to be a vibrant growth area ahead. And I think the -- what drove recently the uptick are the OEMs refreshing the workstation cycle, and I think that we should enjoy some of that for the coming quarters. But I still think, long term, long term, the real opportunity, surely, the market is there. We know that more and more of design and creativity is done digitally. So at the core, the market is there. The opportunity for us is to bring new forms of rendering, new forms of design. And as you could see, Iray is for rendering and VR is for interacting with the design. These types of capabilities require just an enormous amount of GPU capability. And I think, at the core, that's going to be our long-term growth drivers.",319,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

For some reason, I still kind of tend to believe that what drives the gaming market is great games. And I think that there's some evidence that the continued release of great games and great production-value games, the vibrancy of eSports, the fact that eSports is really not just for competition but drives the dynamics -- the dynamic of sharing and social, those kind of factors continue to drive our gaming business. I'm quite enthusiastic about the developing markets. Southeast Asia, for one, is really starting to adopt PC gaming quite rapidly, and it is a market that is extremely underserved. India is a market that is extremely underserved. They are underserved because broadband Internet hasn't been available to those marketplaces until just recently. And they surely -- there's surely demographics in the developing -- in these markets that would love to jump onto gaming. And who doesn't need a PC? And so almost every market develops around PCs quite rapidly. And so I think the way of enjoying games is so affordable by adding a GeForce GTX to a PC that you already own. It is the most affordable form of entertainment if you think about it that way. And most of eSports are free-to-play, anyhow, and so much of it is, anyhow. And so it's a wonderfully affordable way to enjoy entertainment. And so I think the Southeast Asia, India are really quite exciting developing markets.",239,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I guess I'd just like to hear a perspective on a couple of things. One, obviously, it requires high-end and high-ASP GPUs to support some of these applications. So of the early adopters, maybe a sense of which of those folks might already own those types of GPUs and which ones might have to upgrade in the near term. And second, how VR might penetrate the eSports phenomenon over time and drive more of those upgrades into the higher-volume mainstream parts of the gaming market.",111,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Well, there's -- there are really 2 questions in your question. They're both good. And one question is, how do I feel about VR and its impact on gaming? The second part is how will VR impact our business? Let me just tell you the second part first. We don't -- we're not forecasting and not assuming any upside in VR. However, there is no way but good that VR will bring to our business. And we're just -- we're going to -- we'll take it a day at a time, and we believe that it's going to be an exciting growth driver. We believe that it's going to be helpful to our high-end GPU business. But when the time comes, it'll be a nice bonus. And so we're going to run our business as if we don't count on it. However, obviously, we care very deeply about it, because we think that the experience of VR is quite amazing. Anybody who's tried it is surprised how immersive it is, how it takes you away from where you are and into another world. You're really suspended in disbelief, and it's as close to a Holodeck as we've ever experienced. And so we believe strongly that VR is going to be fantastic for entertainment. It's going to be fantastic for games. We also believe that it's going to be fantastic for all of our pro business. You -- I wouldn't be surprised if the segment of our business that it helps the earliest may very well be our professional business. And the reason for that is because there are many applications that are mission-critical. And even though the headsets are not free, it's quite affordable. And for people who have power walls and who use large displays, VR is actually an incredible cost reduction. And so almost anybody can now have a virtual reality cave, which cost tens of thousands of dollars. Anyone can now have a power wall which costs tens of thousands of dollars. And now, for just a few hundred dollars, have all the benefits of that. And so I think that -- you could tell that I'm very, very enthusiastic about it. We're developing a lot of fresh technology and new enabling technology to make it possible. We're working with all of the market leaders to develop the market and cultivate the market. And then from a financial perspective, we'll just see how it plays out. And my sense is that it's going to be a really nice bonus.",423,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

Our OEM business is not about gaming, because that's our gaming business. And the OEMs are not about design because that's our design business. But the thing that some OEMs do is they include our technology to differentiate a mainstream platform from a premium platform. And so by adding NVIDIA's technology, you turn a commodity PC into a premium PC. And the experience is better, the performance is better, and everything just works. And so there's a real benefit in using it as a premium multimedia PC, if you will. And so we're going to -- we'll probably see continued interest in doing that, and we're delighted by that.

But let me address it overall. The installed base takes a couple of 2, 3 years to upgrade. And on the lower end, 3 to 4 years; on the higher end, 1 to 2 years. And so overall, I guess, because the lower-end products are higher in volume, it would probably weigh the overall average to, call it, 3-plus years. But the ASP, of course, if you look at it from an ASP perspective, it's a little bit different. It would probably drift up. The rate of upgrade appears to be increasing. And I might also explain that the ASP of the products can-- the ASP of our overall portfolio, increasing. I think the reason why it's increasing is because the size of the gaming market has now grown to a level that developers can take a fair amount of risk to add a rich content, rich production value and graphics, which they didn't use to be able to do. I mean, they now have the benefit of a large installed base of PlayStation and Xbox, Nintendo and PCs that they could actually create content that is really, really quite beautiful and technologically rich, which drives up the adoption of higher-end GPUs, because you need higher-end GPUs to process it. I think that's quite a significant factor. I think the other factor is that the game consoles, although nowhere near the performance level of our high-end GPUs, on average, is higher in terms of capability than our average installed base. What that -- that's actually really terrific news for us, because a PC gamer who wants to enjoy games that are adapted from game consoles, which all of them are, now would have to upgrade their GPUs to enjoy at least the game console experience. And so I think that there's a -- that bottom half of our installed base has a real opportunity to enjoy, at least, the game console experience for just $150. I mean, you could -- for a $150 graphics card, you could get an experience that is superior to a game console. I mean, that's quite an amazing value. And so that, I think, can also -- is also another reason to spur adoption.",389,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Can you talk a little bit about some of the PC requirements that are going to be necessary to use in Facebook Oculus Rift headset when it comes out this quarter and the cost that's going to be needed for individual user? And kind of contrast that from the business model that Sony is employing, which is basically, my -- based on my knowledge, a bundling strategy with their PlayStation 4, which wouldn't require an upgrade to the graphics card or buying a new desktop.

There's -- there are 2 different questions in there. One question is what is the minimum requirement for VR today? Using today's graphics card, as an example, the GTX 970, which is the most popular graphics card in the world, is the min spec for the Oculus Rift. And the reason why, of course, is because Oculus and their PC focus wants to have the best possible experience for the early adopters of VR. And I think that's a really prudent strategy. You want to delight all of your early adopters with the best possible experience. But the way to think about it long term is as the market continues to grow and more content comes and VR moves into the mainstream, there's no question in my mind that our $100 and $150 GeForce GTX cards will, in the future, be able to play VR just perfectly. And so this is not a question about the availability of technology or the cost of technology. As we know, technology continues to advance. And whatever experience today will continue to get more affordable long term. Whatever the Sony PlayStation does, I think it's just fantastic, either way. What we would like to do is get people excited about VR. And in the final analysis, there are TV gamers, and then there are -- or there are console gamers and there are PC gamers. And they're different genres, and they're different applications and different styles and very largely different customers. And so I think we're just enthusiastic about VR, period.

The opportunity in automotive, obviously, continues to grow, and your unveiling at CES was impressive by anyone's standards. However, there seems to be 2 approaches to the automotive market. As we move forward, there's obviously the closed system approach that Mobileye seems to be pursuing and what appears to be more of an open-architecture approach that you seem to have. Can you maybe describe how things shape up for you as you look out over the horizon with sensor fusion and the various OEMs and getting things right from a safety standards basis, et cetera? Do we need the control of a closed system? Or can we get it done with collaboration with others?",119,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

I appreciate the question. It's really, really a good question. This is really a matter of philosophy. And philosophically, this is how we see the world. We believe that self-driving car is not a solved  problem. And I think, I say that as statement of fact. I don't think anybody would dispute it. I also believe that self-driving cars is a field that's going to require the technical -- technological muscle of a very, very large industry, and that no one company with a few hundred employees is going to solve it all by themselves. So the idea that an unsolved problem of such incredible daunting levels, that an entire computer industry is in the process of trying to solve could possibly be a closed system tied around a chip seems illogical to me. That's number one. Number two, I believe that, long term, our car company, the soul of the car company, is the driving experience of that car. The soul of the car company is the driving experience of the car. The soul of the company is the safety record of that car. The soul of the company is the functionality of that car. And in the future, the functionality, the safety, the driving experience of the car is going to be largely software-defined. It's going to be artificial intelligence-network-defined. I just can't imagine great companies like BMW and Mercedes and Audi and, all over the world, Toyota, and the list goes on, and many great companies that are emerging into this marketplace. I just can't imagine that these companies would somehow outsource the soul of their car to a chip company. I -- that's a second philosophical belief. And so what we've decided to do is to create an automotive autonomous-car computing platform and all of the rich software that's necessary to enable this incredibly high-throughput computer to behave in a really energy-efficient way and cost-effective way and to be able to apply our deep learning expertise so that these cars can benefit from artificial intelligence to solve these really complicated world problems. And that by partnering with every single car company in the world, that, together, we might be able to solve this incredibly daunting challenge and hopefully bring some society good. And so that's our approach as to the open platform. And it starts, really, from a philosophical approach. Now that philosophical approach results in a very substantial technological difference. Notice that our platform is completely programmable. We have rich tools. We know that developers all over the world can very easily buy themselves a GeForce Titan and write CUDA applications. And those CUDA applications will, tomorrow, run on a DRIVE PX just seamlessly. And so I think that, that's a really wonderful way for designers all over the world to be able to develop software, which is really hard to do right now, and then quickly deploy it into the car. And so our strategy is just very, very different, and that's our approach. And my sense is that, at the moment, it appears to be quite a good approach. 
Okay, I really appreciate that question. NVIDIA is the world leader in visual and accelerated computing, which is helping to create exciting growth markets like VR, AI and self-driving cars, which will transform many industries and positively impact the future of society. 
Our strategy is to leverage one core investment into 4 growth markets: gaming, professional visualization, data center and auto. And it's delivering results and gaining momentum. Our goal is to balance investments to capture the enormous opportunity ahead while maintaining a keen focus on improving near-term financial performance. 
I also want to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference will take place April 4 through 7 in San Jose. We'll be focusing on VR, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.

In March, we introduced our newest GPU architecture, Pascal. This extraordinary, scalable design built on the 16-nanometer FinFET process provides massive performance and exceptional power efficiency. It will enable us to extend our leadership across our 4 specialized platforms: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive. Year-on-year revenue growth continued to accelerate, increasing 13% to $1.3 billion.
Our GPU business grew 15% to $1.08 billion from a year ago. Tegra processor business was up 10% to $160 million. Growth continued to be broad-based across all 4 platforms. Record performance in Datacenter was driven by the adoption of deep learning across multiple industries. In Q1, our 4 platforms contributed nearly 87% of revenue, up from 81% a year earlier. They collectively increased 21% year-over-year.
Let's start out with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue increased 17% year-on-year to $687 million. Momentum carried forward from the holiday season helped by the continued strength of Maxwell-based GTX processors. Last weekend at DreamHack Austin, we unveiled GeForce GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, our first Pascal GPUs for gamers. They represent a quantum leap for gaming and immersive VR experiences, delivering the biggest performance gains from the previous generation architect in a decade. Media reports and gamers have been unanimously enthusiastic. The Verge wrote, ""What NVIDIA is doing with its new GTX 1000 series is bringing yesteryear's insane high end into 2016's mainstream.""
We also extended our VR platform by adding spatial acoustics to our VRWorks software development kit, which helps provide an even greater sense of presence within VR. We introduced Simultaneous Multi-Projection, enabling accurate, efficient projection of the real world to surround monitors, VR headsets as well as future displays. To showcase these technologies, we created our own amazing open source game called NVIDIA VR Funhouse available on Steam. In addition, we announced Ansel, an in-game photography system which enables gamers to capture high-resolution and VR scene within their favorite games.
Moving to Professional Visualization. Quadro grew year-on-year for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue rose 4% to $189 million. Growth came from higher-end products and mobile workstations. We launched the M6000 24GB and are seeing good success among multiple customers, including Toyota and Pixar. Roche is using the M6000 to speed its DNA sequencing pipeline by 8x, enabling more affordable genetic testing. We see exciting opportunities for our Quadro platform with virtual reality and NVIDIA Iray, a photorealistic rendering tool that enables designers effectively to walk around their creations and make real-time adjustments.
Moving to Datacenter. Revenue was a record $143 million, up 63% year-on-year and up 47% sequentially, reflecting enormous growth in deep learning. In just a few years, deep learning has moved from academia and is now being adopted across the hyperscale landscape. We expect growing deployment in the coming year among large enterprises. 
GPUs have become the accelerator of choice for hyperscale data centers due to their superior programmability, computational performance and power efficiency. Our Tesla M4 is over 50% more power efficient than other programmable accelerators for applications such as real-time image classification for AlexNet, a deep learning framework. Hyperscale companies are the fastest adopters of deep learning, accelerating their growth in our Tesla business. Starting from infancy 3 years ago, hyperscale revenue is now similar to that from high-performance computing.
NVIDIA GPUs today accelerate every major deep learning framework in the world. We power IBM Watson and Facebook's Big Sur server through our AI, and we are in AI platforms at hyperscale giants, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba and Baidu for both training and real-time inference. Twitter has recently said they use NVIDIA GPUs to help users discover the right content among the millions of images and videos shared every day.
During the quarter, we hosted our seventh Annual GPU Technology Conference. The event drew record attendance with 5,500 scientists, engineers, designers and others across a wide range of fields and featured 600 sessions and 200 exhibitors. At GTC, we unveiled the Tesla P100, the world's most advanced GPU accelerator based on the Pascal architecture. The P100 utilizes a combination of technologies, including NVLink, a high-speed interconnect allowing application performance to scale on multiple GPUs, high-memory bandwidth and multiple hardware features designed to natively accelerate AI applications. The next platform, an enterprise IT site calls it a beast, in all of the good sense of that word.
Among the first customers for our Pascal accelerator is the Swiss National Computer Center (sic) [Swiss National Supercomputing Center], which will use it to double the speed of Europe's fastest supercomputer. At GTC, we also announced the DGX-1, the world's first deep learning supercomputer. Loaded with 8 P100s in a single box interconnected with NVLink, it provides the deep learning performance equivalent to 250 traditional servers. DGX-1 comes loaded with a suite of software designed to aid AI and application developers.
Universities, hyperscale vendors and large enterprises developing AI-based applications are showing strong interest in the system. Among the first to get DGX-1 will be the Massachusetts General Hospital. It launched an initiative that applies AI techniques to improve the detection, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases, drawing on its database of some 10 billion medical images. In our GRID graphics virtualization business, we are seeing interest across a variety of industries ranging from manufacturing, energy, education, government and financial services.
Finally, in Automotive. Revenue continued to grow, reaching $113 million, up 47% year-over-year and up 22% sequentially, reflecting the growing popularity of premium infotainment features in mainstream cars.
NVIDIA is working closely with partners to develop self-driving cars using our end-to-end platform which starts with Tesla in the data center and extends through the deployment with DRIVE PX 2. Since we unveiled DRIVE PX 2 earlier this year, worldwide interest has continued to grow among carmakers, Tier 1 suppliers and others. We are now collaborating with more than 80 companies using the open architecture of DRIVE PX to develop their own software and driving experiences.
At GTC, we demonstrated the world's first self-driving car trained using deep learning and showed its ability to navigate on roads without lane markings even in bad weather. Additionally, we announced that DRIVE PX 2 will serve as the brain behind the new ROBORACE initiative in the Formula E racing circuit. The circuit will include 10 teams racing identical cars, all using DRIVE PX 2. Beyond our 4 platforms, our OEM IP business was $173 million, down 21% year-on-year, reflecting weak PC demand.
Now turning to the rest of the income statement. We had record GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter at 57.5% and 58.6%, respectively. Driving these margins was the strength of our Maxwell GPUs, the success of our platform approach and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $506 million and declined from $539 million in Q4 on lower restructuring charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $443 million, flat sequentially and up 4% from a year earlier, reflecting increased hiring for our growth initiatives and development-related expenses associated with Pascal.
GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $245 million, up 39% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income was $322 million, also up 39%. Non-GAAP operating margins improved more than 470 basis points from a year ago to 24.7%. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $196 million. Non-GAAP net income was $263 million, up 41% fueled by the strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins.
During the first quarter, we'd entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement and paid $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Since the restart of our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we've returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders. This represents over 100% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal years 2013 through this Q1. For fiscal 2017, we intend to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenue to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.7% and 58.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.

Our PC gaming platform, GeForce, is strong and getting stronger than ever, and I think the reason for that is several, several folds. First of all, our GPU architecture is just superior. We dedicated an enormous amount of effort to advancing our GPU architecture. I think the engineering of NVIDIA is exquisite, and our craftsmanship is really unrivaled anywhere. The scale of our company in building GPUs is the highest and the largest of any company in the world. This is what we do. This the one job that we do. And so it's not surprising to me that NVIDIA's GPU technology is further ahead than any time in its history. The second thing, however, it's just so much more than just chips anymore, as you know. Over the last 10 years, we've started to evolve our company to much more of a platform company, and it's about developing all the algorithms that sit on top of our GPUs. GPU is a general-purpose processor. It's a general-purpose processor that's dedicated to a particular field of computing, such as computer graphics here, physics simulation, et cetera. But the thing that's really important is all of the algorithms that sit on top of it, and we have a really, really fantastic team of computational mathematicians that captures our algorithms and our know-how into GameWorks, into the physics engines and recently, the really amazing work that we're doing in VR that we've embodied into VRWorks. And then lastly, lastly it's about making sure that the experience always just works. We have a huge investment in working with game developers all over the world from the moment that a game is being conceived of, all the way to the point that it's launched. And we optimize the games on our platform. We make sure that our drivers work perfectly. And even before a gamer downloads or buys a particular game, we've already updated their software so that it works perfectly when they install the game, and we call that GFE, GeForce Experience. And so it's really about a top to bottom approach, and I haven't even started talking about all of the marketing work that we do and engaging the developers and engaging the gamers all over the world. This is really a network platform and all of our platform partners that take our platform to market. And so it's a pretty extensive network and it's a pretty extensive platform and there's so much more than chips anymore.",418,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

You know that I've been rather enthusiastic about high-performance computing for some time, and we've been evolving our GPU platform so that it's better at general-purpose computing than ever. And almost every single data center in the world and every single server company in the world are working with us to build servers that are based on GPUs -- based on video GPUs for high-performance computing. One of the most important areas of high-performance computing has been this area called deep learning. And this deep learning -- deep learning, as you know, as you probably are starting to hear, is a brand-new computing model that takes advantage of the massively parallel processing capability of a GPU along with the Big Data that many companies have to essentially have software write algorithms by itself. Deep learning is a very important field of machine learning, and machine learning is now in the process of revolutionizing artificial intelligence, making machines more and more intelligent and using it to discover insight that quite frankly is impossible otherwise. And so this particular field is -- was first adopted by hyperscale companies so that they could find insight and make recommendations and make predictions from the billions of customer transactions they have every day. Now it's in the process of moving into enterprises. But in the meantime, hyperscale companies are now in the process of deploying our GPUs in deep learning applications into production. And so we've been talking about this area for some time, and now we're starting to see the broad deployment in production. So we're quite excited about that.",268,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The thing about HPC, about GPU computing is, as you know, this is a new computing model, and we've been promoting this computer model now for close to 7 years. And a new computing model doesn't come along very frequently. In fact, as I know it, I don't know if there's a new computing model that's used anywhere that has been revolutionary in the last 20 years. And so GPU computing takes some time to develop. We've been evangelizing it for quite some time. We developed robust tools, so that make it easier for people to take advantage of our GPUs. We have industry expertise in a large number of industries now. We have APIs that have been created for each one of the industries. We've been working with the ecosystem in each one of the industries and developers in each one of the industries. And as of this time, we have quite a large handful, quite a large number of industries that we accelerate applications for. And so I think that -- I guess, my recommendation -- my recollection would be that it has taken a long time, in fact, to have made GPU computing into a major new computing model. But I think at this point, it is pretty clear that it's going mainstream. It is really one of the best ways to achieve the post Moore's Law era of computing acceleration, and it's being adopted by a broad base [ph] of applications. And the one that, of course, that is a very, very big deal is deep learning and machine learning.

We're seeing great traction in gaming. Gaming, as you know, has multiple growth drivers. Partly, the gaming is growing because the production value of games is growing partly because the number of people who are playing is growing. eSports is more popular than ever. Sport spectatorship is more popular than ever. And so gaming is just a larger and larger market and surprising everybody, and the quality of games is going up, which means that [indiscernible] to go up. High-performance computing has grown, and the killer app is machine learning and deep learning. And that's going to continue to go into production from the hyperscale companies as we expand our reach into enterprises all over the world now, companies who have great deal of data they would like to find insight in.

Thanks, Stephen. Yes, our gross margins within the quarter for Q1 did hit record levels just due to very strong mix across our products on the Maxwell side, both from a gaming perspective as well as what we have in enterprise for Pro Visualization and Datacenter. As we go to Q2, a good review of where we also see gross margin and those are looking at a non-GAAP at about 58%. Mix will again be a strong component of that as our launch of Pascal will come out with high-end gaming and with Datacenter, and the growth essentially across all of our platforms will help our overall gross margins. As we go forward, there's still continued work to do. We're here to guide just one quarter out, but we do have a large TAM in front of us on many of these different markets and the mix will certainly help us. We're in the initial stages of rolling out what we have in software, services, our overall systems. So I don't expect it to be a material part of the overall gross margin, but it will definitely be a great value proposition for us for what we put forth.",200,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The thing that's most important is that the value is greater than ever. And one of the things that we know is games are becoming richer than ever. The production value is become richer than ever, and gamers want to play these games with all of the settings maxed out. They would like to play at a very high resolution. They want to play it at a very high frame rates. When I announced the 1080, I was showing all of the latest and most demanded games running at twice the resolution of a game console at twice the frame rate of a game console and it was barely even breathing hard. And so I think one of the most important things is for customers of this segment, they want to buy a product that they can count on and that they can rely on to be ready for future generation games. And some of the most important future generation games are going to be in VR, and so the resolution is going to be even higher. The frame rate expectation is 90 hertz, and the latency has to be incredibly low so that you feel a sense of presence.

I think a lot -- the answer to a lot of your questions is I don't know. However, there are some things I do know very well. One of the things that we do know is that high-performance computing is an essential approach for one of the most important computing models that we know today, which is machine learning and deep learning. Hyperscale data centers all over the world is relying on this new model of computing so that it could harvest, it could study all the vast amounts of data that they're getting to find insight for individual customers to make the perfect recommendation, predict what somebody would anticipate -- would look forward to in terms of news or products or whatever it is. And so this approach of using computing is really unprecedented, and this is a new computing model and the GPU is really ideal for it. Now we've been working on this for coming up on a decade, and it explains one of the reasons why we have such a great lead in this particular aspect. The GPU is really the ideal processor for these massively parallel problems, and we've optimized our entire stack of platforms from the architecture, to the design, to the system, to the middleware, to the system software, all the way to the work that we do with developers all over the world so that we can optimize the entire experience to deliver the best performance. And so this is something that's taken a long time to do. I have a great deal of confidence that machine learning is not bad. I have a great deal of confidence that machine learning is going to be the future computing model for a lot of very large and complicated problems. And I think that all of the stories that you see, whether it's the groundbreaking work they've done at Google and Google DeepMind on AlphaGo, to self-driving cars, to the work that people are talking about in artificial intelligence recommendation chat bots, to, boy, the list just goes on and on. And I think that it goes without saying that this new computing model in the last couple of years has really started to deliver very, very promising results. And I would characterize the results as being superhuman results, and now they're going into production. And we're seeing production deployments not just in 1 or 2 customers, but basically in every single hyperscale data center in the world in every single country. And so I think this is a very, very big deal, and I don't think it's a short-term phenomenon. And the amount of data that we process is just going to grow, and so those are some of the things that I do know.",467,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

The fact of the matter is we are in a high-tech business and high-tech is hard. The work that we do is hard. The team is -- doesn't take it for granted, and we're not complacent about our work. And so I think that I can't imagine a better team in the world that does to manage this transition. We've managed transitions all the time. And so we don't take it lightly.

The Founders Edition basically is designed by -- wholly designed by NVIDIA product. A reference design is really not designed to be an end product. It's really designed to be a reference for manufacturers to use as a starting point. But the Founders Edition is designed so that it could be manufactured, it can be marketed and customers can continue to buy it from us for as long as they desire. Now our strategy is to support our global network of adding copartners, and we're going to continue to do that. And we gave them -- we gave everybody reference designs like we did before and in this particular case, we created the Founders Edition so that people who like to buy directly from us, people who like our industrial design and people who would like the exquisite design and quality that comes with our products that we can do. And so it's designed to be extremely overclockable. It's designed with all the best possible components. And if somebody would like to buy products directly from us, they have the ability to do that. I expect that the vast majority of the add-in cards will continue to be manufactured by our add-in copartners. And that's our expectation and that's our hope, and I don't expect any dramatic change in the amount of shifting of that. And so that's basically it.

Depending on which one of our businesses that you're talking about, gaming is rather macro insensitive for some reason. People enjoy gaming whether the economy is good or not. Whether the oil price is high or not, people seem to enjoy gaming. Don't forget, gaming is not something that people do once a month, like, going out to a movie theater or something like that. People game every day, and the gamers that use our products are gaming every day. It's their way of doing -- engaging with their friends. They hang out with their friends that way. It's a platform for chatting. Don't forget that the #1 messaging company in China is actually a gaming company, and the reason for that is because while people are gaming, they're hanging out with their friends and they're chatting with their friends. And so it's really a medium for all kinds of things, whether it's entertaining or hanging out or expressing your artistic capabilities or whatnot. And so gaming, for one, appears to be doing quite well in all aspects of the market. The second thing is enterprise, however, is largely -- or hyperscale is largely a U.S. dynamic, and the reason for that is because U.S. dynamic is also China dynamic because that's where most of the world's hyperscale companies happen to be. And so -- and then automotive, where we have most of our automotive success to date has been from the European car companies, and we're seeing robust demand from the premium segments of the marketplace. However, in the future we're going to see a lot more success with automotive here in the United States, here in Silicon Valley, in China.

And so -- but we still have a lot of engineering work to do. The differences are minor. We're a large company, and we have a lot of things that we're doing. I wouldn't over study the small deltas in OpEx. We don't manage things a dollar at a time, and we're trying to invest in the important things. On the other hand, this company is really, really good about not wasting money. And so we want to make sure that on the one hand, we invest into opportunities that are very important to our company. But we just have a culture of frugality that permeates our company. And then lastly, from an operational perspective, we unified everything in our company behind one architecture. And so whether you're talking about the cloud or workstations or data centers or PCs or cars or embedded systems or autonomous machines, you name it, everything is exactly one architecture. And the benefit of one architecture is that we can leverage one common stack of software and that's a base software.

And so that would suggest that it's just increasingly less important part of the way that we go to market. Now what I don't mean by that is that, that we don't partner with the world's large OEMs: HP, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Lenovo. All of the world's large enterprise companies are our partners. We partner with them to take our platforms -- our differentiated platforms, our specialty platforms to the world's markets, and most of them are related to enterprise. We just do less and less volume -- high-volume components devices, generic devices like cellphones that we've gotten out of, generic PCs that we've gotten out of. Largely, we tend not to do business like that anymore. We tend to focus on our differentiated platforms. You mentioned learning and training and inferencing. First of all, training is production. You can't train a network just once. You have to train your network all the time. And every single hyperscale company in the world is in the process of scaling out their training because the networks are getting bigger. They want their networks to do even better. The difference between a 95% accurate network and 98% accurate network or a 99% accurate network could mean billions of dollars of differences to Internet companies. And so this is a very big deal, and so they want their networks to be larger. They want to deploy their networks across more applications, and they want to train their network with new data all the time. And so training is a production matter. It is probably the largest HPC, high-performance computing, application on the planet that we know of at the moment. And so we're scaling, we're ramping up training for production for hyperscale companies. On the other hand, I really appreciate you asking about the inferencing thing. We recently -- well, this year, several months ago, we announced the M4, the Tesla M4 that was designed for inferencing. And it's a little tiny graphics card, a little tiny processor and it's less than 50 watts. It's called the M4. And at GTC, I announced a brand-new compiler called the GPU Inference Engine, GIE. And GIE recompiles the network that was trained so that it can be optimally inferenced at the lowest possible energy. And so not only are we already 50 watts, which is low power, we can also now inference at a higher energy efficiency than any processor that we know of today, better than any CPU by a very, very long shot; better than any FPGA. And so now hyperscale companies could use our GPUs for both training, and they use exactly the same architecture for inferencing and the energy efficiency is really fantastic. Now the benefit of using GPU for inferencing is that you're not just trying to inference only. You're trying to oftentimes decode the image or you could be decoding the video. You inference on it and you might even want to use it for transcoding, which is to re-encode that video and stream it to whoever it is that is -- that wants to share live video with. And so the processing that you want to do on the images and the video and the data is more than just inferencing, and the benefit of our GPU is that it's really great for all of the other stuff, too. And so we're seeing a lot of success in M4. I expect M4 to be quite a successful product. And hyperscale data centers, my expectation, we'll start to ramp that into production Q2, Q3, Q4 time frame.",629,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

And we don't comment on unannounced products as you know. I hate to ruin all of the surprises for you. But Pascal is the single most ambitious GPU architecture we have ever undertaken. And this is really the first GPU that was designed from the ground up for applications that are quite well beyond computer graphics and high-performance computing. It was designed to take into consideration all of the things that we've learned about deep learning, all of the things that we've learned about VR. For example, it has a brand-new graphics pipeline that allows Pascal to simultaneously project into multiple services at the same time with no performance penalty. Otherwise, it would degrade your performance in VR by a factor of 2 just because you have 2 services you're projecting into. And we can do all kinds of amazing things for augmented reality, other types of virtual reality displays, surround displays, curved displays, dome displays. I mean, there's all kind of holographic displays. There's all kinds of displays that are being invented at the moment, and we have the ability to now support those type of displays with a much more elegant architecture without degrading performance. So Pascal is, whether it's AI, whether it's gaming, whether it's VR, is really the most ambitious project we've ever undertaken, and it's going to go through all of our markets. The application for self-driving car is going to be pretty exciting. So it's going to go through all of our markets, and so we're -- of course, we have plenty to announce in the future, but we've announced what we've announced.",275,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And whether we get there 100%, 90%, 92%, 93% is, in my mind, completely irrelevant. The endeavor of getting there and making your car more and more autonomous, initially, of course, we would like to have a virtual co-pilot. Having a virtual co-pilot is the way I get to work every day. I mean, every single day I drive my Model S, and every single day I put it into autonomous mode and every single day it brings me joy. And I'm not confessing necessarily, but texting a little bit is okay. And so I think that the path to full autonomy is going to be paved by amazing capabilities along the way. And so we're not waiting around for 2019. We'll ship autonomous vehicles by the end of this year. And so I understand that we're 3 years ahead of other people's schedules. However, we also know that DRIVE PX 2 is the most advanced autonomous computing -- car computer in the world today. And it's powered by AI fully. And DRIVE PX 2, there will be a DRIVE PX 3, there will be a DRIVE PX 4 and then by 2019, I guess we'll be shipping DRIVE PX 5. And so those -- our road map is just like that. That's how we work, as you guys know very well. And so I think there's a lot of work to be done, which is the exciting part. The thing about a technology company, and the thing about any company, unless there's great problems and great challenges that we can help solve, what value do we bring? And what NVIDIA does for a living is to do what -- to build computers that no other company in the world can build, whether it's high-performance computers that are used to power a nation's supercomputers or a deep learning supercomputer so that we can gain insight from data, or self-driving car computers so that autonomous cars can save people's lives and make people's lives more convenient.

The Microsoft Research network, super deep network's 1,000 layers deep. And so training such a network is quite a chore and is quite an endeavor, and this is a problem that high-performance computing will have to be deployed and this is why our GPUs are so sought after. In terms of how big that's going to be, my sense is that almost no transaction, my sense is that almost no transaction with the Internet will be without deep learning or some machine learning inference in the future. I just can't imagine that. There's no recommendation of a movie, no recommendation of a purchase, no search -- no image search, no text that won't somehow have passed through some smart chat bot or smart bot or some machine learning algorithm so that they could make the transaction work, make the inference or more -- requests more useful to you. And so I think this is going to be a very big thing. And then on the other hand, the enterprises, we use deep learning all over our company today. And we're not -- we had the benefit of being early because we saw the power of this technology early on. But we're seeing deep learning being used now in medical imaging all over the world. We're seeing it being used in manufacturing. It's going to be used for scientific computing. More data is generated by high-performance computers and supercomputers than just about anything. They generate it through simulation. They generate so much data that they have to throw the vast majority of it away. For example, the Hadron Collider, whenever the protons collide, they throw away 99% of the data and they're able to barely keep up with just that 1%. And so by using machine learning and our GPUs, they could find insight in the rest of the 99%. There are just applications go on and on and on, and people are now starting to understand this deep learning. It really puts machine learning and puts artificial intelligence in the hands of engineers that's understandable, and that's one of the reasons why it's growing so fast. And so I don't know exactly how big it's going to be. But here's my proposition that this is going to be the next big computing model. The way that people compute, that in the past, software programmers wrote programs, compiled it. And in the future, we're going to have algorithms write the software for us. And so that's a very different [ph] way of computing, and I think it's a very big deal.",541,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

This quarter, we introduced our new family of Pascal-based GPUs, one of our most successful launches ever. We also benefited from both the winding adoption of deep learning and our expanding engagement with hyperscale datacenters around the world as they apply deep learning to all the services they provide. 
Revenue continued to accelerate, rising 24% to a record $1.43 billion. We saw strong sequential and year-on-year growth across our 4 platforms: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive. Our business model based on driving GPU compute platforms into highly targeted markets is clearly succeeding. 
The GPU business was up 25% to $1.2 billion from a year ago. The Tegra Processor Business increased 30% to $166 million. 
In Q2, our 4 platforms contributed nearly 89% of revenue, up from 85% a year earlier and 87% in the preceding quarter. They collectively increased 29% year-over-year. 
Let's begin with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue increased 18% year-on-year to $781 million, reflecting the success of our latest generation of Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region. 
The Pascal architecture offers a number of amazing technological advances. It enables unprecedented performance and efficiency for playing sophisticated AAA gaming titles and diving [ph] rich, immersive VR experiences. 
In our most successful launch ever, we introduced 4 major products. They are GeForce GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060 for the enthusiast market and the Titan X, the world's fastest consumer GPU for deep learning development, digital content creation and extreme gaming. 
WIRED magazine called the GTX 1080 an unprecedented piece of electronic precision, one that performs Herculean feats of computational strength. Forbes called GTX 1060, which brings a premium VR experience within reach of many, a fantastic product. And HardwareCanucks describes Titan X as a technological tour de force with frame rates that are simply mind boggling. The GTX 1080, 1070, 1060 and Titan X are now in full production and available to consumers worldwide. 
VR's potential is on vivid display in a new open-source game that we released during the quarter. Available on Steam, NVIDIA VR Funhouse is an open-source title created with our GameWorks SDK. It integrates physical simulation into VR along with amazing graphics and precise haptics that you feel like you're actually at a carnival. 
Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue grew to a record $214 million, up 22% year-on-year and up 13% sequentially. Growth came from the high end of the market for realtime rendering tools and mobile workstations. The M6000 GPU 24GB launched earlier this year, is drawing strong interest from a broad range of customers. 
Digital Domain, a leading special effects studio, is using Quadro to accelerate productivity for its work on films and commercials, which requires especially tight turnaround times. Engineer giant AECOM and the Yale School of Architecture are using Quadro to accelerate their design and engineering workflows. 
Last month at SIGGRAPH Conference, we introduced the series of new products that embed photorealistic and immersive experience into workflows incorporating Iray and VR. We launched the Pascal-based Quadro P6000, the most-advanced workstation in GPU, enabling designers to manipulate complex designs up to twice as fast as before. 
We demonstrated how deep learning is being brought to the realm of the industrial design to create better products faster, and we launched 8 new and updated software libraries, such as VRWorks 360 video SDK, which brings panoramic video to VR. 
Moving to datacenter. Revenue reached a record $151 million, more than doubling year-on-year and up 6% sequentially. This impressive performance reflects strong growth in supercomputing, hyperscale datacenters and GRID virtualization. 
Interest in deep learning is surging as industries increasingly seek to harness this revolutionary technology. Hyperscale companies remain fast adopters of deep learning, both for training and realtime inference, particularly for natural lingual processing, video and image analysis. Among them are Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba and Baidu. 
Major cloud providers are also offering GPU computing for their customers. Microsoft Azure is now using NVIDIA's GPUs to provide computing and graphics virtualization. 
During the quarter, we began shipping Tesla P100, the world's most advanced GPU accelerator based on the Pascal architecture. Designed to accelerate deep learning training, it allows application performance to scale up to 8 GPUs using our NVLink interconnect.  We also announced a variant of P100 based on PCI Express, what makes it suitable for a wide range of accelerated servers. 
At our GPU Technology Conference in April, we introduced DGX-1, the world's first deep learning supercomputer. Equipped with 8 P100s in a single box, it provides deep learning performance that is equivalent to 250 traditional servers. It comes loaded with NVIDIA software and AI application developers. We are seeing strong interest in DGX-1 from AR researchers and developers across academia, government labs and large enterprises. 
Two days ago, Jen-Hsun hand-delivered the very first DGX-1 production model to the OpenAI institute. They plan to use this system in part to build autonomous agents like chat box, cars and robots. Broader deliveries will commence later this quarter. 
We'll be talking more about deep learning later this year at regional versions of our GPU Technology Conference set for 8 cities around the world. Among them: Beijing, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Seoul as well as Washington, D.C. 
Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than doubled in the quarter. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries, particularly automotive and AEC. Among customers out of this quarter were Statoil, a Norwegian oil and gas company. 
Finally in automotive. Revenue increased to a record $119 million, up 68% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially, driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars. 
Our effort to help partners develop self-driving cars continues to accelerate. We have started to ship our DRIVE PX 2 automotive supercomputer to the 80-plus companies using both our hardware and DriveWorks software to develop autonomous driving technologies. We remain on track to ship our autopilot solution based on the DRIVE platform. 
Beyond our 4 platforms, our OEM and IP business was $163 million, down 6% year-on-year, in line with mainstream PC demand. 
Now turning to the rest of the income statement. We have record GAAP gross margin of 57.9% while non-GAAP gross margin was 58.1%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach and strong demand for deep learning. 
GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, down 9% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, up 6% from a year earlier. This reflects increased hiring in R&D and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower legal fees. 
GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $317 million compared to $76 million a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income was $382 million, up 65%. Non-GAAP operating margins improved 680 basis points from a year ago to 26.8%. 
Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenue to be $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.8% and 58%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $465 million. And GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 21%, plus or minus 1%. 
Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.

Our datacenter business is comprised of 3 basic markets, as you're alluding to. One of them is high-performance computing. And it's -- one could argue -- one could say -- characterize it is an additional supercomputing market and very computationally intensive. A second market is GRID, which is our data center virtualization, basically graphics application virtualization. You could stream and serve any PC or any PC application from datacenter to any client device. And the third application is deep learning, and this is largely hyperscale datacenters applying deep learning to enhance their applications to make them much smarter, much more delightful. The vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning, by far. And the reason for that is because high-performance computing is a relatively stable business. It's still growing business, and I expect the high-performance computing to do quite well over the coming years. GRID is a fast-growing business. I think Colette said that it was growing 100% year-over-year, but it's from a much smaller base. And deep learning is not only significant in size, it's also growing quite substantially.",183,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thank you. And then last question. On the new -- so you're just starting to ship Pascal now. I guess my understanding is that, historically, as you're shipping a new product, it's -- the yields have opportunity for improvement, and the more volume you ship, the more you climb down the yield curve.

For long-term NVIDIA followers, you might have recalled that 40-nanometer was a very challenging node for us, and with all of these challenges, it's an opportunity for us to improve our company. And we've implemented a very rigorous process node preparation methodology. And it starts with -- of course, with some of the world's best process design engineers, circuit design engineers and process-readiness teams. And we have a fantastic group dedicated to just getting process ready for us. And the second part of it is just -- is how that process readiness is integrated throughout the entire company. And so I'm really, really proud of the way that the company executed on Pascal. 16-nanometer FinFET is no trivial task. Not to mention the speed of the memories that we use. It's the world's first G5X. We also ramped the world's first HBM2 memory and 3D memory stacking. So the number of technological challenges that we overcame in the ramp of Pascal is quite extraordinary. I'm super proud of the team. Now going forward, we're going to continue to refine yields, and that is absolutely the case. However, we came into 16-nanometer with a great deal of preparedness. And so it's too early to guess what's going to happen to yields and margins long term, but we'll guide one quarter at a time.",243,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

We're experiencing growth in all of our businesses. Our strategy of focusing on deep learning, self-driving cars, gaming and virtual reality where markets -- these are markets where GPU makes a very significant difference, is really paying off. And I think this quarter was -- this quarter is really the first quarter where we saw growth across every single one of our businesses, and my expectation is that we're going to see growth across all of our businesses next quarter as well. But it's driven by the focus on these key markets and away from traditional commodity components businesses. I think one particular dynamic sticks out, and it's a very significant growth driver where we have an extraordinary position in, and it's deep learning. Deep learning, you may have heard, is a new computing approach. It's a new computing model and requires a new computing architecture. And this is where the parallel approach of GPUs is perfectly suited. And 5 years ago, we started to invest in deep learning quite substantially. And we made fundamental changes and enhancements for deep learning across our entire stack of technology from the GPU architecture to the GPU design to the systems that GPUs connect into, for example, NVLink, to all the system software that has been designed for it like cuDNN and DIGITS, to all of the deep learning experts that we have now in our company. The last 5 years, we've quietly invested in deep learning because we believe that the future of deep learning is so impactful to the entire software industry, the entire computer industry that we, if you will, pushed it all in. And now we find ourselves at the epicenter of this very important dynamic, and it is probably -- this -- if there is one particular growth factor that is of great significance, it would be deep learning.",316,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

Very strong trends. I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal and have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle, whether it's the price or what part of the stack they are buying now and how quickly they're refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles?",76,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Thanks a lot, Vivek. Let's see, on PC gaming, there's a few dynamics. Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world. And in fact, only about 1/3 has even upgraded to Maxwell. And we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter. And so that gives you a sense of how much -- and Pascal is unquestionably, unquestionably, the biggest leap we've ever made generationally in GPUs, ever. It is not only high performance, it's also energy efficient. And it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others. And so I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us. And it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market 5 years ago. One dynamic that's really quite powerful is that the production quality, the production content is much, much higher in video games today than ever. And the reason for that, I've mentioned several times in previous calls, is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible, meaning the PlayStation4 and Xbox One and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible. And so the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations. This is a dynamic that's relatively new, and so as a result, the quality of games go up, which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it. And I think we're absolutely seeing that dynamic. I'm super excited about the fact that the next-generation game console, the big boost, the 2x boost is coming just around the corner. And that's going to allow game content providers, game developers to aim even higher, and I think that that's going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming. I would say that there's some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well as you know very well, which is eSports is no longer just an interest. eSports is a full-force global phenomenon and very, very powerful in Asia, in just about every developing country, and of course, the Western World as well. And I think that I -- on top of that, not only is VR off to a great start, we're seeing some great content now. But some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal, tapping into this grassroots but rather global interest in using video game as an art medium. We introduced project NVIDIA Ansel, which is the world's first in-game photography system, allows you to create virtual reality photographs, and it's just really, really amazing. And so you could use your video game, capture your amazing moments, share it in VR or in high-res with all your friends. So there's a lot of different ways to enjoy games now, and the production value just continues to go up, which is great for our platforms. And so I -- the -- just to summarize your initial question, how much of the installed base has upgraded to Pascal. Very, very small, of course, because we just started production ramp.

Well, as you can imagine, we have a good pulse on the state of the industry, and we've been in this industry since the very beginning. And deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made it practical, made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software. It is -- GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors, not one big processor, but a whole bunch of small processors. And vitally, they're connected by this connecting tissue. This connecting tissue inside our processor, connecting memory, connecting fabric, that makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously. This -- that architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago. That invention has really been groundbreaking. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning, where neuro-nets are communicating -- neurons, essentially, inspired by neurons, communicating with each other all simultaneously. And so the GP was really quite a perfect match. If you look at deep learning today, 5 years later, I think it's a foregone conclusion that deep learning is being infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter, more intelligent, more delightful to consumers. And so you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad, it's large scale, and it's completely global. And this new computing approach, we realized was going to be quite significant long term. And so 5 years ago, we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our company. GPU computing is not just a GPU chip. It's GPU architecture. It's the GPU -- it's design, the GPU system, all of the algorithms that run on top of it, all of the tools that run on top of it, the frameworks, our collaborations with researchers all over the world. And so that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last 2 generations. When we started this, we were in Kepler, Maxwell was some 10x better than Kepler, and Pascal was some 10x better than Maxwell. And so in just 2 generations, just 5 years’ time, we've improved deep learning by an enormous amount. And the GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all the work that we've done to it. And our strategy -- and this is where we're different, not only the focus in the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing, but where we're really different, I would say, is our singular architectural approach to deep learning. We've essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture. We've made this architecture available from hyperscale to data centers, to workstations, to notebooks, to PCs, to cars, to embedded computers, to even a brand-new fully integrated high-performance computer in a box, we call DGX, the NVIDIA DGX-1. And so there's so many different ways to gain access to the NVIDIA architecture and the NVIDIA platform for deep learning. It's just literally all over the place, all around you. You could -- it's available to you in retail stores, in Etail stores, from OEMs, in the cloud or even universities all over the world, just in embedded computer kits. And so our approach is quite singular and quite focused. And so my sense is that our lead is quite substantial and our position is very good, but we're not sitting on our laurels, as you can tell. And for the last 5 years, we've been investing quite significantly. And so over the next several years, I think you're going to continue to see quite significant jumps from us as we continue to advance in this area.",648,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Yes, we've just started this quarter shipping DRIVE PX 2. And just before I answer your question, let me just tell you what DRIVE PX 2 is. DRIVE PX 2, of course, is a processor. It's -- the DRIVE PX 2 version, with just one single processor with just partner, and -- our Tegra processor and optionally with discrete GPUs, you could literally build -- you can build a car with autopilot capability or an AI copilot capability all the way to self-driving car capability. And it's able to do sensor fusion. It's able to do SLAM, which is localization and mapping; detection using deep neuro-nets of the environment in a surround manner, all of the cameras around the car, all feeding into the processor and the DRIVE PX processor doing realtime inferencing of surround cameras; all the way to the actual planning and driving of the car. All done in this one car computer -- this one car AI supercomputer. And so this quarter, we started shipping them to all of our partners and developers, and -- so that they can start developing their software and their systems around our computer and on top of our software stack. We have the intentions of shipping in volume production many of these. And it's hard to know exactly what everybody's schedule is, but it ranges everything from very soon to the next couple of years. Developing a self-driving car is no -- it's a fairly significant undertaking, and so nobody does it for fun, surely. And the question is -- maybe if I could frame the question just slightly differently, do I expect people to be building OEM cars. Or do we expect them to be building shuttles that are maybe geo-fenced? Do we expect them to be building trucks? And you know how many trucks are on the road and how much of the world's economy is built around trucking products all over the world. To services of -- basically, taxi as a service. The answer is that we're working with customers and partners across that entire range, from cars that are sold, to trucks, to vans, to shuttles, to services.",366,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Founders Edition is engineered by NVIDIA, completely built by NVIDIA and sold directly by NVIDIA and supported by NVIDIA. There's some people that -- some gamers and customers who would prefer to have a direct relationship with our company. Its availability is limited. And it's engineered just at the highest possible level of quality, and we limit the production of it. And the reason for that is because we have a network of partners who are much, much more able to take the NVIDIA architecture to every corner of the world literally overnight. We have a fair number of partners who blanket every single country on the planet as we know. And so -- and it comes -- and they can provide them in different sizes and shapes and styles and different thermal solutions and different configurations and different price points. And so I think -- we believe that, that diversity is one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GeForce platform is so popular. And it creates a lot of excitement in the marketplace and a lot of interesting different diversified designs. And so I think those 2 strategies are harmonious with each other. And -- but our -- the key point is we built the Founders Edition, really, as a way for some customers to be able to purchase directly and have a relationship directly with us.

The first being, we've done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be and for GPUs within that. So it'd be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that. And then secondly, is there a market there for an APU-type product in the data center? I know you guys have Project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective, but is there a deep learning integrated CPU-GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your company that you guys are considering pursuing?",118,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Yes, first of all, the type of workloads in the data center has really changed. Back in the good old days, it largely ran database searches and -- but that has changed so much. It's no longer just about text. It's no longer just about data. The vast majority of what's going through the Internet and what's going through data centers today, as you guys know very well, are images, they're voice, they're -- and increasingly, and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video. Live video, if you think about it for just a moment, it's live video, so it doesn't stay in the server and it doesn't get recorded, which means that if you want to enjoy that live video, there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the data center that's running realtime on their live video so that the person that might be interested in the video stream that you're streaming knows who to alert and who to invite to come and watch the live video. And so if you think about data center traffic going forward, my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput, increasingly high multimedia content and, increasingly of course, powered by AI and powered by deep learning. And so I think that's number one. The second is that the architecture of the data center is recognizably, understandably changing because the workload is changing. Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past. And so the architecture is a new computing model, new -- it's recognized it needs a new computing architecture. And accelerators like GPUs are really, well -- a good fit. And so now the question is how much. It's hard to say. It's hard to say how much. But my sense is that it's going to be a lot. And without any predictions, it's going to be a lot more than we currently ship. And so I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant. I think every hyperscale data center will be GPU accelerated. It'll be GPU accelerated for training. It'll be GPU accelerated for inferencing. There may be other approaches, but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large -- a large part of that. And then lastly, APUs. I guess -- for data centers, I guess my sense is for data centers, energy efficiency is such a vital part. And although the workload is increasingly AI and increasingly live video and multimedia, where GPU is going to add a lot of value, there's still a lot of workload that is CPU centric, and you still want to have an extraordinary CPU. And I don't think anybody would argue that Intel makes the world's best CPUs. It's not even close -- there's not even a close second. And so I think the artfulness of -- and the craftsmanship of Intel CPUs is pretty hard to not -- deny. And for most data centers, I think if you need -- if you have CPU workloads, anyways, I think Intel Xeons are hard to beat. And so that's my opinion anyways.",536,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

We have to continue -- keep pushing VR and get the head mounts out to the world. I think HTC Vive is -- they're doing a great job. Oculus, of course, are doing a great job. And so I think we track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there. It's growing all the time. Second, the content is really cool, and people are really enjoying it. And so we just got to get more content, and developers all over the world are jumping onto VR. It really is a great new experience. But it's not just games, as you know. One of the areas where we have a lot of success, and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise, in industrial design, and in medicine, medical imaging, and architectural engineering. We use it ourselves. We -- we're doing a fair amount of design of our workspace, and we render everything using our photorealistic renderer called Iray, fully accelerated by our GPUs, and then we render it into VR, and we enjoy it completely in VR. And it's something else to be inside an environment that's photorealistic to be rendered and completely enjoying in VRs, so architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that. So we see a lot of broad-based adoption of VR. Now one of the things that we did, which was really spectacular, is the multiresolution, multiprojection rendering of Pascal. It's the world's first GPU architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one. And the reason for that is because the GPU back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display. You have one keyboard. You have one display. But that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types. And so multiprojection was a revolutionary approach to graphics and Pascal introduced it, and you really benefit in VR. The second thing that we did was we integrated physics -- real-world physics simulation into VR. The benefit is that without the laws of physics, as you know, you can't feel anything. Things don't collide. Things don't bounce. When you pick up something, you don't feel the haptics of it. We've -- we made the entire environment physics -- physically simulated. And so as a result, you feel the entire environment when you tip a bottle of water over, it behaves like a bottle of water tipped over, and balls behave the way balls behave. And things don't merge into each other. So that integration with haptics is going to completely revolutionize VR, we believe, and that's physics simulation is another thing. And so I think our position in VR is really quite great. And I'm certainly enthusiastic about the development of VR.",490,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And going forward, which is probably your question, my sense is that deep learning would become a very significant part of that. The other thing to realize is that deep learning is not just for Internet service providers, for voice recognition and image recognition and face recognition and such. Deep learning is a way of using mathematics, using software to discover insight in a huge amount of data. And the one place where we generate a huge amount of data is high-performance computing. Every single supercomputing center in the world is going to move towards deep learning. And the reason for that is because they generate a huge amount of data that they really have very little ability to comb through, to sort through. And now with deep learning, they could discover really, really subtle insights in data that's hyper dimensional. And so that's -- the way to think about deep learning is it's really mathematics. It's a new form of mathematics that is very, very powerful. It's a new approach to software. But don't think of it as a market. I think every market's going to be a deep learning market. I think every application is going to be a deep learning application, and I think software, every piece of software will be infused by AIs long term.",254,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

I appreciate the question. The team has been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer-aided design is done. Your observation is absolutely right. And it's coming from several different places. First of all, more and more of design is really about product design, industrial design, where the feeling of the product, the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product. And whether you're talking about a building or just a consumer product or a car, we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photorealistic way using real material simulations. The computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary. And we're now seeing one design package after another, whether it's Dassault's leading packages, SolidWorks' leading packages, Autodesk, Adobe, the amount of GPUs has really, really increased. And it's increasing quite dramatically. I think partly because, finally, for all of the ISVs, for all the developers, not only is the market demand for earlier views of photorealistic designs an important, important decision criteria, they can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer. And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capability that they put into their packages, if they rely on GPUs, will have the benefits of GPUs there. And so I think that, that virtuous cycle, you're starting to see in design. And so the investment that we made in the photorealistic rendering several years ago, the GPU acceleration of optics, this layer for path-tracing that is used by just about every software package in the world, our continued evangelism of GPUs and its general-purpose use from computer graphics all the way to imaging is something that I think is starting to see benefits. That's number one. Number two, Maxwell was the most energy-efficient GPU ever made until Pascal. Maxwell was twice the energy efficiency of Kepler. And the amazing thing is that Pascal is twice the energy efficiency of Maxwell. But Maxwell made it possible for thin and light designs in laptops and more elegant workstations and the ability to put more horsepower, more capability into any workstation because of power concerns. Maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of GPU that it uses. And I think that, going forward, your last question is, going forward, do we see -- how do we see Pascal? Pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world. And so I think in the coming quarters, we're going to expect to see Pascal out there. And my expectation is that the dynamics I just described, which is software developers using more photorealistic capabilities, our invention of GPU-accelerated photo rendering, Iray and optics and MDL, material description language, and then lastly, the energy efficiency of GPUs.

I guess the first part would be we've seen in the recent months some partnerships being formed with some of your competitors and some of your customers, and we've seen some of those partnerships actually dissolve. So I wondered how does NVIDIA play in this general ecosystem in forming partnerships or not. And then the second part, if we put even just a rough year on it, when would you think the autonomous driving part of your automotive business would actually exceed the infotainment size of your automotive business?",98,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

Well, we play in a graceful, friendly, and open way. And I mean that, I guess, rather seriously. We believe this. We believe that building this autonomous driving car, self-driving car, is a pile of software. And it's really complicated software. It's really, really complicated software. And it's not like 1 company is going to do it. And it's also not logical that large, great companies who are refining their algorithms and the capabilities of their self-driving cars over the course of the next 2 decades can outsource to someone the self-driving car stack. We've always felt that, that self-driving cars is a software problem, and that large companies need to give it [ph] -- own their own destiny. And that's the reason, why DRIVE PX 2 is an open stack, and it's an open platform so that every car company can build their self-driving car on top of it. Number one. Number two, the DRIVE PX 2 architecture is scalable. And the reason for that is because automatic braking and autopilot on a highway and a virtual copilot and a completely autonomous self-driving car, a self-driving truck, a geo-fenced autonomous shuttle, all of these -- a completely autonomous taxi. All of these platforms cannot be solved by 1 chip. It's just not even logical. The computation necessary to do it is so diverse. And the more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances, the more 9s you would like to have, if you will, the more computation you have to do. Just as voice recognition, the amount of computation necessary for voice recognition over the last, just 4, 5 years, has increased by 100x. But notice how precise and how accurate voice recognition has become. And image recognition, video -- circumstance recognition, context recognition, all of that is going to require just an enormous amount of computation. And so we believe that scalable platforms is necessary, number two. And then number three. Detection, computer vision and detection, object detection is just one tiny sliver of the entire autonomous driving problem. It's just 1 tiny sliver. And we've always said that autonomous vehicle, self-driving cars, is really a AI-computing problem. It's a computing problem because the processors needs not just detection but also computation. The CPU matters. The GPU matters. The entire system, architecture matters. And so the entire computation engine matters. Number two. Computation is -- computing is not just a chip problem. It's largely a software problem. And the body of software necessary for the entire system software stack, if you were the operating system of a self-driving, realtime computer, super -- realtime supercomputer, doesn't exist. Most supercomputers are best-effort supercomputers. They run a job as fast as they can until they're done. But that's not good enough for self-driving cars. This supercomputer has to run in realtime, and it has to react the moment it sees that there's danger in the way. And best effort doesn't cut it. You need it to be a realtime supercomputer. And the world's never built a realtime supercomputer before. And that's what DRIVE PX 2 is all about, a realtime supercomputer for surround, autonomous AI. And so that's the focus that we have. That's the direction that we've taken, and I think what you're seeing is that the market is starting to react to that. That maybe as they go further and further into autonomous driving that they're discovering that the problems are related to the type of problems that we're seeing. And that's the reason why DRIVE PX is a computer, not a smart camera.",618,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Deep learning is really machine learning supercharged. And deep learning is really about discovering insight in Big Data, in big unstructured data, in multidimensional data. And that's why deep learning, that's -- I've called it -- its Thor's hammer that fell from the sky. And it's this amazing technology that these researchers discovered. And we were incredibly, incredibly well prepared because GPU is naturally parallel. And we put us in a position to really be able to contribute to this new computing revolution. But when you think about it in the context that it's just -- it's software development, it's a new method of doing software. And it's a new way of discovering insight from data. What company wouldn't need it? So every medical -- every life sciences company needs it. Every health-care company needs it. Every energy discovery company needs it. Every Etail, retail company needs it. Everybody has lots of data. Everybody has lots and lots of data that they own themselves. Every manufacturing company needs it. Every company that has -- that cares about security, every company that deals with a massive amount of customer data has the benefit of -- that can benefit from deep learning. And so that -- when you frame it in that context, I think I would say that deep learnings market opportunity is even greater in enterprises than it is in consumer Internet services. And that's exactly the reason why we built the NVIDIA DGX-1. Because most of these enterprises don't have the expertise or don't -- simply don't have the willpower to want to build a supercomputing datacenter or a high-performance computer, they would just rather buy an appliance, if you will, with all of the software integrated and the performance incredibly well tuned, and it comes out of a box. And that's essentially what NVIDIA DGX-1 is. It's a supercomputer in a box, and it's designed and tuned for high-performance computing for deep learning.",338,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

And we'll know how everything turns out next quarter when we talk again. But I -- at some high level, I would agree with you that as we move further and further and more and more into our platform approach of business, where our platform is specialized and rich with software, that increasingly, the value of the product that we bring has extraordinary enterprise value that the benefits of using it is not just measured in frames per second but real TCO for companies and real cost savings as they reduce the number of server clusters, and real increases and real boosts in their productivity.

So my understanding, as you describe it, it's 1 scalable architecture from the cockpit to ADAS to mapping to autonomous driving.

There's no way to square, and there's no reason to square. And you're not going to find one answer. And the reason why you're not going to find one answer is because nobody knows exactly how to get it done. We all have intuitions, and we all have beliefs about how we're going to be able to ultimately solve the long-term, fully autonomous vehicle that wherever I am, the car I step into, the automotive -- automobile I step into is completely autonomous. And that has AI inside and out. And it's just an incredible experience. But we're not there yet. And all of these companies have slightly -- not all, but many companies have slightly different visions of the future. Some people believe that the path to the future is fully autonomous right away in a geo-fenced area that has been fully mapped in advance. Some people believe that you can use it just for highway autopilot as a first starting point and work quickly towards fully autonomy. Some people believe that the best way to do that is through shuttles and trucks. So you see a lot of different visions out there. And I think all of those visions are coming from smart people doing smart things. And they're targeting different aspects of transportation. I think there's a fallacy that transportation in every single country, in every single form, is exactly the same. It just doesn't work that way. And so there's technology insight and then there's market insight. And there's a technology vision versus your entry point. And I think that's where all of the squaring doesn't happen. And so you're solving for problems that -- you're solving for a simple equation that won't happen. However, there's one thing that we believe absolutely will happen. We are absolutely certain that AI is going to be involved in this endeavor, that finally with deep learning and finally with AI, that we believe we have the secret sauce necessary to break these puzzles and to solve these puzzles over a period of time, number one. Number two, we believe unquestionably that, depending on the problem you want to solve, you need a different amount of computational capability. We believe unambiguously, this is a software problem and that for the largest of transportation companies, they need to own there's -- they're going to need to own their own software in collaboration with you. But they're not going to let you do it and keep it as a black box. We believe unambiguously that this is a computing problem, that this is a realtime supercomputing problem that it's not just about a special widget, but computation is necessary. Processors, a computer, system, system software, and enormous amount of operating system capability is necessary to build something like this. It is a massive software problem. Otherwise, we would have done it already. And so I think that you're going to see this year, the beginnings of a lot of those -- of some very visionary and really quite exciting introductions. But in the next year and the year after that, I think you're going to see more and more and more. I think this is the beginning. And so we're working with some really, really amazing people to get this done.",552,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

Congrats, actually, on a pretty darn good quarter and an amazing guidance. I want to come back to the difference of Pascal versus what would be otherwise competition from [indiscernible], Intel or AMD. There's been a fair amount of documentation talking about the power requirements or the power draw differences between Pascal versus Polaris. And one would think that while that's important in gaming and it's gotten a lot of notice, it would actually be more important for these deep learning applications that we've been talking so much about over the past half hour, 45 minutes, can you maybe talk to that side of the design, not so much the horsepower, but maybe the power efficiency of it and what that means for when you scale it up into really big problems?",139,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

First of all, I appreciate the comment. The team worked really, really hard, and over the last several years, the last 5 years, all of the employees of NVIDIA have been pursuing a strategy that took until today, really, to show people that it really pays off. And it's a very unique business model. It's a very unique approach. But I just want to congratulate all the employees that have worked so hard to do -- to get us here. I appreciate the comment also about energy efficiency. In fact, energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward. And the reason for that is because every single environment that we're in is power-constrained. Every single environment. Even your PC with 750 watts or a 1,000 watts is power constrained. Because we can surely put more GPUs in there than 1,000 watts. And so that's power constrained. We're in environments where we only have 1 or 2 watts. It might be a drone. And we need to be -- we're completely power constrained, so energy efficiency is really important. We might be in a datacenter where we're doing deep learning and we're training neuro-nets or we're inferencing neuro-nets. And this particular case, although the datacenter has a lot of power to provision, the number of GPUs that they want to use in it is measured in tens, tens and tens of thousands. And so energy efficiency becomes the predominant issue. Energy efficiency literally is the most important feature of the processor. Now from there, there are functionality and architectural features. The architectural changes that we made in Pascal so that we could stay ahead of the deep learning research work and the deep learning progress was groundbreaking. And people are starting to discover the architectural changes that we put into Pascal, and it's going to make a huge difference in the next several years of deep learning. And so that's a feature in architectural innovation. And then lastly, of course, there's all of the software that goes on top of processor T-based [ph]. We call it GPU computing instead of just GPUs because GPU computing is about computing. It's about software. It's about systems. It's about the interrelationship of our GPU with the memories and all the memories around the system and the networking and interconnect and storage. And it's a large-scale computing problem. It is also the highest throughput computing problem on the planet, which is the reason why we've been called upon by our nation to build the world's next 2 fastest supercomputers. High-throughput computing is our company's expertise. High-throughput computing from fundamental architecture to chip design to system design to system software to algorithms to computational mathematics and all the experts in all the various fields of science, that is the great investment that we made in the last 5 years, and I think the results are really starting to show.",495,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

It represents the vast majority of our data center revenues recently, and my sense is that it's going to continue to be a significant part of it. And so what was the second question? Did I miss it?

Tegra is at the core of all of our self-driving car initiative. And so without Tegra, there would be no self-driving cars. And so Tegra is the core of our self-driving car initiative. It is the computing platform for self-driving cars. And DRIVE PX 2 includes Tegra as well as the street GPUs of Pascal. But the core of it, the vast majority of the heavy lifting is done by Tegra, and we expect that going forward. And so Tegra is incredibly important to us. Tegra is also the core of the processor of Jetson. Jetson is a platform that is designed for other embedded autonomous and intelligent machines. And so you could imagine what kind of intelligent machines in the future would benefit from deep learning and AI by robots and drones and embedded applications inside buildings and cities. There are all kinds of applications. I'm very, very optimistic about the future of Jetson. But at the core of that is also Tegra. And so think of Tegra as our computer on a chip, and it's our AI computer on a chip. Okay, may I -- I appreciate all the questions. Thank you, all, for joining us today. I would -- our growth is really driven by several factors. Our focus on deep learning self-driving cars, gaming and VR, markets where GPU has been vital is really starting to pay off. The second factor is that Pascal is the most advanced GPU ever created, and we're incredibly excited about it. And we -- this last quarter, we ramped it with enormous success, and I'm so proud of the team for all of the preparation and the execution this last quarter. And the third is hyperscale adoption of deep learning is now widespread, is large scale, and we're seeing it globally. Those are several growth drivers ahead of us. As we go forward, we're also looking to sharing our many developments in deep learning AI with you. We're really just in the beginning of seeing the actual growth of deep learning as we scale out into the market. Deep learning adoption is now widespread and is ramping at every hyperscale datacenter. It's a new computing model. It requires a new computing architecture, one that GPU is perfectly suited for. And the thing that we've done that I'm really delighted with is the strategy that started 5 years ago to optimize our GPU computing platform from end-to-end and optimize it for deep learning. At the processor level, at the architecture level, at the chip design level, systems and software and algorithms and a richness of deep learning experts at the company and the collaboration that we have all over the world with researchers and developers has made it possible for us to continue to advance this field and this platform. And as a result of that, our deep learning platform has improved far more than anybody would have expected. If you just projected it based on semiconductor physics, it would be nowhere near the level of speed-up and step-up that we got from generation to generation. From Kepler to Maxwell, we got 10x, from Maxwell to Pascal, we get another 10x. And you can surely expect pretty substantial improvements and increases from us over the next several years. Where we really shine is -- not only is it a fantastic platform for deep learning and the training of the networks, but it's also fantastic platform to scale out. You can enjoy our platform, whether it's in cloud or in data center or in supercomputers and workstations and deskside PCs, and notebook computers to cars to embedded computers, as I mentioned just now, with Jetson. This is a one singular architecture approach so the thoughtfulness and the care of the investment of the developers and the software programmers and researchers is really our preeminent concern. And as we know, computing is about architecture and computing is about platform, and mostly computing is about developers, and we've been quite thoughtful about the importance it is to developers. And as a result, developers all over the world, all over the industry can use the singular architecture and get the benefits of their science and their applications as they scale and deploy their work. So that's it. We had a great quarter, and I look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. Thank you all for joining us.",738,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Revenue reached a record in the third quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Driving this was success in our Pascal-based gaming platform and growth in our datacenter platform, reflecting the role of NVIDIA's GPU as the engine of AI computing. 
Q3 revenue increased 54% from a year earlier to $2 billion and was up 40% from the previous quarter. Strong year-on-year gains were achieved across all 4 of our platforms: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive. The GPU business was up 53% to $1.7 billion and the Tegra Processor Business increased 87% to $241 million. 
Let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue crossed the $1 billion mark and increased 63% year-on-year to a record $1.24 billion, fueled by our Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region across desktop and notebook and across the full-gaming audience, from GTX 1050 to the Titan X. GeForce gaming PC notebooks recorded significant gains. 
Our continued growth in the GTX gaming GPUs reflects the unprecedented performance and efficiency gains in the Pascal architecture. It delivers seamless play on games and richly immersive VR experiences. In Q3, for desktops, we launched the GTX 1050 and the 1050 TI, bringing eSports and VR capabilities at great value. For notebooks we introduced GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060, giving gamers a major leap forward in performance and efficiency in a mobile experience. 
The fundamentals of the gaming market remain strong. The production value of blockbuster games continues to increase. Gamers are upgrading to higher-end GPUs to enjoy highly anticipated fall titles like Battlefield 1, Gears Of War 3, Call Of Duty, Infinite Warfare. And eSports is attracting a new generation of gamers to the PC. League of Legends is played by over 100 million gamers each month. And there is now a twitch audience of more than 300 million who follow eSports. VR and AR will redefine entertainment and gaming. A great experience requires a high-performance GPU, and we believe we're still in the early innings of these evolving markets. 
Pascal represents not only the biggest innovation gains we've made in a single GPU generation in a decade. It's also our best executed product rollout. 
Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue grew 9% from a year ago to $207 million, driven by growth in the high end of the markets for real-time rendering and mobile workstations. We are seeing strong customer interest in the Pascal-based P6000 among digital entertainment leaders like Pixar, Disney and ILM; architectural, engineering and construction companies like Japan's Shimizu; and automotive companies like Hyundai. 
Next, datacenter. Revenue nearly tripled from a year ago and was up 59% sequentially to $240 million. Growth was strong across all fronts in AI and supercomputing for hyperscale, as well as for GRID, virtualization and supercomputing. GPU deep learning is revolutionizing AI and is poised to impact every industry worldwide. Hyperscale companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Baidu are using it to solve problems for their billions of consumers. Cloud GPU computing has shown explosive growth. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and AliCloud are deploying NVIDIA GPUs for AI, data analytics and HPC. 
AWS just recently announced its new EC2 P2 instant, which scales up to 16 GPUs to accelerate a wide range of AI applications, including image and video recognition, unstructured data analytics and video transcoding. 
We saw strong growth in AI training. For AI inference, we announced the Tesla P4 and P40 to serve power-efficient and high-performance workloads, respectively. Shipments began in Q3 for the DGX-1 AI supercomputer. Early users include major universities like Stanford, UC Berkeley and NYU; leading research groups such as OpenAI, the German Institute of Artificial Intelligence, and the Swiss Artificial Intelligence Lab; as well as multinationals like SAP. So far this year, our GPU Technology Conference program has reached 18,000 developers and ecosystem partners, underscoring the broad enthusiasm for AI. 
Complementing our major spring event in Silicon Valley, we have organized GTCs in 7 cities on 4 continents. They drew sellout audiences in Beijing, Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as Amsterdam, Melbourne and Washington, D.C. with Mumbai still to come. Along with 400 sessions and labs, we provided training in AI skills to nearly 2,000 individuals through our Deep Learning Institute instruction program. 
We also have begun partnering with key global companies to enable the adoption of AI. To implement AI in manufacturing, we announced a collaborative with Japan's FANUC, focused on robots and automated factories. And in the transportation sector, more than 80 OEMs, Tier 1s and startups are using our GPUs for their work on self-driving cars. 
Our GRID graphics virtualization business continues to achieve extremely strong growth. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries, particularly manufacturing, automotive, engineering and education. Among customers added this quarter were Johns Hopkins University and GE Global India. 
And finally, in automotive. Revenue increased to a record $127 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially from premium infotainment products. NVIDIA is developing an end-to-end AI computing platform for autonomous driving. This allows carmakers to collect and label data, train their own deep neural networks on NVIDIA GPUs in the datacenter and then process them in the car with DRIVE PX 2. We have also been developing a cloud-to-car HD mapping system with mapping companies all over the world. Two such partnerships were announced this quarter. We're working with Baidu to create a cloud-to-car development platform with HD maps, Level 3 autonomous vehicles and automated parking. We're also partnering with TomTom to develop an AI-based cloud-to-car mapping system that enables real-time in-car localization and mapping. We've developed an integrated, scalable AI platform with capabilities ranging from automated highway driving to fully autonomous driving operation. We are extending the DRIVE PX 2 architecture to scale in performance and power consumption. It will range from DRIVE PX 2 auto cruise with a single SOC for self-driving on highways up to multiple DRIVE PX 2 computers capable of enabling fully autonomous driving. 
We also announced a single-chip AI supercomputer, called Xavier, with over 7 billion transistors. Xavier incorporates our next GPU architecture, a custom CPU design and a new computer vision accelerator. Xavier will deliver performance equivalent to today's full DRIVE PX 2 board and its two Parker SOCs and 2 Pascal GPUs while only consuming a fraction of the energy. 
Finally, Tesla Motors announced last month that all its factory-produced vehicles, the Model S, the Model X and upcoming Model 3 feature a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 platform and will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. This system delivers over 40x the processing power of the previous technology and runs a new neural network for vision, sonar and data processing. Beyond our 4 platforms, our OEM and IP business was $186 million, down 4% year-on-year. 
Now turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP gross margin for Q3 was a record 59%. And non-GAAP gross margin was a record 59.2%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $544 million, including $66 million in stock-based compensation and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $478 million, up 11% from a year earlier. This reflects headcount-related costs for our growth initiatives as well as investments in sales and marketing. We intend to continue to invest in deep learning to capture this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Thus, we would expect the operating expense growth rate to be sustained over the next several quarters. 
GAAP operating income was $639 million; non-GAAP operating income more than doubled to $708 million. Non-GAAP operating margins were over 35% this quarter. 
For fiscal year '18, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We also announced a 22% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share. 
Now turning to the outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin are expected to be 59% and 59.2%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $572 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. And GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. 
With that, operator, I'm going to turn it back to you and see if we can take some questions.",1419,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

A couple of things. First of all, GPU computing is more important than ever. There's so many different types of applications that require GPU computing today. And it's permeating all over the enterprise. There are several applications that we're really driving. One of them is graphics virtualization, application virtualization. A partner with VMware and Citrix, we've essentially taken a very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive application, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. The second is computational sciences. Using our GPU for general-purpose scientific computing -- and scientific computing, as you know, is not just for our scientists; it's -- running equations and using numerics, is a tool that is important to a large number of industries. And the third, one of the most exciting things that we're doing because of deep learning, we've really ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world. These several applications -- graphics application, app virtualization, computational science and data science -- has really, really driven our opportunity in the datacenter. But the thing that made it possible though -- the thing that really make it possible was really the transformation from our company from a graphics processor to a general-purpose processor. And then on top of that, probably the more important part of that is transforming from a chip company to a platform company. What makes application and graphics virtualization possible is a complicated stack of software we call GRID, and you guys have heard me talk about it for several years now. And second, in the area of numerics and computational sciences, CUDA, our rich library of applications and libraries on top of numerics and numerical libraries on top of the CUDA and all the tools that we have invested in, the ecosystem we've worked with, all of the developers all around the world that now know how to use CUDA-developed applications, is -- makes that part of our business possible. And third, our deep learning toolkit, the NVIDIA deep learning GPU toolkit, has made it possible for all frameworks in the world to get GPU acceleration. And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. I mean, it's not 20%, it's not 50%. It's 20x, 50x. And that translates to, most importantly for researchers, the ability to gain access to insight much, much faster. Instead of months, it could be days. It's essentially like having a time machine. And secondarily, for IT managers, it translates to lower energy consumption and, most importantly, it translates to a substantial reduction in datacenter cost. Whereas you have a rack of servers with GPUs, it replaces an entire basketball court of cluster of off-the-shelf servers. And so a pretty big deal.

It has obviously grown very strongly this year. But in the past, it has been lumpy. So for example, when I go back to your fiscal '15, it grew 60% to 70% year-on-year. Last year, it grew about 7%. This year, it's growing over 100%. How should we think about the diversity of customers and the diversity of applications to help us forecast how the business can grow next -- over the next 1 or 2 years?",85,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Especially in the beginning, several years ago, when we started working on GPU computing and bringing this capability into datacenters, we relied on supercomputing centers in the beginning. And then, we relied on remote workstations, datacenter workstations, if you will, virtualized workstations. And then increasingly, we started relying on -- we started seeing demand from hyperscale datacenters as they used our GPUs for deep learning and to develop their networks. And then now, we're starting to see datacenters take advantage of our new GPUs, P40 and P4, to apply, to operate, to use our -- the networks for inferencing in a large scale way. And so I think we're moving, if you will, our datacenter business in multiple trajectories. The first trajectory is the number of applications we can run. Our GPUs now have the ability with one architecture to run all of those applications that I mentioned, from graphics virtualization to scientific computing to AI. Second, we used to be in datacenters, but now we're in datacenters, supercomputing centers as well as hyperscale datacenters. And then third, the number of applications, industries that we affect, is growing. It used to be -- it used to start with supercomputing. Now we have supercomputing, we have automotive, we have oil and gas, we have energy discovery, we have financial services industry, we have, of course, one of the largest industries in the world, consumer, Internet and cloud services. And so we're starting to see applications in all of those different dimensions. And I think the combination of those 3 things: the number of applications, the number of platforms and locations by which we have success and then, of course, the number of industries that we affect. The combination of that should give us more upward directory in a consistent way. But I think the really -- the mega point, though, is really the size of the industries we're now able to engage. In no time in the history of our company have we ever been able to engage industries of this magnitude. And so that's the exciting part, I think, in the final analysis.",371,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

First of all, the reason why I've been on the road for almost 2 months solid is because the request and the demand, if you will, from developers all over the world for better understanding of GPU computing and getting access to our platform and learning about all of the various applications that GPUs can now accelerate, the demand is just really great. And we no longer could do GTC, which is our developer conference, essentially our developer conference. We can no longer do GTC just here in Silicon Valley. And so we, this year, decided to take it on the road and we went to China, went to Taiwan, went to Japan, went to Korea. We had one in Australia and also one in India and Washington, D.C. The -- and Amsterdam, for Europe. And so we pretty much covered the world with our first global developer conference. I would say, probably, the two themes that came out of it is that GPU acceleration, the GPU has really reached a tipping point that it is so available everywhere. It's available in PCs, it's available from every computer company in the world, it's in the cloud, it's in the datacenter, it's in laptops. GPU is no longer a niche component. It is a large scale, mass -- massively available general-purpose computing platform. So I think people realize now the benefits of GPU. And that the incredible speed up or cost reduction, however -- basically the opposite side of a coin that you can get with GPUs. And so GPU computing. Number 2 is AI. Just the incredible enthusiasm around AI. And the reason for that, of course, for all the -- for everybody who knows already about AI, this is what I'm going to say, it's pretty clear, there's a large number of applications, problems, challenges where a numerical approach is not available. A laws of physics-based, equation-based approach is not available. And these problems are very complex. Oftentimes, the information is incomplete. And there's no laws of physics around it. For example, what's the laws of physics of what I look like? What's the laws of physics for recommending tonight's movie? And so those kind -- there's no laws of physics involved. And so the question is how do you solve those kind of incomplete problems? There's no laws of physics equation that you can program into a card that causes the car to drive and drive properly. These are artificial intelligence problems. Search is an artificial intelligence problem. Recommendations are an artificial intelligence problem. And so now that GPU deep learning has ignited this capability and has made it possible for machines to learn from a large amount of data and to determine the features by itself, to compute the features to recognize, GPU deep learning has really ignited this wave of AI revolution. And so I would say, the second thing that is just incredible enthusiasm around the world is learning how to use the GPU deep learning, how to use it to solve AI-type problems and to do so in all of the industries that we know, from health care to transportation, to entertainment, to enterprise, to -- you name it.",540,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

And this is one of those artificial intelligence problems. Because what -- I heard incomplete information but I'm going to infer from some of the important words that I did hear. And I'm going to apply artificial, in this case, human intelligence, to see if I can predict what it is that you were trying to ask. I think your -- your base -- the baseline -- the basis of your question was that Maxwell in the past. In the past, Maxwell GPU, during that generation, we saw an upgrade cycle of about every 2 or 3 years and we had an installed base of some 60 million, 80 million gamers during that time. And several years have now gone by. And the question is, what will be the upgrade cycle for Pascal? And what will it look like? And there are several things that have changed that I think is important to note and that could affect the Pascal upgrade. First of all, the increase in adoption, the number of units has grown and the number of the ASP has grown. And I think the reason for that is severalfold. I think, one, the number of gamers in the world is growing. Everybody that is effectively born in the last 10, 15 years are likely to be a gamer. And so long as they have access to electricity and the Internet, they are very likely a gamer. The quality of games has grown significantly. And one of the factors of production value of games that has been possible is because the PC and the two game consoles, Xbox and PlayStation and, in the future, in the near future, the Nintendo Switch. All of these architectures are common in the sense that they all use modern GPUs. They all use programmable shading and they all have, basically, similar features. They have very different design points, they have different capabilities but they have very similar architectural features. As a result of that, game developers can target a much larger installed base with one common code base. And as a result, they can increase the production quality, the production value of the games. The second -- and one of the things that you might have noticed that recently, PlayStation and Xbox both announced 4K versions of basically the Pro versions of their game console. That's really exciting for the game industry. It's really exciting for us because what's going to happen is the production value of games will amp up. And as a result, it would increase the adoption of higher-end GPUs. And I think that that's a very important positive. That's part of the second one. The first one being the number of gamers is growing. Second is game production value continues to grow. And then the third is gaming is no longer just about gaming. Gaming is part sports -- part gaming, part sports and part social. There's a lot of people -- there are a lot of people who play games just so they can hang out with their other friends who are playing games. And so it's a social phenomenon. And then, of course, because games are -- the quality of games, the complexity of games in some, such as League of Legends, such as StarCraft, the real-time simulation, the real-time strategy component of it, the agility, the hand-and-eye coordination part of it, the incredible teamwork part of it is so great that it has become sport. And because there's so many people in gaming, because there's -- it's a fun thing to do and it's hard to do, so it's hard to master and the size of the industry is large, it's become a real sporting event. And one of the things that I'll predict is that one of these days, I believe that gaming would likely be the world's largest sport industry. And the reason for that is because it's the largest industry. There are more people who play games and now enjoy games and watch other people play games than there are people who play football, for example. And so I think it stands to reason that eSports will be the largest sporting industry in the world and that's just a matter of time before it happens. And so I think all of these factors have been driving both the increase in the size of the market for us as well as the ASP of the GPUs for us.",756,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

You mentioned some accelerating demand in the manufacturing and automotive verticals. I'm just kind of wondering if you have any thoughts on what inning you're currently in, in terms of seeing a ramp-up, strong ramp-up towards like a full run rate for those areas? And especially for the broader corporate enterprise and market vertical also? And as a quick follow-up, on the gaming side, was wondering if you have any thoughts on some of the -- whether or not there's still a big gap between the ramp-up of Pascal supply and the pent-up demand for these new products?",112,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So I would say that we're probably in the first at bat of the first inning of GRID. And the reason for that -- the reason for that is this, I mean, we prepared ourselves. We went to spring training camp. We came up through the -- they call it the Farm League or something like that, I'm not really a baseball player but I heard some people talk about it. And so I think we're probably at the first at bat, the first inning. The thing that -- the reason why I'm excited about it is because I believe in the future, applications are virtualized in the datacenter or in the cloud. On first principles, I believe that these applications will be virtualized and then you'll be able to enjoy these applications irrespective of whether you're using a PC, a Chrome notebook, a Mac or a Linux workstation. It simply won't matter. And yet on the second -- on the other hand, I believe that in the future, applications will become increasingly GPU accelerated. And so how do you put something in the cloud that has no GPUs? And how do you GPU accelerate these applications that are increasingly GPU accelerated? And so the answer is of course putting GPUs in the cloud and putting GPUs in datacenter, and that's what GRID is all about. It's about virtualization, it's about putting GPUs in large-scale datacenters and being able to virtualize the applications so that we can enjoy them on any computer, on any device and putting computing closer to the data. And so I think we're just in the beginning of that and that could explain why GRID is finally, after a long, long period of time of building the ecosystem, building the infrastructure, developing all the software, getting the quality of service to be just really exquisite, working with the ecosystem partners, it's really taken off and I could surely expect to see it continue to grow at the rate that we're seeing for some time. In terms of Pascal, we are still ramping. I mean, production is fully ramped in the sense that all of our products are fully qualified. They're on the market. They have been certified and qualified with OEMs. However, the demand is still fairly high. And so we're going to continue to work hard and our manufacturing partner, TSMC, is doing a great job for us. The yields are fantastic for '16. FinFET, and they're just doing a fantastic job supporting us in, and so we're just going to keep running at it.",431,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

I'll start backwards and answer the FPGA question first. FPGA is good at a lot of things. And if you -- anything that you can do in an FPGA, if the market opportunity is large, you can always -- it's always better to develop an ASIC. And FPGA is what you use when the volume is not large. FPGA is what you use when you're not certain about the functionality you want to put into something. FPGA is largely useful when the volume is not large. Because you could build an ASIC, you could build a full-custom chip that obviously can deliver more performance -- not 20% more performance but 10x better performance and better energy efficiency than you could using FPGAs. And so I think that's a well-known fact. Our strategy is very different than any of that. Our strategy is really about building a computing platform. Our GPU is not a specific function thing anymore. It's a general-purpose parallel processor. It can do molecular dynamics. It could do full dynamics. It could do partial differential equations. It could do linear algebra. It could do artificial intelligence. It could be used for seismic analysis. It could be used for computer graphics, even computer graphics. And so our GPU is incredibly flexible. And it's really designed for -- it's designed specifically for parallel throughput computing. And by combining it with the CPU, we've created a computing platform that is both good at sequential information, sequential instruction processing as well as very high throughput data processing. And so we've created a computing architecture that's good at both of those things. The reason why we believe that's important is because several things. We want to build a computing platform that is useful to a large industry. You could use it for AI, you could use it for search, you could use it for video transcoding, you could use it for energy discovery. You could use it for health, you could use it for finance, you could use it for robotics, you could use it for all these different things. So on the first principles, we're trying to build a computing platform. It's a computing architecture and not a dedicated application thingy. And most of the customers that we're calling on, most of the markets that we are addressing and the areas that we've highlighted are all computer users. They need to create -- they need to use and deploy a computing platform. I had the benefit of being able to rapidly improve their AI networks, AI is still in the early days. I mean, it's the early days of early days. And so GPU deep learning is going through innovations at a very fast clip. Our GPU allows people to learn, develop new networks and deploy new networks as quickly as possible. And so I think the way to think about it is think of our GPU as computing platform. In terms of the market opportunity. The way I would look at it is this. The way I would look at it is there are something along the lines of 5 million to 10 million hyperscale datacenter nodes. And I think, and you guys have heard me say this before, I think that training is a new set of HPC clusters that have been added into these datacenters. And then the next thing that's going to happen is that you're going to see GPUs being added to a lot of these 5 million to 10 million nodes, so that you could accelerate the -- every single query that will likely come into the datacenter will be an AI query in the future. And so I think GPUs have an opportunity to see a fairly large hyperscale installed base. But beyond that, there's the enterprise market. A still -- although a lot of computing is done in the cloud, a great deal of computing, especially the type of computing that we're talking about here that requires a lot of data. We're a data throughput machine, the type of computers that we're talking about tends to be one that would be in enterprise. And I believe a lot of the enterprise market is going to go towards AI, and the type of things that we're looking for in the future is to simplify our business processes using AI, to find business intelligence or insight using AI, to optimize our supply chain using AI, to optimize our forecasting using AI, to optimize the way that we find and surprise and delight customers, digital customers or customers in digital using AI. And so all of these parts of the business operations of large companies, I think AI can really, really enhance. And then the third -- so hyperscale, enterprise, enterprise computing and then the third is something very, very new, it's called IoT. IoT, we're going to have 1 trillion things connected to the Internet over time and they're going to be measuring things from vibration, to sound, to images, to temperature, to air pressure, to -- you name it, okay? And so these things are going to be all over the world and we're going to measure and we're going to be constantly measuring and monitoring their activity. And using the only thing that we can imagine that can help to add value to that and find insight from that is really AI using deep learning. We could be, we could have these new types of computers and they will likely be on-premise or near the location of the cluster of things that you have and monitor all of these devices and keep -- prevent them from failing or adding intelligence to it, so that they add more value to what it is that people have to do, okay. So I think the size of the marketplace that we're addressing is really larger than any time in our history. And probably the easiest way to think about it is we're now a computing platform company. We're simply a computing platform company and our focus is GPU computing. And one of the major applications is AI.",1021,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Partly because I'm just not sure. But I think the dynamics are that self-driving cars is probably the most -- single most disruptive event, the most disruptive dynamic that's happening in the automotive industry. It's almost impossible for me to imagine that in 5 years' time, a reasonably capable car will not have autonomous capability at some level and a very significant level at that. And I think what Tesla has done, by launching and having on the road in the very near future here, full autonomous driving capability using AI. That has sent a shock wave through the automotive industry. It's basically 5 years ahead. Anybody who's talking about 2021, that's just a non-starter anymore. And I think that that's probably the most significant bit in the automotive industry. I just don't -- anybody who was talking about autonomous capabilities in 2020 and 2021 is, at the moment, reevaluating in a very significant way. And so I think that, of course, will change how our business profile ultimately look. It depends on those factors. Our autonomous vehicle strategy is relatively clear. But let me explain it anyways. Number one, we believe that autonomous vehicles is not a detection problem, it's an AI computing problem. That it's not just about detecting objects. It's about perception of the environment around you. It's about reasoning -- reasoning about what to do, what is happening and what to do. And to take action on -- based on that reasoning and to be continuously learning. And so I think that AI computing requires a fair amount of computation and anybody who thought that it would take only 1 or 2 watts, basically the amount of energy of a -- well, I'm not even -- 1/3 of the energy of a cell phone, I think it's just -- it's unfortunate and it's not going to happen anytime soon. And so I think people now recognize that AI computing is a very software-rich problem and it is a supremely exciting AI problem. And that deep learning in GPUs could add a lot of value. And it's going to happen in 2017, it's not going to happen in 2021, and so I think number one. Number two, our strategy is to apply -- to deploy a one architecture platform that is open, that car companies could work on to leverage our software stack and create their network, their artificial intelligence network. And that would address everything from highway cruising, excellent highway cruising, to all the way to full autonomous, to trucks, to shuttles. And using one computing architecture, we could apply it for radar-based systems or radar plus cameras, radar plus cameras plus LiDARs. We can use it for all kinds of sensor fusion environment. So I think the -- our strategy I think is really resonating well with the industry as people now realize that we need the computation capability 5 years earlier. That we -- that it's not a detection problem, but it's an AI computing problem and that software is really intensive. But these 3 observations, I think, has put us in a really good position.",535,8.0,8.0,0.9444444444444444,0.8

I guess our architecture for DRIVE PX, Mitch, is scalable. And so you could start from 1 Parker SOC and that allows you to have surround camera, it allows you to use AI for highway cruising. And if you would like to have even more cameras so that your functionality could be used more frequently in more conditions, you could always add more processors. And so we go from 1 to 4 processors. And if it's a fully autonomous driverless car, a driverless taxi, for example, you might need more than even 4 of our processors. You might need 8 processors. You might need 12 processors. And the reason for that is because you need to reduce the circumstance by which autopilot doesn't work -- doesn't turn on, excuse me, doesn't engage. And so -- and because you don't have a driver in the car at all. And so I think that depending on the application that you have, we'll have a different configuration and it's scalable. And it ranges from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. And so I think it just depends on what configuration people are trying to deploy. Now for a few thousand dollars, the productivity of that vehicle is incredible, as you can simply do the math. It's much more available. The cost of operations is reduced and a few thousand dollars is surely almost nothing in the context of that use case.",244,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Can you just help us understand why the long designing cycle times for these accelerators?

And it's exactly the reason why having started almost 5 years ago in working with all of these large-scale datacenters is what it takes. And the reason for that is because several things have to happen. Applications has to be developed. Their hyperscale -- and which is their enterprise, their datacenter level software -- has to accommodate this new computing platform. The neural networks have to be developed and trained and ready for deployment. The GPUs have to be tested against every single datacenter and every single server configuration that they have and it takes that type of time to deploy at the scales that we're talking about. And so I think that's number one. The good news is that between Kepler and Maxwell and Pascal, the architecture is identical. Even though the underlying architecture has been improved dramatically and the performance increases dramatically, the software layer is the same. And so that -- it has -- the adoption rate of our future generation is going to be much, much faster and you'll see that.

The first thing is that it's not a detection problem, it's an AI computing problem. And a computer has processors and the architecture is coherent and you can program it, you could write software, you could compile to it. It's an AI computing problem. And our GPU computing architecture, it has the benefit of 10 years of refinement. In fact, this year is the 10 year anniversary of our first GPGPU, our first CUDA GPU called G80, and we've been working on this for 10 years. And so the number one is autonomous driving, autonomous vehicles, it's an AI computing problem, it's not a detection problem. Second, car companies realize that they need to deliver ultimately a service; that the service is a network of cars by which they continuously improve. It's like phones. It's like set-top boxes. You have to maintain and serve that customer because they're interested in the service of autonomous driving, it's not a functionality. Autonomous driving has always been improved with better maps and better driving behavior and better perception capability and better AI. And so the software component of it, the software component of it and the ability for car companies to own their own software once they develop it on our platform is a real positive and real positive to the point where it's enabling or it's essential for the future of the driving fleets. And then the third -- to be able to continue to OTA on -- and the third is simply the performance and energy level. I don't believe it's actually possible at this moment in time to deliver an AI computing platform at the performance level that is required to do autonomous driving at an energy efficiency level that is possible in a car and to put all the functionality together in a reasonable way. I believe DRIVE PX 2 is the only viable solution on the planet today. And so I -- because Tesla had a great intention to deliver this level of capability to the world 5 years ahead of anybody else, we were a great partner for them. Okay, so those are probably the 3 reasons.",373,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

One of the things that I wonder, as maybe AI and deep learning acceleration sort of standardized on your platform. What are you seeing and hearing in the Valley about startup activity and folks that are trying to innovate around the platform that you're bringing up, both complementary to what you're doing and potentially, really long-term competitive to what you're doing. I'd just love to hear your perspectives on that.",102,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

We see just a large number of AI startups around the world. There is a very large number here in the United States, of course. There's quite a significant number in China. There's a very large number in Europe. There is a large number in Canada. It's pretty much a global event. I mean, the number of software companies that have now jumped onto using GPU deep learning and taking advantage of the computing platform that we've taken almost 7 years to build and it is really quite amazing. We were tracking about 1,500. We have a program called Inception. And Inception is our start-up support program, if you will. They can get access to our early technology. They can get access to our expertise, our computing platform. And all that we've learned about deep learning, we can share with many of the start-ups. As they're trying to use deep learning in industries from cyber security to genomics, to consumer applications, computational finance, to IoT, robotics, self-driving cars. The number of start-ups out there is really quite amazing. And so we -- our deep learning platform is a really unique advantage for them. Because it's available in a PC. So you can -- almost anybody, with even a few -- a couple of hundred dollars of spending money can get a start-up going with an NVIDIA GPU that can do deep learning. It's available from system builders and server OEMs all over the world. HP, Dell, Cisco, IBM. System builders, small system builders, local system builders all over the world. And very importantly, it's available in cloud datacenters all over the world. So the Amazon AWS, Microsoft's Azure cloud has a really fantastic implementation, ready to scale out. You've got the IBM cloud, you've got Alibaba cloud. And so if you have a few dollars an hour for computing, you can pretty much get a company started and use the NVIDIA platform in all of these different places. And so it's an incredibly productive platform because of its performance. It works with every framework in the world. It's available basically everywhere. And so as a result of that, we've given artificial intelligence start-ups anywhere on the planet the ability to jump on and create something. And so our -- the availability, if you will, the marketization of deep learning, NVIDIA's GPU deep learning, is really quite enabling for start-ups.",405,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Our channel has been pretty stable for some time. And we have a large network. I appreciate the question. It's one of our great strengths, if you will. We cultivated over 2 decades a network of partners who take the GeForce platform out to the world. And you could access our GPUs. You can access GeForce and be part of the GeForce PC gaming platform from, literally, anywhere on the planet. And so that's a real advantage and we're really proud of it. I guess you could also say that Nintendo contributed a fair amount to that growth. And over the next -- as you know, the Nintendo architecture -- and the company tends to stick with an architecture for a very long time. And so we've worked with them now for almost 2 years, several hundred engineering years have gone into the development of this incredible game console. I really believe when everybody sees it and enjoy it, they're going to be amazed by it, and it's really nothing like they've ever played with before. And, of course, the brand, the franchise and their game content is incredible. And so I think this is a relationship that will likely last 2 decades, and I'm super excited about it.",215,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I would say -- I will leave you with several thoughts; that first, we are seeing growth across all of our platforms, from gaming to Pro Graphics to cars to datacenters. The transformation of our company from a chip company to a computing platform company is really gaining traction. And you can see that -- you could see that the results of our work has resulted in things like GameWorks and GFE and DriveWorks, all of the AI that goes on top of that, our graphics virtualization, remoting platform called GRID to the NVIDIA GPU deep learning toolkit, are just really, really examples of how we've transformed the company from a chip to a computing platform company. 
In no time in the history of our company have we enjoyed and addressed an exciting large market as we have today, whether its artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, the gaming market as it continues to grow and evolve and virtual reality. And of course, we all now know very well that GPU deep learning has ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world and our strategy and the thing that we've been working on for the last 7 years is building an end-to-end AI computing platform, an end-to-end AI computing platform, starting from GPUs that we have optimized and evolved and enhanced for deep learning to system architectures to algorithms for deep learning to tools necessary for developers to frameworks and the work that we do with all of the framework developers and AI researchers around the world to servers to cloud datacenters to ecosystems and working with ISVs and start-ups and all the way to evangelizing and teaching people how to use deep learning to revolutionize the software that they build and we call that the Deep Learning Institute, the NVIDIA DLI.
