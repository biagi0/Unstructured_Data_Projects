We had an excellent quarter with revenue up 53% year-on-year to $7.6 billion. We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization. Full year revenue was a record $26.9 billion, up 61%, compounding the prior year's growth of 53%. 
Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.4 billion rose 6% sequentially and was up 37% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 61%. Gaming has become the top entertainment medium that continues to show strong momentum. Just last month, Steam hit a record 28 million concurrent users, up 50% in 2 years. 
Record desktop revenue in the quarter was led by our growth in our GeForce RTX 30 Series products with continued strength in the high end. At CES, we announced the RTX 3050 GPU, which hit retail in late January, bringing NVIDIA RTX and AI technologies to more mainstream audiences. 
Laptop gaming revenue also set a record, driven by the ramp of the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti GPUs, which were also announced at CES. These leverage our fourth-generation Max-Q technology to enable quiet sim and light gaming laptops. 
All in, we announced over 160 new laptop designs for NVIDIA Ampere architecture RTX 30 Series GPUs. These include a number of studio systems targeting the tens of millions of creators, driving the future of design, innovation and virtual world. In addition to supporting the new RTX 30 Series GPUs, Studio laptops future support for NVIDIA software like Omniverse, [indiscernible] and Broadcast. 
Availability of our gaming products in the channel remains low. NVIDIA RTX ecosystem continues to expand with over 30 new RTX games and applications added this quarter, including blockbuster hits like Battlefield 2042, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Call of Duty: Vanguard and God of War. In addition, several new titles support NVIDIA Reflex for low latency gameplay. 
Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining where we have limited visibility into how much of this impacts our overall GPU demand. Nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are light [ catch ] rate to help direct GeForce supply to gamers. Cryptomining processor revenue was $24 million, which is included in OEM and other. 
We continue to expand the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming ecosystem with new hit titles, including EA's Battlefield 4 and Battlefield V. At CES, we announced a partnership with Samsung to integrate GeForce NOW in its smart TVs starting in Q2 of this year. This follows last month's beta release of the GeForce NOW app for LG smart TVs. In addition, we teamed up with AT&T to bring GeForce NOW to 5G mobile devices in the U.S. We also added our first GFN data center in Canada. 
Moving to Pro Visualization. Q4 revenue was $643 million was up 11% sequentially and up 109% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $2.1 billion was up 100%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a shift to higher-value workstation and the continued ramp of our NVIDIA Ampere architecture. 
We believe strong demand is fueled by continued build-outs for hybrid work environment as well as growth in key workloads, including 3D design, AI and rendering. For example, Sony Pictures ImageWorks is using NVIDIA RTX to accelerate ray tracing for rendering-related applications. Volkswagen is using NVIDIA RTX for AI to assist in predictive maintenance of their vehicles. And Duke Energy is using NVIDIA RTX for AI and VR to map, view and maintain energy facilities. 
NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise software entered general availability. And while it's still in early days, customer feedback so far has been very positive, with multiple significant enterprise licensees already signed. In addition to software licenses, Omniverse also drives computing opportunity for NVIDIA RTX in laptops, workstations and on-prem servers and the cloud. Omniverse can be used by individuals for free and by enterprise teams via software subscriptions. 
At CES, we made the free version of Omniverse for individuals' general availability. Omniverse allows creators with RTX GPUs to connect leading 3D design applications to a single theme and supercharge their work with AI and physics. We also announced early access to Omniverse Cloud, which adds one-click capability to collaborate with other artists, whether across the room or across the globe. 
For digital twin applications, we announced the Isaac Autonomous Mobile Robot platform using Omniverse and securely orchestrated and cloud delivered with fleet commands the platform optimizes operational efficiency and accelerates deployment from logistics robots. It consists of several NVIDIA AI technologies and SDKs, including date map for high-precision mapping, metropolis or situational awareness and reop for real-time route optimization. 
Moving to automotive. Q4 revenue was $125 million, declined 7% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago quarter. Fiscal year revenue of $566 million was up 6%. We have just started shipments of our Orin-based product platform and expect to return to sequential revenue growth in Q1 with more meaningful inflection in the second half of the fiscal year and momentum building into calendar 2023 and beyond.
I will now hand it over to Jensen to provide more color on this morning's automotive news.",855,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Earlier today, we announced a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly develop and deliver fleets of software-defined cars. Starting in 2025, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will have next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled software and services built on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. DRIVE Orin will be the AI computer brain running our DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software, and the DRIVE Hyperion sensor network will be the central nervous system. 
This new vehicle architecture will enable a wide spectrum of active safety, automated driving and parking systems. Inside the vehicle, the system will deliver AI features, including driver and occupant monitoring and advanced visualization of the vehicle's surroundings. 
We are very much looking forward to partnering with Thierry BollorÃ©, JLR's CEO, and his team to reinvent the future of luxury cars. Our full stack end-to-end approach is a new business model that offers downloadable AV and AI services to the fleet of JLR vehicles with a shared software revenue stream for both companies over the life of the fleet. 
This partnership follows the template of our announcement with Mercedes-Benz. Our shared software revenue opportunity with both OEMs will scale with the size of their NVIDIA-powered fleet, which, combined, can exceed 10 million cars over a decade.

Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $3.3 billion grew 11% sequentially and 71% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $10.6 billion was up 58%. Data center growth in the quarter was once again led by our compute products on strong demand for NVIDIA AI. Hyperscale and cloud demand was outstanding, with revenue more than doubling year-on-year. Vertical industries also posted strong double-digit year-on-year growth led by consumer Internet companies. 
The flagship NVIDIA A100 GPU continue to drive strong growth. Inference-focused revenue more than tripled year-on-year. Accelerating inference growth has been enabled by widespread adoption of our Triton Inference Server software, which helps customers deliver fast and scalable AI in production. Data center compute demand was driven by continued deployment of our Ampere architecture-based products for fast-growing AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep learning recommendation systems as well as cloud computing. 
For example, Block Inc., a global leader in payment, uses conversational AI in its Square Assistant to schedule appointments with customers. These AI models are trained on NVIDIA GPUs and AWS and perform inference 10x faster on the AWS GP service and on our CPUs. Social media company, Snap, used NVIDIA GPUs and Merlin deep recommender software to improve inference cost efficiency by 50% and decrease latency to 2x. 
For the third row -- year in a row, industry benchmarks show that NVIDIA AI continues to lead the industry in performance. Along with partners like Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA set records in the latest MLPerf benchmarks for AI training across 8 popular AI workloads, including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and object detection. NVIDIA AI was the only platform to make submissions across all benchmarks and use cases, demonstrating versatility as well as high performance. 
The numbers show performance gains on our A100 GPUs of over 5x in just 18 months, thanks to continuous innovations across the full stack in AI algorithms, optimization tools and system software. Over the past 3 years, they show performance gains of over 20x powered by advances we have made across our full stack offering GPUs, networks, systems and software. 
The leading performance of NVIDIA AI is sought after by some of the world's most technically advanced companies. Meta Platforms unveiled its new AI supercomputer research, SuperCluster, with over 6,000 A100 GPUs moved to an NVIDIA platform InfiniBand network. Meta's earliest benchmarks showed its system can train large natural language processing models 3x faster and run computer vision jobs 20x faster than the prior system. 
In a second phase later this year, the system will expand to 16,000 GPUs that Meta believes will deliver 5 exaFLOPS of mixed precision AI performance. In addition to performance at scale, Meta cited extreme reliability, security, privacy and flexibility to handle a wide range of AI models as its key criteria for the system. 
We continue to broaden the reach and ease with adoption of NVIDIA AI into vertical industries. Our ecosystem of NVIDIA-certified systems expanded with Cisco and Hitachi [indiscernible], which joined Dell, HewlettPackard Enterprise, Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro, among other several manufacturers. We released version 1.1 of our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, allowing enterprises to run accelerated AI workloads on VMware vSphere on mainstream IT infrastructure as well. And we expanded the number of system integrators qualified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise. 
Forrester Research, in its evaluation of Enterprise AI infrastructure providers, recognized NVIDIA in the top category of leaders. An example of a partner that's helping to expand our reach into enterprise IT is Deloitte, a leading global consulting firm, which has built its center for AI computing on NVIDIA DGX SuperPODs. At CES, we extended our collaboration to AV development, leveraging our own robust AI infrastructure and Deloitte's team of 5,500 system integration developers and 2,000 data scientists to architect solutions for truly intelligent transportation. 
Our networking products posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, driven by exceptional demand across use cases ranging from core computing, supercomputing and enterprise to storage. Internet adopters led growth driven by adoption of our next-generation products and higher-speed deployments. While revenue was gated by supply, we anticipate improving capacity in coming quarters, which should allow us to serve with significant customer demands we are seeing. 
Across the board, we are excited about the traction we are seeing with our new software business models, including NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. We are still early in the software revenue ramp. Our pipelines are building as customers across the industries seek to accelerate their pace of adoption and innovation with NVIDIA.

Last week, we terminated our efforts to purchase Arm. When we entered into the transaction in September 2020, we believe that would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and and help Arm expand into new markets, benefiting all our customers in the entire ecosystem. 
Like any combination of pioneers of important technologies, our proposed acquisition spurred questions from regulators worldwide. We appreciated the regulatory concerns. For over a year, we worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem. We gave it our best shot, but the headwinds were too strong and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal. 
NVIDIA's work in accelerated computing and our overall strategy will continue as before. Our focus is accelerated computing. We are on track to launch our Arm-based Grace CPU, targeting giant AI and HPC workloads in the first half of next year. Our 20-year architectural license to Arm's IP allows us the full breadth and flexibility of options across technologies and markets. We will deliver on our 3-chip strategy across CPUs, GPUs and DPUs. Whether x86 or Arm, we will use the best CPU for the job, and together with partners in the computer industry, offer the world's best computing platform to tackle the impactful challenges of our time.

We're going to turn to our P&L and our outlook. For the discussion of the rest of the P&L, please refer to the CFO commentary published earlier today on our Investor Relation website. 
Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect sequential growth to be driven primarily by Data Center. Gaming will also contribute to growth. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $3.55 billion, including the Arm write-off of $1.36 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.6 billion. For this fiscal year, we expect to grow non-GAAP operating expenses at a similar percent as in fiscal 2022. GAAP and non-GAAP other operating -- other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 11% and 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. 
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in person on March 7. We will also be hosting a virtual Investor Day on March 22, alongside the GPU Technology Conference. This will follow Jensen's opening keynote, which we invite you to tune into.

We have several growth drivers in data centers. There's hyperscale, public cloud, enterprise core and enterprise edge. We're seeing growth across the entire spectrum. There are several different use cases that are particularly exciting, large language models -- language -- understanding models triggered by the invention of transformers, which is probably one of the most important AI models that's been invented in some time; and conversational AI used for customer service, chat bots, a whole bunch of customer service applications. It can be web-based. It could be point-of-sale-based. It could be cloud-based. 
Recommender systems, deep learning-based recommender systems are making groundbreaking improvements.

As we discussed last quarter and discussed today, we still have some supply constraints across some of our businesses. Networking in the Data Center business has been supply constrained. We're improving every single day. And we do expect to improve supply each quarter as we enter into fiscal year '23 here. So that is probably the key area within our Data Center, but from time to time, there can be other types of focus on Data Center. 
So I'll turn the rest of the question to Jensen in terms of how -- about the rest of the year as well.",112,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

We are supply constrained. Our demand is greater than our supply. As you know, our Data Center product line consists of GPUs, mix, BlueField DPUs, Quantum and spectrum switches, HGX, if you will, system component, meaning that the entire motherboard or the entire GPU board is delivered in combination because it's so complicated. And so we have products that span a broad reach of use cases for data centers from training of AI models to inferencing at very large scale, to universal GPUs for public cloud, industry standard servers, commodity servers for enterprise use and supercomputing systems that use InfiniBand and Quantum switches. And so the application space is quite broad. We saw demand constrained pretty much across the entire range. 
Our operations team did a fantastic job this year, both in executing in all of these complicated products, but also in expanding our supply base. We expect supply to improve each and every quarter going forward. And this quarter, this coming quarter, the Q1 -- the April quarter is based on guidance that Colette just made, is consistent with an increasing supply base. We expect to still be demand constrained, but our supply base is going to increase this quarter, this next quarter and pretty substantially in the second half.",217,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

We have multiple-arm projects ongoing in the company from connected -- from devices to robotics processors such as the new Orin that's going into autonomous vehicles and robotic systems and industrial automation, robotics and such. Orin is doing incredibly well. It started production. And as we mentioned earlier, it's going to drive an inflection point starting in Q2, but accelerating through Q3 and the several years after as we ramp into all of the electric cars and all of the robotic applications and robotaxis and such. 
We also have Arm projects with the CPU that you mentioned, Grace. We have Grace and we surely have the follow-ons to Grace, and you could expect us to do a lot of CPU developments around the Arm architecture. 
One of the things that's really developed nicely over the last couple of years is the success that Arm has seen in hyperscalers and data centers. And it's really accelerated and motivated them to accelerate the development of higher-end CPUs. And so you're going to see a lot of exciting CPUs coming from us and Grace is just the first example. You're going to see a whole bunch of them beyond that. 
But our strategy is accelerated computing. That's ultimately what we do for a living. We, as you know, love it where there's any CPUs. If it's an x86 from any vendor, so long as we have a CPU, we could connect NVIDIA's platform to it and accelerate it for artificial intelligence or computer graphics, robotics and such. And so we love to see the expansion of CPU footprints, and we're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics and autonomous vehicles and cloud computing and supercomputing and in all these different applications.

And I think it's still kind of a little bit of a black box for a lot of investors. And I know, Jensen, that you've talked about software as a medium to basically open up new markets. But I'm wondering maybe if you can sort of quantify how big the software licensing revenue is today and maybe when you might start to break it out like you did data center, which really got the stock moving in a huge, huge way.",91,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

NVIDIA is a software-driven business. Accelerated computing is a software-driven business. It starts from recognizing what domain of applications we want to accelerate and can accelerate and then building an entire stack from the processor to the system to the system software, the acceleration engines and potentially even the applications itself, like the software that we were mentioning earlier, NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse. These are applications that sit on top of system software and are really valuable to the marketplace. 
The way to think about our software licensing -- so we've always been a software-driven business, but for the very first time, we have packaged licensable software on -- available to customers. The way that we license software for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is per node of server. There's some 20 million, 25 million servers that are installed in the world today in enterprises, not including clouds. We believe that every single server in the future will be running AI software. And we would like to offer an engine that enables enterprises to be able to use the most advanced, the most trusted, the most utilized AI engine in the world. And so that is essentially the target market, if you will, for NVIDIA AI. 
The NVIDIA Omniverse is targeting -- is designed for creators contributing content to a virtual world and connect it to robots that are contributing to content in a virtual world. And so it's based on connections. There are 40 million designers and creators around the world. There are going to be hundreds of millions of robots. Every single car will essentially be a robot someday. And those are connections that will be connected into a digital twin system like Omniverse. And those are -- so the Omniverse business model is per connection per year. 
And in the case of NVIDIA DRIVE, we share the economics of the software that we deliver. If it's AB software or parking software or cabin-based AI software, whatever the licensing is or whatever the service, if it's an upfront license, we share the economics of that. If it's a monthly service subscription, we share the economics of that. But basically, for the cars that we are part of, that we're developing the end-to-end service, we will get the benefits of the economics of that for the entire life of the fleet of the car. And so you could imagine, with 10 million cars, with modern car lifetimes of 10 to 20 years, the economics and the market, the installed opportunity is quite high. And so our business opportunity is based on those factors. 
But our software business really, really started several years ago with virtual GPUs, but this year was when we really stepped it up and offered for the very first time NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Omniverse and DRIVE. And so I watch the spot. I think this is going to be a very significant business opportunity for us, and we look forward to reporting on it.",500,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I was hoping you would quantify where we are in that adoption curve that you tend to differentiate between the adoption differences between your hyperscale and enterprise customers? 
And then kind of related to that, is there an inorganic element to your growth now that you have over $20 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How are you planning to deploy that to kind of accelerate your growth also?",89,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The applications for AI is unquestionably growing, and it's growing incredibly fast. Whether in enterprises and financial services, it could be fraud detection; in cases of consumer-pointing businesses, customer service, conversational AI where people are calling chat bots, but in the future, every website will have a chat bot. Every phone number will have a chat bot, whether it's a human in the loop or not human in the loop, will have a chat bot. And so customer service will be heavily, heavily supported by artificial intelligence in the future. Almost every point of sales, I think, whether it's a fast food or a quick service, businesses are going to have chat bots and AI-based customer service. Retail checkouts will be supported by AI agents. 
And so all of this is made possible by a couple of breakthroughs. Computer vision, of course, because the agents, the AIs have to make eye contact and recognize your posture and such, recognize speech, understand the context and what is being spoken about and have a reasonable conversation with people so that you could provide good customer service. The ability to have human in the loop is one of the great things about an AI, much, much more so than a recording, which obviously is not intelligent and therefore it's difficult to, if you will, call your manager or call somebody to provide services that it can't. And so the number of different applications that have been enabled by natural language understanding in customer service in just the last couple of years has grown tremendously. 
I think we're -- we remain early, early, early days in our adoption. It's incredible how fast it has grown and how many different applications are now possible with AI. It pretty much says that almost all future software will be written with AI or by AI. And when it's done, it will be an AI. And we see it in all these different industries. And so I'm pretty certain we're in the early innings yet of AI, and this is going to be one of the largest industries of software that we have ever known. 
With respect to capital, we -- as you know, we had just terminated our Arm agreement. We have a regular capital strategy process and we'll go through that and we'll make the best judgment about how to use our capital in helping our growth and sustaining our growth and accelerating our growth. And we'll have all of those sensible conversations during those capital allocation meetings.

Let's see, we -- RTX is an unqualified home run. RTX completely reinvented modern computer graphics. It made -- it brought forward ray tracing about a decade earlier than anybody thought possible. The combination of RTX with artificial intelligence, which enabled this technology we call DLSS, is able to not only do a ton more computation using our Shader processors, but also engage the powerful Tensor 4 processors that we have in our GPUs to generate images, beautiful images. 
RTX is being adopted by just about every game developer on the planet now. It's being adopted by just about every design tool on the planet now. And if not for RTX, Omniverse wouldn't be possible. We wouldn't be able to do physically based path tracing and simulate sensors like radars and LiDARs and ultrasonics and, of course, cameras and simulate these cameras physically and still be able to deliver the type of performance that we deliver. And so RTX was a game changer for the industry. It reset modern computer graphics. And it was an enabler for us to build an entire new platform from [ call ] Omniverse. 
We're about, I think, about 1/3 of the way through upgrading an installed base that is growing. You know that video games is now the world's largest gaming genre. And Steam, over the last 2 years, has grown by 50%. The number of concurrent players on Steam has grown tremendously. Not -- and in just the last couple of years, a brand new game store from Epic came on, and it's already a multi-hundred million dollar business. I think it's close to $1 billion. They're doing incredibly well. I'm so happy to see it. And so the overall gaming market is growing and it's growing quite nicely. 
But the thing that, in addition to resetting computer graphics for our entire installed base, the growing of our installed base because gaming is growing, there are a couple of other growth dynamics that are associated with GeForce and RTX that's really quite brand new. One of them is hybrid work. This is a permanent condition. And we now are seeing across the board people who are designers and creators now have to set up essentially a new workstation or new home workstation design studio so that they could do their work at home. 
In addition, the creative economy, the digital economy, the creative economy is really, really doing fantastically because everything has to be done in 3D now. Print ads are done in 3D. So 2D print is done in 3D. Video is done in 3D. And live video, broadcast video, the millions of influencers now augment their broadcast with rich augmented reality and 3D graphics. And so 3D graphics is now not just for video games and 3D content, it's actually used now for all forms of digital content creation. And so RTX has all of these different drivers working behind it, and we're definitely in the early innings of RTX.",501,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

If not for the work that we did so closely with Mellanox, the scalability of DGX and DGX SuperPOD and the research supercomputer that was just installed at Meta would just not be possible. The concepts of overlapping networking and compute, moving some -- moving computing into the fabric, into the network, the work that we're doing with synchronous and precision timing so that we could create Omniverse computers that obey the laws of physics and space time, these things are just simply not possible. The work that we're doing to bring cloud-native secure multi-tenancy to supercomputing wouldn't have been possible. The number of innovations that are countless. And so I am so thrilled with the combination and so thrilled with the work the Mellanox team are doing. 
We've accelerated road maps as a result of the combination that we could leverage a much larger base of chip design. BlueField's road map has been accelerated probably by about a year. The switch in -- the Quantum switch and the spectrum switch, the SerDes are absolutely world-class, shared between Ethernet and InfiniBand and NVLink, absolutely the best SerDes in the world. And so the list of opportunities or the list of combination benefits is really quite countless. And so I'm super thrilled with that. 
With respect to networking growth, we should be growing. If we weren't supply constrained, we should be growing faster than overall CSP growth. And the reason for that -- the reason for that is twofolds. The first is because the networking leadership position of Mellanox, Mellanox is highly heavyweight in the upper end of networking where the adoption of higher-speed networks tends to move. And so it's sensible that as new data centers are built, the first preference is to install it with higher-speed networking than last-generation networking. And Mellanox's networking technology is unambiguously world-class. 
The second reason is because the areas where the overall NVIDIA is strong has to do with the areas that are growing quite fast, which is related to artificial intelligence or cloud AI and such. And so those different applications are growing faster than the core. And so it would be sensible that we have the opportunity as we expand our supply base to continue to grow faster than CSPs overall.",381,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

Thanks, Matt. The -- there are several bottlenecks and let me just highlight some of them. One of the largest bottlenecks is memory speed. And memory speed, that's the reason why we use the fastest memories in the world, HBM and GDDR, et cetera, et cetera. We are the largest consumers of the fastest memories in the world and not even by -- there's not -- with no close second that I know. And so our consumption of fast memories is important to the work that we do. 
The second is networking performance. It is the reason why we have the fastest networks. It is also the reason why we have the most fastest networks in any system. We will have, for example, 8 InfiniBand at the highest speeds connected right into HGX or DGX server. And so the work that we do in GPU direct memory, RDMA, the work that we do with GPU direct storage, the work that we do with in-network computing and all reductions and moving data around inside the network is absolutely world-class. This is an area that we are just -- I am just incredibly proud. 
All of that is so that we could be less bottlenecked by the CPU. Remember, inside our DGX system is 1 CPU and 8 GPUs. And the fundamental goal is to offload as much as we can and utilize the resources that we have as much as we can. 
This year, we expect a transition in PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 5. We are constrained on Gen 4. We'll be constrained on Gen 5, but we're used to that and that's something that we're very good at. And we'll continue to support Gen 4 well through next year, maybe well through the next couple of years in all of the installed base of Gen 4 systems that are going to be all over the world. And we'll take advantage of Gen 5 as much as we can. But we have all kinds of new technologies and strategies to improve the throughput of systems and avert the bottlenecks that are there.",353,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The tremendous demand for our computing platforms, NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA HPC and NVIDIA AI drove a great quarter, capping a record year. Our work propels advances in AI, digital biology, climate sciences, gaming, creative design to autonomous vehicles and robotics and some of today's most impactful fields. Our open computing platform optimized across the full stack, architecture for data center scale is adopted by customers globally from cloud to core to edge and robotics. I am proud of the NVIDIA operations team as we make substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. And this year, we introduced new software business models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. 
NVIDIA DRIVE is a full stack end-to-end platform that serves the industry with AV chips, data center infrastructure for AI and simulation, mapping and the autonomous driving application service. Our data center infrastructure is used by just about anybody building AVs, robotics, robotaxis, shuttles and trucks. EV companies have selected our Orin chip across the world. And our partnership with Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover has opened up a new software and services business model for millions of cars for the life of the fleet. 
NVIDIA Omniverse is a world simulation engine that connects simulated digital worlds to the physical world. Omniverse is a digital twin, a simulation of the physical world. The system can be a building, a factory, a warehouse, a car, a fleet of cars, a robotic factory orchestrating a fleet of robots building cars that are themselves robotic. 
Today's Internet is 2D and AI is in the cloud. The next phase of Internet will be 3D and AI will be connected to the physical world. We created Omniverse to enable the next wave of AI where AI and robotics touches our world. Omniverse can sound like science fiction, but there are real-world use cases today. Hundreds of companies are evaluating Omniverse.

32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 25, 2022",2022-05-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3761.0,2581030.0,97515543.0,Presenter Speech,Colette Kress,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Simona. We delivered a strong quarter driven by record revenue in both Data Center and Gaming, with strong fundamentals and execution against a challenging macro backdrop. 
Total revenue of $8.3 billion was a record, up 8% sequentially and up 46% year-on-year. Data Center has become our largest market platform, and we see continued strong momentum going forward. 
Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.6 billion rose 6% sequentially and 31% year-on-year, powered by the GeForce RTX 30 Series product cycle. Since launching in the fall of 2020, the RTX 30 Series has been our best Gaming product cycle ever. The gaming industry has grown tremendously, with 100 million new PC gamers added in the past 2 years according to Newzoo. And NVIDIA RTX has set new standard for the industry, with demand from both first-time GPU buyers as well as those upgrading their PCs to experience the 250-plus RTX-optimized games and apps, double from last year. We estimate that almost 1/3 of the GeForce Gaming GPU installed base is now on RTX. 
RTX has brought tremendous energy into the gaming world, and has helped drive a sustained expansion in our higher-end platforms and installed base with significant runway still ahead. Overall, end demand remained solid, though mixed by region, and demand in Americas remain strong. However, we started seeing softness in parts of Europe related to the war in the Ukraine and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns. 
As we expect some ongoing impact as we prepare for a new architectural transition later in the year, we are projecting Gaming revenue to decline sequentially in Q2. Channel inventory has nearly normalized, and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. 
The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision. The reduced pace of increase in Ethereum network hash rate likely reflects lower mining activity on GPUs. We expect a diminishing contribution going forward. 
Laptop Gaming revenue posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth, driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA RTX 30 Series lineup. With this year's spring refresh and ahead of the upcoming back-to-school season, there are now over 180 laptop models featuring RTX 30 Series GPUs and our energy-efficient, thin and light Max-Q technologies, up from 140 at this time last year. 
Driving this growth are not just gamers, but also the fast-growing category of content creators from whom we offer dedicated NVIDIA studio drivers. We've also developed applications and tools to empower artists, from Omniverse for advanced 3D and collaboration to broadcast for live streaming to canvas for painting landscapes with AI. The creator economy is estimated at $100 billion and powered by 80 million individual creators and broadcasters. 
We continued to build out our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. Gamers can now access RTX 3080 class streaming, our new top-tier offering with subscription plans of $19.99 a month. We added over 100 games to the GeForce NOW library, bringing the total to over 1,300 games. And last week, we launched Fortnite on GeForce NOW with touch controls for mobile devices, streaming through the Safari web browser on iOS and the GeForce NOW Android app. 
Moving to Pro Visualization. Q1 revenue was $622 million, was down sequentially 3% and up 67% from a year ago. Demand remains strong as enterprises continued to build out their employee's remote office infrastructure to support hybrid work. Sequential growth in the mobile workstation GPUs was offset by lower desktop revenue. Strong year-on-year growth was supported by the NVIDIA RTX Ampere architecture product cycle. Top use cases include: digital content creation at customers such as Sony Pictures Animation and medical imaging at customers such as Medtronic. 
In just its second quarter of general availability, our Omniverse enterprise software is being adopted by some of the world's largest companies. Amazon is using Omniverse to create digital twins to better optimize warehouse design and flow and to train more intelligent robots. Kroger is using Omniverse to optimize store efficiency with digital twin store simulation. And PepsiCo is using Omniverse digital twins to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the supply chain. 
Omniverse is also expanding our GPU sales pipeline, driving higher-end and multiple GPU configurations. The Omniverse ecosystem continues to rapidly expand with third-party developers in the robotics, industrial automation, 3D design and rendering ecosystems developing connections to Omniverse. 
Moving to Automotive. Q1 revenue of $138 million increased 10% sequentially and declined 10% from the year ago quarter. Our DRIVE O-RAN SoC is now in production and kicks off a major product cycle with auto customers ramping in Q2 and beyond. O-RAN has great traction in the marketplace with over 35 customer wins from automakers, truck makers and robo taxi companies. 
In Q1, BYD, China's largest EV maker, and Lucid, an award winning EV pioneer were the latest to announce that they are building their next-generation fleets on DRIVE O-RAN. Our Automotive design win pipeline now exceeds $11 billion over the next 6 years, up from $8 billion just a year ago. 
Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $3.8 billion grew 15% sequentially and accelerated to 83% growth year-on-year. Revenue from hyperscale and cloud computing customers more than doubled year-on-year, driven by strong demand for both external and internal workloads. Customers remain supply constrained in their infrastructure needs and continue to add capacity as they try to keep pace with demand. 
Revenue from vertical industries grew a strong double-digit percentage from last year. Top verticals driving growth this quarter include: consumer Internet companies, financial services and telecom. Overall, Data Center growth was driven primarily by strong adoption of our A100 GPU for both training and inference with large volume deployments by hyperscale customers and broadening adoption across the vertical industries. Top workloads include: recommender systems, conversational AI, large language models and cloud graphics. 
Networking revenue accelerated on strong broad-based demand for our next-generation 25-, 50- and 100-gig ethernet adapters. Customers are choosing NVIDIA's networking products for their leading performance and robust software functionality. In addition, networking revenue is benefiting from growing demand for DGX SuperPODs and cross-selling opportunities. Customers are increasingly combining our compute and networking products to build what are essentially modern AI factories with data as the raw material input and intelligence as the output. 
Our networking products are still supply constrained, though we expect continued improvement throughout the rest of the year. One of the biggest workloads driving adoption of NVIDIA AI is natural language processing, which has been revolutionized by transformer-based models. Recent industry breakthroughs traced to transformers include: large language models like GPT-3, NVIDIA MegaMolBART for drug discovery and DeepMind AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. 
Transformers allow self-supervised learning without the need for human-labeled data. They enable unprecedented levels of accuracy for tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization and answering questions. To do that, Transformers use enormous training data sets and very large neuro networks well into the hundreds of billions of parameters. To run these giant models without sacrificing low inference times, customers like Microsoft are increasingly deploying NVIDIA AI, including our NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and full software stack. In addition, we are seeing a rising wave of customer innovation using large language models that is driven by increased demand for NVIDIA AI and GPU instances in the cloud. 
At GTC, we announced our next-generation Data Center GPU, the H100 based on the new Hopper architecture. Packed with 80 billion transistors, H100 is the world's largest, most powerful accelerator, offering an order of magnitude leap in performance over the A100. We believe H100 is hitting the market at the perfect time. H100 is ideal for advancing large language models and deep recommender systems, the 2 largest-scale AI workloads today. We are working with leading server makers and hyperscale customers to qualify and ramp H100. [ That ] as well as the new DGX H100 AI supercomputing system will ramp in volume late in the calendar year. 
Building on the H100 product cycle goal, we are on track to launch our first-ever Data Center CPU, Grace, in the first half of 2023. Grace is the ideal CPU for AI factories. This week at Computex, we announced that dozens of server models based on Grace will be brought to market by the first wave of system builders, including ASUS, Foxconn, GIGABYTE, QCT, Supermicro and Wiwynn. These servers will be powered by the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, which features 2 CPUs and the Grace Hopper Superchip, which pairs an NVIDIA Hopper GPU with an NVIDIA Grace CPU in an integrated model. 
We've introduced new reference designs based on Grace for the massive new workloads of next-generation data centers: CGX for cloud graphics and gaming, OVX for digital twins or Omniverse, and HGX for HPC and AI. These server designs are all optimized for NVIDIA's rich accelerated computing software stacks and can be qualified as part of our NVIDIA-certified systems lineup. 
The enabler for the Grace Hopper and Grace Superchips is our ultra energy-efficient, low-latency, high-speed memory coherent interconnect called NVLink, which scales from die-to-die, chip-to-chip and system-to-system. With NVLink, we can configure Grace and Hopper to address a broad range of workloads. 
Future NVIDIA chips, the CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, NICs and SoCs will integrate NVLink just like Grace and Hopper based on our world-class SerDes technology. We're making NVLink open to customers and partners to implement custom chips that connect to NVIDIA's platforms. 
In networking, we're kicking off a major product cycle with the introduction of Spectrum-4, the world's first 400-gigabit per second end-to-end Ethernet networking platform, including the Spectrum-4 switch, ConnectX-7 SmartNIC, BlueField-3 DPU and the DOCA software. Built for AI, NVIDIA's Spectrum-4 arrives as data centers are growing exponentially and demanding extreme performance, advanced security and powerful features to enable high-performance advanced virtualization and simulation at scale. Across our businesses, we are launching multiple new GPU, CPU, DPU and SoC products over the coming quarters, with a ramp in supply to support the customer demand. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 65.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was up 67.1%, up 90 basis points from a year ago and up 10 basis points sequentially. We have been able to offset rising costs and supply chain pressures. We expect to maintain gross margins at current levels in Q2. 
Going forward, as new products ramp and software becomes a larger percent of revenue, we have opportunities to increase gross margins longer term. GAAP operating margin was 22.5%, impacted by a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction. Non-GAAP operating margin was 47.7%. 
We are closely managing our operating expenses to balance the current macro environment with our growth opportunities, and we've been very successful in hiring so far this year and are now slowing to integrate these new employees. This also enables us to focus our budget on taking care of our existing employees as inflation persists. 
We are still on track to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses in the high 20s range this year. we expect sequential increases to level off after Q2 as the first half of the year includes a significant amount of expenses related to the bring-up of multiple new products, which should not recur in the second half. 
During Q1, we repurchased $2 billion of our stock. Our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase an additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. 
Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our outlook assumes an estimated impact of approximately $500 million relating to Russia and China COVID lockdowns. We estimate the impact of lower sell-through in Russia and China to affect our Q2 Gaming sell-in by $400 million. Furthermore, we estimate the absence of sales to Russia to have a $100 million impact on Q2 in Data Center. We expect strong sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive to be more than an offset by the sequential decline in Gaming. 
Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.1% and 67.1%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $2.46 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.75 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP Other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. 
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 12.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. 
In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the BofA Securities Technology Conference in person on June 7, where Jen-Hsun will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 24.

The business has essentially doubled over the last 2 years. And now we've got some crosswinds with crypto falling off, channel potentially clearing ahead of a new product cycle. You talked about macro challenges. But at the same time, only 1/3 of the installed base has RTX and we're moving out from under supply. So we'd love to hear your thoughts from here once we get beyond kind of the challenges around COVID lockdown in the July quarter. How are you thinking about Gaming trends?",104,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The -- you captured a lot of the dynamics well in your question. The underlying dynamics of the Gaming industry is really solid, net of the situation with COVID lockdown in China and Russia. The rest of the market is fairly robust. And we expect the Gaming dynamics to be intact. 
There are several things that are driving the Gaming industry. In the last 2 years alone, 100 million new gamers came into the PC industry. The format has expanded tremendously. And the ways that people are using their PCs to connect with friends, to be an influencer as a platform for themselves, use it for broadcast. So many people are now using their home PCs as their second workstation, if you will, second studio. Because they're also working from home. It is our primary way of communicating these days. The need for GeForce PCs have never been greater. 
And so I think the fundamental dynamics are really good. And so as we look into the second half of the year, we look -- it's hard to predict exactly what -- when COVID and the war in Russia is going to be behind us, but nonetheless, the governing dynamics of the gaming industry is great.",211,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

In this upcoming cycle with H100, there's some I/O upgrades that are happening in servers that I think are going to be a fairly strong driver for you, in addition to what's going on with Hopper and the huge performance leaps that are there. 
I wanted to ask a longer-term question, though, around your move to NVLink with Grace and Hopper and what's going on with your whole portfolio. Do you envision the business continuing to be sort of card-driven attached to third-party servers? Or do you think revenue shifts dramatically or in a small way, over time, to be more sort of vertically integrated all of the chips together on NVLink? And how is the industry sort of responding to that potential move?",140,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8
32307.0,"NVIDIA Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, May 25, 2022",2022-05-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,NVIDIA Corporation,3761.0,2581030.0,97515549.0,Answer,Jen-Hsun Huang,,Executives,8,"Yes, I appreciate the question. The -- let's see, the first point that you made is a very big point. The next generation of servers that are being teed up right now are all Gen 5. The I/O performance is substantially higher than what was available before. And so you're going to see a pretty large refresh as a result of that. Brand-new networking cards from our company and others. Gen 5, of course, drives new platform refresh. And so we're perfectly timed to ramp into the Gen 5 generation with Hopper. 
There are a lot of different system configurations you want to make. If you take a step back and look at the type of systems that are necessary for data processing, scientific computing, machine learning and training, inference done in the cloud for hyperscale nature, done on-prem for enterprise computing, done at the edge. Each one of these workloads and deployment locations, the way that you manage would dictate a different system architecture. 
So there isn't one size that fits all, which is one of the reasons why it's so terrific that we support PCI Express, that we innovate a chip-to-chip interconnect for the very first [ time ], before anybody else did. This is now some 7 years ago. We're in our fourth generation of NVLink that allows us to connect 2 chips next to each other, 2 dies, 2 chips, 2 modules, 2 SXM modules to 2 systems to multiple systems. 
And so our coherent chip-to-chip link, NVLink, has made it possible for us to mix and match chips, dies, packages, systems and all of these different types of configurations. And I think that, over time, you're going to see even more types of configurations. And the reason for that has to do with a couple of very important new type of data centers that are emerging. 
And you're starting to see that now with fairly large installations, infrastructures with NVIDIA HPC and NVIDIA AI. These are really AI factories, where you're processing the data, refining the data and turning that data into intelligence. These AI factories are essentially running one major workload and they're running at 24/7. Deep recommender systems is a good example of that. 
In the future, you're going to see large language models essentially becoming a platform themselves. That would be running 24/7, hosting a whole bunch of applications. And then on the other end, you're seeing data centers at the edge that are going to be robotics or autonomous data centers that are running 24/7. They are going to be running in factories and retail stores and warehouses, logistics warehouses all over the world. So these 2 new type of data centers are just emerging, and they also have different architectures. 
So I think the net of it all is that our ability to support every single workload, because we have a universal accelerator running every single workload from data processing to data analytics to high-performance computing to training to inference, that we can support ARM and x86, that we support PCI Express to multisystem NVlink to multi-chip NVLink to multi-die NVLink. That capability for us is -- makes it possible for us to really be able to serve all of these different segments. 
With respect to vertical integration, I think that's system integration. The better way to make me saying that is that system integration is going to come in all kinds of different ways. We're going to do semi-custom chips, as we've done with many companies in the past, including Nintendo. We'll do semi-custom chiplets as we do with NVLink. NVLink is open to our partners, and they could bring it to any fab and connect it coherently into our chip. We could do multi-module packages. We could do multi-package systems. So there's a lot of different ways to do system integration.",643,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

So Colette, I know you said the $500 million was a $400 million hit to Gaming and a $100 million hit to data. So I'm assuming, that doesn't mean the Gaming is down $400 million. I mean, is Gaming -- do you see Gaming actually down more than the actual Russia and lockdown hit?

Let me start first with what does that mean to gaming, what does that mean to Gaming for Q2. We do expect Gaming to decline into Q2. We still believe our end demand remains very strong. Ampere has just been a great architecture, and there's many areas where we continue to see strength and growth in both our sell-through and probably what we will see added into that channel as well. 
But in total, Q2 Gaming will decline from last quarter from Q1, that it will probably decline in the teens, as we try and work through some of these lockdowns in China, which are holding us up. So overall, the demand for Gaming is still strong. We still expect end demand to grow year-over-year in Q2.",128,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

I wonder if you could talk about what you are seeing sequentially? Are you seeing a sequential inflection in the enterprise? And can you talk about the attach rate of software for enterprise versus data centers? And which software is -- are you seeing the most interest? I know you talked about, is it Omniverse?

Thanks, Mark. We had a record Data Center business this last quarter. We expect to have a record -- another record quarter this quarter, and we're fairly enthusiastic about the second half. AI and data-driven machine learning techniques were developed for writing software and extracting insight from the vast amount of data that companies have is incredibly strategic to all the companies that we know. Because in a funnel analysis, AI is about automation of intelligence, and most companies are about domain-specific intelligence. 
We want to produce intelligence. And there are several techniques now that have been created to make it possible for most companies to apply their data to extract insight and to automate a lot of the predictive things that they have to do and do it quickly. And so I think the trend that you hear other people are experiencing about machine learning, data analytics, data-driven insights, artificial intelligence, however, it's described, is all exactly the same thing. And it's sweeping just about every industry and every company. 
Our networking business is also highly supply constrained. Our demand is really, really high. And it requires a lot of components aside from just our chips. Components and transceivers and connectors and cables. And just -- it's a really -- it's a complicated system, the network, and there are many physical components. And so the supply chain has been problematic. We're doing our best. And our supply has been increasing from Q4 to Q1. We're expecting it to increase in Q2 and increase in Q3 and Q4. And so we're really, really grateful for the support from the components industry around us, and we'll be able to increase that. 
With respect to software, there are 2 -- first of all, there are all kinds of machine learning models: computer vision, speech AI, natural language understanding, all kinds of robotics applications, the most -- probably the largest, the most visible one is self-driving cars, which is essentially a robotic AI. And then recently, this incredible breakthrough from an AI model called Transformers that has led to really, really significant advances in natural language understanding. 
And so there are all these different types of models. There are thousands and thousands of species of AI models and -- in all these different industries. One of my favorite -- I'll just say it very quickly, and I'll answer that question about the software. One of my favorites is using Transformers to understand the language of chemistry or using Transformers and using AI models to understand the language of proteins, amino acids, which is genomics. To apply AI to understand -- to recognize the patterns, to understand the sequence and essentially understand the language of chemistry and biology is a really, really important breakthrough. And all of this excitement around synthetic biology, much of it stands back to the -- some of these inventions. 
But anyhow, all of these different models need an engine to run on. And that engine is called NVIDIA AI. In the case of hyperscalers, they can cobble together a lot of open source, and we provide a lot of our source to them and a lot of our engines to them for them to operate their AI. But for enterprises, they need someone to package it together and be able to support it and refresh it, update it for new architecture, support old architectures in their installed base, et cetera, and all the different use cases that they have. 
And so that engine is called NVIDIA AI. It's almost like a SQL engine, if you will. And except this is an engine for artificial intelligence. There's another engine that we provide and that engine is called Omniverse and it's designed for the next wave of AI, where artificial intelligence has to not just manipulate information like recommender systems and conversational systems and such, but it has to interact with physical systems. 
Whether it's interacting with physics directly, meaning robotics or being able to automate physical systems like heat-recovery steam generators, which is really important today. And so Omniverse is designed to be able to sit at that interface, that intersection between simulation and artificial intelligence, and that's what Omniverse is about. 
Omniverse has now -- let's see some -- we're still early in the deployment of Omniverse for commercial license. It's been a couple of quarters now since we've released Omniverse enterprise. And I think, at this point, we have 10% of the world's top 100 companies that are already customers, licensing customers, substantially more who are evaluating. I think it's been downloaded nearly 200,000 times. It has been tried in some 700 companies. And Colette highlighted some of the companies, you might see some of the companies that are using it in all kinds of interesting applications at GTC. 
And so I fully expect that the NVIDIA AI engine, the Omniverse engine, are going to be very successful for us in the future and contribute greatly to our earnings.",832,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And then, Jen-Hsun, my question is for you. You're still guiding Data Center to a very strong, I think, close to 70% or so year-on-year growth despite all the headwinds. Are you worried at all about all the headlines about the slowdown in the macro economy? Like is there any cyclical impact on Data Center growth that we should keep in mind as we think about the second half of the year?",96,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

Vivek, let me first answer the question that you asked regarding any new products as we look at Q2. As we discussed about it, most of the ramp that we have of our new architectures, we're going to see in the back half of the year. We're going to start to see, for example, Hopper will probably be here in Q3, but starting to ramp closer to the end of the calendar year. So you should think about most of our product launches to be ramping in the second half of the year on that part. 
I'll turn it over for Jen-Hsun for the rest.",106,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Our Data Center demand is strong and remains strong. Hyperscale and cloud computing revenues, as you mentioned, has grown significantly, has doubled year-over-year. And we're seeing really strong adoption of A100. A100 is really quite special and unique in the world of accelerators. And this is one of the really, really great innovations as we extended our GPU from graphics to CUDA to Tensor Core GPUs. It's now a universal accelerator. 
And so you could use it for data processing. For ETL, for example, extract, transform and load. You could use it for database acceleration. Many SQL functions are accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs. We accelerate Rapids, we accelerate -- which is the Python version, Data Center scale version of Pandas, We accelerate Spark 3.0. And so from database queries to data processing to extraction and transform and loading of data before you do training and inference and, whatever, image processing or other algorithmic processing you need to do can be fully accelerated on A100. And so we're seeing great success there. 
At the core and closer to what is happening today, you're seeing several different very important new AI models that are being invested in at very, very large scale and with great urgency. 
You probably have heard about deep recommender systems. This is the economic engine, the information-filtering engine of the Internet. If not for the recommender system, it would be practically impossible for us to enjoy our Internet experience, shopping experience with trillions of things that are changing in the world every day constantly and be able to use your 3-inch phone to even engage the Internet. And so all of that magic is made possible by this incredible thing called a recommender system. 
The second thing is conversational AI. You're seeing chat bots and website customer service, even live customer service being now supported by AI. Conversational AI has an opportunity to enhance the customer service, on the one hand. On the other hand, supplement for a lot of labor shortage. 
And then the third is this groundbreaking piece of work that's related to Transformers that led to natural language understanding breakthrough. But within it is this incredible thing called large language models, which embeds human knowledge because it's been trained in so much data. And we recently announced Megatron 530B. And it was a collaboration we did with Microsoft, the foundation of, I think they call it Turing. And this language model and others like it, like OpenAI's GPT-3 are really transformative, and they take an enormous amount of computation. However, the net result is a pre-trained model that is really quite remarkable. 
Now we're working with thousands of start-ups, large companies that are building, who are using the public cloud. And so it's driving a lot of demand for us in the public cloud. I think we have now 10,000 AI inception startups that are working with us and using NVIDIA AI. Whether it's on-prem or in the cloud, it saves money because the computation time is significantly reduced. The quality of service is a lot better, and they could do greater things. And so that's driving AI in the cloud. 
And so all of these different factors, whether it's just the industrial recognition of the importance of AI, the transformative nature of these new AI models, recommender systems, large language models, conversational AI. The thousands of companies around the world that are using NVIDIA AI in the cloud -- driving public cloud demand, all of these things are driving our Data Center growth. And so we expect to see Data Center demand remain strong.",601,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And that's because most others in semis are sort of citing this China stuff, in particular, as more of a logistics issue, so more of a supply issue. But the language, Colette, you were using in your commentary side of lower sell-through in Gaming and sort of the absence of sales in Russia, to me, that sounds a little more demand, which would make sense in the context of this new freeze on hiring that you have.
So I ask because if it's supply related, then you could argue that it's not perishable and really just timing. but if demand related, that might never come back, and it could be the beginning of falling knife. So I'm wondering if you could sort of walk through that for me.",148,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

Let me try a bit here on the China and Russia, two very different things. The current China lockdowns that we are seeing, interestingly, has implications to both supply and demand. We have seen challenges in terms of the logistics throughout the country, things going in and out of the country. It puts a lot of pressure on just logistics that were already under pressure. 
From a demand perspective, it has also been hit from the Gaming side. You have very large cities that are in full lockdown focusing really on other important things for the citizens there. So it's impacting our demand. We do believe that they will come out of COVID and the demand for our products will come back. We do believe that will occur. The supply, we'll sort it out. It's very difficult to determine how. 
Now in the case of Russia, we're not selling to Russia. That's something that we had announced earlier last quarter. But there were plans and Russia has been a part of our overall company revenue of probably about 2% of our company revenue historically.

For most chip companies, it seems like it's heresy to say demand is a problem, so it's so refreshing to hear that. 
I had a question on the second half, and it relates to both Data Center as well as Gaming. So last couple of times you have talked publicly, you have made comments that your visibility into the Data Center has never been better. So I was wondering, if you just take out the Russia impact, is that still true? All the orders that you have been getting, they're intact. And you did say that business will see a strong momentum. I just want to make sure that statement of confidence you have made stays. 
And then on Gaming, Colette, do we expect second half to be up year-over-year just based on the guide for second quarter? It seems like it could be up sequentially but may not return to year-over-year growth in Q3.",166,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Ambrish, thanks for the question. On first principles, it should be the case that our visibility of Data Centers is vastly better, vastly better than a couple of years ago. And the reason for that is several. One, if you recall a couple 2, 3 years ago, deep learning and AI was starting to accelerate in the most computer science deep companies in the world with CSPs and hyperscalers. And but just about everywhere else, it was still quite nascent. And there was a couple of reasons for that. Obviously, the understanding of the technology is not as pervasive at the time. The type of industrial use cases for artificial intelligence requires labeling of data that's really quite difficult. 
And then now with Transformers, you have unsupervised learning and other techniques, zero-shot learning that allows us to do all kinds of interesting things without having to have human-labeled data. We even have synthetic-generated data with Omniverse that helps customers do data generation without having to label data, which is either too costly or, quite frankly, oftentimes impossible. And so now the knowledge and the technology has evolved to a place that most of the industries could use artificial intelligence at a fairly effective way and in many industries rather transformative. 
And so I think, number one, we went from clouds and hyperscalers to all of industries. Second, we went from training-focused to inference. Most people thought that inference was going to be easy. It turns out the inference is by far the harder. And the reason for that is because there are so many different models and there are so many different use cases and so many quality of service requirements. And you want to run these inference models in a small of a footprint as you can. 
And so when you scale out the number of users that use the service, it's really quite high. So using acceleration and using NVIDIA's platform, we could inference any model from computer vision to speech to chemistry to biology, you name it. And we do it so quickly and so fast that the cost is very low. And so the more acceleration you do, the more money you will save. And that -- I think, that wisdom is absolutely true. 
And so the second dimension is training to inference. The third dimension is that we now have so many different types of configurations of systems that we can go from high-performance computing systems all the way to cloud to on-prem to edge. 
And then the final concept is really this industrial deployment now of AI that's causing us to be able to, in just about every industry, find growth. And so as you know, our cloud and hyperscalers are growing very, very quickly. However, the vertical part, vertical industries, which is the financial services and retail and telco, all of those vertical industries have also grown very, very nicely. 
And so in all of those different dimensions, our visibility should be a lot better. And then starting a couple of years ago, adding the Mellanox portfolio to our company, we're able to provide a lot more solution-oriented, end-to-end platform solutions for companies that don't have the skills and don't have the technical depth to be able to stand up these sophisticated systems. And so our networking business is growing very, very nicely as well.",563,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I just want to maybe just ask this question a little bit more directly. So it's good to see the team being able to drive -- navigate the dynamic supply chain environment, right? You booked strong sequential growth in Data Center in April, here in the July quarter, even with some demand impact from Russia, right? And so as we think about the second half of the year, cloud spending is strong, and it's actually, I think, accelerating. 
You're getting ready to ramp H100 later in the year. Mellanox, I think, is getting more supply as you move through the year. And in general, I think previously, you guys were anticipating sequential supply and revenue growth for the business through this entire year. I understand the uncertainty around Gaming.

It's been qualified in every single company in the world. And so after 2 years, it remains the best universal accelerator on the planet. And it's going to continue to scale out in all these different domains and different markets. 
We're going to layer on top of that a brand-new architecture, Hopper. I'm going to layer on top of that brand-new networking architectures.

So let me start here, and I'll see if Jen-Hsun wants to add more of that. Our purchase obligations as well as our prepaids have 2 major things to keep in mind. One, for the first time ever, we are pre-paying to make sure that we have that supply and those commitments long term. And additionally, on our purchase obligations, many of them are for long-lead-time items that are a must for us to procure to make sure that we have the products coming to market. 
A good percentage of our purchase commitments is for our Data Center business, which you can imagine, are much larger systems, much more complex systems. And those things that we are procuring to make sure we can feed the demand, both in the upcoming quarters and further. 
Areas in terms of where we are still a little bit supply constrained are networking. Our demand is quite strong. We've been improving it each time. But yes, we still have demand -- excuse me, supply concerns with networking still.

We are just starting -- we have just started shipping O-RAN in the first quarter of shipping production O-RAN. O-RAN is a robotics processor. It's designed for a software-defined robotic card or robotic pick and placer or a robotic mover, logistics mover. 
We've been designed into 35 car and trucks and robo taxi companies and more others, if you include logistics movers and last mile delivery systems and farming equipment. And the number of design wins for O-RAN is really quite fantastic. O-RAN is a revolutionary processor. And it's designed as a -- if you will, a Data Center on a chip. And it is the first Data Center on a chip that is robotic, processes sensor information, it's safe, it has the ability to be rather resilient. It has confidential computing. It is designed to be secure, designed to be all those things because these data centers are going to be everywhere. 
And so O-RAN is really a technological marvels in production. We experienced very likely the lowest auto quarter in some time -- for some time. And the reason for that is because over the next 6 years-or-so, we have $11 billion and counting of business that we've secured, estimated. And so I think it's a fairly safe thing to say now that O-RAN and our autonomous vehicle and robotics business is going to be our next multibillion dollar business. It's on its way surely there. 
The robotics and autonomous systems and autonomous machines, whether they move or not move, but AI systems that are at the physical edge is surely going to be the next major computing segment. It is surely going to be the next major Data Center segment. We've been working in this area, as you know, for a decade. We have a fair amount of expertise in this area. And O-RAN is just one example of our work here. 
We have 4 pillars to our strategy for autonomous systems. Starting from the data processing and the AI training part of it to train robotics AIs; second, to simulate robotics AIs, which is Omniverse; third, to [ build ] the memory of the robotics AI otherwise known as mapping; and then finally, the actual robotics application and the robotics processor in the system. And that's where O-RAN goes. 
But O-RAN is just 1 of our 4 pillars of our robotics strategy and the next wave of AI. And so I am really optimistic and really enthusiastic about the next phase of the computer industry's growth. And I think a lot of it is going to be at the edge. A lot of it's going to be about robotics.",446,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities remain unchanged. The effectiveness of deep learning AI continues to astound. The Transformer model, which led to the natural language understanding breakthroughs, is being advanced to learn patterns with great spatial, sequential and temporal complexity. Researchers are creating Transformer models that are revolutionizing applications from robotics to drug discovery. 
The effectiveness of deep learning AI is driving companies across industries to adopt NVIDIA for AI computing. We're focused on 4 major initiatives: First, ramping our next generation of AI infrastructure chips and platforms, Hopper GPU, BlueField DPU, NVLink, InfiniBand, Quantum InfiniBand, Spectrum Ethernet networking. And all this to help customers build their AI factories and take advantage of new AI breakthroughs like Transformers. 
Second, ramping our system and software industry partners to launch Grace, our first CPU. 
Third, ramping O-RAN, our new robotics processor and nearly 40 customers building cars, robo taxis, trucks, delivery robots, logistics robots, farming robots to medical instruments. 
And fourth, with our software platforms, adding new value to our ecosystem with NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, and expanding into new markets with new CUDA acceleration libraries.

This was a challenging quarter. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was down 19% sequentially and up 3% year-on-year, below the $8.1 billion outlook we provided on our last earnings call. As we had indicated in our pre-announcement press release on August 8, we experienced a shortfall to our expectations driven primarily by weaker Gaming revenue. Today, we will share with you more details on our Q2 results and Q3 outlook.
Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $2.04 billion was down 44% sequentially and down 33% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. As discussed in May, we expected a sequential decline in Gaming revenue due to softness in Europe related to the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China. The decline in Gaming GPU revenue was sharper than anticipated driven by both lower units and lower ASPs.
Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand. We implemented programs with our Gaming channel partners to adjust pricing in the channel and to price-position current high-end desktop GPUs as we prepare for a new architecture launch.
As noted last quarter, we had expected cryptocurrency money to make a diminishing contribution to Gaming demand. We are unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced crypto money contributed to the decline in Gaming demand. While Gaming navigates significant short-term macroeconomic challenges, we believe the long-term fundamentals in Gaming remain strong.
NVIDIA RTX has redefined computer graphics and is now supported by almost 300 games and applications. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are the most coveted brand by gamers, representing 15 of the top 15 most popular GPUs on Steam. Gaming has emerged from the pandemic an even more popular form of entertainment and social connectivity.
Estimated GeForce sell-through is up over 70% since before the pandemic, and peak concurrent users on Steam are also up more than 70% over the same time period. GeForce now registered members now exceed 20 million. This quarter, we added 80 more titles, including the hugely popular Genshin Impact, bringing our total to over 1,350.
Moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $496 million was down 20% sequentially and down 4% from a year ago. A sequential increase in mobile revenue was more than offset by lower desktop revenue, particularly at the high end. As macroeconomic headwinds intensified, enterprise demand slowed and OEMs worked to reduce inventory. We expect these trends to persist in Q3.
While ProViz is undergoing a near-term adjustment after doubling last year, we believe we have expanded the market opportunity over the last couple of years with AI and Omniverse workloads. We believe hybrid work is here to stay, and with it, the need for collaborative 3D design enabled by professional graphic workstations, both at home and in the office as well as in the cloud.
In June, we announced a partnership with Siemens to enable the industrial levers and AI-powered digital twins, connecting Siemens' Xcelerator platform to NVIDIA Omniverse. This connection opens Siemens to the vast ecosystem of NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA to Siemens' ecosystem of the world's largest industries. Earlier this month at SIGGRAPH, the Premier Computer Graphics Conference, we announced advancements to several foundational technologies of the metaverse, defined as the 3D version of the Internet.
First, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine will enable businesses to create and deploy assistants and avatars, transforming interactions across a range of industries. We also unveiled 11 new Omniverse connectors, bringing the total number of connectors to the Omniverse USD ecosystem to 112. And finally, we released SDKs for the new field of neural graphics, which intertwines AI and graphics to help automate the creation of virtual worlds.
Moving to Automotive. Revenue of $220 million increased 59% sequentially and 45% from the year ago quarter. Strong growth was driven by auto AI solutions, which include AI cockpit and self-driving revenue, with particular strength in self-driving as new energy vehicle design wins ramp into volume. We believe Q2 was an inflection point for our Automotive revenue as NVIDIA Orin has great momentum.
During the quarter, we announced rollout plans of new vehicles from OEM partners, NIO, Li Auto, JIDU and Human Horizons as well as Pony.ai's line of self-driving trucks and robotaxis, all built on NVIDIA DRIVE. Looking forward, we expect our $11 billion Automotive design win pipeline to translate to continued growth.
Moving to Data Center. Revenue of $3.81 billion grew 1% sequentially and 61% year-on-year. Although a record, this was somewhat short of our expectations as we were impacted by supply chain disruptions. Revenue from hyperscale customers nearly doubled year-on-year. Sequentially, sales to North America hyperscale and cloud computing customers increased but were more than offset by lower sales to China hyperscale customers affected by domestic economic conditions.
Vertical industries grew both sequentially and year-on-year. Key workloads driving growth include natural language processing, recommender systems, autonomous vehicle fleet data processing and training and cloud graphics.
Let me share a couple of customer examples. Pinterest transitioned to 100x larger recommender models by moving its inference from CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs. Its ability to deploy a higher-quality model at high throughput and low latency resulted in a 16% increase in engagement, a critical metric for the company, which has over 400 million users and 300 billion images. And Tesla recently upgraded its supercomputer to use over 7,000 A100 GPUs for autopilot training.
From a product perspective, networking led growth this quarter with strong demand from our high-speed Ethernet adapters and design win momentum toward next-generation adapters, including the ConnectX-6 and ConnectX-7. We also see growing interest from cloud service providers for our new Spectrum-4 400-gigabit per second Ethernet networking platform.
Additionally, we are ramping into the upcoming launches of our next-generation platforms. The Hopper architecture flagship H100 data center GPU is in production. Grace is our first CPU. Top computer makers, including Dell, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro are adopting the new NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip to build the next generation of supers.
72% of the systems on the latest top 500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA, including 31 of 39 new systems. NVIDIA's own Selene supercomputer ranks at #8 in the top 500 and is the world's fastest enterprise supercomputer. Moreover, 22 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA.
Significant advances in software technologies are key to our platform performance. In the past 2 years, our A100-based platform has delivered 6x more performance as measured by the  MLPerf industry benchmark, largely through new software technologies and optimizations. Last month, we announced an update to the NeMo Megatron framework that can speed up the training of large language models by up to 30%. Improving a multi-hundred million-dollar AI infrastructure by 30% translates to significant value for customers.
LLMs are one of the most important neural networks today, ranging in size, from tens of billions, to over 1 trillion parameters. Learning from text, they can be used for real-time content generation, tech summarization, customer service chat box and question-answering for conversational AI interfaces.
Currently, these capabilities are available to early access customers to run on NVIDIA GTX SUPER products and NVIDIA DGX Foundry as well as in Microsoft Azure cloud, with other product platforms available soon. We are working with the industry leaders in large language models, a very active and exciting space of AI.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 43.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%. Gross margin includes $1.22 billion in charges for inventory and related reserves based on revised expectations of future demand and $122 million for warranty reserves. These charges incurred in the quarter reflect purchase commitments that we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macro uncertainty. We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact.
GAAP operating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and down 32% sequentially as Q1 included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 38% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These increases were driven primarily by employee growth costs as well as increases in salaries to support our employees during this high inflationary environment and engineering development of new products coming to market.
We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term revenue growth, while managing near-term profitability. Our full year non-GAAP OpEx is expected to grow over 30%.
During the first half of fiscal 2023, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases. We have nearly $12 billion remaining under our authorization through December of 2023.
Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal '23. We expect Gaming and ProViz revenue to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand and prepare for our new product generation. We expect that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive.
Revenue is expected to be $5.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.82 billion.
GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Jefferies conference in Chicago on August 30 and the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco on September 12. And we will be holding a financial analyst Q&A with management, following Jensen's GTC keynote, on September 20. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 16.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you assist? Would you please poll for questions?",1722,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

Obviously, this is a challenge for you as well. But curious how you're thinking about it today. Is the fiscal '20 recovery post the first half '19 correction an appropriate framework? Or was that inflated by crypto as well?
And I guess, as part of that, how do we think about the cascading in of the new product cycle? And is there potential for future reserves needed to be taken if Gaming does not meet your new updated outlook?",96,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

Across those 2 quarters, the Q2 of '23, the Q3 of '23, we have likely undershipped Gaming to our end demand significantly. We expect that sell-through or essentially our end demand for those combined 2 quarters of Q2 and Q3 to be approximately $5 billion.
Now on top of this, keep in mind that we do have Gaming growth drivers to consider for the future. These can include our new Gaming product introductions that are around the corner as well as new segments of the market that we plan to reach with our Gaming technology, to just name a couple. I'll turn it over to Jensen to talk a little bit more about that.
Now regarding any further types of write-downs on this perspective, we did a thorough assessment with this quarter, not only just looking at what we needed for this quarter, but what we needed for the long term. Keep in mind, our inventory provisions and write-downs that we took into account had to reflect some of the purchasing that we did a supply back more than a year ago, when we were still in extreme supply shortages in almost all of our products.
And so this was an opportunity for us to resize given the macroeconomic conditions, what we needed in terms of supply. So our expectations were higher, and we took this opportunity to write them down to what our current expectations are.
I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he wants to add more.",290,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thanks, Colette. C.J., our sell-through is off the highs in the beginning of the year, but it's still very solid. In fact, sell-through is -- has increased 70% since pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. And so it's very clear that gaming is -- the fundamentals of gaming are strong, and this medium is really doing well. Not to mention, the gaming platforms are being used -- our Gaming PCs are being used for influencers, people sharing content, creating content, vloggers, VTubers, there's all kinds of new ways of engaging and spending time with video games.
And our strategy is to reduce the sell-in, reduce the sell-in this quarter or next quarter, to let channel inventory correct. Obviously, we're off the highs, and the macro condition turned sharply worse. And so our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We've also instituted programs to price-position our current products to prepare for next-generation products.
Ampere is the most popular GPU we've ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam. And it remains the best GPUs in the world, and it will be very successful for some time. However, we do have exciting new next-generation coming and it's going to be layered on top of that.
And so we've taken 2 -- we've done 2 things. We've reduced sell-in to let channel inventory correct, and we've implemented programs with our partners to price-position the products in the channel in preparation for our next generation. All of this, we anticipate, were working towards a path to being in a good shape going into next year, okay? So that's what our game plan is.",282,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So I just wanted to make sure our baseline assumption is set there.
And then my question is actually similar, on the Data Center. Sales are pretty strong right now, but there is a concern that Data Center CapEx could be the next shoe to drop in this rolling correction in semiconductors. I'm curious, what's your sense of utilization of your Data Center shipments? And what is the risk that there could be a correction in the Data Center given some of the macro caution expressed by some of the hyperscaler and enterprise customers?",130,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

Thanks, Vivek. The sell-through, the sell-through as I mentioned earlier, of GeForce is solid. The end-market gaming demand is solid. It's off the highs, which was really high recently in the beginning of the year. And so we have -- and because we were building for such a vibrant market, we found ourselves with excess inventory. And so our strategy is to sell well below -- well -- sell-in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct. We'll do that for a couple of quarters or so.
We believe that by the end of the year, we'll be in a good shape going into next year. And so I hope that answers your question, but the important thing is our sell-in rate is far below what is happening in the market for sell-throughs. The sell-through is solid, has increased 70% since pre-COVID. And so the gaming market is really quite vibrant.
On the second question, on data center end markets, we hear fairly broadly that GPU supply is in shortage in the cloud. We hear quite broadly that demand for GPU rentals far exceeds current supply. And it's fairly sensible to us, partly because the number of use cases for GPUs in the cloud has grown quite a bit. If you look at one particular segment in just managing -- collecting data and managing the data of the AV fleet and using that data to train AI models, using that data to reconstruct HD maps, the usage of GPUs in the cloud for just that one application has grown a lot.
And furthermore, there's -- the deep learning-based recommender systems has demonstrated such significant effectiveness, and it helps Internet service providers to enhance engagement, enhance click-through rate. And so that -- so this particular form of recommender systems is going to really drive a fair amount of data processing and machine learning in the cloud.
And then, of course, over the last several years, a very important model has emerged, called Transformers. You and I have spoken about this model several times in the past. And it's been found that this Transformer model, this large language -- this language model, which when scaled up in size, exhibits really spectacular and effective capabilities for -- to be used to learn skills with either few shots or almost no shot, meaning it could learn skills, it could perform skills that it has never learned because the knowledge was somehow encoded from the large amount of data that it had learned from.
And so this large language model area of innovation is used and of course, conversational, chat, Q&A, summarization, text generation, image generation. But very importantly, it's being used in life sciences for understanding chemistry. We've done some very important work in this area ourselves, called MegaMolBART, understanding proteins, understanding DNA, to learn the language of these large -- very, very large spatially as well as temporally or sequentially types of data.
And so the impact of this area is really quite worth staying close to. It's called large language models. I think Stanford did a paper that called it foundation models, that could be used for training all kinds of other types of AIs.
And so we're seeing a great deal of demand for GPUs in the cloud. We were challenged this quarter with a fair amount of supply chain challenges because as you know, we don't just sell the GPU chip, but these systems are really complex, with a large number of chips in the system components that we offer, like HGX.
And so kidding -- all of the components have to come together for us to be able to deliver the final component. And then furthermore, these data centers sit idle until the last piece comes together. And the last piece includes very complicated switches and very complicated NICs and networkings and cables.
And so these -- building these high-performance computing data centers at very large scale for the world's clouds is not particularly easy. And so the supply chain challenges have been somewhat disruptive. But the demand is there. And on top of that, we're ramping into Hopper, which is really a fantastic generation.",706,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I guess, Colette, the first angle being, in the release, you guys talked about pulling, I don't know, high-$200 millions of revenue into the July quarter from October, but also with supply chain challenges, maybe some deliveries that were meant for July got pushed back into October. So if you could talk a little bit more about those dynamics and just clarify for us that the October sequentially up Data Center guidance is actually clean of any pull-ins.

Thanks for the question. And it's kind of a little bit of an add-on to some of the statements that Jensen was discussing regarding our supply chain and what we're seeing today. Our supply chain during the quarter really was quite difficult, was quite challenging to work through.
Our platforms, including HDX, networking chips, cables, switches, were very important to the customers. It's not just about us selling the GPUs. So even though customers order those components themselves, they're looking from us for what we may refer to as kits, kits that go with those GPUs for them to stand up their data centers.
We also experienced supply disruptions internally with our logistics and our component availability. Some of our supply arrived very late in the quarter. We had very little time, from a logistics and availability, to get those things out.
Customers were impacted as well by availability of key third-party other components that we weren't offering, which were slowing down some of their deployments. So what we did in our Q2 orders that couldn't be delivered in Q3, given that some of these supply constraints existed, and we had Q3 demand where we did have supply in Q2, so we worked with customers to optimize that supply and demand. And that's what we've disclosed to you.",219,-6.0,6.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6

The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they've been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well, really slowed down in Q2.
This slowdown can't last forever. And the number of new technologies in software, the number of people who are using clouds and the number of cloud services is continuing to grow. And so I fully expect investment to return. They're a very important market for us, a very large market for us. And the fact that North American hyperscalers doubled year-over-year, our revenues at North American hyperscalers, and that was offset by declines in China, says something about the slowdown in China. And so I don't think that's going to last forever. I think it's going to return.
With respect to Hopper, we're in full production now. And we're racing to get Hopper to all of the CSPs who are dying to get them. And it goes with our HGXs, which is multiple Hoppers on a system tray. It's really a supercomputer in a motherboard, if you will. And it goes along with it networking gear and switch gear. And so there's the enormous amounts of resources applied from all of the CSPs around the world and ourselves to get Hopper to them.

So our inventory charges, as we commented, we're taking a thorough look of not only this last quarter as well as the quarter that we're guiding, but looking over the long term of what we need for demand and then what we had in terms of supply. Remember, we had purchased this very early on in the year as we needed to, to drive the commitment of the supply that we already have.
And so what is happening here for the Data Center, we had great, high expectations. We still have very strong, solid growth projection for Data Center as well. But we're going to take this opportunity for some of the prior architecture pieces, to write down those, given what we see as just a change in terms of our expectations going forward.
So you are correct. There are also pieces in there for Gaming. We have written down some silicon and chips as the macroeconomic conditions and we get ready for our future product launches, taken into account, but there's also components, services and capacity and some of the other drivers that are incorporated in those write-downs.",193,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6

Our Hopper supports previous-generation CPUs. But I guess, next-generation GPUs -- CPUs, Sapphire Rapids and Genoa after that as well as Graviton. And so we certify and test across all of the CPUs because the cloud service providers demand it. And they intend to deploy NVIDIA accelerators, NVIDIA Hoppers, across a large number of CPUs.
There is no question that the delay is disruptive and a lot of engineers have to scramble. It would have been a lot easier if next-generation CPUs were to have executed more perfectly. However, Hopper goes into an environment with CSPs where they connect our PCI Express connectors to old-generation, current-generation CPUs as well. And so nobody likes the delay. The next-generation CPUs will trigger a refresh of infrastructure and new servers. And so I'm super excited about them.

And a lot of it's kind of been talked a little bit about, but I just -- Colette, I want to think about the numbers a little bit more. I guess based on the guidance commentary, where I've come up thinking about would be as like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in Gaming and Professional Visualization and maybe kind of low- to mid-single-digit growth in Data Center and Auto. So I guess, is that the right context?
And with that, and with Hopper coming down the pipeline, we're going to have a lot of questions around kind of the deceleration of year-over-year growth in Data Center, I believe. Do you think that Hopper, as that comes fully available, it sounds like in fiscal 4Q, that you actually see Data Center growth reaccelerate as that product cycle materializes?",138,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Thanks for the question. And that's a pretty good understanding of our guidance. And we do expect, yes, Gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2. So that may be, of our 2 areas of the decline, our Gaming and ProViz, that may be about 3/4 of it associated with that Gaming, and then Professional Visualization would probably be about 1/4 of the 2 areas that will decline.
Our Data Center, yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We'll continue to look at it. There may be some more opportunity there. And Automotive, very similar to our thoughts at the very beginning of the quarter. We are expecting continued growth through each of the quarters of this fiscal year. We felt that Q2 was an inflection point, so we'll continue to grow into Q3 and hopefully Q4 going forward.
I'll turn it over to Jensen to see his thoughts in terms of Hopper, what Hopper brings to us in Q4, and the expectations.",183,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And the reason for that is to allow the inventory, the channel inventory and the OEM inventories to correct. And this allows us to prepare for our next generation. And our next generation has Hopper for compute, but we also have the next generation for computer graphics that will be coming to market.
Hopper is a giant new generation because it is designed to perform this new type of AI model called Transformers. It has an engine inside it called Transformer engine, with numerical formats and pipelines that allows us to do a spectacular job on Transformer-type of models, which includes large language models, but it also includes computer vision models that are now able to be processed with this new type of AI model called Transformers.
And so I fully expect Hopper to be the next springboard for future growth. And the importance of this new model, Transformers, can't possibly be understated and can't be overstated. This is the impact of this model across robotics, computer vision, languages, biology, chemistry, drug design, is just really quite spectacular.

And as we move into the next quarter, we're going to have to see which is going to be growth larger. We're just going to have to take a look once we finish that quarter. But our supply for compute is here. But as we have discussed, sometimes, it's important that they have many of our other components that we provide in networking at the same time that we are providing the GPUs.

And so networking has been short of supply. These are the same supply issues that some of our CSPs are having.

Regarding our inventory charges that we had, when you think about what we have in supply, whether it be chips, components, whether it be memory, remember, a lot of these things can be used interchangeably across the 2. Additionally, the value of our inventory for Data Center is much different than the value of what we have for Gaming from an overall cost perspective. So we're creating capacity opportunities, putting together all of those systems in terms of Data Center. It is prior architectures.
Absolutely, this is not a question regarding anything of our future products coming to market. Nothing on the inventory provision has to do with that. So we took this as looking at the macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed. Our expectations, our plans, were higher. They're still quite solid, that we see in demand both for Gaming as well as solid for Data Center. And that will continue.

Large language models, excitement, innovation, ideas, companies, start-ups, industries, all exceeding everyone's expectations. I don't think anybody could have predicted the impact of Transformers as it scaled up to these giant sizes.
There's a fair amount of literature now written about language models that were smallish in the old days, in the beginning, several years ago, 3 years ago. And the ones that are in the hundreds of billions and moving towards probably several trillion parameters, the effectiveness of the AI is really quite spectacular.
And to have AI that was never trained on a particular skill and yet within one shot or one shot of trying or even no shots, are able to perform that skill, is beyond anybody's expectations, I would think. And so I think the -- if the success of Hopper is -- reflects the amount of work and pent-up demand for large training systems that Hopper is going to go into, that's an indicator, I think, Hopper is going to be a spectacular success.",193,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

You are correct. We do expect that Data Center will assist in our gross margins, but we also have growth plans in Auto. Auto is below our company average, and so that will tend to offset some of those upper-bound things that we will see in terms of Data Center.
From time to time, there's always a small amount of scraps that we will have in our gross margin estimates. So nothing material is planned, but there is small scraps that may occur from quarter-to-quarter that are included in our gross margins.",157,-2.0,6.0,0.3888888888888889,0.6

I would say, first of all, we don't know. Second of all, unlike our Workstation business, our ProViz business, there's no installed base. Most of the ProViz sales tend to be upgrades or replacements from something that has our installed base of 3 or 4 or 5 years, that people -- whatever upgrade cycle they happen to have.
And so in the case of ProViz, the companies that are buying ProViz, our ProViz systems, likely already have systems that they've been using. And so if they were to tighten up ProViz, for whatever reason, the people could continue to use what they have.
In the case of our AI business, there's no real installed base. These are all brand-new things that people are growing into. And the productivity benefits or the cost savings benefits of using autonomous systems is fairly profound. And it's not so much that the demand isn't out there. Everybody would like to be more productive. Everybody would like to save more money. Everybody would like to move faster. It's just that AI's understanding and AI's use is still spreading.
And so we're delighted by the rate of growth and the rate of adoption of enterprise. My sense is that our AI business and our Viz business have very different characteristics for that reason. But what Colette said earlier is, about our ProViz businesses last quarter, is absolutely true, which is OEMs realizing that the end market is slowing and taking the opportunity to correct their inventory.",269,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

However, the overall trend long-term, the ASP is drifting up. And the way to think about that is a game console, when -- my first game console was $99. Lately, game consoles are selling for about $599. And the reason for that is because it's more useful than ever. You use your game console for your greatest form of entertainment, and you use it for a very, very long time.
And GeForce essentially is a game console inside your PC. And we've always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift towards the average selling price of a game console. And so it should be something along the lines of $500 or so roughly at this time.
We also have GeForce in the cloud. And because GeForce in the cloud is hosting many gamers simultaneously, it tends to want to be a much more powerful GeForce. And so our cloud-gaming GeForce tends to be -- our cloud-gaming graphics tends to be a much higher-end.
And so -- and then, of course, there's the design aspect of it. Most designers and most creators are able to use GeForce these days. And they use their PC to create content. And much of that content goes into video games and/or they're using video games to create their artistic content.

We're navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment. In Gaming, our partners and ecosystem are responding to a sudden slowdown in consumer demand and correcting channel inventory. Still, the fundamentals of gaming are strong. We'll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture. I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month.
In Data Center, AI, where computers are helping us write software that was impossible before, is driving a computing revolution and transforming every industry. NVIDIA's leadership in full-stack data center scale accelerated computing has made us the ideal partner for companies racing to leverage the power of AI. Even with the current macroeconomic headwinds, demand for our Data Center products have never been stronger.
The next wave of computing is coming. With AI and 3D graphics advances, developers will extend the Internet with virtual world overlays that connect to the physical world. This next evolution of the Internet is called metaverse.
We created Omniverse to connect the digital and physical world and be an open platform for creating and operating metaverse applications. The immediate applications for Omniverse span product design, manufacturing and operations. Omniverse is off to a great start.
Our Automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business. Autonomous driving is one of the biggest challenges AI can solve, and computing opportunity for us spans the data center to the car. Autonomous driving will transform the auto industry into a tech industry.
Automotive is one of the first to transform into a software-defined tech industry. But all industries will be. We're building NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse to be the engines for the world's enterprise to become software-defined, AI-powered technology companies.
I look forward to next month's GTC conference, where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics in gaming, AI's continuing breakthroughs and building the metaverse, the next evolution of the Internet. So join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.",348,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year-on-year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue, while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions. 
Starting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges, new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S. cloud providers and a broadening set of consumer Internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems and generative AI. 
As the number and scale of public cloud computing and Internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows, our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations and analytics. 
During the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H-100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China. That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter. We started shipping our flagship H-100 data center GPU based on the new Hopper Architecture in Q3. H-100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro. 
Early next year, the first H-100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. H-100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks. H-100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance. It offers 3x lower total cost of ownership while using 5x fewer server nodes and 3.5x less energy. 
Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy and scale AI, including large state-of-the-art models. Microsoft Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens and thousands of A100 and H-100 GPUs, Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform. Oracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. 
This includes bringing to Oracle Cloud infrastructure, the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H-100. Cloud-based high-performance companies, [ with scale ] is adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities' rising demand for AI in the cloud. 
NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries. Networking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints.  Our new Quantum-2 40 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum ethernet networking platforms are building momentum. We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware, whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last 2 years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs.
Our joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure software partners is expanding, including Arista, Checkpoint, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks and Red Hat. 
The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing '22 and has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green 500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing. The #1 most energy-efficient system is the Flatiron Institute Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H-100 GPUs. At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVX, reference designs featuring the new L40 GPU based on the ADA Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual world using NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise. NVIDIA OVX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo and Super Micro by early 2023. Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVX systems. 
We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and BioNeMo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, tech summarization, chatbox, co-development, protein structure and biomolecular property predictions. 
Moving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align Channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4.  
Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand. Our new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first ADA GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090 became available in mid-October and at a tremendous demand and positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the ADA family, RTX 4080 is available today. 
The RTX 4080 Series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neuro rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster game play. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and help supercharge gaming.
For example, the 15-year old classic game, Portal, now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 has made it on Steam's top 100 most wish-listed games. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350. There is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on Steam just hit a record of 30 million, surpassing the prior peak of 28 million in January. 
Activision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales, topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters, Top Gun Maverick and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. And this month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out minutes with 18,000 esports fans packed the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400. We also launched GeForce NOW on the new gaming devices, including Logitech, CloudG, handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks and Razr 5G Edge. 
Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4. 
Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI simulation, computationally intensive design and engineering workloads. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure-as-a-service offering, enabling artists, developers and enterprise teams to design, publish and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device. 
Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OVX for graphics and physics simulation. NVIDIA HGX for AI workloads and the NVIDIA Graphics delivery network, a global scale, distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge. Leaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse. Home improvement retailer, Lowe's, is using it to help design, build and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications, an advanced analytics company, heavy AI are creating Omniverse power digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network. 
And Deutsche Bahn, operator of German national railway is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability. Moving to automotive. Revenue of $251 million increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers' DRIVE Orin-based  production ramps continue to scale. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. Volvo Cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA Drive platform. 
This is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Xavier, along with 30 sensors. Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include Hozon Auto, NIO, Polestar and EX90. 
At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA DRIVE Thor Superchip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC road map, DRIVE Thor  delivers up to 2,000 TFLOPS of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace Hopper and ADA architectures. It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems, simultaneously offering a leap in performance while reducing cost and energy consumption. DRIVE Thor will be available for automakers' 2025 models with Geely-owned automaker, ZEEKR, as the first announced customer. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 53.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%. Gross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%. And non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases and higher data center infrastructure expenses. 
Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters. We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December '23. 
Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the H-100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction. And in automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Orin design wins. 
All in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming and data center. Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.2%  and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. 
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million. Further, financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Credit Suisse conference in Phoenix on November 30; the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 5 and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5 in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, February 22. We will now open the call for questions.

I think you said China is somewhat weaker. So I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming. 
And then Jensen, a question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. So if, let's say, U.S. cloud CapEx is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why?",102,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

Thanks for the question. Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business. We had indicated, if you put 2 quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business. Now during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 was relatively solid. We've indicated that although China lockdowns continue to channel -- excuse me, challenge our overall China business, it was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid.  And desktop, a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia areas. We expect, though, stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays as well as the continuation of the ADA adoption.",113,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

The first has to do with general purpose computing no longer scaling. And so acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows. 
The second dynamic is AI. And we're seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs, in important breakthroughs in AI. One is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to the best content or item or product to recommend to somebody who's using a device that is like a cellphone or interacting with a computer just using voice. You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request and make the appropriate recommendation to them. 
The second has to do with large language models. This is -- this started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to BERT, which led to GPT-3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language. It could be the language of biology. It could be the language of chemistry. And recently, I just saw a breakthrough called [ Genes LM, ] which is just one of the first example of learning the language of human genomes. 
The third has to do with generative AI. You know that the first 10 years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI. But the goal of perception, of course, is to understand context. But the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution to create something to generate product. And this is now the beginning of the era of generative AI. You probably see it all over the place, whether they're generating images or generating videos or generating text of all kinds and the ability to augment our performance to enhance our performance to make productivity enhanced to reduce cost and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with. Productivity is really more important than ever. 
And so you could see that our company is indexed to 2 things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity. And these things are more important than ever. And my expectation is that we're seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI and for these reasons.",435,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Thanks, CJ. We're making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI enterprise. In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds. You know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem. And over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and startups of all kinds. But more so -- more than ever, we're at the tipping point of clouds, and that's fantastic. Because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly. 
And this quarter, we announced several initiatives, one has -- several partnerships and collaborations, one that we announced today, which has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there. It has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many start-ups clamoring for large installations of our GPU so that they could do large language model training and building their startups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world's Internet service providers. 
Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and the scale, flexibility of clouds. And so over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the  cloud, all of our platform and software stacks to the cloud. And so today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack, for a very large part of the work that we're doing together so that we could take a full stack out to the world's enterprise. That's all software included.  
We, a month ago, announced the same similar type of partnership with Oracle. You also saw that rescale, a leader in high-performance computing cloud has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. MONAI has been integrated into GCP. And we announced recently NeMo, large language model, and BioNeMo, large language model, to put NVIDIA software in the cloud. And we also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full stacks to the cloud so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly and customers could engage our software if they would like to use it in the cloud. It's per GPU instance hour if they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through software license, and so license and subscription. And so in both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it. 
The partners that we work with are super excited about it because NVIDIA's rich ecosystem is global. And this could bring both new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer. And so our software stack is making really great progress.",482,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

So as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter. Most of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business, just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China. So when we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down.
Now looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market, our ADA architecture, our Hopper architecture and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market and which you see.

First,  is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance? I ask because you now have the A800 that is sort of a modified version of the A100 with the lower data transfer rate. So one could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it. And I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge. 
Can you just go into that a little bit more? Because last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought, but revenue came in pretty much in line. And it sounded like China was a net neutral. So is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charges relate to?",139,-5.0,6.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6

So let me talk about the first statement that you indicated. Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that. They're usually for very, very specific products and projects that we see. So I'm going to answer no. Nothing that we can see. 
Your second question regarding the inventory provisions. At the end of last quarter,  we were beginning to see softness in China. We've always been looking at our needs long term. It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes 2 or 3 quarters for us to build product for the future demand. So that's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. So now looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China, it was time for us to take a hard look at what do we think we'll need for data center going forward and not led to a write-down.",192,-2.0,6.0,0.3888888888888889,0.6

If I could take that. First, thanks for your question. Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing. We're not -- we don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All of our network solutions are very high end, and they're designed for data centers that move a lot of data. 
Now if you have a hyperscale data center these days, and you are deploying a large number of AI applications, it is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center. So the small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings frankly, in provisioning the service or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics. 
And so these days, with disaggregated and AI application, AI provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic and it pays for itself right away. But that's where we are focused, in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services in -- well, the AI applications that we focus on. You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world. And it is completely powered by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network. And the reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously.  
The investment that you're going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high. And so in the places where we focus, networking is really quite important. It goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox. I think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter. And now we're doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter. And so that kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking. It is an indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend but it is highly indexed to AI adoption.",362,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Thanks, Aaron. The math is like this. If you're going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%, the numbers are huge. And when we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center. And so we distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and it runs for a very long time. And so the importance of the network can be over-emphasized. 
And so the difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very easy to achieve. The difference between NVIDIA's InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself. A lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around. We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge of the -- within the network itself. 
We achieved significant differences in overall efficiency. And so if you're spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure, or even hundreds of millions of dollars on the infrastructure, the difference is really quite profound.",196,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings because every data center is now power limited, and because of this incredible transformer engine that's designed for the latest AI models. The performance over Ampere is so significant that I -- and because of the pent-up demand for Hopper because of these new models that are -- that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems and large language models and generative AI models. 
Customers are clamoring to ramp Hopper as quickly as possible, and we are trying to do the same. We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers. Remember, NVIDIA is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume. It's a miracle to ship 1 supercomputer every 3 years. It's unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter. 
And so we're working hand in glove with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up Hoppers. We expect them to have Hopper cloud services stood up in Q1. And so we are expecting to ship some volume, we're expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we're expecting to ship large volumes in Q1. That's a faster transition than Ampere.

Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward in discussing our data center business. Our data center business is becoming larger and larger and our customers are complex. And when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about 7, 8 different companies. But the reality is there's a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they're purchasing. Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is, where our research is, where our higher education is also purchasing.

Let me double click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right. There are 2 major dynamics that's happening. First, the adoption of NVIDIA AI in Internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they're doing it has grown a lot, internet service companies. And these are Internet service companies that offer services, but they're not public cloud computing companies. 
The second factor has to do with cloud computing. We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing. Almost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year -- this quarter, this last quarter since GTC about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud. A CSP, a hyperscaler is both -- are 2 things to us, therefore, a hyperscaler can be a sell to customer. They are also a sell with partner on the public cloud side of their business. 
Because of the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem, because we have so many Internet service customers and enterprise customers using NVIDIA's full stack, the public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us and the sell-with relationship they have with us. And it's pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business will likely, would very likely be the vast majority of their overall consumption. 
And so because the world CSPs, the world's public clouds is only at the early innings of their enterprise to lifting enterprise to the cloud world it's very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large. And so increasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will  include, of course, continuing to sell to them for internal consumption but very importantly, sell with for the public cloud side.",324,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

There is always a resell market. If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time. And the reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today, is upgraded to a 4090 or 3090 by a couple of years ago, was upgraded to 4090 today. That 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed it sold at the right price. 
And so the volume of -- the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there. And the inventory is never 0. And when the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market. But my sense is that where we're going right now with ADA is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market. And  early signs are, and I'm sure you're also seeing it, that the ADA launch was a home run. 
That 4090, we shipped a large volume of 4090s because as you know, we were prepared for it. And yet within minutes, they were sold out around the world. And so the reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts. And that says something about the strength and the health and the vibrancy of the gaming market.

On supply, I think there was some mixed messaging in your remarks. I think you talked about supply being a headwind at 1 point. And then when you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing. So I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you're caught up to demand at this point. And then secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic I realize, but it is -- I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million. It's becoming a bigger piece of your OpEx. So curious how we should be modeling that going forward.",112,2.0,5.0,0.6111111111111112,0.5

When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter and next quarter to really see our supply improve, so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers. That's our supply. We've also made a discussion regarding our customers' supply constraints issues when setting up a data center. Even getting data center capacity has been very difficult. And therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they're still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through. 
So that hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding 2 areas of supply. In our stock-based compensation, what we'll see, it's very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives. We have provided to our incoming employees but also once a year to our employees, and it's a single date in terms of when that is priced. So it's difficult to determine. 
But stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and will continue to be. So we look at it from an overall compensation perspective. So up until now and when we do the focal, we'll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now.",241,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

We are quickly adapting to the macro environment. Correcting inventory levels, offering alternative products to data center customers in China and keeping our OpEx flat for the next few quarters. Our new platforms are off to a great start and formed the foundation for our resumed growth. 
NVIDIA RTX is reinventing 3D graphics with ray tracing and AI. The launch of ADA Lovelace is phenomenal. Gamers waited in long lines around the world, 4090 stocks sold out quickly. Hopper, with its revolutionary transformer engine is just in time to meet the surging demand for recommender systems, large language models and generative AI. NVIDIA Networking is synonymous with the highest data center throughput and enjoying record results. Orin is the world's first computing platform designed for AI-powered autonomous vehicles and robotics, and putting automotive on the road to be our next multibillion-dollar platform.
These computing platforms run NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, software libraries and engines that help the companies build and deploy AI to products and services.  NVIDIA's pioneering work in accelerated computing is more vital than ever. Limited by [ business ], general purpose computing has slowed to a crawl just as AI demands more computing. Scaling through general purpose computing alone is no longer viable, both from a cost or power standpoint. Accelerated computing is the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.",233,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8
