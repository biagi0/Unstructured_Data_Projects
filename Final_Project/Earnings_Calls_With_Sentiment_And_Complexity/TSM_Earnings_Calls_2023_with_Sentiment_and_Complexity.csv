Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter 2023. First quarter revenue decreased 1.5% sequentially in U.S. dollar terms as our business was dampened by the end market demand softness and customers' inventory adjustment despite the continued ramp-up of our industry-leading 5-nanometer technologies. It is at the low end of our previous guidance. 
In NT dollar terms, revenue increased 2% in the fourth quarter due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points sequentially to 62.2% mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts, partially offset by lower capacity utilization. 
Total operating expenses accounted for 10.3% of net revenue. Operating margin was 52%, up 1.4 percentage points from the previous quarter. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 11.41 and ROE was 41.7%. 
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 32% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter while 7-nanometer accounted for 22%. Advanced Technologies defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 54% of wafer revenue. 
On a full year basis, 5-nanometer technology contributed 26% of 2022 wafer revenue. 7-nanometer was 27%. Advanced Technologies accounted for 53% of total wafer revenue, up from 50% in 2021. 
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 10% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 4% to account for 38%, IoT decreased 11% to account for 8% and Automotive increased 10% to account for 6% and DCE decreased 23% to account for 2%. 
On a full year basis, all 6 platforms had year-on-year growth. HPC increased 59% year-on-year to account for 41% of our 2022 revenue. Smartphone increased 28% to account for 39%, IoT increased 47% to account for 9%, automotive increased 74% to account for 5%, and DCE increased 1% to account for 3%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.56 trillion or USD 51 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 137 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 48 billion in accounts payable, an increase of TWD 93 billion in accrued liabilities and others. 
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remain at 36 days while days of inventory increased 3 days to 93 days. 
Regarding cash flow and CapEx, during the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 487 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 337 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for first quarter 2022 cash dividend. 
Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 47 billion to TWD 1.34 trillion at the end of the quarter. 
In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $10.82 billion. 
To recap our performance in 2022. We had a strong growth in 2022 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry's megatrends of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 33.5% in U.S. dollar terms to reach $76 billion and 42.6% in NT terms to reach TWD 2.26 trillion. Gross margin increased 8 percentage points to 59.6%, mainly reflecting a more favorable foreign exchange rate, value-selling efforts and cost improvement, partially offset by lower capacity utilization. Thanks to better operating leverage, operating margin increased 8.6 percentage points to 49.5%. 
Overall, full year EPS increased 70.4% to TWD 39.2 and ROE was 39.8%. 
On cash flow, we spent USD 36.3 billion or TWD 1.1 trillion in CapEx. We generated TWD 1.6 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD 528 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 285 billion in cash dividends in 2022, up from TWD 266 billion in 2021. I have finished my financial summary. 
Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. As overall macroeconomic conditions remain weak, we expect our business to be further impacted by continued end market demand softness and customers' further inventory adjustment. 
Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 16.7 billion and USD 17.5 billion, representing a 14.2% sequential decline at the midpoint. 
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.7, gross margin is expected to be between 53.5% and 55.5%, operating margin between 41.5% and 43.5%. 
Starting in 2023, certain tax exemptions from the Taiwan government have expired. However, the government has recently passed the amendments to the statute for industrial innovations. All things considered, we expect our effective tax rate in 2023 and beyond to be approximately 15%. This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our fourth quarter '22 and first quarter '23 profitability. Compared to third quarter, our fourth quarter gross margin increased by 180 basis points sequentially to 62.2%, of which 140 basis points was contributed by a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Meanwhile, cost improvement efforts also helped offset the impact from a lower capacity utilization. 
Compared to our fourth quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago, mainly due to cost improvement efforts. 
We have just guided our first quarter gross margin to be 54.5% at the midpoint mainly due to a lower capacity utilization rate as customers further adjust their inventory levels and a less favorable foreign exchange rate. 
In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of N3, overseas fab expansion and inflationary cost. 
In addition, R&D expenses accounted for 7.2% of our net revenue in 2022. In 2023, as we increase our focus on technology development and add more resources, we expect R&D expenses to increase by about 20% year-on-year and account for 8% to 8.5% of our net revenue. 
To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to strategically and consistently sell our value. 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. 
Next, let me talk about our 2023 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As I have stated before, given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customers' structural growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile. 
In 2022, we spent $36.3 billion to capture the structural demand and support our customers' growth. In 2023, our capital budget is expected to be between USD 32 billion and USD 36 billion. Out of the USD 32 billion to USD 36 billion CapEx for 2023, about 70% will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 20% will be spent for specialty technologies and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, mask making and others. 
Our depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately 30% year-over-year in 2023 mainly as we ramp our 3-nanometer technologies. 
With this level of CapEx spending in 2023, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. 
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",1273,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, 2022 Earnings Call, Jan 12, 2023",2023-01-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5276.0,2722041.0,102082444.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our 2023 outlook. 
Concluding 2022, the semiconductor industry growth excluding memory, was about 10%, while foundry increased about 27% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue grew 33.5% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms. 
Our business was supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation, even as a semiconductor inventory correction began to dampen the momentum in second half 2022. 
Entering 2023, we continue to observe softness in consumer end market segment, while other end market segments such as data center related have softened as well. 
As customers and the supply chain continue to take action, we forecast the semiconductor supply chain inventory will reduce sharply through first half 2023, to rebalance to a healthier level. 
In the first half of 2023, we expect our revenue to decline mid- to high single-digit percent over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms. 
Having said that, we also start to observe some initial signs of demand stabilization, and we will watch closely for more signals. We forecast the semiconductor cycle to bottom sometime in first half 2023, and to see a healthy recovery in second half this year. 
In the second half of 2023, we expect our revenue to increase over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms. 
For the full year of 2023, we forecast the semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline approximately 4% while foundry industry is forecast to decline 3%. For TSMC, supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we will continue to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market, and we expect 2023 to be a slight growth year for TSMC in U.S. dollar terms. 
Next, let me talk about the N7, N6 demand outlook. Three months ago, we set our N7, N6 capacity utilization in first half '23 will not be as high as it has been in the past 3 years. due to end market weakness in smartphone and PCs and customers' product schedule delay. Since then, the end market demand for smartphone and PCs has further weakened and the capacity utilization of N7, N6 is lower than our expectation 3 months ago. We expect this to persist through first half '23 as the semiconductor supply chain inventory takes a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level, and we expect a mild pickup in our N7, N6 demand in second half '23 than our prior expectation. 
However, we continue to believe N7, N6 demand is more a cyclical issue rather than structural. We are working closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technologies to drive additional wave of structural demand from consumer, RF, connectivity and other applications to backfill our N7, N6 capacity over the next several years. Thus, we are confident our 7-nanometer family will continue to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Now I will talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our N3 has successfully entered volume production in late fourth quarter last year as planned with good yield. We expect a smooth ramp in 2023 driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. As our customers' demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply, we expect the N3 to be fully utilized in 2023. Sizable N3 revenue contribution, we expect to start in third quarter '23 and N3 will contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023. We expect the N3 revenue in 2023 to be higher than N5 revenue in its first year in 2020. 
N3E will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power, and yield and offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. Volume production is scheduled for second half '23. 
Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we continue to observe a high level of customer engagement at both the N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than 2x that of N5 in its first and second year. 
Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology, thus, we expect customers a strong demand in 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond for our 3-nanometer technologies and are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Finally, let me talk about our plans to expand TSMC's global manufacturing footprint to increase customers' trust and expand our future growth potential. TSMC's mission is to be trusted technology and capacity provider for the global IC, logic IC industry for years to come. Our job is to provide the optimal solutions for our customers to enable their success. This including technology leadership, manufacturing, cost, trust and recently also including more geographic manufacturing flexibility. 
Based on customers' request, we are increasing our capacity outside of Taiwan to continue to provide our customers the optimal solution they need to be successful. TSMC's decisions are based on our customers' need and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders. Our decisions are also based on the talent pool, land, electricity and water needs for TSMC's long-term growth. 
In the U.S., we are in the process of building 2 advanced semiconductor fabs in Arizona. Our U.S. customers welcome us to build capacity in the U.S. to support their need and have placed their strong commitment and support. We had an opening ceremony on December 6 last year to celebrate the arrival of the first batch of state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and Fab 1 is on track to begin production of N4 process technology in 2024. 
We also announced the construction of a second fab, which is scheduled to begin production of 3-nanometer process technology in 2026. TSMC Arizona will continue to provide the most advanced semiconductor technology commercially available in the U.S., enabling next-generation, high-performance and low-power computing products in the future years. Each of our fab will have a clean room area that approximately double the size of a typical logic fab. 
We will also consider building additional mature node capacity outside of Taiwan. In Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab, which will utilize 12- and 16-nanometer, N22, N28 process technologies. Volume production is scheduled for late 2024. We are also considering building a second fab in Japan, as long as the demand from customers and the level of government support makes sense. 
In Europe, we're engaging with customers and partners to evaluate the possibility of building a specialty fab, focusing on automotive-specific technologies based on the demand from customers and level of government support. In China, we expand 28-nanometer in Nanjing as planned to support local customers, and we continue to follow all the rules and regulation fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and expand our capacity to support our customers' growth. 
Our N3 has just entered volume production in Tainan Science Park. We are also preparing for N2 volume production starting in 2025, which will be located in Hsinchu and Taichung Science Park. 
While capacity is not born overnight and takes time to build, we are committed to expanding our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust and expand our future growth potential. Depending on the demand from customers and level of government support, our 28-nanometer and below overseas capacity could be 20% or more of our total 28-nanometer and below capacity in 5 years or more time. 
While initial cost of overseas fab are higher than TSMC's fab in Taiwan. Our goal is manage and minimize the cost gap. 
Our pricing will remain strategic to reflect our value, which also including the value of geographic flexibility. At the same time, we are leveraging our competitive advantage of lost volume, economies of scale and manufacturing technology leadership to continuously drive cost down. We will also continue to work closely with our government to secure their support. 
By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher cost of overseas fabs while remaining the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer, no matter where we operate. 
Thus, even we increased our capacity outside of Taiwan, we believe long-term gross margin of [ 53% ]  and higher continue to be achievable, and we can earn a sustainable and healthy ROE of greater than 25% while delivering profitable growth for our shareholders. This concluding our key message. Thank you for your attention.",1386,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

I wanted to ask the first question just about the rising investment costs and also the cost differential with the U.S. Just based on the 2 press releases, the Taiwan fab, you cited Fab 18, about USD 60 billion investment for 8 phases, which would be, I estimate about 200,000 capacity. That's about $300 million per thousand wafer. The Arizona fab was $40 billion for about 50,000, $800 million per 1,000 wafers. So just 2 questions on it. If you could maybe discuss a bit more if there's differences in those releases on the investment in calculation, and a bit more color on the relative costs since you do the U.S. expansion? 
And then the second part of the question is, is the cost seeing a significant acceleration? It's been rising with each new node. But are you seeing an accelerating pace as you move through 3- and 2-nanometer?",150,3.0,7.0,0.6666666666666666,0.7

Randy, Thank you. Please allow me to summarize your question. So Randy's first question is he wants to understand, I think, he's referring, I think, to our press release when we -- about N3 in Tainan and the total investment there, and how does that compare to our announcement of the investment in Arizona for 2 phases. 
Randy, if I got you correctly, basically what Randy is asking is, what is the cost in the U.S. seem much higher in terms of the investment? So what is driving this big difference or a gap, so to speak. That's the first part of your question, right, Randy. Okay. So that's the first part.",113,4.0,6.0,0.7222222222222222,0.6

Randy, this is Wendell. Let me share with you this. The Arizona fab. We make the decision based on customers' request. And so we're planning on building the 2 fabs, 1 and 5, actually N4 and the other one N3. We're not able to share with you a specific cost gap number between Taiwan and U.S., but we can share with you that the major reason for the cost gap is the construction cost of building and facilities, which can be 4 to 5x greater for U.S. fab versus a fab in Taiwan. 
The high cost of construction includes labor cost, cost of permits, cost of occupational safety and health regulations, inflationary costs in recent years and people and learning curve costs. Therefore, the initial cost of overseas fabs are higher than our fabs in Taiwan.",137,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And the second question, just wanted to ask actually 2 areas that came up in the remarks. The R&D, the over 20% increase. If you could give a feel like what's mainly driving that additional step up, is it the development cost for the new nodes, the packaging? Or is it some now expanding R&D into new geographic areas? 
And if I can fit in the second part, just the tax rate, Taiwan was hyping a pretty big program of CapEx and R&D, but tax breaks, but your tax rate is going up from 11% to 15%.

So Randy's second question, I guess, is sort of 2 parts financial related. First, we -- our CFO said, our R&D spending will increase about 20% year-on-year. So Randy wants to know what is driving behind that? Is it customer going overseas? Is it more technology development as a technology leader, et cetera? And then the second part, he wants to understand the guidance of effective tax rate of 15% given the recent legislation passed in Taiwan. Why is it not lower?",83,4.0,5.0,0.7222222222222222,0.5

Randy, for the first question, we're the technology leader, and we intend to continue to maintain the leadership. Therefore, we are devoting more and more resources in R&D, including people and other kind of resources. That's the reason why our R&D expense will increase in 2023 and probably beyond. 
The other thing about tax, in 2023, part of the tax exemptions -- or incentives in Taiwan have expired.

So I think you just mentioned that even though we cannot disclose it, but the cost is definitely higher for the overseas capacity, but the management believes that the margin will stay the same. So I mean -- I think I asked this question back to 2019, the manager was talking about like the pricing will be the same across the board regardless of geographical locations. So what has changed now? So with the different pricing, can we say the overseas capacity will generate a similar return and profitability throughout the cycle?

The second question is for the N7. I think we spent some time for 7-nanometer, which is more cyclical. I think after 3 months, I think the correction is even bigger.

Wei,,Executives,34,"So I answer this one? First, N7 most of business for TSMC in the last 2 years is from the PC and smartphone. And that happened to correct -- or let me say that inventory correct happened to be the most severe one. And so the end market dropped more severely than we thought. In fact, the unit will not increase, but the content will be increased, so is demand be more softened than we thought 3 months ago? 
Why be repeated at 5 or 3? Cyclicality of the semiconductor always exist, but it's unlikely this time the scenario was to be repeated because our current downturn actually, it's kind of being enhanced or being degraded by the pandemic. 
Due to the pandemic, the digital transformation progress have been enhanced. And so the demand being increased dramatically. But then due to the pandemic, the supply chain disruption happened. And people during this time, probably changed their strategy or their thoughts on the inventory buildup. So artificially, the inventory has been built up quickly and dramatically. 
And then the response to the each industry are different. And so they manage that the inventory correction also differently. This kind of phenomenon all because of -- largely because of pandemic, and we don't think that it will happen again. And in the next 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer, I believe TSMC and TSMC's customer will be more prudent on planning that what is the demand and also the supply.",243,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So I wanted to ask C.C. what's the true value add of Moore's Law going forward since it becomes much more expensive and whether you really see that customers can continue to expand their gross margin and create value to this world. So this is my first question.",102,-4.0,7.0,0.2777777777777778,0.7

So Charlie's first question is around technology. He notes that the cost, I guess, and cost per transistor is getting higher and overall global costs are increasing as well. So his question is, what is the value? Or is there still value in the so-called Moore's Law going forward? How does TSMC view this issue?",56,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

And also, we try to help our customers with our advanced 3D IC Fabric technology to improve the system performance, and that's where it's important. 
In the future, we want the world to be more greener, more safer, better. So power consumption needs become very, very important.

So do you think for mobile computing, particularly do you think a value-add is diminishing based on what you just said.

Actually, they might have a different kind of product schedule. They might have a different kind of product plan and et cetera. But the technology adoption, actually, it did not slow down. That's my answer to your first follow-up question. And whether that's some kind of customer, some of the hyperscale customers want to develop their own chip. Yes, but I cannot give you more information than that.

And so if we look at the share revenue could be higher than 5-nanometer for the first year. But if we look at the sales contribution as a percentage of total sales, it's actually a bit lower. And so I wonder for this year, perhaps there's some market demand issue. But looking into 2024 and 2025 based on your current customer engagement, should we model a faster ramp-up into 2024 or 2025 or its overall ramp-up could be slight slower because of maybe customer schedule issues or planning?

She notes 3-nanometer revenue is greater than 5-nanometer in its first year, but the revenue percentage contribution of mid-single digit is smaller or lower. So she's wondering why is that. Is it because of the market slowdown? Is it less customer adoption and interest? What is the reason behind that?

Wei,,Executives,70,"Okay. Sunny, let me start. The percentage of revenue for the advanced nodes, it becomes less important. This is because our base has become so big, much bigger than before. So I wouldn't worry about the percentage issue. In fact, we continue to observe a high level of customer engagement at both the  N3, and  N3E, the number of tape-outs more than doubled that of N5 in the first and the second year.

Wei,,Executives,107,"Charles, let me answer your question. All your comments are correct. I mean, that is because of a newer technology like a N2, N 1.4 and also a lot of new chips are more expensive than before. Actually, the technology complexity continue to increase exponentially. So that's why we spend much more R&D budget. We want to continue to be #1 in the world.

Yes, I do. Maybe a second question. I want to ask about specialty technology. Obviously, you expect specialty technology to backfill your 7-nanometer fabs. I think this may be a more commonality inside the industry, but I recently spoke to some of your customers who are more on the analog mixed signal side. A lot of them are, I mean, driving volumes more from 28-nanometer and above, and they could tell me that the benefit of going to 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer for you, 7-nanometer is there, but it's not large enough as in the past, moving node to node. And at the same time, the cost is much higher, and I look at your technology road map, specialty technology, road map, it does seems to me that the specialty technology platforms are not as broad as the 7-nanometer if I compare with the 28-nanometer and above. 
I just want to get some insights from you. How do you think about the progression of specialty technology going forward, as it seems to me that it's kind of slowing down a little bit more slowing a little bit down faster for the analog mixed signal customers.",194,-3.0,7.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7

Wei,,Executives,111,"Charles, your observation is quite good. Actually, you are right. But then let me share with you a little bit more detail inside. Actually, you are right, for the analog portion or mixed signal portion, we do not need to really move into 7-nanometer or more ones node. But as time goes by, now it's more and more computing functionality needed to be added into the product. 
Let me share with you that one thing like the WiFi, you need a really, very high speed to move to the next generation and also the RF. For those kind of things, you need a very high-performance of the computing together with low power consumption. It is important. And if you want to get the lower power consumption, the only the leading-edge node it can give you that kind of opportunities. All the footprint stays the same, then if you want to have a higher functionality with a lower power consumption, that's where you have to move into the 7-nanometer or more advanced node even with the analog product.

I think the Wendell has answered this question earlier, let me summarize a little bit. TSMC is in a service business. not in just pure production. The service depends on the trust from the customers. So in the past, our trust and service depends on our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and the lowest cost and quality. But recently, the geopolitical development is evolving just in front of us. that 100% in one place cannot suffice our customers' needs. Therefore, we started the overall global footprint planning. 
Now of course, the cost will be higher. And I think our team has been focused on how do we do this at the same time, keep our minimum gross margin to be 53% and above. And that is the standard that we decide how the pace of our global expansion going to be, and there are other segments in terms of the space, of course. 
The global expansion increased the value to our customers and to the new geopolitical environment. And therefore, the pricing, how the customer can shoulder the increased cost in terms of pricing. And of course, the -- geopolitically, the semiconductor in the U.S. and Japan are all new. So I believe we are working hard on how to reduce the cost by building up the semiconductor supply ecosystem in U.S. and Japan. And I think indeed, both governments echo are -- not just us, also rather other major companies to build a similar capacity in this place to reduce the costs. 
So that is the general arrangement we are planning. There's no fixed rate. Of course, the government support will be another factor. And so that is, we are cautiously step-by-step to make sure our shareholders' value still be kept.",296,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

So my second question is on the mature node. And there will be no mature node is long-lasting and generates pretty good profits with TSMC technology leadership. So while we are expanding overseas, what is the strategy for mature node in the long run, especially China expansion led by -- also by the government subsidies. 
And also R&D is quite valuable for TSMC. And should we continue to allocate the R&D to mature node when maintaining group [indiscernible] and advanced packaging?",82,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023",2023-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4679.0,2782281.0,103860700.0,Presenter Speech,Jen-Chau Huang,,Executives,1,"Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the first quarter 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter 2023.  
First quarter revenue decreased 18.7% sequentially in NT or 16.1% in U.S. dollar as our first quarter business was impacted by weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand, which led customers to adjust their demand accordingly. Gross margin decreased 5.9 percentage points sequentially to 56.3%, mainly reflecting lower capacity utilization and a less favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by a more stringent cost controls. 
Total operating expenses accounted for 10.8% of net revenue, which is lower than the 12% implied in our first quarter guidance mainly due to stringent expense control and lower employee profit sharing. Operating margin was 45.5%, down 6.5 percentage points from the previous quarter. 
Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 7.98 and ROE was 27.5%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 31% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 20%. Advanced Technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 51% of wafer revenue. 
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC declined 14% quarter-over-quarter and accounted for 44% of our first quarter revenue. Smartphone declined 27% to account for 34%. IoT declined 19% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 7% and DCE decreased 5% to account for 2%.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.59 trillion or USD 52 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 71 billion, mainly due to the decrease of TWD 65 billion in accounts payable. On financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 34 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 96 days. 
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 385 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 302 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for second quarter 2022 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased CNY 42 billion to CNY 1.39 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $9.94 billion. I have finished my financial summary. 
Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the second quarter to continue to be impacted by customers' further inventory adjustment. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between to USD 15.2 billion and USD 16 billion, which represents a 6.7% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.4, gross margin is expected to be between 52% and 54%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our first quarter '23 and second quarter '23 profitability. Compared to fourth quarter, our first quarter gross margin decreased by 590 basis points sequentially to 56.3% primarily due to a lower capacity utilization. Compared to our first quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago, by 80 basis points, mainly due to more stringent cost control efforts. 
We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to be 53% at the midpoint mainly due to a lower capacity utilization rate and higher electricity costs in Taiwan. After last year's electricity price increase of 15% in the second half of 2022, TSMC's electricity price in Taiwan has increased by another 17% starting April 1 this year. This is expected to take out 60 basis points from our second quarter gross margin.  
We expect the impact from higher electricity costs to continue throughout the second half of this year and dilute our full year gross margin by about 50 basis points. In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of N3, overseas fab expansion and inflationary costs, including higher utility costs in Taiwan.  
To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, which we have no control over, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.  
Next, let me talk about 2023 capital budget. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As I've stated before, given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customers' structural growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile. Thus we expect our 2023 capital budget to be between USD 32 billion and USD 36 billion.  
With this level of CapEx spending in 2023, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend on both an annual and quarterly basis. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading edge, and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.  
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",904,-5.0,7.0,0.2222222222222222,0.7
380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023",2023-04-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,4679.0,2782281.0,103860701.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. 3 months ago, we said we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to start gradually reducing 4Q 2022 and we forecast a sharper reduction throughout the first half of 2023.  
However, due to weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand fabless semiconductor inventory continued to increase in the fourth quarter and exited 2022 at a much higher level than we expected. In addition, the recovery in end market demand from channels reopening is also lower than our expectation. Therefore, the fabless semiconductor inventory adjustment in first half '23 is taking longer than our prior expectation. It may extend into third quarter this year before rebalancing to a healthier level.  
For the full year of 2023, we do our forecast for the semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline mid-single-digit percent while foundry industry is forecast to decline high single-digit percent. We now expect our full year 2023 revenue to decline low to mid-single-digit percent in U.S. dollar terms and our business to do better than both semiconductor ex memory and foundry industries, supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of USD 6.7 billion, which is towards the low end of our guidance range, provided in U.S. dollar terms. 
Moving into second quarter 2023, we expect our business to continue to be impacted by customers for the inventory adjustment. We now expect our revenue in the first half of 2023 to decline by about 10% over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms as compared to mid- to high single-digit percent decline previously.  
Having said that, we believe we are passing through the bottom of the cycle of TSMC business in the second quarter. While we forecast only a gradual recovery, for the semiconductor ex memory industry in second half 2023, TSMC's business in the second half of this year is expected to be stronger than the first half, supported by customers' new product launches.  
Next, let me talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our 3-nanometer technology is the first in the semiconductor industry to high-volume production with good yield. As our customers' demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply, we expect N3 to be fully utilized in 2023 supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. Sizable N3 revenue contribution is expected to start in third quarter and N3 will contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023. N3 will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield and offer complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications.  
N3E has passed the qualification and achieve performance and yield targets and volume production is scheduled for second half '23. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we continue to observe a high level of customer engagement at both N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than 2x that of N5 in the first and second half year -- in the second year, I'm sorry.  
Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. Thus we expect customers a strong multi-yield demand for our N3 technologies and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Now I will talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 top neurosis transistor structure to provide our customers with the best performance, cost and technology maturity. Our nanosheet technology has demonstrated excellent power efficiency and our N2 deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. At N2, we are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement from both HPC and the smartphone applications.  
Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced, and will further extend our technology leadership well into the future.  
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's global footprint and talent development status. As we have said before, we are expanding our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust, expand our future growth potential and reach for more global talents. In Arizona, despite some challenges in obtaining permits our fourth fab is scheduled to begin production of N4 processing technology in late 2024. In Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab the volume production is scheduled for late 2024.  
In Europe, we are engaging with customer and partners to evaluate the possibility of building a specialty fab focusing on automotive specific technologies based on the demand from customers and level of government support. In China, we are expanding 28-nanometer in Nanjing as planned to support our customer in China, and we continue to follow all rules and regulation fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and expand our capacity to support our customers' growth.  
In Kaohsiung, our fab construction continues, but we have adjusted our previous 28-nanometer expansion plan to now focus on capacity expansion for more advanced nodes, and we will remain flexible going forward. In terms of talent development, a key to TSMC's success is adherence to our core value of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust and our discipline and spirit of working together as 1 team.  
In both the U.S. and Japan, we recruiting from the top local colleges and universities and our progress is well on track. We have hired more than 900 US employees today in Arizona and more than 370 in Japan. We also plan to hire more than 6,000 employees in Taiwan in 2023. All of our hirings are to support our future growth potential.  
In addition to providing extensive training program for new overseas employees, many of them are brought to Taiwan for [indiscernible] experience in our fabs so that they can further their technical skills, while being emerged in TSMC's operation, environment and culture. As we expand our global footprint, our priority work continue to be identified, attract and hire talent whose core values and principles are aligned with TSMC's so that we can establish TSMC culture in all our employees, no matter where we operate. 
This concludes our key message. Thank you for your attention.",1048,-6.0,7.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7

Intel has been claiming that they will be attaining process parity and then process leadership by 2025 and talking about engaging with several fabless companies. How does TSMC see this competitive threat? 
And how do you benchmark TSMC N3 and N2, which is coming in 2025 with Intel's offerings over the next, let's say, 2 to 3 years?

This is Wendell. Let me make a few comments on the dividends. TSMC is committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing dividends. During the periods of high capital intensity or high capital investment, more of the focus is on sustainable. But when we start to capture and harvest the capital investment spend, the commitment is -- or the focus is more towards steadily increasing. 
The 70% ratio is a guidelines. Let me give you an example. If in the particular year, the free cash flow is much lower because of higher CapEx or lower profit than the -- to maintain a sustainable dividend, the ratio of free cash flow to be dispersed could be higher. And on the other hand, in a year where free cash flow is particularly high, the ratio can be 70%, but it can be lower because we need to look forward into the year behind that specific year, and to make sure it is sustainable.

First, as you look at the 3-nanometer where you mentioned supply still short of demand and have a lot of applications coming in. Do you have plans for potential reuse of 5-nanometer in the next 1 to 2 years as you bring up more of the 3-nanometer? And then the second part of the question, I wanted to ask more on that Kaohsiung fab shift. If you could go through why the plan to pull back on 28. And then with the intention for where you would shift that investment. Because I know you did cancel the 7-nanometer for that line.

Thank you, Randy. So Randy's first question is kind of related to our CapEx and capacity plan. His question partly is in terms of C.C. noted that the N3 demand exceeds our ability to supply. So he's asking, will we consider to reuse or convert tools -- N5 tools to N3 in the next few years. And also, he wants to know related to our plans in Kaohsiung.

Wei,,Executives,32,"Okay, Randy. You got a very good question about whether we converted some of the N5's capacity to N3 because N3 today, we are short of support to our customer. Instead of saying the convert N5 capacity to N3, let me say that we developed a strategy and a methodology to make some of the N3's tool can be supported by N5. And we take this kind of flexibility into our consideration so that we can fulfill our commitment to support our customer in N3 as much as possible. Although still not enough, but we are doing that. So that answer one of your -- the first part of your question. 
You asked about Kaohsiung's TAM. Let me say that we look at the market situation today, and we are going to build -- initially the 28 nanometers that demand is so high so that we have to put Kaohsiung into our consideration. However, the market situation is so dynamic, and we look at our plan. 
One of the plan is in Japan, we build a new fab for 28 nanometers of specialty. By the way, TSMC expand the mature node's capacity or for specialties.  We don't increase capacity just for pure logic application. The other one, no, we don't do. So in order to avoid some of the overcapacity. So we built 1 in Japan. We're also expanding our capacity, 28-nanometer capacity in Nanjing. That's the second one. And then we are considering of the euro. That might be the third one for automotive application. 
Put all 3 together, we don't think today that Kaohsiung's -- if we build 28-nanometer probably, it won't be kind of financially feasible. So we diverted now adjusted to become a more advanced node, which we are still in shortage. And Kaohsiung is so close to Tainan so that we can have more flexibility in between.

I think a lot of investors also quite interested about the U.S. CHIPS Act. So I remember Chairman showed some concern about those requirements. I'm not sure which one is specifically concerned, for example, I need to disclose customer information, profit sharing, some restrictions for the future China fab investments.

And then just a quick follow-up. You spoke about AI being a positive and all the innovation happening in generative AI today. Just from a TSMC standpoint, is this fair to assume that what you're going through today is more on the training stage and therefore is more semiconductor and wafer intensive, but when you go into more inference, that intensity has to decrease? Is that a fair assumption? Or do you think that this level of intensity will continue growing from a TSMC standpoint for AI?",91,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So Krish's, second question is regards to generative AI and these type of applications. His observation is that the majority is training today, which seems to be beneficial. But as training moves to inference, would it be less semi-intensive or semi content intensive? And then, therefore, would that be, i.e., lower benefit to TSMC?",55,2.0,7.0,0.6111111111111112,0.7

Wei,,Executives,104,"Krish, I mean, that today, your observation is right because, right now, most of the AI concentrate or focus on training. And in the future, it will be inference. But let me say that, no matter what kind of application, they need to use a very high-performance semiconductor component, and that actually is a TSMC's advantage. 
So we expect that semiconductor content starting from a data center for [indiscernible] to device and edge device or those kind of things, put all together, they need a very high-speed computing with a very power-efficient one. And so we expect it will add to TSMC's business a lot. Qualitatively, as I said, we didn't know yet.

So we established this overseas operation office to make sure that headquarter's support to each overseas fab, what is sufficient and enough.

Maybe I want to start with one item you disclosed in your filings. On your balance sheet, you have an item called equipment under installation and construction in progress. 
That number has hit a record high, I think, over USD 40 billion as of the end of fourth quarter '22, which kind of means there are $40 billion investment. You put money in, but you are not harvesting that investment yet. But there's no revenue dollars being generated. 
But now I think you said you're tightening the CapEx for 2023, but you're reiterating that $32 billion to $36 billion CapEx. That seems to be adding on top of that $40 billion. A lot more investment is still expected in this year. 
So my question really is about this. Are you expecting a significantly higher incremental revenue opportunity in 2024 and beyond to justify that $40 billion plus, maybe another $32 billion investment? Or is the cycle time between you put the money in, put the investment into the time you harvest the investment, the generated revenue is getting a little bit longer than usual?

I think Charles' question, he does rightly note that on our balance sheet, equipment under installation reached roughly about $40 billion at the end of 2022. 
He notes this is a very high level. His concern, maybe Wendell can address, as we also guided for $32 billion to $36 billion CapEx this year, so is this number going to only increase?

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter of 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the third quarter.
Second quarter revenue decreased 5.5% sequentially in NT or 6.2% in U.S. dollars as our second quarter business was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end market demand and led to customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. Gross margin decreased 2.2 percentage points sequentially to 54.1%, mainly reflecting lower capacity utilization and higher electricity cost partially offset by more stringent cost control and a more favorable foreign exchange rate.
Despite the industry's cyclical downturn, we continued to invest in R&D to support our N3 and N2 development. Thus, operating margin was 42%, down 3.5 percentage points sequentially. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 7.01 and ROE was 23.2%.
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 30% of our wafer revenue in the second quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 23%. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 53% of wafer revenue.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC decreased 5% quarter-over-quarter to account for 44% of our second quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 9% to account for 33%. IoT decreased 11% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 3% to account for 8%. And DCE increased 25% to account for 3%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.5 trillion or USD 48 billion. 
On the liabilities side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 62 billion, mainly due to the net decrease of TWD 87 billion in income tax payable as we paid TWD 120 billion for 2022 income tax, offset by TWD 33 billion accrued tax payables for the second quarter.
Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 53 billion mainly as we raised TWD 41 billion in corporate bonds. 
On financial ratios. Accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 32 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 99 days, primarily due to N3 ramp during the quarter. 
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 167 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 251 billion in CapEx, distributed TWD 71 billion for third quarter 2022 cash dividend and raised TWD 41 billion from corporate bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance decreased by TWD 109 billion to TWD 1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter. 
Free cash flow was negative TWD 83 billion during the quarter as operating cash flow was more than offset by capital expenditures, partly due to the income tax payment of TWD 120 billion. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled $8.17 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between USD 16.7 billion and USD 17.5 billion, which represents a 9.1% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.8, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin to be between 38% and 40%. This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our second quarter '23 and third quarter '23 profitability. Compared to first quarter, our second quarter gross margin decreased by 220 basis points sequentially to 54.1%, primarily due to a lower capacity utilization. Compared to our second quarter guidance, our actual gross margin slightly exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago mainly due to more stringent cost control efforts and a slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate.
We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decline by 1.6 percentage points to 52.5% at the midpoint, primarily as the higher level of capacity utilization rate is offset by 2 to 3 percentage points margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the continued steep ramp-up of our 3-nanometer to dilute our fourth quarter gross margin by about 3 to 4 percentage points. 
In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of N3, overseas fab expansion and inflationary costs including higher utility costs in Taiwan. To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. While we face near-term challenges, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. 
Next, let me talk about our 2023 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. We now expect our 2023 capital budget to be towards the lower end of our range of between USD 32 billion and USD 36 billion. Our depreciation expense is now expected to increase by mid-20s percent year-over-year in 2023, mainly as we ramp our 3-nanometer technologies.
Despite near-term inventory cycle, our commitment to support customers' structural growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge, specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.
Now let me make a few comments on our cash dividend distribution policy. The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the capital -- the company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility and distribute a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend to shareholders. As a result of our rigorous capital management, in May, TSMC Board of Directors approved the distribution of TWD 3 per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2023, up from TWD 2.75 previously. This will become the new minimum quarterly dividend level going forward. First quarter '23 cash dividend will be distributed in October 2023. 
For 2023, TSMC's shareholders will receive a total of TWD 11.25 per share dividend and at least TWD 12 per share cash dividend for 2024. Going forward, as our capital intensity begins to decline in the next several years, the focus of our cash dividend policy is expected to shift from a sustainable to a steadily increasing cash dividend per share in the next few years.

380075.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2023",2023-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited,5140.0,2854837.0,105967757.0,Presenter Speech,C.C. Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of USD 15.7 billion, in line with our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the second quarter was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end market demand and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. 
Moving into third quarter 2023, while we have recently observed an increase in AI-related demand, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business. We expect our business in the third quarter to be supported by the strong ramp of our 3-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers' continued inventory adjustment.
In the last quarterly conference, we said we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to rebalance to a healthier level exiting the third quarter. This statement continues to hold true. However, due to persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions, slower-than-expected demand recovery in China and overall softer end market demand conditions, customers are more cautious and intend to further control their inventory into 4Q '23. 
Thus while we maintain our forecast for the 2023 semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline mid-single digit year-over-year, we now expect the foundry industry to decline mid-teens and our full year 2023 revenue to decline around 10% in U.S. dollar term. With such inventory control, we also forecast the fabless semiconductor inventory to exit 4Q '23 at a healthier and lower level as compared to our expectation 3 months ago.
Next, let me talk about HPC and TSMC's long-term growth outlook. As we have said before, the massive structural increase in demand for computation underpinned by the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC continues to drive greater need for performance and energy-efficient computing, which require use of leading-edge technologies. These megatrends are expected to fill TSMC's long-term growth. Even with a more challenging 2023, our revenue remains well on track to grow between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms, which is a target we communicated back in January 2022 investor conference.
The recent increase in AI-related demand is directionally positive for TSMC. Generative AI requires higher computing power and interconnected bandwidth, which drives increasing semiconductor content. Whether using CPUs, GPUs or AI accelerator and related ASIC for AI and machine learning, the commonality is that it requires use of leading-edge technology and a strong foundry design ecosystem. These are all TSMC's strengths. 
Today, server AI processor demand, which we define as CPUs, GPUs and AI accelerators that are performing training and inference functions accounts for approximately 6% of TSMC's total revenue. We forecasted this to grow at close to 50% CAGR in the next 5 years and increase to low teens percent of our revenue.
The insatiable need for energy-efficient computation is starting from data centers and we expect it will proliferate to edge and end devices over time, which will further long term -- which will drive further long-term opportunities. We have already embedded a certain assumption for AI demand into our long-term CapEx and growth forecast. Our HPC platform is expected to be the main engine and the largest incremental contributor to TSMC's long-term growth in the next several years.
While the quantification of the total addressable opportunity is still ongoing, generative AI and large language model only reinforce the already strong conviction we have in the structural megatrend to drive TSMC's long-term growth, and we will closely monitor the development for further potential upside.
Now let me talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. N3 is already in volume production with good yield. We are seeing robust demand for N3 and we expect a strong ramp of N3 in the second half of this year, supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. N3 is expected to continue to contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023.
N3E further extends our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield and provides complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3E has passed qualification and achieved performance and yield target and will start volume production in the fourth quarter of this year. 
With our continuous enhancement of 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multi-yield demand from our customers and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I'll talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 will adapt nanosheet transistor structure to provide our customer with the best performance, cost and technology maturity. Our nanosheet technology has demonstrated excellent power efficiency, and our N2 will deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. 
As part of N2 technology platform, we also developed N2 with backside power rail solution, which is best suited for HPC applications. Backside power rail will provide 10% to 12% additional speed gain and 10% to 15% logic density boost on top of the baseline technology. We are targeting backside power rail to be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. 
We are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement in N2 from both HPC and smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced and to further extend our technology leadership right into the future.

C., and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I want to talk about TSMC's global manufacturing footprint status update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. Our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint, to increase customer trust and to expand our future growth potential and to reach for more global talents. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs and the necessary level of government support. That is to maximize the value of our shareholders and to fulfill our fiduciary duty.
In Arizona, we are building a first fab to provide U.S. most advanced semiconductor technology in mass production to support the needs for U.S. semiconductor infrastructure. Our fab in Arizona started construction in April 2021 with an aggressive schedule. We are now entering a critical phase of handling and installing the most advanced and dedicated equipment. 
However, we are encountering certain challenges as there is an insufficient amount of skilled workers with those specialized expertise required for equipment installation in a semiconductor-grade facility. While we are working on to improve the situation, including sending experienced technicians from Taiwan to train the local skill workers for a short period of time, we expect the production schedule of N4 process technology to be pushed out to 2025.
In Japan, we are building a specialty technology factory, which will utilize 12, 16 and 22, 28 process technologies. Volume production is on track for late 2024. 
In Europe, we are engaging with customers and partners to evaluate building a specialty fab in Germany focusing on automotive-specific technologies based on the demand from our customers and the level of government support.
In China, we are expanding 28-nanometer in Nanjing as we planned to support our customers in China, and we continue to follow all rules and regulations fully. 
At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and to expand our capacity to support our customers' growth.
From a cost perspective, the initial cost of overseas fab are higher than TSMC's fabs in Taiwan due to: one, the smaller fab scale; two, higher costs throughout the supply chain; and three, the early stage of semiconductor ecosystem on those overseas sites as compared to a matured ecosystem in Taiwan. In our recent meetings with senior government officials in the U.S., Japan and Europe, we discussed our plans to expand our global manufacturing footprint to them. We also emphasized one of our major responsibility is to manage and minimize the cost gap to maximize return for our shareholders.
Those discussions went very well. All sides understand the critical and integral role TSMC plays in the semiconductor industry, and we appreciate all the governments' ongoing support in working with TSMC to help narrow down the cost gap. We will continue to work closely with all the governments to secure their further support. 
Our pricing will also remain strategic to reflect our value, which includes the value of geographic flexibility. At the same time, we will leverage our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership, large volume and economies of scale to continuously drive our cost down.
By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher cost of overseas fab while remaining the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer, no matter where we operate. Thus, even as we expand our capacity overseas, TSMC's long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE of greater than 25% is achievable, and we will continue to maximize the value for our shareholders.

Could TSMC talk a little bit about what TSMC is doing on the capacity side, especially on the advanced packaging, but also on other areas? And when do you expect to get back to some degree of demand-and-supply balance for these AI accelerators? Is it going to be only sometime next year?

Three months ago, we were probably more optimistic, but now it's not. Also that is -- for example, China economy's recovery is actually also weaker than what we thought. And so the end market demand actually did not grow as we expected.

I mean I just say the macroeconomy is not so -- has become weaker than we thought. In fact, higher inflation and interest rate impact end demand in all market segments in every region in the world. As we said, under such situation, our customers are more cautious in their inventory control in the second half of this year.

This is a very deep question. Of course, we have a model, basically. The short-term frenzy about the AI demand definitely cannot extrapolate for the long term. And neither can we predict the near future, meaning next year, how the sudden demand will continue or will flatten out. 
However, our model is based on the data center structure. We assume a certain percentage of the data center processor are AI processors, and based on that, we calculate the AI processor demand. And this model is yet to be fitted to the practical data later on. But in general, I think the -- our trend of a big portion of data center processor will be AI processor is a sure thing. 
And will it cannibalize the data center processors? In the short term, when the CapEx of the cloud service providers are fixed, yes, it will. It is. But as for the long term, when their data service -- when the cloud service is having the generative AI service revenue, I think they will increase the CapEx. That should be consistent with the long-term AI processor demand. And I mean the CapEx will increase because of the generative AI services. Anything more for you?",212,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

But we're not giving our guidance on the fourth quarter at this moment. We're just spelling out some of the challenges that we're seeing.

For next year, we're seeing -- we're not talking about the whole gross margin, but we still see that N3 will dilute about 3 to 4 percentage points of next year's gross margin.

Randy, the push out of fabs does push out some part of the CapEx, but that doesn't affect a big part. For 2024, it's too early to talk about the overall CapEx. 
However, our CapEx, if you -- as we said before, every year, we spend the CapEx to capture the future growth opportunities. And in the past few years, our CapEx has risen very fast to capture the megatrend. And going forward, the next few years, when we start to harvest those investments, we believe that CapEx will begin to level off in terms of dollar amount. And that will lead to -- start to lower the capital intensity in the next several years.",116,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

So Laura's first question is looking at our expansion of advanced packaging or back end versus the front-end wafer. As we are expanding the back end, but not the front end, does that imply that, first, that our front-end wafer particularly leading node, we expect the utilization to increase next year?

A lot of my customers right now increased their demand and that will increase their front-end demand, of course. TSMC almost have the major share -- or the largest share, let me say that, in the front-end wafer. According to the front-end [ loading ], we really work closely with our customer to decide what is the back end that they need. 
And so on that perspective, we are planning our CoWoS capacity, although probably still not enough, but we're working very hard to increase it. Overcapacity, not today is a concern. Today concern's not enough capacity to support all the very strong demand.",118,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And this is a follow-on. For AI, when do we actually start to see N3 -- adoption for N3?",79,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So Brett's first question is looking at our 3-nanometer families and the continuous enhancements that we always have. He is asking, what is the customer reception of N3P and N3X? How does this compare or cannibalize N3? 
And when do we expect AI related to adopt 3-nanometer family solutions?",50,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Wei,,Executives,101,"Let me answer the last one first. AI application already adopting that -- our N3 technology node. We continue to improve our technology as we always do. So we have N3E, N3P and N3X. 
X is the actual performance that's for the very high-speed, very high, let me say, performance computing for some of the CPUs application. 
But N3Es are widely accepted by all of my customer, and the design starting from N3E. And we help them -- okay, for some of them go to the N3P. 
So all together, every version, every variation, there's a lot of customer engagement right now.",102,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Mark, you were talking about the -- building up the ecosystem in some of the overseas markets like the U.S. and you're talking about skill shortage. 
But can you talk about what you think the like-for-like wafer cost difference is to operate in the U.S. versus Taiwan. I think your TSMC founder talked previously about a 50% premium to operate in the U.S. Can you just clarify if it's likely to be that high? And then when would you expect the cash support from the U.S. CHIP Act to be made available to TSMC?",103,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

So Brett's second question is for Chairman. He wants to know, in basically the cost gap how big is the cost gap of fab in the U.S. versus in Taiwan? Founder has said 50% or more. Is it that high? 
And then concurrently, with the CHIPS Act, when -- or how and when do we expect to receive the incentives to support?",63,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

I mean at this point, if we're using the current supply chain and labor cost, indeed, there's that differences. 
However, we try to work with the U.S. administration. First of all, on the subsidy, cash subsidy and tax -- investment tax credit, that is to cover the gap in the first 5 years approximately. When the tool is depreciated, then the ecosystem becomes prominent. That is, what is that, material costs, chemical costs and the labor cost. And we are working with our supplier to set up some of the more efficient supply sites to be lower, but they -- and the U.S. administration has decided also to subsidize the supply -- our suppliers. 
So that is still in the work. How much it can further decrease, I don't know. But I think either way, we will strengthen our pricing values and be able to keep the corporate profitability as we forecasted now.",162,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

The first question is I want to ask about AI, especially around TSMC's monetization of the AI trend. We did hear some commentary that for certain AI applications, TSMC is selling chips for a few hundred bucks, but TSMC customers can actually sell for tens of thousands of dollars to their end customers. So I mean some investors I spoke with really still -- [ it pains them ] to see TSMC create an advanced technology probably to give a greater value than this. 
So the question really is, how does TSMC think about maybe better monetization going forward for the capability to produce all these AI chips? 
And really, I want to tie back to one thing management mentioned in the prepared remarks. The AI growth, 50% CAGR, how much of that is volume? And how much of that could be the pricing [ actually ] in terms of TSMC's expected growth over the next few years?",162,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

And actually, after that, TSMC CapEx did level off around $10 billion level for roughly 5 years until 2019. 
By telling us the CapEx is probably going to level off, are you telling us or are you alluding to maybe there will be some steady-state CapEx numbers going forward maybe starting from '24 or '25 around $30 billion each level?

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the fourth quarter 2023.  
Third quarter revenue increased 13.7% sequentially in NT dollars or 10.2% in U.S. dollars as our third quarter business was supported by the strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology and higher demand for 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. Gross margin increased 0.2 percentage points sequentially to 54.3%, mainly reflecting higher capacity utilization, partially offset by the margin dilution from N3 ramp.  
Total operating expenses accounted for 12.6% of net revenue as compared to 12.1% in the second quarter mainly due to higher R&D expenses to support our 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer development. Operating margin was 41.7%, down 0.3 percentage point from the previous quarter. 
Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 8.14 and ROE was 25.8%.  
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 6% of wafer revenue in the third quarter while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 37% and 16%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 59% of wafer revenue.  
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 6% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our third quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 33% to account for 39%. IoT increased 24% to account for 9%. Automotive decreased 24% to account for 5%. And DCE decreased 1% to account for 2%.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.55 trillion or USD 48 billion. 
On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 159 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 95 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD 59 billion in accrued liabilities and others. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 30 billion, of which TWD 10 billion from new issuance and TWD 20 billion from foreign exchange rate movement.  
On financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days increased 3 days to 35 days while days of inventory decreased 3 days to 96 days.  
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 295 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 227 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for fourth quarter '22 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 35 billion to TWD 1.31 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled $7.1 billion.  
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 18.8 billion and USD 19.6 billion, which represents a 11.1% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%.  This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our third quarter '23 and fourth quarter '23 profitability. Compared to second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 20 basis points sequentially to 54.3%, primarily due to a higher capacity utilization rate and a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by the margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology.  
Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago by 80 basis points, mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate. We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to decline by 1.8 percentage points to 52.5% at the midpoint, primarily due to the continued margin dilution from the steep ramp of our 3-nanometer technology.  
As a reminder, 6 factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership technology development and ramp-up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate. To manage our profitability in the next several years, we will work diligently on our internal cost improvement while continuing to strategically sell our value. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.  
Next, let me talk about our 2023 CapEx and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and have tightened up our capital spending throughout the year where appropriate. We now expect our 2023 CapEx to be approximately USD 32 billion. Out of the approximately $32 billion CapEx for 2023, about 70% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies; about 20% will be spent for specialty technologies; and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask-making and others.  
Our depreciation expense is now expected to increase by low 20s percentage year-over-year in 2023 as compared to our January forecast of approximately 30% year-over-year increase. 
Despite the near-term inventory cycle, our commitment to support customers' growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term structure market demand profile. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.

Wei,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of USD 17.3 billion, in line with our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the third quarter was supported by the strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology and higher demand for 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. 
Moving into fourth quarter 2023. While AI-related demand continues to be strong, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business. We expect our business in the fourth quarter to be supported by the continued strong ramp of our 3-nanometer technology, partially offset by customers' continued inventory adjustment.  
On the inventory side, we expect the fabless semiconductor inventory to have continuously reduced in the third quarter. However, due to the persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions and slow demand recovery in China, customers remain cautious in their inventory control. Thus, we expect the inventory digestion to continue in the fourth quarter. 
Having said that, we are observing some early sign of demand stabilization in the PC and smartphone end market. Together with such level of inventory control, we forecast the fabless semiconductor inventory to further reduce and exit 4Q '23 at a healthier level.  
Next, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. As we have said before, our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust, expand our future growth potential and reach for more global talents. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' need and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders.  
In Europe, after conducting extensive due diligence, we announced our plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany focusing on automotive and industrial applications. We have received a strong commitment to support this project from our JV partners; the European Commission government; and German federal state and city governments. This fab will utilize 22- and 28-nanometer and 12/16-nanometer technologies for semiconductor wafer fabrication. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in second half 2024 and production is targeted to begin in late 2027.  
In Arizona, we are receiving strong support from the city of Phoenix, State of Arizona and U.S. federal government and continue to develop positive relationship. We work closely with our local trade and union partners. We are making good progress on the fab infrastructure, utilities and equipment installation issues in our first fab and the situation is improving. We have also begun early preparation for our Arizona fab operations and hired close to 1,100 local TSMC employees so far. Many of them has been brought to Taiwan for extensive hands-on experience in our fab, so that they can further their technical skills while being immersed in TSMC operation environment and culture.  
We continue to target volume production of N4 process technology in first half 2025 and are confident that once we begin operations, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing, quality and reliability in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan.  
In Japan, we built a specialty technology fab, which will utilized 12- and 16-nanometer and 22- and 28-nanometer process technologies. We have hired approximately 800 local TSMC employees so far with the majority having similarly been brought to Taiwan for hands-on experience. Equipment moving has begun this month and volume production is on track for late 2024.  
In China, we have recently received an extension from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security to continue our operation in Nanjing. We are currently in the process of applying for validated end user authorization and expect to receive permanent authorization in the near future.  
From a cost perspective, the initial costs of overseas fabs are higher than TSMC fab in Taiwan due to, first, smaller fab scale; second, higher costs throughout the supply chain; and third, the early stage of semiconductor ecosystem overseas as compared to a matured ecosystem in Taiwan. TSMC's responsibility is to manage and minimize the cost gap to maximize the return for our shareholders. Our pricing will also remain strategic to reflect our value, which include the value of geographic flexibility.  We will also work closely with government to secure their support. 
At the same time, we are leveraging our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership, large volume, economies of scale to continuously drive our costs down. By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher cost of overseas fabs and still deliver the long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE of greater than 25%. We remain firm in our commitment to maximize the value for our shareholders.  
Now let me talk about N3 and N3E ramp-up and progress, our 3-nanometer technology, the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. N3 is already in volume production with good yield and we are seeing a strong ramp in the second half of this year, supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. We reaffirm N3 will contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023, and we expect a much higher percentage in 2024 supported by robust demand from multiple customers.  
N3E will leverage the strong foundation of N3 to further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield and provide complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3E has passed qualification and achieved performance and yield targets and will start volume production in fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to provide further enhancement of N3 technology, including N3P and N3X.  
With our strategy of continuous enhancement of our 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multi-yield demand from our customers and we are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.  
Finally, I will talk about the N2 stages. The recent surge in AI-related demand supports our already strong conviction that demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. The value of our technology platform is expanding beyond the scope of geometry shrink alone and increasing toward greater power efficiency. 
In addition, as process technology complexity increases, the lead time and engagement with customers also start much earlier. As a result, we are observing a strong level of customer interest and engagement at our N2 similar to or higher than N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and smartphone applications.  
Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced in 2025. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 will adopt nanosheet transistor structure, which has demonstrated excellent power efficiency. N2 will deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing.  
As part of N2 technology platform, we also developed N2 with backside power rail solution, which is best suited for HPC applications. We are targeting backside power rail to be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivative will further extend our technology leadership well into the future.

My first question is on the technology leadership. Given we are hearing a lot of competitive messaging from your U.S. IDM competitor/customer in the last few months, Intel seems to think that they will be getting into technology -- or process technology leadership in 2025. 
Just wanted to hear what does TSMC think of Intel's claim. And when TSMC thinks about customer engagement, do you feel you will lose a little bit of market share to Intel when it comes to the N2 or the first generation of nanosheet transistors? Or you think your very high market share in N3 will continue into N2? That's my first question.",122,2.0,6.0,0.6111111111111112,0.6

Thank you, Gokul. Please allow me to summarize your first question. So Gokul's first question is about technology leadership and competition with, I think, particularly IDM. He notes this IDM is very -- messaging about taking over process technology leadership from TSMC. And so Gokul's question is, how do we see this? Are we concerned that we will lose market share at nanosheet or N2 to this IDM given their claims of process -- regaining process technology leadership.

Wei,,Executives,8,"Well, Gokul, this is C. C. Wei. Let me answer your question with a very simple answer is that no, but what I will state a little bit long. Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows that our N3P, now I repeat again, N3P technology, demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A, my competitor's technology, but with an earlier time to market, better technology, maturity and much better cost.  
In fact, let me repeat again, our 2-nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A and will be semiconductor industry's most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025. Does that answer your question, Gokul?",120,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

That's quite clear. Could you talk -- also talk about -- my second question is, could we talk a little bit about the AI-related demand. You've seen a pretty strong demand on the data center side and you talked about AI being about 6% of revenues this year, mostly on the data center side. 
Are we starting to see more engagement on AI demand on edge devices?

So the next question is for the technology cadence. I mean, for TSMC, for revenue contribution for 5-nanometer, we start to see the meaningful revenue contribution for 5-nanometer starting in the third quarter 2020 and 3-nanometer is third quarter 2023. So the cadence, it looks like, is longer for 3 nanometers versus 5-nanometer and 7 nanometers. 
What is the technology cadence moving forward? Are we able to see a meaningful revenue contribution of 2-nanometer in 2-year time frame or 3 years' time frame? I think the technology migration cadence is an important indicator still.",96,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

Thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's second question, again, as he said, is around the technology cadence. He notes that 5-nanometer started contributing revenue in 3Q '20, but I think you're saying 3-nanometer's revenue contribution in 3Q '23. So the cadence is growing longer to kind of 3 years between 5 and 3. 
So what will be the technology cadence in the future? And thus, for 2-nanometer, when should we expect meaningful revenue as well. Is that correct, Bruce?",79,5.0,7.0,0.7777777777777778,0.7

If you ask me what is the most challenging part, I would say it's cost. I mean, that's -- you look at it today, inflation, everything, and the tool have become more and more expensive. Although we can do it on time to meet customer's requirement, our challenge right now actually, I would say, number one, cost. I want to reduce the cost so more customers can afford it.

Wei,,Executives,55,"Well, let me answer the question on automotive demand. In fact, in the past 3 years, automotive demand is very strong. And we deliver whatever they asked. And today, I think the automotive demand already entered the inventory adjustment mode in the second half of 2023. However, we still expect the automotive demand will increase again in 2024 because more and more EV, more and more functionality being added to automotive and that's what we saw.
Now talking about the N7, the 7-nanometer technology, why we have such a low utilization or the revenue decreased. It's go beyond our initial -- our original plan because of we expect the N7 to be very -- fully utilized even now, but it is not. Let me answer the question because of we suddenly have -- in 10 years, the smartphone demand dropped dramatically from about 1.4 billion units to about 1.1 billion now. So that exactly, in this time frame, the N7's utilization has been impacted and followed by one major customer who delayed their product introduction. And so that's why we have a low utilization. 
But saying that, we are confident to backfill our 7-, 6-nanometer capacity with additional wave of specialty demand from consumer, RF, connectivity and other applications and will return to a healthy level of utilization over the next several years. This is very similar to a situation that we have, 28-nanometer back in 2018 and 2019 time frame, okay? At the beginning, it was underutilized for a period of time and we worked hard to -- with our customer and then for developers some specialty technologies and then now we have to expand 28-nanometer specialty capacity.

That's the major portion. That, including the kind of speed improvement or the power consumption decrease, all those kind of things, put all together, maybe cost is also part of the consideration which we noticed about.

And so no matter what, TSMC provide industry-leading solution in both very leading technology and also very advanced packaging technology and to work with our customer for their product and have a best system performance. 
And the other one is you are asking about the SoIC, when it will become a high volume and a more substantial revenue for TSMC. It's coming. It's coming.

Krish, in the past, our leading nodes normally reach gross margins -- corporate margin in about 8 quarters.

Well, first of all, our corporate margin is higher than before. And secondly, the leading node, as I just said, is becoming more and more complex. And also, in the past few years, the inflation pressure that was not expected also contribute the higher cost in the N3. 
So it's going to be pretty challenging for future leading nodes to reach corporate margin as in before -- like before in the same time frame. 
The mature nodes. I can tell you that our mature nodes are -- the gross margins are really congregated around the corporate average in a pretty narrow band because we focus on specialty technology. It's not a commodity capacity. Yes.",154,-6.0,7.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7

But I want to really call out the reported revenue for 5-nanometer in the third quarter. It looks like you are showing some really good countercyclical strength and probably a record high. 
I want to understand the rebound in the 5-nanometer business in Q3. Is that going to be more in the following quarters? And what's behind that? And relative -- let's say, your expectation like 3 to 6 months ago when you were reducing the '23 outlook, is 5-nanometer doing better than expected? And how has the demand trended in the last 2, 3 months for 5-nanometer?",118,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

So Charles' first question is about 5-nanometer. He's asking in the very near term, he notes that he saw very strong sequential revenue increase in the third quarter so he's wondering what is driving this. And then he's asking about what is the outlook for the next 3 to 6 months for 5-nanometer specifically.",55,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Charles, I can share with you the increase in revenue, N5, in the third quarter mainly comes from 2 platforms, HPC and smartphone. HPC also includes the AI-related demand. Smartphone, basically, customers -- some customers' product seasonalities. 
Now forward-looking wise, I'm not going to share with you, but we will tell you in January what actual the next quarter N5 revenue will be the overall revenue.",67,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

The other question is about CapEx. It sounds like that you're expecting CapEx on absolute dollar might still grow going forward. I know that's a long-term comment. But I look at the near term, TSMC CapEx seems to be running at USD 7 billion per quarter in the second half '23, which kind of is at $28 billion annualized run rate. 
But if we are expecting total CapEx for '24 to grow in dollar term over '23, it seems like you're expecting CapEx ramp in 2024. Maybe that's your planning for some of the CapEx ramp in '24. Is that the right way to think about the CapEx? Is $7 billion really like the really bottom level run rate for TSMC CapEx at this point?",126,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So Charles' second question is also -- is on CapEx. Basically, he's saying given the guidance he's looking at our CapEx, it's running at about USD 7 billion run rate. So he is assuming -- or although we do not comment on '24, he's assuming if next year's CapEx dollar amount is going to increase, but if we're running at $7 billion run rate, does that imply $28 billion, how should he reconcile this.",76,-4.0,6.0,0.2777777777777778,0.6
