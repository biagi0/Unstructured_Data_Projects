We had a stellar Q4 and fiscal 2017, with records in all of our financial metrics: revenue, gross margin, operating margins and EPS. Growth was driven primarily by Datacenter tripling with the rapid adoption of AI worldwide. 
Quarterly revenue reached $2.17 billion, up 55% from a year earlier and up 8% sequentially and above our outlook of $2.1 billion. Fiscal 2017 revenue was just over $6.9 billion, up 38% and nearly $2 billion more than fiscal 2016. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year was broad-based with record revenue in each of our 4 platforms: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive. Our full year performance demonstrates the success of our GPU platform-based business model. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 57% to $1.85 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue was up 64% to $257 million.
Let's start with our Gaming platform. Q4 Gaming record -- revenue was a record $1.35 billion, rising 66% year-on-year and up 8% from Q3. Gamers continue to upgrade to our new Pascal-based GPUs. Adding to our Gaming lineup, we launched GTX 1050 class GPUs for notebooks, bringing eSports and VR capabilities to mobile at great value. The GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti were featured in more than 30 new models launched at last month's Consumer Electronics Show. 
To enhance the gaming experience, we announced G-SYNC HDR, a technology that enables displays which are brighter and more vibrant than any other gaming monitor. Our partners have launched more than 60 G-SYNC-capable monitors and laptops, enabling smooth play without screen tear or artifacts. 
eSports, too, continues to attract new gamers. Major tournaments with multimillion-dollar purses are drawing enormous audiences. This last quarter, Dota 2 held its first major tournament of the season in Boston. Tickets sold out in minutes. The price pool reached $3 million, and millions of gamers watched online. 
Moving to Professional Visualization. Quadro revenue grew 11% from a year ago to a record $225 million, driven by demand for high-end real-time rendering and mobile workstations. We recently launched a family of Pascal-based GPUs designed for mobile workstations, which leading OEMs are embracing. Earlier this week, we introduced Quadro GP100, which creates a new supercomputing workstation. This new type of workstation enables engineers, designers and artists to take advantage of new technologies of photorealism, fluid simulation and deep learning. 
Next, Datacenter. Revenue more than tripled from a year ago and was up 23% sequentially to $296 million. Growth was driven by AI, cloud service providers deploying GPU instances, high-performance computing, GRID graphics virtualization and our DGX AI supercomputing appliance. 
AI is transforming industries worldwide. The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as health care, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs. At November's SC16 Supercomputing Conference, Microsoft announced that its GPU-accelerated Microsoft cognitive toolkit is available both in Azure cloud and on-premises with our DGX-1 AI supercomputer. 
In a series of related announcements at SC16, we described our plans to join the Cancer Moonshot project in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy and several national labs to help build predictive models and guide treatment under this project. We are collaborating on a new AI framework called CANDLE, the Cancer Distributed Learning Environment. And to support this work, we unveiled our new own supercomputer, the NVIDIA DGX SATURNV, which joins together 124 DGX-1 systems. It's currently the world's 28th fastest supercomputer and the #1 system in energy efficiency. 
Our GRID graphics virtualization business doubled year-on-year, driven by strong growth in the education, automotive and energy sectors. We are excited to be hosting our eighth Annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley from May 8 to May 11. This will be the year's most important event for AI and accelerating computing. And we expect it to be our largest GTC yet, attended by thousands of application developers, scientists and academics as well as entrepreneurs and corporate executives. 
Finally, in Automotive, revenue grew to a record $128 million, up 38% year-over-year. At Jen-Hsun's CES opening keynote, we demonstrated our leadership position in self-driving vehicles. With a growing list of industry players adopting our AI car platform, we also showcased AI Co-Pilot, a technology that will recognize a driver and their preferences, monitor their alertness, understand natural spoken language and provide alerts to -- in dangerous situations. One of the highlights of CES was a demonstration of our own autonomous car, dubbed BB8. More than 500 passengers took rides in the backseat without a driver behind the wheel. 
We announced a number of new partnerships at the show, among them were collaborations with Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier; and ZF, Europe's leading supplier for the truck industry, both centered on developing AI car computers with DRIVE PX 2 technology. 
We also announced that we're working on cloud-to-car mapping collaborations with HERE focused on the U.S. and Europe and ZENRIN focused on Japan. These complement partnerships announced in Q3 with Europe's TomTom and China's Baidu. Our mapping partnerships now span all geographies. Jen-Hsun was joined on the CES stage by Audi of America's President, Scott Keogh. They announced the extension of our decade-long partnership to deliver cars with Level 4 autonomy starting in 2020, powered by DRIVE PX technology. Audi will deliver Level 3 autonomy in its A8 luxury sedan later this year through its zFAS system powered by NVIDIA. We also shared news at CES of our partnership with Mercedes-Benz to collaborate on a car that will be available by year's end. 
During the quarter, Tesla began delivering a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 platform in every new Model S and Model X to be followed by the Model 3. Tesla's cars will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. In addition, Volvo started turning over the keys to initial customers of its Drive Me program. Its XC90 SUVs equipped with DRIVE PX 2 are capable of fully autonomous operation on designated roads in Volvo's hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. 
With NVIDIA's powering the markets' only self-driving cars and partnerships with leading automakers, Tier 1 suppliers and mapping companies, we feel very confident in our position as the transportation industry moves to autonomous vehicles. 
Next, our OEM and IP business was $176 million, down 11% year-on-year. 
Now turning to the rest of the income statement for Q4. Gross margins were at record levels with GAAP gross margins at 60% and non-GAAP at 60.2%. These reflect the success of our platform approach as well as strong demand for GeForce gaming GPUs and deep learning. 
GAAP operating expenses were $570 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $498 million, up 12% from a year earlier, reflecting headcount-related costs for our AI growth initiatives as well as investments in sales and marketing. We are investing into huge market opportunities, AI, self-driving cars, cloud computing and gaming. Thus, we expect our operating expense growth rate to be in the high teens over the next several quarters. 
GAAP operating income was $733 million, and non-GAAP operating income was $809 million, both more than doubled from a year earlier. 
Our GAAP tax rate was 10% and our non-GAAP was 13%. These rates were lower than expected primarily due to a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax. GAAP EPS was $0.99. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.13. 
In fiscal year '17, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, in line with our intentions. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $1.9 billion plus or minus 2%. At the midpoint, this represents 46% growth over the prior year. We expect Datacenter to grow sequentially. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.5% and 59.7%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This guidance assumes that our licensing agreement with Intel ends at March and does not renew. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $603 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $520 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $20 million, including additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $4 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back to the operator so we can open up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let's start with the questions.",1478,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

First of all, thanks a lot. Well, the single biggest mover would have to be Datacenter. I mean, when you look back on last year and when you look forward, there's a lot of reasons why Datacenter business overall grew 3x, driven by a factor of 3. And so I would expect that to happen -- to continue. There are several elements of our Datacenter business. There's the high-performance computing part. There's the AI part. There's GRID, which is graphics virtualization. There's cloud computing, which is providing our GPU platform up in the cloud for startups and enterprises and all kinds of external customers to be able to access in the cloud; as well as a brand-new AI supercomputing appliance that we created last year for anybody who would like to engage deep learning and AI but don't have the skills or don't have the resources or don't have the desire to build their own high-performance computing cluster. And so we integrated all of that with all of the complicated software stacks into an appliance that we maintain over the cloud. We call that DGX-1. And so these pieces, AI, high-performance computing, cloud computing, GRID and DGX, all in contribution, contributed to our growth in Datacenter quite substantially. And so my sense is that as we look forward to next year, we're going to continue to see that major trend. Of course, Gaming was a very large and important factor. And my expectation is that Gaming is going to continue to do that. And then longer term, our position in self-driving cars I think is becoming more and more clear to people over time. And I expect that self-driving cars will be available on the road starting this year with the early movers and no later than 2020 for Level 4 by the majors. And you might even see some of them pull into 2019, and so those are some of the things that we're looking forward to.",330,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

So Jen-Hsun, where are we in the gaming cycle? It's been very strong the last few years. What proportion of your base do you think is a credit to Pascal? And where does that usually peak before you launch your next-generation products? And then for Colette, just inventory dollars and base picked up. If you could give us some comment on that. And then just on OpEx productivity, you did a very good job last year, but this time, you're saying OpEx will go up mid-teens.

We typically assume that we have an installed base of a couple of hundred million GeForce gamers. And we've upgraded about 2 quarters of them, as in 2 operating quarter out of 4 years. It takes about 3 or 4 years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago.

On your question on inventory, as you know, in many of our businesses, we are still carrying significant architectures and a broad list of different products for those architectures across. We feel comfortable with our level of inventory as we look forward into fiscal year '18 and our sales going forward. Your second question was regarding OpEx and comparing it to where we finished in 2017 and moving into fiscal year '18. We do have some great opportunities, large businesses, for us to go capture the overall TAMs for, and we're going to be continuing to invest in the Datacenter, specifically in AI, self-driving cars as well as gaming. And so rather than a focus on what the specific operating margin is, we're going to focus primarily to start rolling the overall TAM and capturing that TAM on the top line.",143,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

The growth was impressive and I'm wondering -- you mentioned that the hyperscale players really have embraced the products first. And I'm wondering if you could share with us, to the extent that you think that they're embracing it for their own use or to the extent that they're deploying it for services such as machine learning as a service and enterprises, are really kind of tapping into this also through the hyperscale guys.

Inside the hyperscalers, the early adopters are moving, obviously, very, very fast and -- but everybody has to follow. Everybody has to follow. Deep learning has proven to be too effective. And you guys -- everybody knows now that every hyperscaler in the world is investing very heavily in deep learning. And so my expectation is that over the next coming years, deep learning and AI would become the essential tool by which they do their computing. Now when they host it in the cloud, people on the cloud use it for a variety of applications. And one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GPU is such a great platform is because of its broad utility. And we've been working on GPU computing now for coming up on 12 years. And industry after industry, our GPU computing architecture has been embraced for high-performance computing, for data processing, for deep learning and such. And so when somebody hosted up in the cloud, for example, Amazon putting our GPUs up in the cloud, that instance has the ability to do molecular dynamics to deep learning training, to deep learning inferencing. Companies could use it for offloading their computation to startups being able to build their company and build their application and then host it for hundreds of millions of people to use. And so I think the hyperscalers are going to continue to adopt GPU both for internal consumption and cloud hosting for some time to come. And we're just in the beginning of that cycle. And that's one of the reasons why we have quite a fair amount of enthusiasm around the growth here. You mentioned enterprise. And enterprise has all woken to the power of AI, and everybody understands that they have a treasure trove of data that they would like to find a way to discover insight from. In the case of real applications that we're engaging now, you could just imagine that in the transportation industry, in car companies creating self-driving cars, one car company after another needs to take all of their road data and start to train their neural networks for their future self-driving cars. And so they use our DGX or Tesla GPUs to train the networks, which is then used to run their cars running on DRIVE PX. So that's one application example. Another application example, which is quite significant, is going to be the future of processing all of the HD maps in the world. You guys might have seen that we announced that GTC, this API SDK called MapWorks. MapWorks takes video information, video information that is recorded from a car, and reconstructs the three-dimensional terrain information from that live video. And so it has to do computer vision, 3D reconstruction, has to determine and detect where the lanes are, the signs are, the lights are and even some interesting 3D features, maybe buildings and curbs and such. And it would do that automatically, and we need to process that for the world, for the planet. And you could just imagine how much video is being recorded today and how much data is being generated and how much inferencing, computer vision and 3D reconstruction that has to be done, and our GPUs are really quite perfect for it. And so MapWorks runs on top of our GPUs, and we're working with just about every mapping company in the world today to adopt MapWorks and to do HD processing for their maps. So that's another example. Medical imaging companies all over the world have recognized the importance of deep learning and their ability to detect cancer and retinopathy, and the list of examples goes on and on. And so all the different modalities have now recognized the importance of deep learning, and you're going to start to see one medical imaging company after another. The list of examples just keeps on going. I mean, the fact of the matter is at this point, deep learning and AI has really become how future software development is going to be done for a large number of industries, and that's the enthusiasm that we're seeing around the world.",729,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

And our VRWorks SDK, which allows us to process graphics in very low latency, dealing with all of the computer vision, processing and whether it's lens warping and such, has been -- has delivered really excellent results. The early VR is really targeted at early adopters. And I think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that surprises people, that delight people by Oculus and by Valve and by Epic and by Vive, by ourselves, by the industry, has really been a good focus. And I think that we've delivered on the promise of a great experience. The thing that we have to do now is that we have to make the headsets easier to use with fewer cables. We have to make it lighter. We have to make it cheaper. And so those are all things that the industry is working on. And as the applications continue to come online, you're going to see that they're going to meet themselves and find success. I think the experience is very, very clear that VR is exciting. However, remember that we are also in the VR -- we also brought VR to computer-aided design and to professional applications. In this particular area, the cost is just simply not an issue. And in fact, many of the applications previously were power walls or caves, VR caves that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And now you could put that same experience, if not even better, on the desk of designers and creators. And so I think that you're going to find that creative use and professional use of VR is going to grow quite rapidly. And just recently, we announced a brand-new Quadro 5000, P5000 with VR, the world's first VR notebook that went to market with HP and Dell. And they're doing terrifically. And so I think -- I would think about VR in the context of both professional applications as well as consumer applications, but I think the first year was absolutely a great success.",353,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And the number of eSports gamers around the world is growing. You guys know that Overwatch is a home run. Activision Blizzard's Overwatch is raging all over Asia, and eSports fans all over the world are picking it up. And it's graphically very intensive. Without a 1050 class and above, it's simply a nonstarter. And to really enjoy it, you need at least a 1060. And so this last quarter, we launched a 1050 and a 1050 Ti all over the world, and we're seeing terrific success out of that. And my expectation going into next year is that Overwatch is going to continue to spread all over the world. It's really basically just started. It started in the West, and it's now moving into the East, where the largest eSports markets are. And so Overwatch is going to be a huge success. League of Legends is going to continue to be a huge success. And my expectation is that eSports, along with the AAA titles that are coming out this year, is going to keep PC gaming continue to grow. And so I, quite frankly, thought Q4 was pretty terrific, and we had a record quarter. We had a record year. And I don't remember the last time that a large business the size of ours and surely the size of a datacenter business grew by a factor of 3. And so I think we're in a great position going into next year.",255,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

There are different kind of categorizations and implementations of those different subsegments. So I wanted to get a sense from you how NVIDIA's end-to-end computing platform kind of dominates machine learning relative to, say, the competition.

First of all, thanks for the question. The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning. And machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI, to achieve AI. If a computer can't learn and if it can't learn continuously and adapt with the environment, there's no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence. Learning, as you know, is a foundational part of intelligence. And deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself by learning from a large quantity of data. Prior to deep learning, other techniques like expert systems and rule-based systems and hand-engineered features where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect the cat, and then they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect the car. You could imagine how difficult that is and how imperfect that is. It basically kind of works, but it doesn't work good enough, well enough to be useful. And then deep learning came along. The reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because its singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network, and it requires an enormous amount of computation. And that's why a lot of people credit the work that we've done with our programmable GPUs and our GPU computing platform and the early collaboration with deep learning AI researchers as the big bang, if you will, the catalyst that made modern AI possible. We made it possible to crunch through an enormous amount of data to train these very deep neural networks. Now the reason why deep learning has just swept the world, it started with a convolution of neural networks, but -- reinforcement networks and time sequence networks and all kinds of interesting adversarial networks. The list of types of networks, I mean, there are 100 networks being created a week. And papers are coming out -- come out of everywhere. The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust. It is incredibly useful, and this tool has, at the moment, found no boundaries of problems that it's figured out how to solve. And I think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super important. For example, if I -- if you wanted to understand the sentiment of consumers on a particular new product that you sent, whether the sentiment is exactly right so long as you understand the basic trend, you largely understand the sentiment, I think people would consider that information to be useful. However, if you're using machine learning for cancer detection, obviously, we need to have a level of precision that is quite high. And so whether it's in health care or financial services or high-performance computing and in some areas where, for example, ad-supported Internet search, small differences in accuracy could make a very large difference in the financial results for the advertiser and for the people hosting the service. And so in all of these cases, deep learning has found a great, great utility. And that's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much growth. And obviously, for self-driving cars, being kind of right is not a good idea, and we would like to be exactly right.",572,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

First of all, you know that we are a full-stack platform. The way we think about all of our platforms is from the application all the way back to the fundamental architecture in a semiconductor device. And so in the case of DRIVE PX, we created the architecture optimized for a neural net, for a sensor fusion, for high-speed processing. The semiconductor design, in the case of DRIVE PX 2, called Parker, Tegra Parker, the system software for high-speed sensor fusion and moving data all the way around the car, the better you do that, the lower cost the system will be. The neural networks on top of that, that sits on top of our deep learning SDK, called cuDNN and TensorRT, basically frameworks of AI; and then on top of that, the actual algorithms for figuring out how to use that information from perception to localization, to action planning. And so -- and then on top of that, we have an API and an SDK that is integrated into mapmakers, and we integrate it into every single map, HD map service in the world from HERE to TomTom, to ZENRIN in Japan, to Baidu in China. So this entire stack is a ton of software. But your question specifically has to do with the perception layer. And that perception layer, quite frankly, is just a small part of the self-driving car problem. And the reason for that is because in the final analysis, you want to detect lanes. You've got video coming in, you want to detect lanes. You have video coming in, you want to detect the car in front of you. And all we have to do, it's not trivial but it's also not monumental, we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars, and we train our networks to do so. And as you know very well now, the deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human-engineered computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning. And that's one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach and abandoned the traditional hand-featured computer vision approaches. And so anyways, the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars end-to-end, we realized that this is much more than computer vision; that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that's quite complex and now we've had a lot of experience doing so. And then recently at CES, we announced partnerships with Audi, which we announced that we will have Level 4 self-driving cars on the road by 2020. We announced a partnership with Daimler. We announced a partnership with ZF and Bosch, 2 of the world's top Tier 1 suppliers. We also announced partnerships with all of the mapping companies. And so if you put all that stuff together, we have the processor. We have the Tier 1 partnerships for the integration of the systems. We have all the software on top of it, the deep learning networks, the car partnerships, of course, and integrated into maps around the world. And all that entire stack, when you put them all together, should allow us to have self-driving cars on the road.",544,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

A thermostat will have inferencing on it. A bicycle lock will have inferencing on it. Cameras will have inferencing on it. And self-driving cars would have a large amount of inferencing on it; robots, vacuum cleaners, you name it, smart microphones, smart speakers, all the way into the datacenter. And so I believe that long term, there will be a trillion devices that has inferencing connected to edge computing devices near them, connected to cloud computing devices, cloud computing servers, okay. So that's basically the architecture. And so the largest inferencing platform will likely be ARM devices. I think that, that goes without saying. ARM will likely be running inferencing networks, 1-bit, XNOR, 8-bit and even some floating point. It just depends on what level of accuracy do you want to achieve, what level of perception do you want to achieve and how fast you want to perceive it. And so the inferencing market is going to be quite large. We're going to focus in markets where the inferencing precision -- the inferencing, the perception scenario and the performance by which you have to do it is mission-critical. And of course, self-driving cars is a perfect example of that. Robots, manufacturing robots, will be another example of that. In the future, you're going to see, in our GTC, if you have a chance to see that, we're working with AI City partners all over the world for end-to-end video analytics. And that requires very high throughput, a lot of computation. And so the examples go on and on all the way back into the datacenter. In the datacenter, there are several areas where inferencing is quite vital. I mentioned one earlier. Just mapping the Earth, mapping the Earth at the street level, mapping the Earth in HD and three-dimensional level for self-driving cars, that process is going to require, well, just the pilot GPUs running continuously as we continuously update the information that needs to be mapped. There is inferencing which is called offline inferencing, where you have to retrain the network after you've deployed it and you would likely retrain and recategorize, reclassify the data using the same servers that you use for training. And so even the training servers will be used for inferencing. And then lastly, all of the nodes in cloud will be inferencing nodes in the future. I've said before that I believe that every single node in the cloud datacenter will have inferencing capability and accelerated inferencing capability in the future, and I continue to believe that. And these are all opportunities for us.",464,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Let me see if I can help answer that. So you are correct in terms of how to look at that in Q1. The delta from Q4 to Q1 is we only have a partial partner recognition from the Intel, and that stops in the middle of March. So as we move forward as well going into Q2, we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2. I'm not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just gave guidance out one quarter. But keep that in mind, there's a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1, and then it depletes in Q2. If you think about our overall model, our overall business model, it has moved to higher-end value-added platforms, and that's what we're selling. So our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher volume platform that gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx. We'll see what that kind of mix looks like as we go into Q2, but just to leave you with a understanding that Intel's probably what we can do here, okay.",201,4.0,7.0,0.7222222222222222,0.7

There are several SKUs of Tesla processors. There's the Tesla processors used for high-performance computing, and it has FP64, FP32, ECC, its design and has CUDA, of course, and it has been optimized for molecular dynamics, astrophysics, quantum chemistry, flow dynamics. The list goes on and on. The vast majority of the world's high-performance supercomputing applications, imaging applications, 3D reconstruction applications has been ported onto our GPUs over the course of the last decade and some. And that's a very large part of our Tesla business. Then of course, we introduced, on top of the architecture, our deep learning stack. Our deep learning stack is -- starts with cuDNN, the numerics kernels, a lot of algorithms inside them to be optimized for numerical processing of all kinds of different precision. It's integrated into frameworks of different kinds. There are so many different frameworks from TensorRT to Caffe, to Torch and Theano, to MxNet, to CNTK, the work that we did with Microsoft, which is really excellent, scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks. And that's our deep learning stack, and that's also very important. And then the third is GRID. GRID is a completely different stack. It's the world's first graphics virtualization stack, fully integrated with the Citrix, integrated to VMware. Every single workstation and PC application has been verified, tested and has the ability to be streamed from a datacenter. And then last year, starting -- I think we announced it in -- we started shipping it in August, our DGX-1, the world's first AI supercomputer appliance which integrates a whole bunch more software of all different types and has the ability to -- we introduced our first NVIDIA Docker. It containerizes applications. It makes it possible for you to have a whole bunch of users use one DGX. They could all be running different frameworks because most environments are heterogeneous. And so that's DGX-1. And it's got an exciting pipeline ahead of it, and it's really designed for companies and workgroups who don't want to build their own supercomputer, like the hyperscalers, and aren't quite ready to move into the cloud because they have too much data to move to the cloud. And so everybody basically can easily buy a DGX-1, it's fully integrated, fully supported, and get to work on deep learning right away. And so each one of these are all part of our Datacenter business and -- but the largest, because it's been around the longest, is our Tesla business.

And with many processors, you can achieve Level 5 today. And some people are using many processors to develop their Level 5, and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their Level 4. Our next-generation -- so that's all based on the Pascal generation. That's all based on the Pascal generation. Our next generation, the processor is called Xavier. We announced that recently. Xavier basically takes 4 processors and shrink it into 1. And so we'll be able to achieve Level 4 with 1 processor. That's the easiest way to think about it. So we'll achieve Level 3 with 1 processor today. Next year, we'll achieve Level 4 with 1 processor. And with several processors, you could achieve Level 5. But I think that the number of processors is really interesting because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion, and we've got to do perception. We have to do localization. We have to do driving. There's a lot of functional safety aspects to it, fail-over functionality. There are all kinds of black box recorders, all kinds of different functionality that goes into the processor, and I think it's really quite interesting. But in the final analysis, what's really, really hard -- and this is one of the reasons why our positioning in the autonomous driving market is becoming more and more clear, is that in the final analysis, it's really a software problem. And it's an end-to-end software problem. It goes all the way from processing in the perception processing in a car to AI processing, to helping you drive, connected to HD clouds for HD map processing all over the world. And so this end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking. I just don't -- I don't know where anybody else is currently doing that with the exception of 1 or 2 companies, and so I think that that's really where the great complexity is. We have the ability to see and to optimize across the entire range. Now the other thing that we announced at CES that's worth mentioning is that we believe in the future Level 4 means that you will have autopilot capability, hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios. However, it's unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve Level 4. It's just not practical for some time. However, during those circumstances, we believe that the car should still have an AI, that the car should be monitoring what's happening outside and it should be monitoring the driver. And when it's not driving for you, it's looking out for you. And we call that the AI Co-Pilot. Whereas AI autopilot achieves Level 4 driving, AI Co-Pilot looks out for you in the event that it doesn't have the confidence to drive on your behalf. And so I believe that that's a really big breakthrough, and we're just seeing an incredible excitement about it around the industry because I think it just makes a lot of sense. And the combination of the 2 systems allows us to achieve -- build a better car.",549,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

I think first of all, the gaming -- the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected, a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago, and that's basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport. And not only is it a sport, it's a social sport. And in order to play some of these modern eSports games, it's a 5 on 5. And so you kind of need 4 other friends. And so as a result, you -- in order to enjoy, to be part of this phenomenon that's sweeping the world, that -- it's rather sticky. And that's one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard is doing so well. That's one of the reasons why Tencent's doing so well. These 2 companies have benefited from -- tremendously from the eSports dynamic, and we're seeing it all over the world. And although it's free to play for some people, of course, you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it. And that's one of the reasons why you need GeForce in your PC so that you can enjoy eSports. When it's also a sport, you -- nobody likes to lose. And surely, nobody likes to blame their equipment when they do lose. And so having GeForce allows -- gives you confidence, and it gives you an edge. And for a lot of gamers, it's just a world standard. And so I think that number one, eSports is one of the reasons why Gaming continues to grow. And I think at this point, it's fair to say that even though it's now the second most watched spectator sport on the planet behind Super Bowl, it is also the second-highest paid winning sport behind football. It is -- it will soon be the largest sport in the world. And I can't imagine too many young people, long term, not coming into the sports somehow and -- as this sport continues to expand in genres. And so that's one of the core reasons. Now aside for -- you asked a question about GeForce NOW, which I really appreciate. The simple way to think about that is this: There are many computers in the world that simply don't have the ability to enjoy video games, whether it's extremely thin and light notebooks. In our Apple Macs, Chromebooks, the integrated graphics that don't have very good -- very good capabilities, I think that it's -- the reasonable thing to do is to put the technology in the cloud. And it took us some 5 years to make this possible, to put the technology in the cloud and stream the video game experience with very low latency to the computer, like Netflix does. And so we're basically turning the PC into a virtualized gaming experience and putting that in the cloud. And so I don't know exactly how big it's going to be yet, but our aspiration is that we would reach the parts of the markets where they're casual or they just want to have another way, another device where they can game, or somebody would like to come into the gaming world and isn't quite ready to invest the time in building a computer or buying into a GeForce PC yet. So I'm anxious to learn from it. And when I learn more about GeForce NOW, I'll be more than happy to share it.",577,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

We had a record year, a record quarter, and most importantly, we're at the beginning of the AI computing revolution. This is a new form of computing, new way of computing where parallel data processing is vital to success, and GPU computing that we've been nurturing for the last decade and some is really the perfect computing approach. 
We're seeing tremendous growth and exciting growth in the datacenter market. Datacenter now represents a -- had grew at 3x over -- year-over-year, and it's on its way to become a very significant business for us. Gaming is a significant business for us. And longer term, self-driving cars is going to be a really exciting growth opportunity. 
The thing that has really changed our company, what really defines how our company goes to market today is really the platform approach that instead of just building a chip that is industry standard, we created software stacks on top of it to serve vertical markets that, we believe, will be exciting long term that we can serve.

We had a strong start to the year, highlighting our record first quarter with a near tripling of Datacenter revenue, reflecting surging interest in artificial intelligence. Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94 billion, up 48% from a year earlier, down 11% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.9 billion. Growth remained broad-based with year-on-year gains in each of our 4 platforms: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive.
From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from the year earlier and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million. And we recognized the remaining $43 million in revenue from our Intel agreement.
Let's start with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue in the first quarter was $1.03 billion, up 49% year-on-year. Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs, including gaming notebooks. Our Tegra gaming platforms also did extremely well. Demand remained healthy for our enthusiast class, GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, introduced nearly a year ago. It was complemented this past quarter with GTX 1080 Ti, which runs 35% faster and was launched at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. GTX 1080 Ti is designed to handle the demand of 4K gaming and high-end VR experiences. Typical of many supportive reviews, Ars Technica, stated, ""It is undoubtedly a fantastic piece of engineering, cool, quiet and without rival. Those that demand the absolute very best in cutting-edge graphics need look no further.""
We also released the next generation of our Titan class product, the TITAN Xp, designed for enthusiasts and researchers who demand extreme performance. Gaming continues to be driven by the headlong growth in eSports. The newest title, Overwatch, added 30 million gamers in its first year. GeForce was the graphics platform of choice at all of the top eSports tournaments, including the finals of the big 4 international competitions.
With apologies to the start of the baseball season, eSports is now as popular among U.S. male millennials as America's favorite pastime. More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix, ESPN and Hulu combined. GeForce sales remained underpinned by the steady stream of AAA titles coming onto market, which continue to push for more GPU performance. 
In the months ahead, we'll see a series of highly anticipated blockbuster titles. Among them are Destiny 2, coming to the PC for the first time, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, Shadow of War and the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise, World War II. We are excited to be working with Nintendo on its acclaimed Switch gaming system. Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform.
Moving to Professional Visualization. Quadro revenue grew to $205 million, up 8% from a year ago, amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstation. We're seeing significant increase in professional VR solutions driven by Quadro P6000 GPUs. Lockheed Martin is deploying Quadro to create realistic VR walk-throughs of the U.S. Navy's most advanced ships. The Marines utilize VR to train aircrew personnel. And IKEA is rolling out VR to many of its stores, helping consumers configure their kitchens from a huge array of options, which they can visualize in sharp detail.
Next, Datacenter. Record revenue of $409 million was nearly triple that of a year ago. The 38% rise from Q4 marked its seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Driving growth was demand from cloud service providers and enterprises building training clusters for web services plus strong gains in high-performance computing, GRID graphics visualization and our DGX-1 AI supercomputer. AI has quickly emerged as the single most powerful force in technology. And at the center of AI are NVIDIA GPUs.
All of the world's major Internet and cloud service providers now use NVIDIA Tesla-based GPU accelerators: AWS, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft as well as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. We also announced that Microsoft is bringing NVIDIA Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs to its Azure cloud. Organizations are increasingly building out AI-enabled applications using training clusters, evident in part by growing demand for DGX-1. We are seeing a number of significant deals. Among them are Fujitsu's installment of 24 systems integrated into an AI supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan's largest research center, as well as new supercomputers at Oxford University, GE and Audi.
Working with Facebook, we announced the launch of the Caffe2 deep learning framework as well as Big Basin servers with Tesla P100 GPUs. To help meet huge demand for expertise in the field of AI, we announced earlier today plans to train 100 people this year through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, representing a 10x increase from last year. Through on-site training, public events and online courses, DLI provides practical training on the tools of AI to developers, data scientists and researchers.
Our HPC business doubled year-on-year, driven by the adoption of Pascal GPUs into supercomputing centers worldwide. The use of AI and accelerated computing in HPC is driving additional demand in governance intelligence, higher education research and finance.
Our GRID graphic virtualization business more than tripled, driven by growth in business services, education and automotive. Intuit's latest TurboTax release deploys GRID to connect tax filers seeking real-time advice with CPAs. And Honda is using GRID to bring together engineering and design teams based in different countries.
Finally, Automotive. Revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules. We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problem of autonomous driving. Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just 1 year ago, more than 225 car and truck makers, suppliers, research organizations and start-ups have begun developing with it. That number has grown by more than 50% in the past quarter alone, the result of the platform's enhanced processing power and the introduction of TensorRT for the in-vehicle AI inferencing.
This quarter, we announced 2 important partnerships: Bosch, world's largest auto supplier, which does business all over the world, carmakers is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform; and Paccar, one of the world's largest truck makers, is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF. 
We continue to view AI as the only solution for autonomous driving. The nearly infinite range of road conditions, traffic patterns and unexpected events are impossible to anticipate with hand-coded software or computer vision alone. We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018.
Now turning to the rest of Q1 income statement. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6%, respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $596 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiatives. GAAP operating income was $554 million and non-GAAP operating income was $637 million, nearly doubling from a year ago. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $507 million, non-GAAP net income was $533 million, more than doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strengths as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion.
For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In Q1, we issued $82 million in quarterly cash dividends.
Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $1.95 billion plus or minus 2%. Excluding the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement, total revenue is expected to grow 3% sequentially. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.4%, 58.6%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. These reflect approximately a 100 basis points impact from the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $8 million, inclusive of additional charges from early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $3 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items.
Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website.
Finally, this week, we are sponsoring our annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley. Reflecting the surging importance of accelerating computing, GTC has grown to more than 7,000 attendees from 60 countries, up from 1,000 when we started 8 years ago. Among its highlights, Jen-Hsun will deliver a news-filled keynote tomorrow morning. We have 550-plus talks, more than half on AI. Developers will have access to 70 labs and workshops to learn about deep learning and GPU computing. And we will award a total of $1.5 million to the 6 most promising companies, among the 1,300 in our Inception Program for AI start-ups. We will be hosting our Annual Investor Day tomorrow and hope to see many of you there.

And I'm hoping that you can maybe drill down on the drivers here. I guess on the cloud side, we think of 2 different areas, GPU as a service versus the cloud company's own AI effort. And I'm hoping you could help us understand to the extent where the demand is falling into either one of those buckets. And then on the enterprise side, I think there's a view out there that the enterprise is just -- is going to the cloud. So to hear you talk about training clusters for web services is very interesting. And I was hoping you could provide some more color on that demand driver.",119,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

So our GPU computing business for Datacenter is growing very fast and it's growing on multiple dimensions. On the one hand, there's high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods. We call that HPC. That's growing. There is, in enterprise, the virtualization of graphics. There's a whole lot of desktop PCs running around. However, more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows. And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center. It's easier to manage. The total cost of ownership is lower, and mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be. And so the second pillar of that is called GRID and it's basically virtualizing the PC. And as you can tell, virtualization, mobility, better security, those are all driving forces there. And then there's the Internet companies. And the Internet companies, as you mentioned, really has 2 pillars. There's the Internet service provision part where they're using deep learning for their own applications, whether it's photo tagging or product recommendation or recommending a restaurant or something you should buy or personalizing your webpage, helping you with search, provisioning up the right apps, the right advertisement, language translation, speech recognition, so on and so forth. I mean, there's a whole bunch of amazing applications that are made possible by deep learning. And so Internet service providers are using it for internal application development. And then lastly, what you mentioned is cloud service providers. And basically, because of the adoption of GPUs and because of the success of CUDA and so many applications are now able to be accelerated on GPUs, so that we can extend the capabilities in Moore's Law so that we can continue to have the benefits of computing acceleration, which in the cloud means reducing cost. And that's on the serve -- cloud service provider side of the Internet companies. So that would be Amazon Web Services, the Google Compute cloud, Microsoft Azure, the IBM Cloud, Alibaba's Aliyun...

by Microsoft Azure. We're starting to see almost every single cloud service around the world standardizing on the NVIDIA architecture. So we're seeing a lot of growth there as well.

On the Gaming side, what we have observed over time is that when you launch a new platform, it definitely creates demand and you see 12 months of very good visibility and into growth. And I wonder -- I was wondering, as you see the Datacenter numbers come in quarter after quarter here, to what extent do you think the Datacenter demand that you're seeing is -- I know it's probably only -- you're only able to answer qualitatively. But to what extent do you think the Datacenter is secondary versus you have a new platform and there's just kind of a platform-driven demand?",111,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

The eSports is growing. The number of players in eSports, the number of people who are enjoying eSports is growing. Mobile is growing. I think it's amazing. It's amazing, the growth of mobile and the latest games. And of course, the first-party titles, the AAA titles are doing great work. Battlefield is doing great and I'm looking forward to the new Battlefield. I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars and I'm looking forward to the first time that Destiny is coming to the PC. As you know, it was a super hit on console. But the first-generation Destiny wasn't available on PCs and Destiny 2 is coming to the PC. So I think the anticipation is pretty great. So I would say that PC gaming continues to grow and it's hard to imagine people...

First of all, it's really important to understand that the data centers, the cloud service providers, the Internet companies, they all get kind of lumped together in one conversation. But obviously, the way they use computers are very different. There are 3 major pillars of computing up in the cloud -- or in large data centers. Hyperscale. The one pillar is just internal use of computing systems for developing, for training, for advancing artificial intelligence. That's a high-performance computing problem. It's a very complicated software problem. The algorithms are changing all the time. They're incredibly complicated. The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial, and that's why they're in such great demand. And it's also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them, so that they can be productive. Having a scarce AI researcher waiting around for a computer to finish simulation or training is really quite unacceptable. And so that one -- that first pillar is the market that we -- is a segment of the...

or gets strained, once the network is trained, it is put into production. Like for example, your Alexa speakers has a little tiny network inside. And so obviously, you can do inferencing on Alexa.

So anyways, I -- the second pillar is inferencing. And inferencing, inferencing as it turns out, is far, far less complicated than training. It's 1 trillion times less complicated, 1 billion times -- 1 trillion times less complicated. And so once the network is trained, it can be deployed. And there are thousands of networks that are going to be running inside these hyperscale data centers, thousands of different networks, not one, thousands of different types. And they're detecting all kinds of different kinds of things. They're inferring all kinds of different things, classifying, predicting, all kinds of different things, whether it's photo or voice or videos or searchers or whatnot. And in that particular case, our advantage -- in that particular case, the current incumbent is CPUs. The CPU is really the only processor at the moment that has the ability to basically run every single network. And I think that's a real opportunity for us. And it's a growth opportunity for us. And one would suggest that FPGA is as well. One would suggest that ASICs like TPUs -- TPUs and ASIC is as well. And I would urge you to come to the keynote tomorrow and maybe I'll say a few words about that tomorrow as well. And then the last pillar is cloud service providers, and that's basically the outward public cloud provisioning a computing approach. It's not about provisioning inferencing. It's not about provisioning GPUs. It's really provisioning a computing platform. And that's one of the reasons why the NVIDIA CUDA platform and all of our software stacks that we've created over time, whether it's for deep learning or molecular dynamics or all kinds of high-performance computing codes or linear algebra or computer graphics, all of our different software stacks make our cloud computing platform valuable. And that's why it's become the industry standard for GPU computing. And so those are 3 different pillars of hyperscalers, and it's just important to segment them so that we don't get confused.",351,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

And as my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, there is a perception that your gaming business has been driven a lot more by pricing and adoption of more premium products, and hence, there could be some kind of ceiling to how much gamers are willing to pay for these products. Could you address that? Are you seeing the number of gamers and the number of cards grow? And how long can they continue to reach for more premium product?",81,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

That's the way to think about it. That's the simple math. People are willing to spend $200, $300, $400, $500 for a new game console. And the NVIDIA GeForce GPU, the PC gaming card is, on average, far less. There are people who just absolutely demand the best. And the reason for that is because they're driving a monitor or they're driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond the TV. And so if you have a 4K or you want to run 120 hertz, or some people are even driving at the 2 and 4 -- 200 hertz, those kind of displays demand a lot more horsepower to drive than an average television, whether it's 1080p or 4K, at 60 frames per second or 30 frames per second. And so the amount of horsepower they need is great. But that's just because they just really love their rig and they're surrounded in it and they just want the best. But the way to think about that is ultimately, that's the opportunity for us. I think GeForce is a game console, and the right way to think about that is at an equivalent ASP of some $200, $300, that's probably potentially the opportunity ahead for GeForce.",223,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

And it's sold all over the world and it's a consumer product. It's a product that I -- that is sold both into our installed base as well as growing our installed base. When we think about GeForce, they're -- these are the parameters involved. How much of our installed base has upgraded to Pascal? How much of our installed base is growing? How is Gaming growing overall? How is -- what are the driving dynamics of Gaming, whether it's eSports or mobile or using games for artistic expression? It's related to the AAA titles that are coming out. Some years, the games are just incredible. Some years, the games are less incredible. These days, the production quality of the games have just become systematically so good that we've had years now of blockbuster hits. So these are really good dimensions of it. And then there is -- it's overlaid on top of it with some seasonality because people do buy graphics cards and game consoles for Christmas and the holidays and there are international holidays where people are given money as gifts and they save up the money for a new game console or a new game platform. And so in a lot of ways, our business is driven by games. So it's not unlike the characteristics of the rest of the gaming industry.",237,6.0,4.0,0.8333333333333334,0.4

Let me think here. I think 1 year ago, 1 year ago was -- maybe it was 2 years ago, maybe it's somewhere between 18 months ago or so when I think Jeff Dean gave a talk where he said that Google was using a lot of GPUs for deep learning. I think it wasn't much longer ago than that. And really, really, that was the only public customer that we had in the hyperscale data center. Fast forward a couple of years, we now have basically everybody. Every hyperscaler in the world is using NVIDIA for either deep learning, for some announcements that you'll read about in data center deployment, tomorrow hopefully, and then a lot of them have now standardized on provisioning the NVIDIA architecture in the cloud. And so I guess in the course of 1 or 2 years, we went from basically hyperscale being an insignificant part of our overall business to quite a large part of our business, and as you could see also, the fastest-growing part of the business.",177,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

GeForce NOW is a really -- it's really an exciting platform. It virtualizes GeForce. It puts it in the cloud, turns it into a gaming PC as a service -- that can be streamed as a service. And we are -- I said at GTC that around this time, that we'll likely open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta for some time. And we'll shortly go to external beta. And last time I checked, there's many, many, tens of thousands of people who are signed up for external beta trials. And so I'm looking forward to letting people try it. But the important thing to realize about that is I -- that's still years away from really becoming a major gaming service. And that's -- it's still years away from being able to find the right balance between cost and quality of service and the pervasiveness of virtualizing a gaming PC. So we've been working on it for several years and these things take a while. My personal experience is almost every great thing takes about a decade.

It's a business to them. And we're selected to work on these consoles. And if it makes sense and the strategic alignment is great and we're in a position to be able to do it -- because the opportunity cost of building a game console is quite high. The number of engineers who knows how to build computing platforms like this -- and in the case of the Nintendo Switch, I mean, it's just an incredible console that fits in such a small, small form factor. And it could both be a mobile computing -- mobile gaming device as well as a console gaming device. It's just really quite amazing. And they just did an amazing job. Somebody asked me a few months ago before it was launched how I thought it was going to do. And of course, without saying anything about it, I said that it delighted me in a way that no game console has done in the last 10, 15 years. And it's true. I mean, this is a really, really innovative product and really quite a genius. And if you ever have a chance to get it in your hands, it's just really, really delightful. And so in that case -- in that case, the opportunity to work on it was just really, really too enticing. We really wanted to do it. And -- but it always requires deep strategic thought because it took several hundred engineers to work on. And they could be working on something else like all of the major initiatives we have. And so we have to be mindful about the strategic opportunity cost that goes along with these. But in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just a home run. I'm so glad I did it.

And it's this. I think Colette mentioned that there were 225 car and truck development engagements that were underway, up 50% in the last quarter.

Not -- the second one is the revenue contribution is not significant at the time, at this moment. But I expect it to be high. And that's why we're working on it. The 200 developers who are working on the DRIVE PX platform are doing it in a lot of different ways. And at the core, it's because in the future, every aspect of transportation will be autonomous. And if you think through what's going on in the world and one of the most important -- one of the most powerful effects that's happening right now is the Amazon effect. We're grabbing our phone. We're buying something and then we expect it to be delivered to us tomorrow. Well, in -- when you sent up that -- those set of electronic instruction, the next thing that has to happen is a whole bunch of trucks has to move around. And they have to go from trucks to maybe smaller trucks and from smaller trucks to maybe a small van that ultimate delivers it to your house. And so if you will, transportation is the physical Internet, is the atomic Internet, the molecular Internet of society. And without it, everything that we're experiencing today would be able to continue to scale. And so you could imagine everything from autonomous trucks to autonomous cars, surely, and autonomous shuttles and vans and motorcycles and small piece of delivery robots and drones and things like that. And for a long time, it's going to augment truck drivers and delivery professionals who, quite frankly, we just don't have enough of. The world is just growing too fast in an instant delivery, delivered to your home, delivered to you right now phenomenon. And we just don't have enough delivery professionals. And so I think autonomous capability is going to make it possible for us to take pressure off of that system and reduce the amount of accidents and make it possible for that entire infrastructure to be a lot more productive. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing so much enthusiasm. It's not just the branded cars. I think the branded cars get a lot of attention and we are excited about our partnerships there. And gosh, I love driving autonomous cars. But in the final analysis, I think the way to think about the autonomous future is every aspect of mobility and transportation and delivery will be -- will have autonomous -- will be augmented by AI.",421,7.0,5.0,0.8888888888888888,0.5

Given your very unique position in helping to nurture AI for the last many years and your deep insights into the way the customers are adopting it, as investors try and understand the sustainability of recent growth, can you help us understand where you believe AI adoption is overall? And since Colette threw out a baseball comment earlier, if we thought about AI adoption in reference to a 9-inning game, where are we in that 9-inning game?",108,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

There's a -- it's a great question and there's a couple of ways to come at it. First of all, AI is going to infuse all of software. AI is going to eat software. Whereas Mark said that software is going to eat the world, AI is going to eat software. And it's going to be in every aspect of software. Every single software developer has to learn deep learning. Every single software developer has to apply machine learning. Every software developer will have to learn AI. Every single company will use AI. AI is the automation of automation. And it's -- will likely be the transmission. We're going to, for the first time, see the transmission of automation, the way we're seeing the transmission and the wireless broadcast of information for the very first time. And I'm going to be able to send you automation, send you a little automation by e-mail. And so the ability for AI to transform industry is well understood now. It's really about automation of everything. And the implications of it is quite large. We've been using now deep learning. We've been in the area of deep learning for about 6 years. And the rest of the world has been focused on deep learning for about somewhere between 1 to 2. And some of them are just learning about it. And almost no companies today use AI in a large way. So on the one hand, we know now that the technology is of extreme value. And we under -- we're getting a better understanding of how to apply it. On the other hand, no industry uses it at the moment. The automotive industry is in the process of being revolutionized because of it. The manufacturing industry will be. Everything in transport will be. Retail, Etail everything will be. And so I think the impact is going to be large and we just -- we're just getting started. We're just getting started. Now that's kind of a first inning thing. The only trouble with the baseball analogy is that in the world of tech, things don't -- every inning is not the same. In the beginning, the first inning feels like -- it feels pretty casual and people are enjoying peanuts. The second inning, for some reason, is shorter. And the third inning is shorter than that and the fourth inning is shorter than that. And the reason for is because of exponential growth. Speed is accelerating. And so from the bystander who are on the outside looking in, by the time third inning comes along, it's going to feel like people are traveling at the speed of light next to you. Now if you happen to be on one of the photons, you're going to be okay. But if you're not on the deep learning train in a couple of 2, 3 innings, it's gone. And so that's kind of the challenge of that analogy because things aren't moving in linear time. Things are moving in exponential time.",509,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

I think there's a couple of ways to think about it. First of all, we know that this is the -- we know that some -- the world causes the end of Moore's Law, but it's really the end of 2 dynamics that has happened. And one dynamic, of course, is the end of processor architecture productive innovation, okay, end of instruction-level parallelism advances. The second is the end of Dennard scaling. And the combination of those 2 things makes it look like it's the end of Moore's Law. The easy way to think about that is -- the easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely -- if we want to advance computing performance, we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone. That's one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors. We want the best transistors. There's no question about it. But we don't need it to advance. And the reason for that is because we advance computing on such a multitude of levels all the way from architecture, this architecture we call GPU accelerate computing, to the software stacks on top, to the algorithms on top, to the applications that we work with. We tune it across the top, from the top to bottom, all the way from bottom to top. And so as a result, transistors is just one of the 10 things that we use. And like I said, it's really, really important to us and I want the best. And TSMC provides us the absolute best that we can get. And we push along with them as hard as we can.

Thanks a lot, Joe. You answered it right there. It's both of those. It's both of those. On the first -- the first thing is that we have to develop platforms that are useful per industry. And so we have a team working with the health care industry. We have a team that's working with the Internet service providers. We have a team that's working with the manufacturing industry. We have a team that's working with the financial services industry. We have a team that's working with media and entertainment and with enterprise, so -- with the automotive industry. And so we have different verticals. We call them verticals and we have teams of business development people, developer relations, computational mathematicians that works with each one of the industries to optimize their software for our GPU computing platform. And so it starts with developing a platform stack. Of course, one of the most famous examples of that is our Gaming business. It's just another vertical for us. And it starts with GameWorks that runs on top of GeForce and then it has its own ecosystem of partners. And so that's for each one of the verticals and each one of the ecosystems. And then the second thing that we do is we have, horizontally, partner management teams that work with our partners, the OEM partners and the go-to-market partners so that we could help them succeed. And then, of course, we rely a great deal on the extended sales force of our partners so they could help to evangelize our computing platform all over the world. And so there's this mixed approach between dedicated vertical market, business development teams as well as a partnership approach to partnering with our OEM partners that has really made our business scale so fast.",304,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Supercomputing to us is a collection of -- not a collection but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world. And some of the famous ones, whether it's Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC, you've got TiTech in Japan, there are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputer centers or open science. And so we consider those supercomputing centers. High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to, well, to simulate something. It could be scenarios for predicting equity, or, for example, as you guys know, Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing center -- or high-performance computing centers. The energy industry, Schlumberger, for example, is a great partner of ours and they have a massive, massive high-performance computing infrastructure. And Procter & Gamble uses high-performance computers to simulate their products. And so I think last year, McDonald's was at GTC and I hope they come this year as well. And so I think high-performance computing, another way of thinking about it is that more and more people really have to use simulation approaches for product discovery and product design and product simulation and stuff to stress the products beyond what is possible in a physical way so that they understand the tolerance of the products to make sure they are as reliable as possible.",242,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

It's just not right. It's not correct. And so in business, who cares about being fair? And so I wasn't looking for fair. I was just looking for right. And so the data has to be correct. It turns out -- and I said earlier that our hyperscale businesses have 3 different pillars. There's training, which our GPUs are quite good at. There's cloud service provision, which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have been -- that has adopted CUDA over the years. And then there's inferencing. And inferencing is a 0 opportunity for us, a 0 business for us at the moment. I mean, we do 0% of our business in inferencing and it's 100% on CPUs. And in the case of Google, they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC. And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs. And so I published a blog. I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons and you could look that up. But the way to think about that is our Pascal is probably approximately twice the performance of the TPU, the first generation TPU. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to drive the performance of inferencing. This is something that's still kind of new for us. And tomorrow, I'm probably going to say a few words about inferencing and maybe introduce a few ideas. But inferencing is new to us. It's -- there are 10 million CPUs in the world in a cloud, and today, many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that. But in the future, the belief is that the vast majority of the world's cloud queries will be inference queries, will be AI queries. Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes. And I think that's our opportunity. We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world and it's up to us to prove it. At the moment, I think it's safe to say that the P40, the Tesla P40, is the fastest on the planet, period. And then from here on forward, it's incumbent upon us to continue to lean into that and do a better, better job.",407,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7

It's called GeForce NOW and I announced it at CES. And I said that right around this time of the year, we're going to open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta and closed beta for some time. And so we're looking forward to opening up the external beta. My expectation is that it's going to be some time as we scale that out. It's going to take several years. I don't think it's something that's going to be an overnight success. And as you know, overnight successes don't happen overnight. However, I'm optimistic about the opportunity to extend the GeForce platform beyond the gamers that we currently have in our installed base. There are several billion gamers on the planet and I believe that every human will be a gamer someday. And every human will have some way to enjoy an alternative universe some way, someday. And we would love to be the company that brings it to everybody. And the only way to really do that on a very, very large-scale basis and reach all those people is over the cloud. And so I think our PC gaming business is going to continue to be quite vibrant. It's going to continue to advance. And then hopefully, we can overlay our cloud reach on top of that over time.
Well, thanks for all the questions today. I really appreciate it. We had another record quarter. We saw growth across our 4 market platforms. AI is expanding. Datacenter nearly tripled. Large ISP, CSP deployments everywhere. PC gaming is still growing; eSports, AAA gaming titles, fueling our growth there. And we have great games on the horizon. Autonomous vehicles, becoming imperative on all sectors of transportation, as we talked about earlier. We have a great position with our DRIVE AI computing platform. And as Moore's Law continues to slow, GPU accelerated computing is becoming more important than ever and NVIDIA is at the center of that. 
Don't miss tomorrow's GTC keynote. We'll have exciting news to share, next-generation AI, self-driving cars, exciting partnerships and more. Thanks, everybody.",363,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

NVIDIA continues to fire on all cylinders. We achieved strong revenue in each of our businesses. Data center revenue grew more than 2.5x, reflecting momentum behind artificial intelligence as we expanded our product portfolio and began shipping our new Volta platform. Overall, quarterly revenue reached a record $2.23 billion, up 56% from a year earlier, up 15% sequentially and well above our outlook of $1.95 billion. 
From a reporting segment perspective, Q2 GPU revenue increased 59% to $1.9 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue doubled to $333 million. OEM revenue reached $251 million, reflecting sales of our cryptocurrency-specific GPUs, partially offset by the lapse in our licensing agreement with Intel. 
Let's start with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue was $1.19 billion, up 52% year-on-year and up 15% from Q1. This reflects the vibrant Gaming ecosystem underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launched GPUs and other technologies, great games and growing interest in eSports. 
Gamers continue to love our Pascal-based GPUs, with demand remaining strong for GeForce GTX 10 Series products. Our new Max-Q design approach enabling Gaming notebooks that are thinner, lighter and faster is finding a strong market. Max-Q is being utilized in more than 20 new notebook models from a wide range of OEMs. Quality games continue to drive GPU sales. 
At the E3 Gaming expo in L.A., we showed the eagerly anticipated Destiny 2 running on 4K on PCs, which drew rave reviews. Major fall titles in addition to Destiny 2 include the new Call of Duty, World War II, Star Wars: Battlefront 2 and Middle-earth: Shadow of War. We're also seeing the rise of independent titles that will become runaway hits, most notably, a new last-man-standing shooter called PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.
Gaming also continues to be driven by the surging popularity of eSports. This week's biggest sporting event isn't playing out at Dodger Stadium or Wrigley Field; it's in Seattle at the International Dota 2 Championships. The $24 million in prize money is more than twice the purse of golf's richest event, the US Open. For the third straight year, GeForce GTX is Dota 2's official graphics platform. 
GPU sales were lifted by demand from increasingly mining activity, or
Ethereum. We served a large portion of this specialized market with a dedicated board, as seen in our OEM sales, and some with GeForce GTX boards. Our strategy is to stay alert to this fast-changing market, knowing that GPUs are highly efficient at running the algorithms used to mine cryptocurrencies. 
Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue grew $235 million, up 10% from a year ago, up 15% sequentially and a demand for high-end, real-time rendering and for more powerful mobile workstations. Demand was especially strong in education, both among universities and large public school districts, as well as in the financial sector and defense industry. And last week, at SIGGRAPH's computer graphics show, we highlighted how AI will augment the process of content creation. This new Optix 5 SDK uses AI to accelerate ray tracing. When running on our DGX rendering appliance, it provides the rendering capability of 150 standard dual-CPU servers. 
We also introduced NVIDIA eGPU system solutions. This creates a new category for our platforms using an external chassis to expand access to TITAN Xp and Quadro GPUs for the 25 million content creators using standard notebook PCs. 
Next, Datacenter. Revenue of $416 million was up more than 2.5x from a year ago. This growth, shared across AI, deep learning, high-performance computing and GRID, is particularly notable given that we announced and shipped production units of our Volta-based V100 accelerator as we transition from Pascal-generation GPUs. 
Looking ahead, we see inferencing and video transcoding as emerging applications that are well suited for our GPUs. V100 was among the most important launches at this quarter's GPU Technology Conference. It provides 10x the deep learning power of its year-old predecessor, widely outpacing Moore's Law. Some of the early V100 production units were given out in recent weeks to leading AI researchers attending the [ CBPR ] and ICML conferences. 
We made available our TensorRT 3 inference optimizer and run time for deep learning applications. It delivers 100x faster inferencing on V100 than the best CPU implementation. And it supports the industry's 2 most common AI frameworks: Google TensorFlow and Facebook's Caffe. 
We also entered into a wide range of important partnerships based on AI. Among them, Baidu has aligned with us on Volta. It's bringing this new architecture to its cloud and optimizing the PaddlePaddle open-source deep learning framework for Volta. 
Volkswagen is collaborating with us to bring the power of AI across their organization, and we announced a new partner program with Taiwan's top ODMs including Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, Wistron to provide them with the early access to the HGX reference architecture, GPU computing technology and design guidelines. 
Demand remains strong for our DGX AI supercomputer as organizations take on multiple systems to build out AI-enabled applications. Facebook disclosed a system incorporating 128 DGXs. We have shipped systems to more than 300 unique customers, with 1,000 plus in the pipeline. 
Our HTC business remained strong. The new Green500 list showed that the world's 13 most efficient supercomputers run on NVIDIA Tesla P100 accelerators. The top position is held by the Tokyo Institute of Technology's TSUBAME 3.0 system. It achieved an extraordinary 14.1 gigaflops per watt, 50% higher efficiency than the previous leader, helping to point the way to [ exascale ] supercomputing. 
Momentum continued in our GRID graphics virtualization business. Among key wins was Amazon Web Services whose G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs. 
In automotive. Revenue grew to $142 million, up 19% year-over-year. We announced important new partnerships based on our DRIVE PX AI platform, which is being used by more than 225 car and truck makers, Tier 1 suppliers, HD-mapping companies, start-ups and research institutions. Additionally, production cars using our technology continue to make their way into the market. 
Audi announced last month that the 2019 A8 will be the first car to feature NVIDIA's powered Level 3 autonomous technology. This means that, under certain specific use cases, it will be able to be driven by its own software without monitoring from the driver. 
Our DRIVE PX platform is already on the road in Tesla Motors' full line of cars, including the new Model 3, which uses the second-generation Tesla autopilot. 
This quarter, we also announced that Toyota selected NVIDIA DRIVE PX for their next-generation autonomous cars. 
Volvo, long a byword for safety and value, and Autoliv selected DRIVE PX for self-driving cars targeted to hit the market by 2021. ZF and Hella have selected the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform for their line of autonomous vehicle products. And Baidu announced that its Project Apollo open-source self-diving platform for the China market will use NVIDIA DRIVE PX. 
You'll be hearing more from us in the months ahead at regional GTCs that we will be conducting in Beijing, Munich, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Washington, D.C. and Tokyo. 
Now turning to the rest of the Q2 income statement. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter were 58.4% and 58.6%, respectively, reflecting the decline in in-sell licensing revenue. 
Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $614 million; non-GAAP operating expenses were $533 million, up 19% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiatives. GAAP operating income was $688 million; non-GAAP operating income was $773 million, doubling from a year-ago. GAAP net income was $583 million; non-GAAP net income, $638 million, also doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion. 
For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In the first half of fiscal 2018, we have paid $758 million in share repurchases and $166 million in quarterly cash dividends. 
Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 58.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $672 million, non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $570 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $2 million, inclusive of additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are supposed -- are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. 
Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]

On the clarification side, we have seen several quarters where your Datacenter business grew very strongly on a sequential basis. This time, the growth was somewhat more modest, and I was wondering if there is a little more color around that. And then the bigger question is, Jensen, it seems the data center market is sort of bifurcating between your GPU approach on one side and ASICs on the other side. What are you doing to make sure that the balance sort of stays in your favor as the market matures from here?",108,1.0,5.0,0.5555555555555556,0.5

I thought we did great. I thought we did great. We almost tripled year-over-year. And we ramped Volta into volume production. And because Volta was so much better than our last-generation processor, Volta is 100x faster than Kepler. 100x faster than Kepler just 4 years ago, and Kepler was already 10x faster than CPUs. And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it in GTC right at the beginning of the quarter. I thought the team did fantastically, transitioning the customer base to Volta, and now Volta is in high-volume production. The application of data center -- you asked a larger question about data center. The data center, data center is a very large market, as you know, and the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world's future computing will be largely done in data centers. And there's a very well-accepted notion now that GPU acceleration for servers delivers extraordinary value proposition. If you have a data-intensive application and the vast majority of the future applications in data centers will be data-intensive, a GPU could reduce the number of servers you require or increase the number of the amount of throughput pretty substantially. Just adding one GPU to a server could reduce several hundred thousand dollars of reduction in the number of servers. And so the value proposition in the cost savings of using GPUs is quite extraordinary. There are several applications in data centers. First of all, there's training and there's high-performance computing; there's cloud virtual PC, as what Amazon AWS G3 announcement was about this last -- this quarter; and then there's also new applications such as inferencing as these models are now going into production and the new applications that are coming online, which is likely to overwhelm the Internet in the near future, which is live video. Consumers taking live video on their phones and sharing with their friends and there's -- there are going to be hundreds of millions of these happening all the time. And each one of these videos will have to be transcoded to a variety of formats to be shared with their friends and also has to be -- you have to perform AI on it instantaneously so that you could avoid inappropriate video from being streamed to large audiences. And so the number of applications where GPUs are valuable, from training to high-performance computing to virtual PCs to new applications like inferencing and transcoding and AI, are starting to emerge. The one area where you're talking about ASICs and TPUs, TPU is basically an ASIC. The way to think about that is this is after 4 generations of evolution of our GPU, NVIDIA GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more. We could perform deep learning applications, whether it's in training or in inferencing now, starting with the Pascal P4 and the Volta generation. We can inference better than any known ASIC on the market that I've ever seen. And so the new generation of our GPU is essentially a TPU that does a lot more, and we can do all the things that I just mentioned and the vast number of applications that are emerging in the cloud. And so our belief is this. Our belief is that, number one, a GPU has to be versatile to handle the vast array of big data and data-intensive applications that are happening in the cloud, because the cloud is a computer, it's not an appliance. It's not a toaster, it's not a lightbulb, it's not a microphone. The cloud has a large number of applications that are data-intensive. And second, we have to be world-class at deep learning. And so our GPUs have to evolve into something that can be absolutely world-class TPU, but it has to do all of the things that a data center needs to do.",662,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow, and over time, it will become quite large. I -- it is very clear that new currencies will come to market. And it's very clear that the GPU is just fantastic at cryptography, and as these new algorithms are being developed, the GPU is really quite ideal for it. And so this is a market that is not likely to go away anytime soon, and the only thing that we can probably expect is that there will be more currencies to come. It will come in a whole lot of different nations. It will be -- it will emerge from time to time, and the GPU's really quite great for it. What we've done, our strategy is to stay very, very close to the market. We understand its dynamics really well. And we offer the coin miners a special coin-mining SKU, and this product is -- this product -- this GPU configuration is optimized for mining. We stay very close to the market. We know its every single move and we know its dynamics. And then the last thing that I can say is that, the larger of a GPU company you are, the greater ability you could absorb the volatility. And so between the combination of the fact that we have GPUs at just about every single price point, we have such incredibly efficient designs, that we're so close to the marketplace and because we have such large volumes, we have the ability to rock and roll with this market as it goes.

First of all, we actually gave a really great guidance last quarter, and we beat it by $250 million. And the $250 million, you could see in our -- what we categorized under the OEM SKUs, basically the cryptocurrency SKUs. And that, if you reverse-engineered it out, I think, is approximately $150 million. And I -- and we serve the vast -- I would say, the large majority of the cryptocurrency demand out of that specialized products. There're still small miners that buy GeForces here and there, and that probably also increased the demand of GeForces. There were a lot of shortages all over the world, and as we go into this quarter, it's -- there's still cryptocurrency mining demand that we know is out there. And based on our analytics and understanding of the marketplace, there will be some amount of demand for the foreseeable future. But I -- it's also the case that there were gamers who -- whose needs and demands were not filled last quarter. And the second quarter, the second quarter is an important part of the year for us. I mean, we -- GeForce is in an incredibly great strategic position. After all of the numerous product launches that we've seen from other players, it's very, very clear that the GeForce product lineup is absolutely the best in the world. And the second half is going to see some very exciting titles. You've got Destiny 2, you have Call of Duty from Activision, you have Star Wars Battlefront from EA. I mean, these are going to be blockbusters, and we're expecting them to do incredibly well. We also know that a game that came out of nowhere -- and this is one of the things that's really great about the video game market, you never know where the next amazing new title's going to come from. PlayersUnknown Battleground (sic) [ PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds ], it's really essentially survival -- Survivor meets Hunger Games. How could that not be a fun game? And so they've done incredibly well. And so I think the market dynamic is really, really vibrant for the second half of the year, and we have a really great position. With respect to our guidance. The way to think about our guidance, we gave a good guidance and we're comfortable with our guidance. And we know that the dynamics in our business, our data center position, is quite exciting. We know that our Gaming business is vibrant and our position is excellent. We've -- we saw growth across all of our product segments.

And the reason for that is because the first ramps tend to be more costly, and you're still trying to stabilize yield, there's a lot of complexities involved. But what I can tell you is that we shipped a lot of Voltas. We shipped a lot of Voltas. And Volta is fully ramped. Customers are clamoring for it.

Curious how you're thinking about ASP uplift over time, and whether you would expect that to drive a reacceleration in growth in data center looking into the second half of the calendar year.",64,6.0,8.0,0.8333333333333334,0.8

So the first way to think about our ASP is to think about the value proposition that our GPUs provide. Whenever you include a Volta in your data center, in your server that is doing data-intensive processing, the number of commodity servers that it replaces and the number of just NICs and cables that it replaces is pretty extraordinary. Every single Volta allows you to save several hundred thousand dollars. And so the price of Volta is driven by the fact that, of course, the manufacturing process is quite extraordinary. I mean, these are expensive things to go and design. The manufacturing cost itself, you guys can estimate, is probably in the several hundred dollars, close to $1,000. However, the software intensity of developing Volta, the architectural intensity of developing Volta, the -- all of the software intensity associated with all the algorithms and optimizing all the algorithms of Volta is really where the value added ultimately ends up. And so I guess, the pricing -- your question really is pricing, we're going to -- we expect pricing to be quite favorable for Volta. And then your second question, I think, is related to acceleration. The growth -- the data center growth opportunity for us is quite significant, as you know. I mean, there are several applications that demand GPUs today. Almost every single data center in the world today recognizes that GPU is the path forward for data-intensive processing. Every single OEM and every single cloud service provider now supports NVIDIA GPUs and offer NVIDIA GPUs, and Volta is going to be the engine that serves them. And so I'm expecting a lot of good things from Volta.",280,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Thanks a lot, Atif. The road map for auto kind of looks like this. For this year and next, what you should see is development partnerships that we have with a growing number of car companies, and they're reflected in our e-projects, development systems and purchasing of our AI supercomputers like DGX. And so for the next, I would say, this year and the vast majority of next year, that's what you should expect from the autonomous driving perspective. Starting next year, you're going to start to see robot taxis start to come to the road. We're working with a handful, maybe, I guess, about 6 or 7 really exciting robot taxi projects around the world. And you could see them start to go into prototype or beta testing starting now. And then, next year, you'll see a lot more of them. And starting 2019, you'll see them going to real commercial services. And so those are robot taxis, what some in the industry call Level 5s, basically driverless cars. And then the fully autonomous driver cars -- driven cars, branded cars, will start hitting the road around 2020 and 2021, okay? And so the way to think about it is this year and next is really about development. Starting next year and the following year is robot taxis.

Our Pro business, call it, roughly nearly $1 billion, it was -- it grew, what, 8% last year. It grew 8% the year before that, maybe a little bit less. And this year, it grow -- it grew about 10%, maybe a little faster. The way to think about that business is it's really a platform for design, and the digital design of all kinds. And it's designing movies, designing cars, designing products, people designing websites. Anybody who's doing digital design could really benefit from our Quadro platform. It's very software-intensive, it's certified with every major computer-aided design package. It's certified by large industrial companies all over the world. You could use Quadro and bring up a database 10 years from now and know that, because of the nature of how we manage our software, the certification process we go through with each one of the major industry partners, we could pull up an entire design that's designed 5 years ago 10 years from now. And so if anything were to happen to a product or a plane or a ship or a building, the level of certainty in your data integrity is going to be complete. And so the software intensity is high, and the -- and our platform is recognized all over the world as the industry standard. The growth opportunity for Quadro are several, and it's starting to kick in. And I have -- I'm rather optimistic about its future growth as well. One of them is photorealistic rendering. We now have the ability to use our artificial intelligence and ray tracing technology in combination, called Optix 5.0 that we just announced at SIGGRAPH, that allows you to visualize photorealistic rendering practically interactively. And it's just an amazing thing to watch. Second, we now have a new system, called the external GPU system, that's a partnership between the work that we did with Intel. And all of our partners in the ecosystem taking advantage of Thunderbolt 3 and the new external GPU-capable Windows system, you can now have an external system connect to Thunderbolt. And basically, our GPU is outside the laptop. And so for some 25 million, 20 million users of thin and light notebooks, you can now have the ability to have the GPU as well and get a boost in your productivity like you've never seen before. And so you can now have thin notebooks and still have the benefit of our GPUs. And so that's a new market for us. We're going to see virtual reality do quite well, and especially in design. And we've partnered with HP recently to do an industrial version of a backpack that allows designers to be able to freely roam within their design space and completely in virtual reality. And so there's a variety of growth drivers in that business that I'm quite excited about.",479,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

I think our strategic position and the value of our architecture is more powerful today than ever. And so our -- I think #1 is our strategic position.

Volta is -- it was a giant leap. It's kind of 120 teraflops. 120 teraflops. Another way to think about that is 8 of them in 1 node is essentially 1 petaflops, which puts it in the -- among the top 20 fastest supercomputer on the planet. And I -- the entire world's top 500 supercomputers is only 700 petaflops. And with 8 Voltas in 1 box for doing artificial intelligence, it represents one of them. And so that's -- Volta is just a gigantic lead for deep learning, and it's such a gigantic leap for processing that -- and we announced that at GTC, if you recall, which is practically right at the beginning of the quarter. And so the transition was not insignificant, and it was that the team just executed flawlessly. I'm so proud of the team that they executed the most complex processor that's ever been built. And working with our teams, working with our partners at TSMC and Samsung and all of our package partners, Bill, and they just did a great job for us. And so the team did great. Now looking forward, there's a whole bunch of growth drivers for our data center business. Deep learning is -- training is a growth driver. Cloud computing, high-performance computing is a growth driver, and we have new growth drivers with inferencing. And so I'm pretty excited about our prospects going into the age of -- the generation of Volta. In terms of the guidance and what we expect, I think our dynamics are really positive.

And when we look at the charts that you've published about your expectation for exaflops -- the number of exaflops required to train an increasing number of deep learning networks through 2020, it looks like your expectation is for that to accelerate over time.

I think, at the highest level, the way to think about that is data-intensive computing. Data-intensive computing, whether it's deep learning or high-performance computing, the GPU is just phenomenal at it. NVIDIA's CUDA GPU was after 12 years of driving this architecture and pioneering this computing approach, it's just a home run. And the value proposition and the money that it saves people, the amount of energy that it saves, is quite extraordinary. One way to think about that is if you speed up an application by a factor of 10, you're basically saying that it takes 10x fewer servers to do the same job or you could do 10x as much work in the same amount of servers. And so the value proposition is really quite great. And the applications that we serve is really diverse now. It used to be just high-performance computing and supercomputing, but the number of applications we serve span Internet service providers, manufacturing, health care, financial services, transportation. The number of data-intensive applications and industries that need them is really growing very fast. And so how fast does that -- what does that imply in terms of long-term growth? It's kind of hard to say. It's kind of hard to say. But first principles would suggest, first principles would suggest that every single data center in the world will be GPU-accelerated someday, and I've always believed that. And I believe that even more today because I believe that, in the future, this new computing model that we all finally call AI is going to be a highly data-intensive business model, and the GPU is the ideal computing model for that. And so I'm not exactly sure if that completely answers your question, and partly because I'm not exactly sure. I just know that the -- on first principles, the computing architecture is ideal. There's every evidence that every single data center and every single OEM and every single Internet service provider is jumping on this architecture and jumping on Volta. And I believe that AI is going to be the future of computing. And so somewhere between those beliefs and executing the business is the truth.",363,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Every single cloud provider and every single OEM is now fully geared up to take that server to market, and they all have GPU options. Every single OEM in the world now and every cloud provider in every ODM now has NVIDIA GPU chassis and platforms, whether it's in one GPU in one [ U ] to 8 GPUs in a supercomputing configuration. And so the number of options of ways to enjoy NVIDIA GPUs is really quite countless now. Volta for Gaming, we haven't announced anything. And all I can say is that our pipeline is filled with some exciting new toys for the gamers. And we have some really exciting new technology to offer them in the pipeline. But for the holiday season, for the foreseeable future, I think Pascal is just unbeatable. It's just the best thing out there. And everybody who's looking forward to playing Call of Duty or Destiny 2, if they don't already have one, should run out and get themselves a Pascal.",265,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

There are hundreds of millions of NVIDIA GPUs in the world, and they're all CUDA-compatible and they're all 100% CUDA-compatible. And we're so rigorous and so disciplined about ensuring their compatibility that, for developers, it's really a wonderful platform. However, we are thoughtful about how we configure the GPUs so that they're best for the applications. Some applications would like to have the maximum amount of performance in a few nodes. Some would like to have the maximum amount of performance within 30 watts. Some would like to have the maximum amount of flexibility with all of the I/O pin connectors and all display connectors. Some people like to have multi-GPUs and that they have the ability to configure them together. And so every market has a slightly different need.

A neural net, in terms of complexity, is approximately -- not quite, but approximately doubling every year, and this is one of the exciting things about artificial intelligence. In no time in our -- in my history of looking at computers in the last 35 years have we ever seen a double exponential, where the GPU computing model, our GPUs, are essentially increasing in performance by approximately 3x each year in order to be 100x in just 4 years. We have to increase in performance, overall system performance, by a factor of 3 -- by over a factor of 3 every year. And yet on the other hand, on top of it, the neural network architecture and the algorithms that are being developed are improving in accuracy by about twice each year. And so object recognition and accuracy is improving by twice each year, or the error rate is decreasing by half each year. And speech recognition is improving by a factor of 2 each year. And so you've got these 2 exponentials that are happening, and it's pretty exciting. And it's one of the reasons why AI is moving so fast.",195,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Our GPUs are useless because -- without software. And the reason for that is because, otherwise, they -- each one of the markets, whether it's playing games or professional visualization or high-performance computing, doing molecular dynamics, computation or doing seismic processing or perceiving the 3-dimensional world around the car and reasoning about where it is and trying to figure out how to drive, all of that software is very, very different. What we do is we -- there's a core in our company, the core architecture is a GPU core. However, the configuration of the products and the chips and the systems are very different from market to market. And so somebody asked me earlier, the gentleman asked me about cryptocurrency. That configuration is very, very different than a Gaming configuration, which is different than a high-performance computing configuration. And it's different from our inferencing configuration, and it's different from our self-driving-car configuration. And so the chips are designed to be different even though they're architecturally identical. And then the systems are designed to be market-specific and application-specific. And the software on top of it is super, super application-specific. And that's one of the reasons why our company is increasingly differentiated from a components company and what we call a platform company. Each one of these platforms that we bring to market are very, very different even though, at its core, this data-intensive parallel computing architecture called CUDA is essential among all of them. We don't break out the automotive from the rest of the Tegra business. The Tegra business consists of basically 3 parts at the moment. One part is -- one major component of it is the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and they're just doing incredibly well. I'm so happy for Nintendo because they're risk-takers, they're innovators, they -- they're -- they don't -- they're not influenced by what other people do, and they're original thinkers and I just love the way they invented the Switch and the way they've taken it to market. I'm so happy for them. And it's doing really well. The second major component is our self-driving car platforms and a lot of it still is the infotainment systems. Our infotainment system is going to evolve into an AI cockpit product line. We're going to -- we initially started with autonomous driving, but you've probably heard me say at GTC that our future infotainment systems will basically turn your cockpit or turn your car into an AI. So your whole car will become an AI. It'll talk to you, it'll know where you are, and knows who's in the cabin. And if there's potential things to be concerned about around the car, it might even just tell you in natural language. And so the entire AI will be -- the entire car will become an AI. We announced at CES a partnership with Daimler, and they talked about the work that we're doing together in the next-generation car, how we're going to bring the AI into the car. And that's our first visible -- highly visible project, and there are others that we're working on. And then the future projects, starting from end of next year with robot taxis, and starting with 2020, the autonomous cars, fully autonomous cars. You're going to see the rest of that come online. And that's a major component of Tegra. And then the last component, the third component, the major component, I would say, is AI at the edge. That's the next major revolution. And I -- we have a new product line. It's -- that we announced about a year ago, and it's called Jetson. Jetson is just -- it's just an amazing little AI computer. And if you want to do deep learning at the edge, whether it's really, really clever cameras for smart and safe cities, to traffic lights that can now monitor traffic, Jetson and AI at the edge is going to be the next growth opportunity for us. And those 3 major segments make up essentially the Tegra business. We haven't split each one of them out separately. But one of these days, we'll consider doing it.",707,6.0,6.0,0.8333333333333334,0.6

Partly, I'm not in total control of the answer. But on first principles, let me maybe explain it this way. I believe that there are a few hundred million office workers and information workers whose PCs will be virtualized and just become an application, like Netflix, and it will be virtualized, it'll be streamed from our cloud GPUs called GRID. I believe that every single company in the world, manufacturing, health care, finance, will use computational approaches to analyzing their business. And some of them will use it -- will use AI and some of them will use traditional first-principle, physics-based algorithms. And I -- and it's hard to say exactly what the split's going to be. I -- my guess, however, is that AI will be the larger part of that. But you're going to see hybrid versions of it. Most computations, the reason why we're so bullish about CUDA and our GPU, which is able to do both general purpose computation as well as deep learning, is because most algorithms has the combination of both. Inside the car, we don't just use deep learning, we use CUDA and deep learning. We use CUDA for all kinds of algorithms, computer vision algorithms, including deep learning. And so -- and we're seeing in quantum chemistry, in physics simulations like fluid dynamics, more and more of the algorithms are hybrids of deep learning and numerics. And so I -- that segment of the marketplace is kind of hard to predict. And then there's the -- there's just the consumer Internet service providers and the billions and billions of queries that are going into the cloud. Some of them are text, some of them are speech, and increasingly, some of them are video. But the amount of traffic that's going to be inferenced using deep learning is going to be quite explosive. It's kind of hard to know exactly the pace of each one of these. But I think, on first principles, we would all agree that these are large computation challenges and that the previous model of using just microprocessors to do that computation is not efficient. And that the GPU, with its parallel data processing capability and now our fourth-generation deep learning architecture, you essentially have a TPU that does a whole bunch more. And so I think the approach that we take has great promise, and we're just super enthusiastic about it. But exactly how much it's going to contribute in the near term in percentages is going to be hard to guess. 
Okay, that was great. I appreciate all the questions. We had a great quarter. We're seeing exciting growth dynamics driving in each of our businesses. This is the era of artificial intelligence, and NVIDIA has dedicated ourselves to be its brain. Cloud and Internet service providers are going in -- going all in on AI and jumping on to our new Volta GPU. Enterprises and giant industries from transportation to health care to manufacturing to financial services have awakened to the power of AI, and the growing pipeline of the NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer is a great indicator. The next revolution of AI will be AI at the edge, and the most visible and impactful evidence will be the autonomous vehicle. Our strategy is to build a ground-up, deep learning platform for self-driving cars, and that has put us in pole position to lead the charge. And in Gaming, which is actually the first consumer AI application, we have a great strategic position in this growing market. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ahead. We can make an amazing impact on the future of the world.

We had an excellent quarter with record revenue in each of our 4 market platforms. And every measure of profit hit record levels, reflecting the leverage of our model. Data center revenue of $501 million more than doubled from a year ago and the strong adoption of our Volta platform and early traction with our inferencing portfolio.
Q3 revenue reached $2.64 billion, up 32% from a year earlier, up 18% sequentially and well above our outlook of $2.35 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 31% from last year to $2.22 billion. Tegra processor revenue rose 74% to $419 million.
Let's start with our gaming business. Gaming revenue was $1.56 billion, up 25% year-on-year and up 32% sequentially. We saw robust demand across all regions and form factors. Our Pascal-based GPUs remained the platform of choice for gamers as evidenced by our strong demand for GeForce GTX 10-Series products. We introduced the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, which became available last week. It complements our strong holiday lineup ranging from the entry-level GTX 1050 to our flagship GTX 1080 Ti.
A wave of great titles is arriving for the holidays, driving enthusiasm in the market. We collaborated with Activision to bring Destiny 2 to the PC earlier in the month. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, popularly known as PUBG, continues to be one of the year's most successful titles. We are closely aligned with PUBG to ensure that GeForce is the best way to play the game, including bringing shadow play highlights to its 20 million players. Last weekend, Call of Duty: WWII had a strong debut, and Star Wars Battlefront II will be out [ soon ].
eSports remains one of the most important secular growth drivers in the gaming market with a fan base that now exceeds 350 million. Last weekend, the League of Legends World Championship was held in Beijing's National Stadium, the Bird's Nest, where the 2008 Olympics games were held. More than 40,000 fans attended live, and online viewers were set to break last year's record of 43 million following in 18 languages.
GPU sales also benefited from continued cryptocurrency mining. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business and a portion with GeForce GTX boards, though it's difficult to quantify. We remain nimble in our approach to the cryptocurrency market. It is volatile, does not and will not distract us from focusing on our core gaming market. Lastly, Nintendo Switch console continues to gain momentum since launching in March and also contributed to growth.
Moving to data center. Our data center business had an outstanding quarter. Revenue of $501 million more than doubled from last year and rose 20% on the quarter amid strong traction of the new Volta architecture. Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3 driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing. As we have noted before, Volta delivers 10x the deep learning performance of our Pascal architecture, which has been introduced just a year earlier, far outpacing Moore's Law.
The V100 is being broadly adopted with every major server OEM and cloud provider. In China, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent announced that they are incorporating V100 in their data centers and cloud server service infrastructures. In the U.S., Amazon Web Services announced that V100 inferences are now available in 4 of its regions. Oracle Cloud has just added Tesla P100 GPUs to its infrastructure offerings and plans to expand to the V100 GPUs. We expect support from V100 from other major cloud providers as well.
In addition, all major server OEMs announced support for the V100, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM and Supermicro are incorporating it in servers. And China's top server OEMs, Huawei, Inspur and Lenovo have adopted our HGX server architecture to build a new generation of accelerated data centers with V100 GPUs.
Our new offerings for the AI inference market are also gaining momentum. The recently launched TensorRT 3 programmable inference acceleration platform opens a new market opportunity for us, improving the performance and reducing the cost of AI inferencing in order -- by orders of magnitude compared with CPUs. It supports every major deep learning framework, every network architecture and any level of network complexity. More than 1,200 companies are already using our inference platform including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, iFLYTEK, Hikvision and Tencent.
During the quarter, we announced that the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry, or NGC, is now available through Amazon's cloud and will be supported soon by other cloud platforms. NGC helps developers get started with deep learning development through no-cost access to a comprehensive, easy-to-use, fully optimized deep learning software stack. It enables instant access to the most widely used GPU-accelerated frameworks.
We also continue to see robust growth in our HPC business. Next-generation supercomputers, such as the U.S. Department of Energy's Sierra and Summit systems expected to come online next year, leverage Volta's industry-leading performance, and our pipeline is strong. The past weeks have been exceptionally busy for us. We have hosted 5 major GPU Technology Conferences in Beijing, Munich, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Washington with another next month in Tokyo. In a strong indication of the growing importance of GPU-accelerated computing, more than 22,000 developers, data scientists and others will come this year to our GTCs, including the main event in Silicon Valley. That's up 10x in just 5 years. Other key metrics show similar gains. Over the same period, the number of NVIDIA GPU developers has grown 15x to 645,000, and the number of CUDA downloads this year are up 5x to 1.8 million.
Moving to professional visualization. Third quarter revenue grew to $239 million, up 15% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially driven by demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations. The defense and automotive industries grew strongly as the demand for professional VR solutions driven by Quadro P5000 and P6000 GPUs. Among key customers, Audi and BMW are deploying VR in auto showrooms. And the U.S. Army, Navy and Homeland Security are using VR for mission training.
Last month, we announced early access to NVIDIA Holodeck, the intelligent VR collaboration platform. Holodeck enables designers, developers and their customers to come together virtually from anywhere in the world in a highly realistic, collaborative and physically simulated environment. Future updates will address the growing demand for the development of deep learning techniques in virtual environments.
In automotive, revenue grew to $144 million, up 13% year-over-year and up slightly from last quarter. Among key developments this quarter, we announced DRIVE PX Pegasus, the world's first AI computer for enabling Level 5 driverless vehicles. Pegasus will deliver over 320 trillion operations per second, more than 10x its predecessor. It's powered by 4 high-performance AI processors in a supercomputer that is the size of a license plate. NVIDIA DRIVE is being used by over 25 companies to develop fully autonomous robotaxis, and DRIVE PX Pegasus will become the path to production. It is designed for ASIL D certification, the industry's highest safety level and will be available in the second half of 2018.
We also introduced the DRIVE IX SDK for delivering intelligent experiences inside the vehicle. DRIVE IX provides a platform for car companies to create and always engage AI co-pilot. It uses deep learning networks to track head movement and gaze, and it will have a conversation with the driver using advanced speech recognition, lipreading and natural language understanding. We believe this will set the standard for the next generation of infotainment systems, a market that is just beginning to develop.
Finally, we announced that DHL, the world's largest mail and package delivery service, and ZF, one of the world's leading automotive suppliers, will deploy a test fleet of autonomous delivery trucks next year using the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform. DHL will outfit electric light trucks with the ZF ProAI self-driving system based on our technology.
Now turning to the rest of the income statement. Q3 GAAP gross margins was 59.5% and non-GAAP was 59.7%, both up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting continued growth in value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $674 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $570 million, consistent with our outlook and up 19% year-on-year.

And since then, every major cloud provider, from Amazon, Microsoft, Google to Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and even recently, Oracle, has announced support for Volta and we'll be providing Volta for their internal use of deep learning as well as external public cloud services. We also announced that every major server computer maker in the world has now supported Volta and in the process of taking Volta out to market. HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Huawei in China, Inspur in China, Lenovo, have all announced that they will be building servers -- families of servers around the Volta GPU. And so I think we -- this ramp is just the first part of supporting the build out of GPU-accelerated servers from our company for data centers all over the world as well as cloud service providers all over the world. The applications for these GPU servers has now grown to many markets. I've spoken about the primary segments of our Tesla GPUs. There are 5 of them that I talk about regularly. The first one is high-performance computing where the market is $11 billion or so. It is one of the faster-growing parts of the IT industry because more and more people are using high-performance computing for doing their product development or looking for insights or predicting the market or whatever it is. And today, we represent about 15% of the world's top 500 supercomputers. And I've repeatedly said and I believe this completely and I think it's becoming increasingly true that every single supercomputer in the future will be accelerated somehow. So this is a fairly significant growth opportunity for us. The second is deep learning training, which is very, very much like high-performance computing. And you need to do computing at a very large scale. You're performing trillions and trillions of iterations. The models are getting larger and larger. Every single year, the amount of data that we're training with it is increasing. And the difference between a computing platform that's fast versus not could mean the difference between building a $20 million data center or high-performance computing servers for training to $200 million. And so the money that we save and the capability we provide is really, the value is incredible. The third segment, and this is the segment that you just mentioned, has to do with inference, which is when you're done with developing this network, you have to put it down into the hyperscale data centers to support the billions and billions of queries that consumers make to the Internet every day. And this is a brand-new market for us. 100% of the world's inference is done on CPUs today. We announced very recently, this last quarter in fact, that TensorRT 3 inference acceleration platform and in combination with our Tensor Core GPU instruction set architecture, we're able to speed up networks by a factor of 100. Now the way to think about that is imagine whatever amount of workload that you've got, if you could speed up using our platform by a factor of 100, how much you can save. The other way to think about that is because the amount of -- the networks are getting larger and larger, and they're so complex now. And we know that every network on the planet will run on our architecture because they were trained on our architecture today. And so whether it's CNNs or RNNs or GANs or autoencoders or all of the variations of those, irrespective of the precision that you need to support, the size of the network, we have the ability to support them. And so you could either scale out your hyperscale data center to support more traffic or you can reduce your cost tremendously or simultaneously, both. The fourth segment of our data center is providing all of that capability, what I just mentioned, whether it's HPC, training or inference and turning it inside out and making it available in the public cloud. There are thousands of start-ups now that are in -- are started because of AI. Everybody recognizes the importance of this new computing model. And as a result of this new tool, this new capability, all these unsolvable problems in the past are now interestingly solvable. And so you can see start-ups cropping up all over the west, all over the east, and there's just -- there are thousands of them. And these companies don't either -- would rather not use their scarce financial resources to go build high-performance computing centers, or they don't have the skill to be able to build out a high-performance platform the way these Internet companies can. And so these cloud providers, cloud platforms are just a fantastic resource for them because they could rent it by the hour. We created in conjunction with that, and I mentioned all the cloud service providers have taken it to market, in conjunction with that, we created a registry in the cloud that containerizes these really complicated software stacks. Every one of these soft frameworks with the different versions of our GPUs and different acceleration layers and different optimization techniques, we've containerized all of that for every single version and every single type of framework in the marketplace. And we put that up in the registry -- cloud registry called the NVIDIA GPU Cloud. And so all you had to do was download that into the cloud service provider that we've got certified and tested for, and with just one click, you're doing deep learning. And then the last -- and so that's the cloud service providers. If you -- the way to guess that -- estimate that is there are obviously tens of billions of dollars being invested in these AI start-ups. And some large proportion of their investment fund raise will ultimately have to go towards high-performance computing, whether they build it themselves or they rent it in the cloud. And so I think that's a multibillion dollar opportunity for us. And then lastly, this is probably the largest of all the opportunities, which is the vertical industries. Whether it's automotive companies that are developing their supercomputers to get ready for self-driving cars or health care companies that are now taking advantage of artificial intelligence to do better diagnostics of -- diagnosis of disease, to manufacturing companies to -- for in-line inspection, to robotics, large logistics companies. Colette mentioned earlier DHL. But the way to think about that is all of these planning -- all of these companies doing planning to deliver products to you through this large network of delivery systems, it is the world's largest planning problem. And whether it's Uber or Didi or Lyft or Amazon or DHL or UPS or FedEx, they all have high-performance computing problems that are now moving to deep learning. And so those are really exciting opportunities for us. And so the last one is just vertical industries. I mean, all of these segments, we're now in a position to start addressing because we've put our GPUs in the cloud, all of our OEMs are in the process of taking these platforms out to market and we have the ability now to address high-performance computing and deep learning training as well as inference using one common platform. And so I think the -- we've been steadfast with the excitement of accelerated computing for data centers, and I think this is just the beginning of it all.",1264,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

There's -- I'll answer the last one first and then work towards the first one. I think the guidance that we provided, we feel comfortable with. But if you think about Volta, it is just in the beginning of the ramp, and it's going to ramp into the market opportunities I talked about. And so my hope is that we continue to grow, and there's every evidence that the markets that we serve, that we're addressing with Volta is -- are very large markets. And so there's a lot of reasons to be hopeful about the future growth opportunities for Volta. We've primed the pump. So cloud service providers are either announce the availability of Volta or they announced the soon availability of Volta. They're all racing to get Volta to their cloud because customers are clamoring for it. The OEMs are -- we've primed the pump with the OEMs, and some of them are sampling now and some of them are racing to get Volta to production in the marketplace. And so I think the foundation, the demand is there. The urgent need for accelerated computing is there because Moore's Law is not scaling anymore, and then we've primed the pump. So the demand is there. There's a need -- the need is there, and the foundations for getting Volta to market is primed. With respect to gaming, what drives our gaming business? Remember, our gaming business is sold one at a time to millions and millions of people. And what drives our gaming business is several things. As you know, eSports is incredibly, incredibly vibrant, and what drives -- the reason why eSports is so unique is because people want to win and having better gear helps. The latency that they expect is incredibly low, and performance drives down latency and they want to be able to react as fast as they can. People want to win, and they want to make sure that the gear that they use is not the reason why they didn't win. The second growth driver for us is content, the quality of content. And boy, if you look at Call of Duty or Destiny 2 or PUBG, the content just looks amazing. The AAA content looks amazing. And one of the things that's really unique about video games is that in order to enjoy the content and the fidelity of the content, the quality of the production value at its fullest, you need the best gear. It's very different than streaming video, it's very different than watching movies where streaming videos, it is what it is. But for video games, of course, it's not. And so when AAA titles comes out in the later part of the year, it helps to drive platform adoption. And then lastly, increasingly, social is becoming a huge part of the growth dynamics of gaming. People are -- they recognize how beautiful these video games are, and so they want to share their brightest moments with people. They want to share the levels they discover. They want to take pictures of the amazing graphics that's inside. And it is one of the primary drivers, the leading driver, in fact, of YouTube and people watching other people play video games, these broadcasters. And now with our Ansel, the world's first in-game virtual reality and surround and digital camera, we have the ability to take pictures and share that with people. And so I think all of these different drivers are helping our gaming business, and I'm optimistic about Q4. It looks like it's going to be a great quarter.",604,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

On the near term, you talked about the health on demand side for Volta. Curious if you're seeing any sort of restrictions on the supply side, whether it's wafers or access to high-bandwidth memory, et cetera. And then the longer-term question really revolves around CUDA, and you've talked about that as being a sustainable competitive advantage for you guys entering the year. And now that we've moved beyond HPC and hyperscale training to more into inference and GPU as a service and you've hosted GTC around the world, curious if you could extrapolate on how you're seeing that advantage and how you've seen it evolve over the year and how you're thinking about CUDA as the AI standard.",131,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Well, everything that we build is complicated. Volta is the single largest processor that humanity has ever made, 21 billion transistors, 3D packaging, the fastest memories on the planet and all of that in a couple hundred watts, which basically says it's the most energy-efficient form of computing that the world has ever known. And one single Volta replaces hundreds of CPUs. And so it's energy-efficient. It saves an enormous amount of money. And it gets this job done really, really fast, which is one of the reasons why GPU-accelerated computing is so popular now. With respect to the outlook for our architecture, as you know, we are a one-architecture company, and it's so vitally important. And the reason for that is because there are so much software and so much tools created on top of this one architecture. On the inference side -- on the training side, we have a whole stack of software and optimizing compilers and numerics libraries that are completely optimized for one architecture called CUDA. On the inference side, the optimizing compilers that takes these large, huge computational graphs that come out of all of these frameworks, and these computational graphs are getting larger and larger and their numerical precision differs from one type of network to another -- from one type of application to another. Your numerical precision requirements for a self-driving car, where lives are at stake, to detecting where -- counting the number of people crossing the street, counting something versus trying to track -- detect and track something very subtle in all kinds of weather conditions is a very, very different problem. And so numeric -- the type of networks are changing all the time. They're getting larger all the time. The numerical precision is different for different applications. And we have different computing -- computer performance levels as well as energy availability levels that these inference compilers are likely to be some of the most complex software in the world. And so the fact that we have one singular architecture to optimize for, whether it's HPC for numeric -- molecular dynamics and computational chemistry and biology and astrophysics, all the way to training to inference gives us just enormous leverage. And that's the reason why NVIDIA could be an 11,000-people company and arguably, performing at a level that is 10x that. And the reason for that is because we have one singular architecture that's -- that is accruing benefits over time instead of 3, 4, 5 different architectures where your software organization is broken up into all these different small subcritical mass pieces. And so it's a huge advantage for us, and it's a huge advantage for the industry. So people who support CUDA knows that the next-generation architecture will just get a benefit and go for the ride that technology advancement provides them and affords them. Okay. So I think it's an advantage that is growing exponentially, frankly, and I'm excited about it.",499,7.0,8.0,0.8888888888888888,0.8

Jensen, in the last few months, we have seen a lot of announcements from Intel, from Xilinx and others describing other approaches to the AI market. My question is how does a customer make that decision whether to use a GPU or an FPGA or an ASIC, right? What is -- what can remain your competitive differentiator over the longer term? And does your position in the training market also then maybe give you a leg up when they consider solution for the inference part of the problem?",97,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

So first of all, we have one architecture and people know that our commitment to our GPUs, our commitment to CUDA, our commitment to all of the software stacks that run on top of our GPUs, every single one of the 500 applications, every numerical solver, every CUDA compiler, every tool chain across every single operating system in every single computing platform, we are completely dedicated to it. We support the software for as long as we shall live, and as a result of that, the benefits to their investment in CUDA just continues to accrue. I -- you have no idea how many people send me notes about how they literally take out their old GPU, put in a new GPU and without lifting a finger, things got 2x, 3x, 4x faster than what they were doing before, incredible value to customers. The fact that we are singularly focused and completely dedicated to this one architecture and in an unwavering way allows everybody to trust us and know that we will support it for as long as we shall live. And that is the benefit of an architectural strategy. When you have 4 or 5 different architectures to support, that you offer to your customers and you ask them to pick the one that they like the best, you're essentially saying that you're not sure which one is the best. And we all know that nobody's going to be able to support 5 architectures forever. And as a result, something has to give, and it would be really unfortunate for a customer to have chosen the wrong one. And if there's 5 architectures, surely, over time, 80% of them will be wrong. And so I think that our advantage is that we're singularly focused. With respect to FPGAs, I think FPGAs have their place, and we use FPGAs here in NVIDIA to prototype things and -- but FPGA is a chip design. It's able to be a chip for -- it's incredibly good at being a flexible substrate to be any chip, and so that's its advantage. Our advantage is that we have a programming environment, and writing software is a lot easier than designing chips. And if it's within the domain that we focus on, like, for example, we're not focused on network packet processing, but we are very focused on deep learning. We're very focused on high performance and parallel numerics analysis. If we're focused on those domains, our platform is really quite unbeatable. And so that's how you think through that.

And so I think for some time, we're going to see that crypto will be a small but not 0, small but not 0 part of our business. The -- when you think about crypto in the context of our company overall, the thing to remember is that we're the largest GPU computing company in the world. And our overall GPU business is really sizable and we have multiple segments. And there's data center and I've already talked about the 5 different segments within data center. There's ProVis and even that has multiple segments within it. Whether it's rendering or computer-aided design or broadcast in a workstation, in a laptop or in a data center, the architectures are rather different. And of course, you know that we have high-performance computing. You know that we have autonomous machine business, self-driving cars and robotics. And you know, of course, that we have gaming.

Here's the reason why. So what happens is, is when a crypto -- when a currency -- digital currency market becomes very large, it entices somebody to build a custom ASIC for it. And of course, Bitcoin is the perfect example of that. Bitcoin is incredibly easy to design as a specialized chip form. But then what happens is a couple of different players starts to monopolize the marketplace and as a result, it chases everybody out of the mining market and it encourages a new currency to evolve -- to emerge. And the new currency, the only way to get people to mine it is if it's hard to mine, it's hard to mine, okay, you got to put some effort into it. However, you want a lot of people to try to mine it. And so therefore, the platform that is perfect for it, the ideal platform for digital -- new emerging digital currencies turns out to be a CUDA GPU. And the reason for that is because there are several hundred million NVIDIA GPUs in the marketplace. If you want to create a new cryptocurrency algorithm, optimizing for our GPUs is really quite ideal. It's hard to do. It's hard to do, therefore, you need a lot of computation to do it. And yet there's enough GPUs in the marketplace, it's such an open platform that the ability for somebody to get in and start mining is very low barriers to entry. And so it's the cycles of these digital currencies, and that's the reason why I say that digital currency crypto usage of GPUs, crypto usage of GPUs will be small but not 0 for some time. And it's small because when it gets big, somebody will go and build a custom ASIC. But if somebody builds a custom ASIC, there will be a new emerging cryptocurrency, so ebbs and flows.",322,3.0,6.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6

It's a huge milestone. I wanted to follow up with a question on some of your comments regarding data center partners because as I look back over the last 5 years, I just don't see any precedent for the momentum that you have in the marketplace right now between your server partners, white box partners, hyperscale partners that are deploying it, hosted, et cetera. And so my question is relative to the doubling that we've seen year-on-year in each of the last 2 years, what does that partner expansion mean for data center's growth? And then if I could sneak one more in. 2 new products just announced in the gaming platform, 1070 Ti and a Collector's Edition on TITAN Xp. What do those mean for the gaming platform?",138,7.0,6.0,0.8888888888888888,0.6

Let's see. We have never created a product that is as broadly supported by the industries and has grown 9 consecutive quarters, it has doubled year-over-year and with partnerships of the scale that we're looking at. We have just never created a product like that before, and I think the reason for that is several folds. The first is that it is true that CPU scaling has come to an end. That's just laws of physics. The end of Moore's Law is just laws of physics. And yet the world for software development and the world -- the problems that computing can help solve is growing faster than any time before. Nobody's ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Amazon before. Nobody's ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Didi before. The number of millions of taxi rides per week is just staggering. And so nobody's ever seen large problems like these before, large-scale problems like these before. And so high-performance computing and accelerated computing using GPUs has become recognized as the path forward. And so I think that that's at the highest level of the most important parameter. Second is artificial intelligence and its emergence and applications to solving problems that we historically thought were unsolvable. Solving the unsolvable problems is a real realization. I mean, this is happening across just about every industry we know, whether it's Internet service providers to health care to manufacturing to transportation and logistics, you just name it, financial services. And so I think artificial intelligence is a real tool, deep learning is a real tool that can help solve some of the world's unsolvable problems. And I think that our dedication to high-performance computing and this one singular architecture, our 7-year head start, if you will, in deep learning and our early recognition of the importance of this new computing approach, both the timing of it, the fact that it was naturally a perfect fit for the skills that we have and then the incredibly -- the incredible effectiveness of this approach, I think, has really created the perfect conditions for our architecture. And so I think -- I really appreciate you noticing that, but this is definitely the most successful product line in the history of our company.",382,8.0,6.0,0.9444444444444444,0.6

And interestingly, with the other segments growing as quickly as they are, auto is becoming a smaller percentage of revenue now. And certainly, the design traction seems very positive. Can you talk about the ramp in terms of when the auto revenue, when we could see that as getting back to a similar percentage of revenue? Is that growing more quickly? Do you think that is likely to happen over the next year with some of these design wins coming out? Or is that something we should -- we'll be waiting for over several years?",107,6.0,5.0,0.8333333333333334,0.5

So the way to think about that is as you know, we've really, really reduced our emphasis on infotainment even though that's the primary part of our revenues, so that we could take, literally, hundreds of engineers and including the processors that we're building now, a couple of 2,000, 3,000 engineers, working on our autonomous machine and artificial intelligence platform for this marketplace to take advantage of the position we have and to go after this amazing revolution that's about to happen. I happen to believe that everything that moves will be autonomous someday, and it could be a bus, a truck, a shuttle, a car. Everything that moves will be autonomous someday. It could be a delivery vehicle. It could be little robots that are moving around warehouses. It could be delivering a pizza to you. And we felt that those -- this was such an incredibly, incredibly great challenge and such a great computing problem that we decided to dedicate ourselves to it. Over the next several years, and if you look at our DRIVE PX platform today, there's over 200 companies that are working on it. 125 start-ups are working on it. And these companies are mapping companies. They're Tier 1s. They're OEMs. They're shuttle companies, car companies, trucking companies, taxi companies. And this last quarter, we announced an extension of our DRIVE PX platform to include DRIVE PX Pegasus, which is now the world's first auto-grade, full ASIL D platform for robotaxis. And so I think our position is really excellent, and the investment has proven to be one of the best ever. And so I think in terms of revenues, my expectation is that this coming year, we'll enjoy revenues as a result of the supercomputers that customers will have to buy for training their networks, for simulating the -- all these autonomous vehicles driving and developing their self-driving cars. And we'll see fairly large quantities of development systems being sold this coming year. The year after that, I think, is the year when you're going to see the robotaxis ramping, and our economics in every robotaxi is several thousand dollars. And then starting, I would say, late 2020 to 2021, you're going to start to see the first fully automatic autonomous cars, what people call Level 4 cars, starting to hit the road. And so that's kind of how I see it. Just next year is simulation environments, development systems, supercomputers, and then the year after that is robotaxis and then a year or 2 after that will be all the self-driving cars.",433,8.0,7.0,0.9444444444444444,0.7

And now you're hitting numbers at 60% excluding that. I want -- if you could talk a little bit about how mix of the data center business and some others drives gross margin going forward. And maybe, Jensen, you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned Volta being such a huge chip in terms of transistor count.

Thanks, Matt, for the question. Yes, we've been on a steady stream of increasing the gross margins over the years. But this is the evolution of the entire model, the model of the value-added platforms that we sell and inclusive of the entire ecosystem of work that we do, the software that we enable in so many of these platforms that we bring to market. Data center is one of them. Our ProVis, another one and if you think about all of our work that we have in terms of gaming and that overall expansion of the ecosystem. So this has been continuing to increase our gross margin. Mix is more of a statement in terms of each quarter we have a different mix in terms of our products. So some of them have a little bit of seasonality. And depending on when some of those platforms come to market, we can have a mix change within some of those subsets. It's still going to be our focus as we go forward in terms of growing gross margins as best as we can, you can see in terms of our guidance into Q4, which we feel comfortable with that guidance that we will increase it as well.",208,5.0,6.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6

The first thing is I'm just incredibly proud of the technology group that we have in VLSI, and they get us ready for these brand new nodes, whether it's in the process readiness with all the circuit readiness, the packaging, the memory readiness. The readiness is so incredible -- incredibly important for us because these processors that we're creating are really, really hard. They're the largest things in the world. And so we get one shot at it. And so the team does everything they can to essentially prepare us. And by the time that we tape-out a product for real, we know for certain that we can build it. And so the technology team in our company is just world-class, absolutely world-class. There's nothing like it. Then once we go into production, we have the benefit of ramping up the products. And as yields improve, we'll surely benefit from the cost. But that's not really where the focus is. I mean, in the final analysis, the real focus for us is continue to improve the software stack on top of our processors. And the reason for that is each one of our processors carry with it an enormous amount of memory and systems and networking and the whole data center. Most of our data center products, if we can improve the throughput of a data center by another 50% or, in our case, often times we'll improve something from 2x to 4x, the way to think about that is that billion-dollar data center just improved its productivity by a factor of 2. And all of the software work that we do on top of CUDA and the incredible work that we do with optimizing compilers and graph analytics, all of that stuff then all of a sudden translates to value to our customers, not measured by dollars, but measured by hundreds of millions of dollars. And that's really the leverage of accelerated computing.",343,6.0,7.0,0.8333333333333334,0.7

Yes, listen, there's a lot of news out there. I guess some of the things I take away, first of all, Raja leaving AMD is a great loss for AMD. And it's a recognition by Intel probably that the GPU is just incredibly, incredibly important now. And the modern GPU is not a graphics accelerator. The modern GPU, we just left the word G in there -- the letter G in there. But these processors are domain-specific parallel accelerators, and they're enormously complex. They're the most complex processors built by anybody on the planet today. And that's the reason why IBM uses our processors for the world's largest supercomputers. That's the reason why every single cloud, every single -- every major cloud, every major server maker in the world has adopted NVIDIA GPUs: It's just incredibly hard to do. The amount of software engineering that goes on top of it is significant as well. And so if you look at the way we do things, we plan a road map about 5 years out. It takes about 3 years to build a new generation, and we build multiple GPUs at the same time. And on top of that, there are some 5,000 engineers working on systems software and numerics libraries and solvers and compilers and graph analytics and cloud platforms and virtualization stacks in order to make this computing architecture useful to all of the people that we serve. And so when you think about it from that perspective, it's just an enormous undertaking; arguably, the most significant undertaking of any processor in the world today. And that's the reason why we're able to speed up applications by a factor of 100. You don't walk in and have a new widget and a few transistors and all of a sudden speed up applications by a factor of 100 or 50 or 20. That's just something that's inconceivable unless you do the type of innovation that we do. And then lastly, with respect to the chip that they built together, I think it goes without saying now that the energy efficiency of Pascal GeForce and the Max-Q design technology and all of the software that we created has really set a new design point for the industry. It is now possible to build a state-of-the-art gaming notebook with the most leading-edge GeForce processors and be able to deliver gaming experiences that are many times greater than a console in 4K and have that be in a laptop that's 18 millimeters thin. The combination of Pascal and Max-Q has really raised the bar, and I think that that's really the essence of it.",444,7.0,7.0,0.8888888888888888,0.7
