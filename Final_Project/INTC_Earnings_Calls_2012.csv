I want to begin by highlighting a few of the most significant. We reinvented the transistor with our 3-D Tri-Gate technology. We unveiled a new generation of personal computers, the Ultrabook. We closed 2 large acquisitions: McAfee and Infineon Wireless Solutions. We broke ground on the world's first 14-nanometer fabs, D1X in Oregon and Fab 42 in Arizona. And our 2011 revenue and earnings were the best in Intel's history.
We surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, after crossing $40 billion for the first time just last year. This was our second consecutive year of more than 20% revenue growth. Since 2009, we have added $19 billion to the top line. The investments we've made to innovate and to expand our capabilities are paying off. Let me highlight a few examples.
As the volume of traffic crossing the Internet continues to explode, this has left companies and individuals searching for simple ways to store, manage and access this flood of information. This mega trend led to a fantastic year for our Data Center Group, with revenue up 17% on record microprocessor units, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. But this wasn't just servers. Storage revenue was up 42% to a new record high, and our Embedded Communications Infrastructure business was up 18%, also to a new record high.
Volume shipments of our Sandy Bridge server product, code-named Romley, have begun. We also demonstrated Knights Corner, the first single-chip coprocessor capable of delivering a teraflop of computing power.
Turning now to our PC business. We saw record notebook microprocessor units in 2011, as the PC Client Group grew 17%, fueled by demand in the enterprise and emerging markets, and PC users' appetites for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. The result was a second consecutive year of rising ASPs, as our mix of core CPUs increased to nearly 70%. Sandy Bridge microprocessors accounted for approximately 40% of the company's total revenue.
Emerging markets now account for 2 out of every 3 incremental units of PC demand, a shift that's rewarding Intel and the PC companies that have a long-standing, deep presence in these markets. 
Looking back at the last 12 months of reported data, emerging markets like India and Indonesia grew 22% and 37%, respectively. China, now the largest PC market in the world, represents 20% of all PC demand, and grew a remarkable 15%. Even with that, China has a household penetration rate of just 35%, versus almost 90% in the U.S. China is the world's largest market for mobile phones with more than 950 million subscribers. It's also at the forefront of the smartphone boom and will be the home of the world's first 32-nanometer smartphone.
Last week at CES, Lenovo announced the K800 smartphone based on our Medfield SoC. The K800 will be available on the China Unicom network in Q2, and will showcase Intel architecture in a phone with very competitive battery life and outstanding performance.
2011 was also a year in which we completed several important acquisitions. In the first quarter, we completed the purchase of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, formerly the Infineon Wireless division. Together, McAfee and IMC added $3.6 billion in revenue and new strategic capabilities in security and connectivity that will allow us to extend our strategies across the continuum of computing. McAfee has already announced the Deep Safe platform, around which we are building a family of products to take advantage of the combination of McAfee software and Intel silicon to deliver first-of-its-kind protection against day 0 threats.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Telmap, whose location-based search and navigation expertise will allow us to add differentiated services to Intel architecture-based devices from Ultrabooks to smartphones. As many of you know, we made several important announcements at CES last week. In addition to the Lenovo K800, we announced the Medfield-based smartphone reference design that boasts a sleek form factor, 8 hours of talk time, 6 hours of 1080p video playback and 14 days of standby power, clearly demonstrating the low-power, high-performance capabilities of Intel architecture. Yet as the performance of this device that really showcases what's possible when you combine advanced process technology and the world's most popular computer architecture. Though Medfield is our very first smartphone SoC, independent testers appointed to benchmarks to place Medfield reference design among the very best in the markets.
It was this differentiated performance and exceptional roadmap and exciting new usage models that led to our multiyear, multi-device strategic relationship with Motorola Mobility. The first of these Intel architecture-based devices will go through carrier certification this summer with commercial availability shortly thereafter. And while the Lenovo and Motorola designs are exciting first steps, we're not done making announcements in the smartphone space.
In the months ahead, we're looking forward to sharing with you a range of exciting new products. Let me highlight just a few. We'll launch Romley for servers in the first quarter. We'll launch Ivy Bridge, our first 22-nanometer product, in early spring. Ivy Bridge will improve on the graphics performance of Sandy Bridge by more than 70%. The industry will bring more than 70 new Ultrabook designs to market this year. And when Windows 8 launches, we'll be ready with both PCs and tablets.
In summary, 2011 was an outstanding year for Intel. As we look to 2012, we're excited about bringing more Intel innovations to the market. With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.",929
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3181.0,208947.0,12269055.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Paul. 2011 was our most profitable year and a year of record revenues. Revenue of $54 billion was up over $10 billion or 24% from a year ago and was our second year in a row with business growing greater than 20%. Our PC Client Group and our Data Center Group both grew at 17% year-on-year. In addition, we closed on the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division in 2011 which contributed $3.6 billion to our revenue growth.
Gross margin of 62.5% in 2011 was at the high-end of our historical range, as our investments in industry-leading manufacturing process technology continued to enable leadership products, which drove a richer mix across client and server. Spending, as a percent of revenue, was approximately flat at 29.7%. Operating income, net income and earnings per share were all records.
Non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 billion was up 18% year-on-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 25% from a year ago.
For the year, we generated a record $21 billion of cash from operations. We invested over $8 billion in research and development, $10.8 billion in capital assets, primarily building and equipping leading-edge factories; and spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions. Additionally, we paid $4.1 billion in dividends, increasing the annualized dividend per share by 33% and increasing our dividend payout ratio to 40% of free cash flow. Lastly, we used our stock repurchase program to return over $14 billion of cash to shareholders in 2011, reducing diluted shares outstanding from a year ago by roughly 450 million shares.
Total cash investments ended the year at $14.8 billion, down approximately $6.7 billion from a year ago. Fourth quarter revenue finished at $13.9 billion, up $2.4 billion and 21% from the fourth quarter of 2010.
As we announced in December, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage. As a result of the hard disk drive shortage, we saw a reduction of orders for microprocessors as customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. Despite this reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact the actual sales of personal computers in the fourth quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. 
Gross margin improved to 64.5% from the third quarter, with lower factory start-up costs as we qualified for sale our first product on 22-nanometer process technology and lower unit costs. Non-GAAP operating income of $4.8 billion was up 20% from a year ago and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 was up 21% from a year ago. 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 8% from the fourth quarter. This decline is slightly more than the average seasonal decline as we expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact our business in the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be down 1.5 points to 63%, but manufacturing costs going up as we begin to sell our first 22-nanometer product, Ivy Bridge, and ship lower volumes, when compared to the fourth quarter.
Turning to 2012. We are planning on another strong year, with revenue growth in the high single-digits and gross margin at the high end of our historical range, at 64%. Importantly, we will continue to invest in our business in 2012. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion as we build the world's first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14-nanometer process technology. We are also forecasting an increase in investment in research and development of $1.8 billion. We are making critical investments in R&D for Ultrabooks, data centers, phones and tablets. In addition, we are making R&D investments in core capabilities like security, SoCs and extending our process technology leadership.
The trends that we discussed in May drove our performance in 2011, and we expect will drive our financial performance in 2012. We expect continued strength in emerging markets as rising incomes increase the affordability of personal computers. We will continue to benefit from the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet as they've drive the build-out of the cloud infrastructure and as we expect to generate more sales in storage, communications and networking products for this segment.
Our process technology and manufacturing advantage will continue to extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio, not just in PCs and servers, but also in low-power products for phones, tablets and embedded systems. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",776

It will play out, we believe, pretty similar to this year. There'll be some unit growth, but I believe we'll also benefit from the fact that we have a very strong product portfolio and we'll benefit from a rich mix. You've seen that over the last couple of years. And if I can just take a second here, just to put the high single-digit revenue growth in perspective. If you go back to 2011 and you strip out the acquisitions and the fact that we had a 53rd week, you're left with an underlying growth rate for what I'll call the existing core business, of about 15%. You compare that to the high single-digit forecast for 2012, you see. We do expect it to come down some, that's because we expect GDP growth rates to come down a little bit and we do correlate to GDP growth rates. But still, the same kind of drivers in '12 that we saw in '11.",164

The other question I have is on unit costs. And again, in your written comments, it suggests that they'll be up for the quarter end for the year. And I wonder if you could just walk us through the puts and takes on unit costs in particular. And I guess, I'm kind of wondering if more Ivy Bridge ultimately results in reduced unit costs at some point.",68

The unit cost increase that we're seeing in Q1 and over the course of '12 is a normal phenomenon, as we're ramping new factories and new process technologies. If you go back 2 years, and you have to offset it for a different quarter, but if you go back and you look at the first 32-nanometer products, what you see is, as we're just starting to ramp those big factories, the first products are coming out, those tend to be pretty expensive products, and then the cost kind of comes down over the course of the year. It's a consistent phenomenon that we've seen before.",106

Our intention is to participate broadly in all 3 of those markets. In tablets, I think we'll be able to do that from day one, as you see the Android tablets coming out and Windows 8 tablets coming out. And you'll see us well-positioned in multiple price point on those. And who knows where those prices go over time, but our intention would be to use the advanced silicon integration capability we have to be able to drive the build material cost down, integration up in tablet space, which I think is going to be a sweet spot for Intel. On phones, our strategy is a little bit different. We're coming in at the top of the smartphone market. Our value proposition initially is aimed at best performance and very competitive feature sets and very good battery life. Over -- and then let me say on the other end of the market, the Infineon acquisition has given us a very strong position in basic phones and feature phones. They shipped 400 million modems this year into the cell phone business. So over time, what we'll want to do is grow that capability up by integrating the apps processor and the comm processors onto the same chip, while we drive our initial positions in apps processors from the top down.",225

As I look out over the next few years, we'll have success in these devices. I think they'll start to grow earnings for us out in time. It doesn't change my intermediate view of long-term gross margins.

People are very excited about the feature set and having the PC reenergized. I think initially, what you're going to see is that this will be replacement of existing notebook sales and customers and so forth. People will trade up for it. It's a very exciting new product. As we go through the course of 2012, particularly as -- and into '13, as Windows 8 machines rollout, you have the possibility, and then as I look at our design wins, the probability of many of those machines incorporating touch. At that point, it's hard to tell what the market impact is going to be because the PC now has the characteristics of the best of all tablets and very high performance-capable machine -- notebooks. So I don't know that we know how that plays out. No one knows how that plays out. What I know is that we'll be well positioned for it in any direction.",179

And one on -- follow-up on CapEx this time. So you obviously decided to raise the CapEx for this year. And -- Intel has always had a very strong lead versus competitors, 1 or 2-year lead. So I'm curious, what are the criteria that you use to decide to accelerate CapEx? Like what is the incremental benefit that this provides you? And I know that in the past year you said that you expect to get paid for it, but over what time frame? And I'm just curious as to how you make those decisions.",97
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3181.0,208947.0,12269076.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,24,"Yes, it's a good question. So I just want to come back and clarify something. The CapEx that we're spending doesn't increase our cadence of Moore's Law. We're still on a 2-year cadence, and as we have shown you in investor meetings, we would go faster if we could but we don't think the industry can keep up with us. Your point, though, is still valid and that based on everything we see from other people that are building factories, they're struggling to solve some of the same problems that the cadence that we solved. So I think our process technology lead is extending. The way we get paid for that is simple. We can put more features, more performance and bring power envelopes down faster than the competition can. I think if you look historically, we've gotten paid for that by driving cost down at a curve, and we're going to still use cost as one of the ways that we get paid here. But increasingly, if you look at the last 2-plus years, we've also gotten paid by bringing out these really capable products and driving a richer mix. And that's really been the story over the last couple of years, is by integrating the graphics transistors to end -- to our leading-edge process technology, we're creating much more capable products, we're putting other features on those products, things like WiDi and things that differentiate us from the market, and we get paid in a richer mix. And so that's where our strategy going forward is we'll have cost-reduced products, and we'll have then also a portfolio of really capable products where we drive a sell up.",279

If you step back and look at the Data Center Group in 2011, it grew revenue 17%. And if you think back to the investor meeting, we told you our plan was to grow 15% at the top line and consistent on the bottom line. We did that in '11. Based on everything we see for '12, we have high confidence that we can continue to grow at that kind of a rate. We're not going to get into a quarter-by-quarter because remember, the service business can be pretty -- the Data Center business can be pretty lumpy if there's one big customer that's buying and a big buying pattern, you'll see a pop-up and it can come down the next quarter.

The product is in high-volume production now getting ready for our customers assistance launches later this quarter and into early Q2. It provides an outstanding value proposition and a good ROI for CIOs to evaluate. I think, though, that this is not -- initially it will not drive that kind of replacement cycle that we saw for Nehalem because it's still relatively new machines. On the other hand, I think people will embrace this machine for high-capacity needs. We talked earlier about the build-out of Internet data centers, about storage and other segments in this type of Data Center and I think this product is probably the most well-rounded product we've produced in this genre so far.",153

Overall, as we look at the flood impact that you mentioned in your guidance, how should we think about that snapping back and maybe just within your guidance of being up 8% for the entire year of high single-digits, how should we think about seasonality considering the floods snapback, multiple discrete items like Ivy Bridge coming out, Romley, Windows 8, Ultrabook, et cetera?",70

There's probably more moving pieces as I look out over the next 11.5 months than I can recall for a long time, Ross. So let me start with the flood first. Our view and the view from our customers, and I talked to everybody at CES, from OEMs to OEMs, it's very consistent, is that the industry seems to be hitting the bottom of their output trough in the January, February time frame and then it starts recovering from there. Everything we've seen so far suggests that anyone on Earth who wanted to buy a PC has been able to buy a PC. There's not -- there may be some spot stockouts of a particular SKU at a particular store, but all of our channels are still showing pretty good sales outgrowth and that seems a strong indicator as we go through this underlying demand. I think that you will see -- we have seen a compression of the supply chain that hit us very dramatically in the fourth quarter and was the result of the driver for our pre-announcement. And it's also the driver, as Stacy said, for our being under seasonality in Q1. We think that there's likely to be some refilling of those pipes in the second quarter, early third quarter, as the supply lines come back in normalcy. On the other hand, it's very possible that people just learned to live with leaner inventories, which is always very good for us. As a result, we see a more nonlinear, more second half loaded year this year than we've seen for quite some time, in terms of CPU shipments, not necessarily for a PC shipments.",282

We have a strong product line. We’ve generated a strong mix. I think maintaining that is probably a pretty likely case. And then what we're watching is with Ultrabooks, as they ramp into the -- a much higher percentage of the consumer market in the back half of the year, that could give us a little bit of an oomph, but I'm not counting on that -- my gross margin forecast, but it certainly one of the things we'd like to see happen. You also have to keep in mind that one of the less bright spots for us in 2011 was that netbooks were way down. And so I'm going to see kind of a natural mixing up as I go from '10 to '11 and '11 to '12 with less netbooks and a large percentage of the total being Core.",157

And how does that capacity kind of layer on over the course of the year? And then the follow-up part and parcel of that, so that we can just kill everything at once, is what is the assumption around factory loadings as that capacity growth ramps over the course of the year?",76

So first, let's talk about what's driving the capital spending. And I'll be the first to admit when I see numbers like the $10.8 billion in 2011 and $12.5 billion for 2012, those are big numbers. I have to step back and look at it against the context of how much our business has grown. We were up 25% from '09 to '10, we're up 24% from '10 to '11, so it's more than 50% growth in 2 years. Put another way, it's almost $20 billion of incremental revenue over the course of that time period. When you look at that in that context, it makes sense. And just to give you one other data point that at least helps me be comfortable here, I think my depreciation as a percent of revenue in 2012 stays in a healthy range. So I think that gives me some comfort. In terms of the makeup of the specific capital in '12, it's more heavily weighted than what we've historically seen to building buildings. And Andy told you in the investor meeting that we've kind a -- it's a 2-year cycle and we're building buildings. So we're seeing that it's more than 1/3 of the total capital in '12. I think that piece starts to come down in '13. And remember, that piece has a much longer useful life which means we depreciated over a much longer period of time. The equipment piece actually comes down from '11 to '12, and that's a little more -- it's heavily weighted towards 14-nanometer equipment that we're putting in place. So that's kind of the makeup of the capital. In terms of utilizations, we're running full out today. We're just at the beginning edge of 22-nanometer. Every unit that we can get out there, we can sell. So we're running the new stuff full out. We did take a little bit of advantage in Q4 based on the hard disk drive shortage. We took some older generation capacity off-line to avoid putting some older generation product in inventory and we utilize that equipment, as you've seen us do before, to offset -- to go a little faster on 22-nanometer. So those are responsive things that we do. But I think we're running full out today, and I think will be nicely loaded over the course of 2012.",410

But you should, based on what Paul told you in terms of how we're viewing the impact of the hard disk drive shortage, it says we have a back-end-loaded year from a unit standpoint that will clearly give us a little bit of a tailwind. You also have to remember that those first wafers that come off the line for 22-nanometer, these are big factories, the very first products are coming off the line now. Those tend to be pretty expensive and that cost comes down over the course of the year as well. So those are things that give you a tailwind into the back half of the year -- give me tailwind over the back half of the year.",131

Can I just go back to the question of channel inventory? I mean, you described it as historically lean.

But let's assume that we get to the hard disk drive issue and inventory were to go back to normal levels. Where are we now? Can you quantify where these historically low levels are? And if we went back to normal, how much more weeks of inventory do you think your distributors need to carry to sustain what should be a fairly robust second half of the year?",112

So we're talking about something – a correction, that's in the order of a week, Uche. It's not like this is a months’ worth of inventory. And really, as much as that can get compensated for, in either direction, by the decisions of OEMs to put things on boats versus airplanes. And so I think while there's still a shortage of drives, you're going to see more use of planes, shipping things from Asia to the end markets. And depending on how things, how fast things recover, you may see people go back to boats, which puts a bit more buffer into the system. It's on the order of a week, not in the order of a month.",141

It almost certainly comes down more in Q1 and our view is in that that's the level of inventory that they can live with. They just -- they may not go all the way back up to the previews inventory levels. We see that as these things play out. And as Paul said, over time, leaner inventory levels in the supply chain and then the kind of things we can do to be just in time, they actually make the supply chains much more efficient. They benefit our business over time.",106

I said that core is approximately 70% of our mix already and I don't know that that's going to go 90%, and there's no way it's going likely down to 50%. So I think we're sort of in -- it's historically high for our premium brand, but I think we're in the sweet spot for what we're going to see, certainly the bulk of 2012 because the Ultrabooks are going to be Core-centric. And what we can't yet predict is the mix between i3, i5 and i7. Right now, the stuff that's sold in Christmas and into January were a very good mix of i5s and i7s, but the price points were $8.99, $9.99. As we move towards the second half of the year, and price points come down maybe as low as $6.99, the mix may come down a bit to i3s. But I still think you're going to see people position this as a premium product. Their industry is enjoying a little sell-up around it. In terms of a target, what we said before is that our goal this year will be to exit the year at about 40% of consumer notebooks being Ultrabook.",207

Is this conservatism? Or is this kind of the penalty you're paying as depreciation grows relative to the CapEx spending?",67

I don't think I'm being overly conservative, although I certainly hope so. And it's not a higher depreciation cost. Again, my depreciation as a percent of revenue, looks like it stays in a nice, healthy range. It's the unit cost penalty associated with the ramping 4 big 22-nanometer factories. Again, those are big factories and the first wafers off the line are pretty expensive. And so that will cause a little bit of an offset to the good news that I expect that we're going to see based on start-up costs and the higher platform revenue.",102

So if I try and get to the high single-digit revenue growth that you guys have guided for this year, even assuming some of that inventory correction comes back into sales, it's still, I think, like several billion dollar jump above normal seasonality in the second half. So I mean do you -- how do we get there? Do you guys expect tablets and phones? Do you expect further price increases? Can you just maybe take us through that?",85

So I think if you're pointing to that we have a nonseasonal unit forecasting, the answer is yes, for the reasons Paul said. And again, based on what we've seen so far, sales of PCs look to be pretty seasonal. We think what's going to happen is the industry is going have to go through some kind of extraordinary measures to make sure PCs are getting to the right place to be sold, with very low inventory levels out there, and that pipeline starts to refill in Q2 and causes us to have more of our units in the back half. This isn't predicated on us magically winning half of the phone market. We're super excited to get those first products in the market, as Paul said, they have critical acclaim, but they don't move the needle from the standpoint of revenue or profit this the year.

So spending as a percent of revenue will come up in 2012 and we expect it'll come down over time. If you deconstruct what we're doing in 2012, my opinion is we're making some significant but prudent incremental investments in some critical areas. We made a lot of progress in terms of where we are with Ultrabooks, where we are with phones and tablets. We're going to make some investments there. In addition, we're making some investments in our Server business. You've seen us moving our product line from just focusing on servers to broader products in the Data Center that are focused on storage and communications and networking. You're going to see us continue to do that. And then underlying that, there's some core capabilities for the company around SoC integration, communications technology, security, process technology.

I think the thing is, tablets are a little bit about hardware and an awful lot about software. And I think that until you get to Ice Cream Sandwich, the offering isn't as powerful as what's out there with Apple. And as the Ice Cream Sandwich tablets start shipping, I think you'll start seeing a little bit better receptivity, Google just added the music store, the videos are better, everything got a little bit better bit ICS. And so I think the better test is year 2 here, in terms of is there anyone that can compete with the iPad? And then the other part of that test, of course, is the Windows 8 tablets that are being queued up for production. So I don't know that the whole tablet thing is settled down by any stretch, and I do have a lot of interest in, if you heard me at CES about these hybrid and convertible designs as they apply to clamshells, where there's a significant blurring between what people do with tablets and what people do with PCs. So the jury is out on I think the long-term segmentation by form factor. But I do think you'll see more progress on the Android side as a result of ICS.",232

And if so, how should we think about that through the year? Should that track similar to PCs in terms of back half loaded? Or should that see a nice bump up in Q2?",62

We didn't see softness in the Server business in Q4. It may have jumped out at you that the year-over-year comp was down a little bit, it was 8% versus higher comps but if you go back to Q4 of last year, we had a Q4 of '10, we had an extraordinary strong quarter there. If I recall right, it was almost 30% growth from Q3 to Q4 of '10. So we're still seeing a nice, secular growth trend in servers and that's what we saw in Q4 and that's what we expect...",108

There's other elements in there around storage and networking equipment. And the other big element of that is the sales to the large Internet data centers that are being built up around the world. I think Stacy talked about that last quarter. Those sales were lumpy. They tend to be a function of when Facebook or Google or Amazon decides to turn on a new Data Center and they buy x 100,000 units. Or there's a new generation and they want to have a quick complete swap out. And as a result, we're seeing a change to the historical linearity that we saw in this -- in the enterprise Data Center business for many years. So I think you should probably get used to a little bit more lumpiness here and look at the overall year-on-year growth, which is what we've been trying to discuss at the last couple of analyst meetings.",178

You said as you enter the smartphone market more broadly, as you moved on to mid-end and low-end smartphones, you mentioned that it makes sense to integrate Medfield with the baseband that you had with Infineon. I'm just wondering what should we be thinking in terms of the timeframe for that solution. And also, as a follow-up, I'm just curious, given that all the smartphones also have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS and then [ph]. Do you have that capability today internally? If not, what's your strategy for those components?",97

A lot of that came with the acquisition from the Infineon group. And that's got 2G, 3G, they have an LTE solution underway. We've had Wi-Fi forever, and we've had Bluetooth for many years. So all of those are being integrated into our comms capabilities. In fact, we've integrated those business units now into a single unit to be able to accelerate that. I did not say, I want to be very clear, I did not say that our intent would be to integrate Medfield to baseband. I said over time, you'll see us move from the low-end baseband-only business in the feature phones and value phones to having it a more integrated capability. I didn't say when and what generation. I'm really not at liberty to discuss that. But the major thrust over the next year or 2 is going to be to have very high-performance modems as a comps processor and the best-of-class apps processors for smartphones.",166

What are the implications for CapEx?",23
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3181.0,208947.0,12269125.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,73,"So I hinted at it I think in the previous answer. If you look at the spending of CapEx for 2012, and this is consistent with what we said last year. It's a big component of it, but historically large component of it, is actually building the facilities, these 4 factory model that we've been talking about. We've got big construction projects underway. They start to taper off. From here, our CapEx, really, will be a function of 2 things: it's the unit growth that we see going forward, and it's the speed at which we bring capabilities to that leading-edge process technology. And I think graphics has been the classic example of that. As we move that to the process edged to the leading-edge process technology, it did drive an increase in CapEx but it also drove a really capable product line that we got paid for. So we balance off those decisions as we go forward. A big increase in units would say that we'll continue to spend CapEx to support those units. If it's less than that, then CapEx is less. It becomes a pretty -- a more traditional relationship going forward.",195

And then secondly, as we look at the balance sheet and the capital structure, you've taken on some debt in the fourth quarter. Can you frame for us, is that about the right level, a comfortable level for you? Are you capable of taking on more debt? Did  you look for potentially flexibility to buy back more stock, et cetera, in 2012?",65
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2012",2012-01-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3181.0,208947.0,12269127.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,75,"Well, let me separate out those quarters. At the end of this, I'm not going to make a prospective statement on buybacks or debt. But our balance sheet certainly supports us taking on more debt. We have a relatively low amount of debt for a company of our size. So if we had a strategic need or decided that we wanted to take on more debt to buy back stock and recapitalize the company, we certainly have the capability of doing so. I'll come back to our capital structure philosophy. We've said in the past that our first priority is investing in our business. I think if you look at 2011, it's a perfect example of that, we've made some significant investments in research and development in CapEx. We bought it, we bought back and we bought the Infineon Wireless division that we believe bring really important capabilities, as well as nice business models into the company. Second priority is the dividend. We had a pretty significant increase in the dividend in 2011, and we've increased the amount of dividend as a percent of free cash flow in terms of our target. And we're kind of right in there now. And then third is buying back stock and you saw us do a pretty significant amount of stock buyback. We did take advantage in 2011 of fairly low interest rates and high dividend yields to accelerate that some,  and it probably didn't escape you noticed that we bought back $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, which I think is probably our largest quarter of buybacks ever. So all that's true. I'm not going to talk prospectively, though, about more debt or the size of the buyback. That's not how we do it.",292

The first quarter played out much as we expected, with ongoing strong demand in emerging markets and in the enterprise being offset by continuing softness in the mature market consumer segments. PC consumption in the BRIC countries experienced solid double-digit growth over the first quarter of the year -- of last year. In addition, we see continued momentum in IP Data Center solutions, from servers to networking to storage, across both mature and emerging markets.
Our commitment to long-term research and development is paying off. We are beginning a year of major product and technology transitions that will have a very positive impact on our company and the industry. I'd like to highlight a few examples. We are ramping our 22-nanometer manufacturing process into high volume. This revolutionary technology uses our third-generation, high-k metal gate and the industry's first 3D Tri-Gate Transistors.
The move to Tri-Gate Transistors delivers roughly twice the improvement in transistor performance over conventional planar scaling when applied to low-power applications like smartphones and Ultrabooks. We combine our process technology, manufacturing and design to produce a highly leveraged business model that is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. That model allows us to do things others can't, like advancing our Atom roadmap at twice the rate of Moore's Law through 2014.
We're doing this at a time when the rest of the industry is struggling to ramp older technologies that lag our prior-generation, 32-nanometer process. Our research on 3D transistors began over 10 years ago, and advancements like this don't come easily. In fact, they're getting harder and harder to achieve, and our lead over the rest of the industry continues to grow, giving us product advantages in power, performance and cost.
Ultrabooks are reinventing computing with new form factors, high performance, better battery life, advanced security and other exciting new features. With more than 21 designs already shipping and more than 100 designs in the pipeline for 2012, we're very pleased with our progress. And yet, this is just the beginning. Earlier this month, we launched our largest advertising campaign in a decade. And over the next few months, we expect Ultrabooks to reach mainstream price points. By the holiday season, we expect the touch interfaces and innovative new hybrid designs will combine the convenience of a tablet with the performance and productivity of a notebook for truly no-compromise devices and experiences.
Global trends in data centers also continue to look favorable. We expect that by 2015, IP traffic will triple and data storage needs will grow by about 50%. This isn't just a mature market phenomenon. Data centers in China have grown at 8x the worldwide average over the last 5 years, making it the second-largest server market in the world.
The Xeon E5 processor, code-named Romley, was engineered with exactly these trends in mind, improving performance up to 80% and performance per watt more than 50% over the prior generation. One month after launch, Romley has shipped nearly twice the volume of Nehalem at the same point in its ramp.
At IDF Beijing last week, we also provided details about our upcoming Atom-based microserver System on Chip, code-named Centerton. Centerton will launch in the second half of the year with 2 cores, 64-bit capability, ECC and virtualization technology, all in a 6-watt power envelope delivering outstanding performance and power efficiency with unmatched software compatibility.
This quarter, we made significant progress in smartphones as well. Following our announcements with Lenovo and Motorola at CES, we followed on at Mobile World Congress with announced designs with Orange, ZTE and Lava, as well as a strategic partnership with Visa for mobile payments.
And finally, McAfee posted its best first quarter bookings in the company's history. McAfee's Deep Defender security product, the first fruit of McAfee and Intel's collaboration, also successfully blocked the day-0 Cridex worm attack, missed by many other antivirus systems, demonstrating the value of our hardware plus software security strategy.
Looking ahead, our expectations for 2012 remain unchanged, and Q2 will bring several exciting announcements. We've already begun high-volume shipment of Ivy Bridge products, and you will soon see system availability. Ivy Bridge will be our fastest ramping product ever, comprising nearly 1/4 of our microprocessor volume in Q2 alone and crossing over 50% of our microprocessor shipments this fall. And we expect to see another important milestone for our business later this week with the launch of the world's first Intel architecture-based smartphone.
Q1 was a solid quarter, and it provides a great step up -- setup for the year of important transitions built on a foundation of growing process technology leadership and the performance, compatibility and power efficiency of Intel architecture.
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.",794
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3081.0,284850.0,14002017.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Paul. The first quarter results came in slightly better than our expectations. From a revenue standpoint, the first quarter came in at $12.9 billion, slightly better than expected. Similar to the fourth quarter, our business was negatively impacted by hard disk drive shortages and the resulting additional reduction of inventories across the supply chain.  Despite this discontinued reduction in inventory levels, it is our belief that the shortage did not impact actual sales of personal computers in the first quarter, with demand trends playing out as expected. Our expectation of high single-digit revenue growth for 2012 is unchanged.
For the second quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 5% from the first quarter and a return to year-on-year growth. This is better than the average seasonal decline of down 1%, as we see the beginning of the refilling of the PC supply chain as hard disk drive shipments recover.
Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin of 64% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the fourth quarter. Our forecast for 2012 was unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the second quarter is 62%. As we move into the second quarter, we will be ramping up our Ivy Bridge production in 3 new 22-nanometer factories, resulting in an increase in unit costs.
As we progress through the year, we expect unit costs to come quickly down the cost curve, resulting in second-half gross margins improving from the first half.
For the first quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.4 billion. We are maintaining our spending forecast for the year at $18.3 billion. As we move into the second quarter, we are forecasting a $200 million increase to spending when compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by the start of our Ultrabook marketing campaign. We expect spending as a percent of revenue to come down in the second half.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter. We generated approximately $3 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had $1.5 billion of stock repurchases.
Inventory grew by approximately $400 million, with more than all of our growth attributed to our ramp of Ivy Bridge. On a unit basis, our microprocessor inventory went down from the fourth quarter.
Our first quarter results and our forecast for the second quarter are consistent with our expectations at the start of the year and reinforce our expectations for 2012. Against the backdrop of the worldwide shortage of hard disk drives and continued macroeconomic weakness in the mature markets, our execution remains strong.
We are in the midst of an unprecedented refresh of our product line across segments of our business. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramp rates will be significantly faster than their predecessors. Our manufacturing lead continues to extend with 3 new 22-nanometer factories ramping in the second quarter and a fourth factory ramping in the second half. Additionally, we are winning designs in embedded smartphones and tablets that will add to our growth rate over the long term. We are making investments in our business which bring us competitive advantage, and we are using the cash flow we are generating to increase shareholder returns. We will talk more about all of these trends at our next month's investor meeting. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",601

It sounds like the entire hit is just the ramp of the Ivy Bridge. I just want to get a little bit of understanding. Was this an unexpected unit cost uptick? Or is there something different going on with the yield curve with Ivy Bridge at 22 than you had anticipated?",61
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3081.0,284850.0,14002021.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,7,"No, it's absolutely consistent with my expectations when I started the year. Maybe it's worthwhile. It's been 2 years since we've gone through a process transition; that was the 32-nanometer transition. So let me just take a second to go through a tutorial on how the cost accounting works as we go through one of these. We have 3 new 22 nanometer factories. And at the beginning of that ramp, the first units that go through those factories in essence absorbs all of the cost of those factories. So that is, by far, the most expensive part of the ramp. Those are the products that are today sitting in inventory. And as we ramp up sales in Q2, those will be the products that we sell-through. And so the result of that from a cost accounting standpoint is we'll have a peak in unit cost in the second quarter, and then we come down nicely in Q3 and nicely again into Q4 as those factories ramp. And as I said, it's consistent with what I thought at the beginning of the year, and it's consistent with what we saw with 32 nanometer. If you go back and look at the same quarter, you'll see that same peak in unit cost. The difference there was it was 2 factories and today it's 3 factories because of the speed at which we're ramping Ivy Bridge.",233

To achieve that this year, given the March quarter run rate, it kind of implies a pretty healthy ramp to about $3 billion a quarter for the next 3 quarters. Is that kind of how we should expect the Romley ramp to play out? Or if you can give us some guidance around that, that'd be helpful.",96
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3081.0,284850.0,14002023.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,9,"I'll give you a little color around it, then I'll let Stacy handle the CAGRs and the dollars per quarter. We went into very high volume production on the enterprise version of Romley, which is the EP version in March, and that was the data point I gave you in terms of 2x the volume of Nehalem. In anticipation of that, I think there was a bit of a lull on Nehalem shipments in the first part of Q1 from our customers as they knew this transition was coming. So that was really part of the profile of the quarter. And particularly, if you look year-over-year, remember last year, we had some large deliveries of products to some Internet data center customers that -- I think Stacy described that as being very lumpy in terms of their demand. And that's Q1 of last year, as well as the 14th week. So when you adjust for those factors, I really don't see anything on our Data Center business that puts us off-track from the numbers that we committed to in terms of the 15% CAGR. And yes, we do expect double-digit growth in the second half of the year for this product line.",203

Actually, I'd just add to that. I would expect the Data Center Group -- I think Paul did a really nice job of describing the Q1 compare. As I think about Q2, we would expect the Data Center Group to get back to double-digit growth. And then as we move into the back half of this year, it's growth rates that are at or above the historical average. So it's -- it's expected to grow, and we're still committed to the goals that we talked about last May of doubling the business over the next 5 years. And the trends that are driving it are still intact.",108

So you obviously got hit by it in Q1. You're seeing a bit of a snapback in Q2. You said you're not -- in your CFO commentary, you said you weren't forecasting any more negative impact. But is a possible -- is a positive impact possible? Have we seen all the snapback you think that we're going to see from the hard drives coming back? Or is there potential for further-above seasonal growth coming in the back half? How should we think about overall seasonality in the wake of the hard drive situation through the rest of the year?",111

Thanks. This is Stacy. And actually, I'd characterize Q2 as being -- our forecast is pretty consistent with underlying demand, and that I think the inventory replenishment really kicks in as we get into Q3. So let me kind of talk through what I think hard disk drives have done to the shipment of PCs. Q4 was obviously impacted significantly as the impact of the Thailand floods reduced the amount of hard disk drives out there. And as we said on the January call, people weren't buying processors because they couldn't marry that with a hard disk drive and make the system. And so we saw a significant reduction of inventory levels. I think that reduction actually continued into Q1. So we saw further reduction of the worldwide supply chain. What you see in Q2, I believe, is pretty indicative of in-demand, just the fact that you have a Q1 that's depressed because of that contraction in the supply chain. And then what I think happens in Q3 is that's where you're going to really start to see the replenishment of the worldwide supply chain for PCs, and it's a combination of: they're going to replenish the supply chain with Ivy Bridge as opposed to doing it with older-generation technology, and it's anticipation of a good Q4. We have lots of catalysts in the marketplace that we think are driving a reasonable amount of excitement for how sales could go at the end of this year.",249

So this quarter, gross margins came in a little bit better than expected, and it looked like it was because your platform unit costs were better than expected. Next quarter, on at least versus where the Street was, it looks like gross margin is coming a little worse, and it looks like it's probably because of higher-than-expected gross margins -- higher-than-expected platform and unit costs. I know there have been some fluff floating around of push outs on Ivy Bridge. Is this -- should we take this as, I guess, some sort of evidence that the initial ramp of Ivy Bridge actually did see a bit of a push up from Q1 into Q2? I mean, how did that ramp versus what's going now compare with your original expectations as in back in January when you gave the gross margin guidance for the quarter?",159

We shifted the launch of Ivy Bridge out 3 weeks, yes. And so what that means is we sold through a little less Ivy Bridge in Q1. Those products were in inventory. And then that's the Q2 impact that I talked to you on cost. So Ivy Bridge really explains the little bit of good news in Q1 and then the Q2 gross margin forecast. And again, that Q2 margin forecast is consistent with what I thought when I started the year. It's just Q1 was a little better.",92

But what we're seeing -- and remember, we're comparing to a 14-week quarter back in Q1 of '11. But in general when you step back and look at what's happening in the different businesses, what we see is that the notebook segment of the market continues to grow nicely on a unit basis. Emerging markets continues to grow, and that tends to be a bit more desktop-centric. Enterprise was relatively strong and then we saw some weakness in mature-market consumer. Those kind of play through the different segments. But if your question is are we continuing to see notebook market growth, we did in Q1 when you look at the actual demand for computers relative to where we were a year ago and relative to what you'd expect seasonally.",140

And there's a lot of interest in these new generation, all-in-one desktop. If you haven't seen them, they're pretty attractive machines. And then the second launch of the products is in the dual core, which is the mainstream notebooks. So I think that helps put a profile over the course of quarter as well.",83

You talked about being able to achieve mainstream pricing in a few months. Can you just talk about where you were able to make changes -- helping your customers make changes in the bill of material? I know you said up -- a $300 million fund to help achieve some of those improvements. Given the way these Ultrabooks look compared to regular PCs, I just kind of want to know how much were you able to achieve improvements to achieve those mainstream pricing. And how much of those improvements are proprietary to Intel, given your investment in taking costs down?",112

The Ultrabook fund really hasn't kicked in to where it's yielding near-term bill of materials reductions, Uche. We're making those investments now. Some of them have to do with capacity that's coming online for the second half of this year, particularly around capacitive touch screens, to be able to make sure that those come down in price. The biggest changes are, quite frankly, just competition. When you -- I talked about 21 designs shipping now, another -- over 100 more coming through the second half of this year. That's driving volume and it's driving people to be competitive on some of these previously niche sort of technologies. And I'll give you one example. ASUS is now shipping a very low profile, 500-gig hard drive into an Ultrabook, something that we didn't think was possible. Yet they've found the technology to do this, and that helps give them an advantage. And I think you'll see other customers do that. The biggest change and the one that we're really focused on is trying to make sure that we intercept the Windows 8 launch with sufficient quantities of Ultrabooks that have touch enabled. And up to now, touch has been a fairly -- almost a $100 adder to cost, the bill of materials cost, and we've seen that come down very dramatically over the last 60, 90 days. As we've worked it and as more and more customers have committed to SKUs, that drives the volume. So the combination of all of these things, of the OEMs and Taiwan Inc. aiming at these volume opportunities is really what's driving prices and costs down.",271

Any -- do you feel -- think you'll be able to achieve 40% of consumer notebooks and Ultrabooks exiting in 2012? And any update as to enterprise adoption of Ultrabooks?

I'm still very confident we can do that. All the signs are tracking there. I mean, everything we've looked at since we first gave that number set has gotten more positive. More designs, better price points, et cetera, et cetera, lower costs. So all the first derivative indicators are very positive around that. In terms of enterprise adoption, enterprise tends to be a little bit slower. A lot of enterprises like our vPro technology, the vPro-based SKUs for Ultrabooks I think come out this summer, first ones, and then start ramping over the course of the year. I will say that hasn't stopped the people in this room from having Ultrabooks. As I look around the table, most of them are Ultrabooks. So this enterprise, for one, is adopting them.",135

I'll say for Q1, JoAnne, our mix was quite healthy. We didn't see any significant shift in mix. Generally I think as we progress through the year, what we're going to see is relative strength based on the strength of the Ivy Bridge product line and the Romley product line in their respective segments. And then we're likely to see some price competition at the low end of the market that all kind of plays into my benign pricing environment that I expect for the year.

And that's been true sort of year in, year out for a long time. The trend that is underlying that, though, is that more and more businesses are allowing their employees to bring any kind of computer they want into the office. And so you're seeing a bit less rigidity around that number than we've seen in the past, and it tends to get a little bit more mixed.

And I'll talk more about the segments of the business in May. But between Ultrabooks and the rest of the client business, we've got a great cost structure and a rich mix. And I think you can kind of see it in the overall results. If you just do the gross margin math for the company between our Q1 actual, our Q2 forecast, we kind of average 63% for the first half.

I think a lot of that has -- has to depends on -- if you look at people buying tablets today, particularly in the iPad arena, there are people that have started out PCs and very often still use PCs. And it's a complimentary device. How that unfolds 2, 3 years from now, I don't think anyone knows. What I am very excited about, and I alluded to this in my opening comments, is this notion of bringing the convenience, the thin-ness, the instant-on capability and the touch of a tablet combined with the productivity, the compatibility and the usefulness of a keyboard into the same device. And you'll see a number of these shipping second half of this year as the energies of our OEMs and the ODMs gets unleashed into this category.

I think at the base of your question, it's probably going up less than you were anticipating. This comes back to my comment in the January call. You have to keep in mind that a pretty large proportion of our capacity or our CapEx in 2012 is in building factories, and that has a much longer depreciation schedule than does putting equipment into the factories. I think back in January I said it was over 1/3. I actually refined that later in the quarter and said it was more like 40% of the total amount of CapEx that we're spending this year is going to be on buildings and fabs as opposed to equipment. So I think that's why you're seeing less of an impact to depreciation than maybe your historical models would suggest.",169

Actually, it should be higher than normal seasonal. And I've heard your comment on Data Center being very strong. But if we looked across PC clients, maybe a potential for handsets or a micro server or maybe software, where do you see the above seasonal strength coming from in the back half of the year?",82

There's not much of a replenishment in Q2. And then as Ivy Bridge ramps in, as people gear up for the kind of normal Q4 selling season, we expect inventory levels to replenish some in the third quarter. That's the biggest shift and we talked about that at the beginning of the year. That's what kind of causes the shift of units to the back half.",85

Second question, Paul, is for you. As you talked to your customers or your potential customers in handset, can you talk about to what extent 2 things matter to them? One, your technology roadmap, particularly as you're able to talk to them about 14 nanometer? And then two, just the fact that you actually have or will have the capacity available -- because obviously elsewhere, we're seeing very tight supply on what's now 28-nanometer.",77

Then there's 2 classes of handset customers. There's obviously the traditional OEM manufacturers, and we've announced a number of those; but there's also carriers that are interested in doing a private label, and we've announced one of those with Orange in Europe. And the relationships that we have with carriers globally are pretty strong, and they go back a number of years. And those are -- those have to do with a lot of the work that Intel has done in their data centers and in the reconfiguration of the cellular network infrastructure. As both classes of customers look at the handset roadmap, what they want to do is find ways to provide differentiation from what's out there and service platforms for themselves. That's where the other element of our strategy, the non-silicon element of our strategy, becomes much more critical. And so what's our security roadmap as it relates to that? What's our location-based services capability? What kinds of sensors can we build into the handset? All of those are really hardware-centric features that employ software that allow someone to create a service annuity stream. That discussion is much more sophisticated and complex than just showing a roadmap. And that's the level that we're at today with most customers.",235

I think you mentioned earlier that the BCG group would start growing double-digits. Did you mean year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter in that second quarter comment? And how should we think about the contribution of the network and storage traction that you really hadn't been addressing as much in the past?,53

And thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. So yes, when I think about BCG, I'm always doing year-over-year comps because of the growth rate of that business. And I'll hold off, I think, on going through the various segments of the BCG business. We will talk a lot about that in May. But if I take you back to what we said last May, which I still believe to be true, we're seeing secular demand drivers that are driving the classic server business, and that's the build-out of these big IP data centers. And then from an Intel perspective, we're benefiting by the fact that our architecture is now extending into things like storage and networking and even some of the backplane infrastructure in the data center, and so that's giving us added growth. But we'll go through that in a lot more detail in May.",149

And the follow-up question is one for Paul, and it's a bigger-picture manufacturing one. In your preamble, you mentioned about Intel being able to do things others couldn't from a manufacturing point of view. To that end, as you're able to pull further ahead of the competition on Moore's Law, how should we think about that benefit manifesting itself, either strategically for Intel or on the types of markets you can address, the revenue growth margins or even the business model implications that you can do with things like potentially entering the foundry business, et cetera?",97
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 17, 2012",2012-04-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3081.0,284850.0,14002079.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,65,"Well, the business model that we have today is one that I'm extremely comfortable with and we're working as hard as possible to maintain, which is -- and I described this last year in the analyst meeting. As compared to other non-integrated device manufacturers, we get paid twice for our products. We get paid the equivalent of a foundry margin, and we get paid the equivalent of an architectural margin and that allows us to generate fairly nice margins. So as long as we can fill up all of the factories we can build with Intel products at those kinds of rewards in terms of the ROI, that makes the most sense for us. Are there opportunities out in time to take advantage of the lead that we're building in areas like foundry? Yes, perhaps, and I've said that before. And you've seen some small announcements to that effect, where we've signed up some companies for some foundry activity over the next several years. I would look at those, and I would ask you to look at those as being learning experiences for us. A lot of the work we're doing here is to build the libraries, the tools that allow us as a company and our designers of the company to be able to use quick time to market, quick derivative capabilities, modularity for our SoC businesses going forward. And the best way to test those is to have some third-party customers to really validate how good they are, how -- or where they need some work. So it's a learning expense for us. It is for profit, it is not done strictly for -- just to get to know how to do this. And in terms of where it goes long term, I'll leave that point open.",299

We'll have 25% of our shipment volume in Q2 coming from Ivy Bridge on 22 nanometer. And it's just an incredibly fast ramp rate. And even compared to what we did on 32 nanometer, that's a lot faster than what we're able to do. So we can just transition the market to these great new products. And I think you've seen some of the non-integrated models where they really struggle with ramp rates and yields and things like that. So it's a benefit in the long term to the product lineup, and it's a benefit tactically to our ability to transition the product line.",135

As my follow-up, can you just maybe give us your sense of just the trend in PC demand out there?

And the question I've been asking everyone as they come through here is do you see the year any differently than you did 3 months ago, the last time we were all together face-to-face? And the answer is universally no. It's -- this is playing out exactly as we had predicted so far. It's only 3 months into the year. But given that we now have line of sight to Q2 and we've sort of worked our way through the HDD morass, it's feeling pretty good. As I look out towards the second half of the year, it doesn't take a lot to deliver the kind of numbers we're talking about. Stacy gave an indication of our view of some inventory refill around Ivy Bridge as that ramps up. I'll remind you that we are going into a new -- a year where we have a new version of Microsoft operating system, and that traditionally has been very strong for the industry. And this particular version gives us the opportunity to participate with a mainstream operating system around touch, and I'm very excited about that. So you add those things up, and I think the battle for the consumer dollars even in a soft consumer environment can be -- is not going to be as clear anti-PC as it perhaps was last year. And lastly, we're not going to get trapped into giving numbers, but we do feel a little bit validated about the fact that the third-party analysts raised their numbers to equal ours, particularly around the desktop business, which has been a point of difference between us. Also, we're looking for a relatively decent year with strength in emerging markets in all segments, strength in enterprise globally and continuing softness in the Western Europe and potentially United States markets.",314

But cash is coming down because your free cash flow is kind of neutral. And then obviously, with the dividends and buybacks, that's drawing the cash level down. How low do you feel comfortable drawing down the cash and still feeling like you're in a tremendous capital position that gives you an advantage?",82

I think you want to be a little careful on the free cash flow generated in Q1 relative to the long-term trend. You have a couple of issues in Q1. First is it's pretty depressed, given what happened with hard disk drives. And as our business recovers, the cash flow is going to improve. And then secondly, remember there's things we accrue for all year long. We have big payments in Q1. That's kind of a couple of billion dollars worth of shift in free cash flow. So that's on the free cash flow side. In terms of cash balances, what -- we don't peg a specific number out there, although I think, as you know, we have very specific conversations with the board. I think you can see in the first quarter, we're obviously pretty comfortable with our cash balances. They changed a little bit, but we've kind of been now bouncing around this number for a couple of quarters.",165

I mean, I think this is -- that just helps. And what you're going to see is an incredible amount of differentiation from $699 to $1,299. And I love that. People are doing different experiments with different screen sizes. I talked earlier about convertibles and hybrids and slide-out keyboards and things like that. Some people are putting touch in, which is a cost adder. I really don't see the need to get to those price points to deliver the value proposition. The price points make everything work better because it lowers the bill of material's cost on some of these previously very expensive niche components.",126

I mean, the Ultrabook, even as we hit our numbers, we said that's going to be 40% of consumer notebooks at year end. So that's still not the majority of PCs. I think the general issue is that this has been a market which, as we've talked about, has not had a lot of new and exciting products the last few years.

Against a backdrop of mixed macroeconomic trends, our business in the second quarter played out largely as we expected. We continue to enjoy a rich mix of products in both the PC and Data Center Group, and our distributor channel had its best Q2 in 5 years.
Our Technology and Manufacturing Group, once again, delivered fantastic results. Our 22-nanometer process help [ph] is ahead of where 32 nanometers was at the same point in its ramp and ahead of our own plans. That enabled us to ramp Ivy Bridge to nearly 1/4 of our PC volume, our fastest ramp ever. We also announced an important agreement with ASML last week that we expect will accelerate the developments and deployment of 450-millimeter and EUV lithography technologies by up to 2 years and deliver significant value to our shareholders.
Ultrabooks continued to build momentum and achieved our volume goals for the first half. We are very pleased with the level of innovation and invention being brought into this category and are now tracking over 140 Ivy Bridge-based designs in the pipeline. Of those, more than 40 will be touch-enabled and a dozen will be convertibles. With visibility into this many designs, we are very confident that we'll see $699 systems at retail this fall. We are also tracking more than 20 Windows 8 tablet designs based on our low-power and low-cost Clover Trail Atom SoC in addition to a number of core-based tablets. 
In our Data Center business, volume growth combined with a rich mix drove record server revenues. In fact, the mix of 2 of our highest-performing Romley products was more than 2x that of the prior generation Westmere at the same point in its ramp. DCG grew 15% over the second quarter last year, with cloud volume growing at more than twice the rate of the rest of the server market segment. Those figures put the Data Center on track to the growth targets that we shared with you in May.
High-performance computing continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within our Data Center business. And earlier this quarter, we announced more technical details behind our new Many Integrated Core coprocessor due out later this year. Branded Xeon Phi, this new product family will combine the throughput of highly parallel computing with the familiar programming models of the Intel architecture. Phi will be an impressive product for the HPC market segment with more than 50 cores, manufactured on our 22-nanometer tri-gate process technology. We already have more than 40 customers signed up to support the architecture.
In the smartphone space, we saw the launch of Medfield-based phones from Lenovo, Lava and Orange to great reviews. These launches further established Intel in the market, building on the wide presence we have in base spends.
Overall, our business in the first half was consistent with our expectations. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, consumer market growth in Western Europe and North America is not forecasted to recover as fast as we had anticipated. 
Worldwide enterprise demand is growing as expected. Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil, are still growing nicely, but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations. Taken together, these factors have led us to adjust our expectations for the second half. We are now expecting full year revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range versus our prior expectation of high-single digits. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate that having a deep and long-established presence in every geography, combined with leading technology, manufacturing and products are important in any environment. But they are especially valuable in the mixed market we are now experiencing. 
With a wide range of Ultrabooks and Intel-based tablets expected to be available this year and an exciting Windows 8 launch just around the corner, we remain optimistic about our future. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",659

The second quarter results came in largely as expected. Second quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Enterprise and emerging markets contributed to the year-on-year growth, somewhat offset by continued weakness in mature markets. The core business came in as expected, but we saw softness in our NAND memory business. At a segment level, the PC Group grew 4% from a year ago and the Data Center Group grew 15%.
Inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain are healthy but are being managed below historical averages based on macroeconomic uncertainty and ahead of the Windows 8 operating system release. For the third quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.3 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, which is at the lower end of the historical range.
Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance and down slightly from the first quarter. Our forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 64% gross margin for the year, and our gross margin forecast for the third quarter is 63%.
As expected, the fast ramp of Ivy Bridge resulted in a cost increase in the second quarter. We expected the second quarter was the peak in terms of platform unit cost, with costs coming down in the third quarter and more in the fourth quarter.
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.6 billion. Based on the macroeconomic environment, we have taken actions to slow hiring, and as a result, are lowering our spending forecast for the year to $18.2 billion. We expect spending in the third and fourth quarters to be flat to the second quarter. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $13.6 billion, approximately flat to the first quarter. We generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. Inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge ramp with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
While macroeconomic weakness and our expectation that our customers will continue to maintain lower inventory levels has led us to reduce our expectations to 3% to 5% revenue growth for the year, we continue to make great progress in the market. Both Romley and Ivy Bridge ramps are significantly faster than their predecessors. We are winning significant designs in Ultrabooks, phones and tablets. And our manufacturing lead continues to generate leading products and low costs. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",459

Over the last several years, our distribution channel role has shifted and evolved quite a bit. If you take a snapshot 5 years ago, most of the business was them distributing desktop microprocessors and motherboards then went into white box builds. And as the PC market shifted from desktops to notebooks, they became less of a driver of the PC volume. They picked up skill sets to do systems integration and they're now among our larger server channels. So the distribution channel has sort of reinvented itself and is now a fairly significant force in not just the desktops in emerging markets or preassembled notebooks but increasingly for servers and storage systems.",127

And as a follow-up, maybe for Stacy, looking at the gross margin guidance and looking at your reconciliation in the printed commentary, it sounded like the only negative impact to gross margins in Q3 would be these other cost of sales.

The -- what's going on with other cost of sales in Q3 is we're finding some opportunities to take some 32-nanometer capacity off-line. They are relatively small today, but it's just a result of the lower demand expectations on the year. And so we're taking some of those factories off, and so you'll see a little bit of demolition costs and some of those things that flows through other cost of sales. And it's not huge, it's between 0.5 point and a point, but it's a bit of an offset in gross margin in the third quarter.",98

In terms of what our expectations of the inventory pipeline, I think we saw more in Q2 than we expected. And as we look into the back half of the year, our current expectation, based on what we're hearing from customers, is based on macroeconomic uncertainty and the timing of the Windows 8 launch. They're going to continue to manage inventory levels. We -- and that's a change from where we were a quarter ago and really points to the below seasonal guide for the third quarter.",130

And then as my follow-up, just a question on the -- what seems to be a pretty significant dichotomy between notebook volumes and desktop volumes sequentially, especially given that you said enterprise was decent so I would have thought desktops might do a little better.

We've been seeing robust notebook growth rates now for several years, well in excess of what's happening in desktop. I'd say notebooks, really, is a volume story, and then in desktops, I think what they've done a really good job of is driving segmentation. And so again, even with lower unit growth, they've been driving some nice revenue growth, but a lot is segmentation and ASP uplift.",71

When you talk about segmentation and ASP uplift, that also leads into the competitive scenario question. Obviously, you're doing a lot better than your primary competitor just based on their recent news. Can you talk a little bit about why you think that is in the PC space? You mentioned a little bit that emerging markets are still growing well from you. Do you think it's competition in the emerging markets or is it more related to Data Center? Can you help us understand that?",94

I don't -- I think our position in servers is really unchanged and is really quite good.",61

And then going back to the inventory question, you talked about inventory in the channel being a bit low, but your own inventory is quite high. Understand a lot of this is coming from the ramp of the new products. But what gives you the confidence in guiding to relatively high gross margins for the rest of the year? And for the full year, are you -- what are the puts-and-takes there and what should we be concerned about or what are you concerned about potentially with that inventory build?",91
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2012",2012-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2343.0,326428.0,15776559.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,21,"Yes. So let me take those as 2 separate things. The inventory build is directionally what we expected. I think the one thing that we're doing is we're able to fill Ivy Bridge a little faster than we thought, and Ivy Bridge is -- it counts for all of the inventory growth. It's both units and dollars this quarter. And when I look across CPU inventory level, Ivy Bridge is now more than half of the inventory that's sitting in there. As I think about the next quarter, I think we'll be pretty flat and we'll see business levels start to grow, and so days of inventory will start coming down from here would be my expectation. The gross margin story for us really is a cost story, and I talked about this last quarter. We have this phenomenon where we'll ramp multiple factories at the same time on 22-nanometer. Those early products coming out of the factories are pretty expensive products. That led to a peaking cost in Q2. As we move into Q3, we now have the phenomenon where cost comes down rapidly on Ivy Bridge, but as Paul talked to you about, it's about 1/4 of our volume in Q2. We're going to more or less double that volume in Q3. And so this phenomenon where costs come down but the volume doubles, I'll see some cost good news in Q3, it's between 0.5 point and a point, and then I get more cost good news in Q4 as that ramp starts to flatten out a bit. And so really, the thing I'm watching on gross margin is are we on the path of cost reduction of Ivy Bridge? And on the ramp rate, we're doing great on the cost. The ramp rate's a little ahead of forecast. That gives me the confidence that we'll see a gross margin in Q4 that's kind of around 65%, and that gets me to 64% for the year.",328

Paul, can you just talk about maybe put a little more color around the macro slowdown you're seeing, when it happened, was it just a sudden jump down? Is it in a slow erosion and maybe go into the geos a little bit, which has been more impacted or less impacted?",55

Well, first of all, let me color it by saying that we still see growth in all these geographies and we're forecasting a stronger second half than first half. And I gave you the year-over-year numbers. What we had expected that we would see by now is that the U.S. and Western Europe consumer businesses would be recovering from sort of a softness that we were seeing for several quarters. And as a result of not seeing that, 2 things are happening. One, we don't see the PC sales to be as robust as we first thought, but the inventory replenishment coming off of the hard drive shortage is not as deep as we thought or as large as we thought, because there are people expecting to sell into a smaller overall TAM growth. In terms of China and Brazil, which I singled out and -- but I could have also spoken a little bit about maybe Russia in that, and India, in some of the countries we're seeing the prices of computers go up as a result of the currency fluctuations against the dollar. Most PC components, including ours, are sold globally in dollars and the PCs are typically priced in dollars, so -- at least to the distributors in those countries, so the price goes up as the currency changes. In China, it's a little bit different. What we're seeing there is an abatement of the GDP growth, sort of 8%, 8.25% down to 7%, 7.25%. And while we still see growth there, we don't see quite as much as we first thought. So you add all those together plus the fact that the enterprise is doing pretty good, you come down to a more muted growth scenario than we first thought.",295

So I'd say we're just -- it's a continuation of the trends that we've seen. Specifically to your question, no, it's not predicated on boomer sales in either tablets or in smartphones. But don't take from that, that those aren't important segments. We think we're on a path to have a lot of products in the market.

What those reports may -- I haven't seen the reports, Romit, but they may be just pointing to the fact that we're filling in more price points with Ivy Bridge, but we have not reduced our price points.

In -- realize that we're talking kind of 0.5 point to a point, relatively small changes. But in the third quarter, there's a couple of things that has caused me to put that forecast up. First, Q3 tends to be a larger consumer quarter, so you see a little bit of a mix impact associated with that. Again, not changing our price point, it's just the mix of what we think sells through in the third quarter. And then the second thing is what I was just talking about, we think we probably gained some share at the low end of the market. We'd expect that to continue into the third quarter but fairly muted impact. So all of this is in the context of what I articulated at the beginning of the year of a pretty benign pricing environment. I haven't seen anything that causes me to change that view.",152

It's not peak 22-nanometer. And that capital is appropriate to invest really in any economic climate. So the change in the demand environment hasn't changed our view of at least the 22-nanometer capital we're putting in place today. That said, as I'd said earlier, we are seeing some opportunities to take some older-generation capacity off-line and roll forward. My guess is as we work through those, we'll end up at the lower end of the range on CapEx. We're just -- we're working through those opportunities as we speak, and I think we'll come down a bit from here.",118

I think that the value associated with the Ultrabooks -- they start with the core product line, the Core i3, i5 and i7s -- is still pretty good. And I commented in my statement that I think that -- we're quite sure that the prices are going to be $699 in the sweet spot. If there was that kind of elasticity, which we have not seen, then I would expect some of the thin and light designs around the Pentium and Celeron chips that we sell would pick up some of that volume, and we don't see that today. What we're seeing is that in a time of tight consumer budgets, people buy quality and they tend to buy the high end of the line or reasonably high end of our product lines. So it's not going to last [ph]. If you want something to last a few years, and that tends to give them a bit more of assurance. And I'd also say the other thing that hasn't come up yet is the Win 7 to Win 8 transition.

And our thesis really hasn't changed here, which is that these are incremental machines for the most part. People still have primary computers in their lives, most people do. Much like they did like what we saw when the netbooks ramped up several years ago. As Intel-based tablets start shipping, both on Windows 8 and Android, we expect to be able to participate in that fast-growing market. But I don't think those numbers are going to be material this year. I think that just because of the timing of the start, it's going to be a slower ramp. And Stacy really addressed that earlier in his comment on phones and tablets.",158

This quarter where it's units primarily and then cost is secondary. So I'm not going to get to that level of granularity, but you should kind of visualize this as we are -- our inventories -- we are reducing units on an older generation products and we're refilling our inventory pipeline with Ivy Bridge. That's primarily units of Ivy Bridge and then those units are a little bit more expensive still than the Sandy Bridge parts that they're replacing.",98

I mean that's one of the reasons we didn't hit the midpoint this quarter. That was the reason. What we're seeing, though, is there's a variety of SKUs that our customers are designing. I talked about over 140 designs. Some of them are aiming at a premium segment and higher prices using SSDs. Some of them are using these ultra-low profile, very high-capacity drives, which are now becoming available, which gives you the capacity and the thinness at the same time, which I think is a nice way to hit lower price points.",100

In fact, it's very hard for us to distinguish that today given that we have not seen stalls before because -- we see -- we're shipping chips in to our customers in advance of the operating system being loaded. But having said that, since the last Windows release, we've moved to more of a hub model with our chips, so that means people can draw these a bit more just in time. So that may be some of the air pocket that we're seeing, to use your phrase, in Q3, but I think that gets filled up pretty quickly in Q4. And it's, as I said earlier, a lot of people buy the Win 7 machines with a coupon and then upgrade.",143

Stacy, you had presented some slides at the Analyst Meeting that I think you said kind of hold on techs, what if our view on unit growth changes. And then you presented a very helpful responsiveness case study. Is what you described to John relative to ramping down some older products and fabs and putting newer products in that and being at the low end of CapEx, is that the responsiveness case study or would that be another step altogether?",87

We're constantly looking at demand. And I realize we're -- CapEx, it's more important that we figure out what '13 and '14 demand looks like, but yes, as we see opportunities to take 32-nanometer capacity off-line and roll it forward, then it offsets capital that we would have had to buy for 22 nanometer. The case study I showed was one where you see a dramatic shift in demand levels that happens as a result of a financial crisis that takes everything down in a very fast period of time. This is when our expectations are just moderating and so we're finding some incremental opportunities to start to react that way.",127

We see the demand signals continue to be strong and we're going through the inventory replenishment to get the freshest stuff into inventory. We have seen loadings come down some in 32 nanometer, not to the point that we're taking underload charges but to the point that we can start to take a little bit of that capacity off-line.

We really haven't changed our view on that. A couple of things give us confidence there. One is the first half shipments on Ultrabooks were essentially right on our expectation set over 6 months ago. And the design pipeline for what we see in the second half and the price points that we see, we think, will get us there. In a softer selling season, I think these machines become even more attractive.

Yes, I -- we saw NAND soft in Q2. You saw on our commentary and as Paul alluded to. I don't think it's just us. I think you're seeing that from other companies. It's led to us being a little lower in revenue. I think that continues as part of the lowering of expectations into the back half. There's a chunk of that that's NAND-related. I want to contrast it, though, it's really different compared to the last downturn we went through, which I think was about 4 years ago. You really see the impact of the strategy that we've been pursuing in that business. The fact that we now have process technology leadership and we've transitioned all of our shipments to higher-margin segments of the NAND market like SSDs and compute-NAND. So that even though while it's impacting us at the top line, it's a business that still is generating positive profit and it's still generating positive cash flow. I was a fairly new CFO when the last big downturn hit NAND and it was quite different because we didn't have that cost leadership and we were shipping into the commodity segments of the business. So I think it's a real testament to what they have accomplished in the business, but it's definitely soft.",226

Our third quarter results came in slightly above our revised guidance, as PC-related billings improved in September over their July and August levels. We believe that Q3 PC sales grew approximately 1/2 of the seasonal norm and reflected flat enterprise sales. The billings upside we saw late in the quarter reflected our customers beginning their system production in advance of the Windows 8 launch later this month. As we look into Q4, we believe that the overall PC business will grow at about 1/2 of what we would expect from normal seasonality. Our revenue forecast growth is below these levels, as our customers are taking a cautious inventory approach in the face of market uncertainty and the timing of the Windows 8 launch. Our forecast assumes an incremental decrease in inventory at our customers going into year end.
Our Data Center business saw the corporate servers segment softening over the course of the quarter, with the cloud segment growing 50% over last year and storage revenue growing 27% to a new record.
During the last month, I've met with all of our major customers. And while the market remains tough, I've been encouraged to see a renewed appetite for innovation across the entire ecosystem. Our customers are designing entirely new categories of PCs that will take advantage of our newest microprocessors, combined with Microsoft's new touch-enabled Windows 8 operating system to bring dozens of beautiful new tablet, convertible and Ultrabook designs to the market.
In the coming months, consumers will see tremendous form factor and industrial design innovation. There will be more than 140 Core-based Ultrabooks, more than 40 of which will have touch. This will include more than a dozen convertibles that combine the productivity of the laptop with the convenience of a tablet. Many of the Ultrabook SKUs will hit the mainstream $699 price point, with some burst SKUs well below even that number. Q4 will see more than 20 Atom-based tablets from 6 or more leading OEMs using Clover Trail. Clover Trail is a brand-new SoC that will enable tablets as thin as 8.5 millimeters and as light as 1.5 pounds with 3 weeks of Connected Standby battery life and all of the compatibility that Windows users and Intel customers have come to expect. I'm excited about these products and the capabilities they bring to consumers and the enterprise.
Last month at IDF, we shared details of our next-generation Core processor codenamed Haswell. Originally targeted at 15 watts, we've made significant advancements in micro architecture and process technology that will allow us to move Haswell down into the 10-watt envelope, fostering even more innovation in form factor, as well as new usage models like gesture computing and voice recognition. We continue to make progress in handhelds, with Motorola's launch of the RAZR i, the world's only 2-gigahertz smartphone that delivers better battery life than similar competing devices. In general, I see the computing market in a period of transition, but also a period of breakthrough innovation and creativity. Intel has a history of navigating the industry's transitions and emerging better and stronger. With a hardware and software roadmap that spans the smallest portable devices, to the most powerful data center servers and world-leading silicon process technology, we're excited about the future and confident in our strategy and prospects in all the markets we serve.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",573
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2586.0,365535.0,17451907.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Paul. Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, flat from the second quarter and slightly better than our revised expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.6 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This slight increase in revenue in the fourth quarter reflects the caution we are seeing in the order patterns of our customers as a result of concerns about the global economic environment, ongoing consumer softness in mature markets and a slowing enterprise market segment. As a result of weaker than expected demand environment, we are taking several actions. We significantly cut factory loading at the end of the quarter and will maintain low factory utilization rates throughout the fourth quarter. We expect these factory adjustments to help bring down our total inventory levels by approximately $0.5 billion. Additionally, we are redirecting equipment and space to 14-nanometer from older generation technologies. The result of this is a $1.2 billion decrease from our July forecast for capital spending, with the midpoint of our capital-spending forecast for the year now at $11.3 billion.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 63% was slightly better than the midpoint of our revised guidance and flat to the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin range to be 57%, down 6 points from the third quarter. 2/3 of the gross margin decline is the result of the excess capacity charges. In addition, we expect an increase in inventory reserves as we start production on our next-generation micro architecture product codenamed Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013. Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $10.5 billion, down approximately $3 billion to the second quarter.
We generated over $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1 billion in dividends, repurchased nearly $3 billion in capital assets and had roughly $1 billion of stock repurchases. In addition, we closed our $3 billion strategic equity investment in ASML. As a result of lower-than-expected sales in the third quarter, inventory grew by approximately $400 million. More of all -- more than all of the increase in inventories came from the Ivy Bridge product ramp, with an offset as we reduced inventory levels of older generation products.
We are taking aggressive tactical actions to reduce inventory levels and redirect space and equipment to 14-nanometer, but we're also seeing some important positive trends in the market. In the client space, we are seeing innovative products coming to the market with Intel Inside, ranging from Ultrabooks to smartphones to tablets. In the Data Center, we expect to continue to benefit from the buildout of the cloud and a substantial performance, cost and power benefit that our enterprise customers get from our leadership products. Underlying all of this, our manufacturing advantage is extending over the rest of the industry as we start the ramp of Haswell, our new micro architecture on 22-nanometer, and begin to build out our 14-nanometer factory network. The combination of the tactical actions we are taking, coupled with new products and design wins across all segments, and our manufacturing leadership will all benefit our business over the coming quarters.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",558

I'll -- we will provide a forecast for 2013 when we get to January. So again, similar to the prior question, yes, I think it's premature to provide a forecast at this point across revenue or gross margin or CapEx for '13. We need to fight through Q4 first. There's a couple of things that I think you can model for '13, though, that are helpful. We just talked about the start-up costs. We're starting up 14-nanometer. So historically, that's worth 2 to 3 points of gross margin. In terms of the excess capacity charges that we're taking, we're taking a lot in Q4. I think we'll see that significantly better in Q1 and then by the time we get to Q2, I don't expect really any excess capacity charges. So you'll see that play out. And just to size those 2 things in Q1, I think the excess capacity charges and the start-up costs are kind of roughly similar orders of magnitude. So those 2 things should offset. Beyond that, I'll wait until we get to January because there's just many other moving parts for 2013.",188

Probably not completely expected, PC Client a little bit better than maybe you might have expected when you preannounced. The Data Center, however though, is seeing some ASP movement that caused that revenue to be soft. Can you communicate to us what your outlook is as far as the revenue mix for next quarter and maybe what that might do to our gross margin number?",81

So just to come back to Q3 for a second, then I'll answer your question on Q4. What we saw specifically in the client side -- it played out roughly as we thought when we did the pre-announcement. And if you step back from that, what we saw was some growth in consumption, but our customers continuing to manage inventories very lean. And in fact, we saw across the worldwide PC supply chain, we actually saw a reduction in overall inventory levels in Q3. And normally in Q3, you'd see an increase. So you can kind of get a sense of how lean they're managing things. In the Data Center, what we saw was strong growth in the Internet IP data centers, the cloud. It was up actually 50% from a year ago. It was offset when we started to see some weakness on the enterprise side, and that's where you're seeing the lower ASP, just because of the difference in ASP between those 2 segments. As we go into Q4, in terms of the overall mix of our business, when I look at the gross -- when I -- I'll direct you to the gross margin recon. There's an issue there with the excess capacity charges. We have some builds on Haswell, really ASP is not an impact in gross margin. And so you can take from that, that we expect it to continue to be kind of similar mix in a roughly benign ASP environment.",248

Clearly, we saw a softening in the Consumer segment. We talked about that when we did the pre-announcement about a month ago. And the surprise there was that China, which had been very strong, turned weak on us on top of a continuing weakness in the mature markets of the U.S. and Western Europe. However, having said that, we do believe that when the numbers are all in, that PC consumption did grow in Q3 at about 1/2 the normal seasonal rate and will also grow in Q4 at about 1/2 the normal seasonal rate. How much of that half-ing is macroeconomic versus the timing of the Windows 8 build and the share of wallet war for tablets versus PCs is TBD. And we'll know a lot more about that 3 -- or 90 days from now after the Windows 8 launch, after we see Intel-based tablets start shipping, when people start playing with the operating system, have all the touch-based Ultrabooks out there, we'll know a lot more. So we'll try to quantify that a bit more for you in 90 days. But right now, it's a bit of each.",207

But underutilization in Q4 is clearly helping you kind of lower this year's CapEx a bit. And back in '09, off of about 1/2 the CapEx base, I think the underutilization around the credit crisis saved you about $1.5 billion in capital spending. Is this going to hold where, as we go into '13, the lack of -- your underutilization will allow you to save on CapEx? And if you're twice the base then, can we think about a $3 billion number in total?",105

You can see that 2012 capital spending is down $1.2 billion from what we thought a quarter ago, although we had some indications that we were trending down a little bit.

I can help you on the former, not the latter. On Ivy Bridge, there's, I'd say, a handful, 5 to 8, something like that that I've seen, off the top of my head. And for Haswell, it's too soon to tell. I mean, we have -- when you start seeing an Ultrabook with a detachable touchscreen, is it a tablet? And it's based on Haswell. Is it a tablet? Is it an Ultrabook? Or is it a convertible? Even I don't know. We'll have to invent some names for these things as we go along. What I can tell you is that the level of innovation there is really unbounded. I haven't seen this in a long time. But I think in terms of -- just looping near-term selling season, there are some Ivy Bridge ones. They tend to be skewed more towards the enterprise, where our customers believe that their customers, the CIOs of the world want a high-performance tablet that is compatible, that is secure, that runs all their enterprise software. So I think that's where you'll see those migrate versus, say, the Clover Trail stuff, which was going to be a bit more consumer-centric.",199

But what I get back to, as I look out here, I don't think -- and I said this to you guys before, I don't think that the tablet, as we've seen it evolve over the last several years is the end state of computing. The innovation is going to start pouring in now that you have widely available SKUs on a widely distributed operating system that's now -- that will come from multiple vendors that can unleash their creativity. And what I can't predict is what form factor is going to win here? But I do think that some of these things that have sort of the best of both worlds, the performance and the capability of a laptop and the form factor and convenience of a tablet, are likely to be the things that are -- are the most high-volume runners.

If we look at typical seasonality for Q1, you guys are probably down like $1 billion or something like that.

I would maybe make a couple of comments, though, to your thesis. One is, based on what we're seeing in the back half of this year, I am less convinced that normal seasonality is a great guide. What we're seeing is, the customer is managing things very cautiously. Depending on how sales go, you can get multiple different outcomes for Q1, and we'll get there in a quarter. In terms of inventory levels, we're too high today because the unit volume that we expected in September didn't materialize. We're a little -- we're under on what we thought from Q4. That's one of the reasons we're bringing the utilization down. We'll bringing inventory levels down significantly in Q4 back into a healthy range, and our intent would be to keep them in that range.",152

I see the same situation. I mean, China as a manufacturing center is reflecting the comments that we had in our commentary, which is that the OEMs are being very cautious with their inventory commits at this point in time for all the reasons we've discussed. And it's as lean as we've seen it in normal times, even without the shortage of, let's say, the hard drives of last year. In terms of the channel inventory, there really isn't very much. I went into a Tier 3 city. You don't see things stocked up or stacked up on pallets and stuff. People are generally -- I think most of our customers worldwide spent a lot of Q3 thinning out their Windows 7 inventory, so they wouldn't have an overhang at the launch. And that accounts for a lot of this inventory shift of our billings versus the consumption that we've been talking about. And now with the launch of Windows 8 coming in a week or so, you'll see a new round of build and hopefully consumption.",193

Just to put that in perspective, maybe 2 other comments on what we're doing. One is, we're taking down utilization in the factories down to sub-50%. Again, to take inventory out and to free up the opportunity to move both space and equipment and redirect that to 14-nanometer. So it's a pretty significant series of actions. And I also want to point to the inventory that we have in place. While it's in terms of units more than I want to hold, it's on the order of 70% Ivy Bridge. So it's our freshest stuff. So I'm not worried about the salability of the inventory, but I do want to bring the aggregate inventory levels down. It's just healthier for us to have less.",153

We were putting on capacity for a bigger second half than we got. We're going to now make adjustments so that we can move capacity to 14-nanometer and bring our inventory levels down. It doesn't change the fact that our planning model -- we're always looking to make sure we have the ability in terms of what we call white space, so some unallocated factory space, as well as some equipment to respond to upsides. It's -- the risk of being caught short and the cost of being caught short is much more than the cost of being long. Because as you can see when we get a little long, we can take actions and within a 6-month period we can get back aligned. If you're short, it can take you 2 years to get caught back up.",170

It's not different than our historical patterns. So you can think of it in the range of 80% to 90% of the equipment that we buy at 22-nanometer is usable at the 14-nanometer node.

The pricing is -- we do forward pricing with our customers. It's priced I think aggressively to move into the mainstream price points in terms of the stuff I talked about. If you look at our PC group numbers quarter-over-quarter, the ASP was about flat year-over-year. It was down a bit. Mobile was down a bit. What that reflects was really us going after some incremental share at the bottom of the market. So it didn't really change pricing, but it changed the mix. And we thought it was time we could do some of that, and we did it opportunistically. That's more the driver on that side. In terms of demand stimulation, a lot of what we're doing is really to make sure that the feature set of this season's Ultrabooks are really consistent with where the market is. That's why we've been so focused on working with our customers and the ecosystem, just for example, bringing the touch SKUs in. 6 to 8 months ago, that we did not have line of sight to 40 out of 140 SKUs of Ultrabooks being touched-enabled. It was probably 5 or 10. We're up to 40 now. And that's just going to get bigger as we go into 2013. So working with the vendors and the glass manufacturers to bring the cost of touch as an increment down has been one of the key things we think we can do to drive demand.",252

In the context of cyclical history, what we're seeing here isn't too unique from the standpoint of, yes, the margins usually decline pretty significantly on the other side of the big CapEx cycles. I think the average margin decline is 700 basis points. The peak is 1,300 basis points. You're down about 1,000 basis points now from the peak gross margins, so pretty normal. Is there anything you see in that context that would cause this margin decline to be worse than some of the more dramatic declines you've seen historically?",100

I think we've done a lot to improve that responsiveness, and I think that has been helpful, and you saw that in 2009. But if you go back before that, as opposed to a couple of quarters, you were sometimes talking about a couple of years to get capacity back in line. I think that's different. And then the other thing I'd point to that's different is, while the decline is significant and we're taking some excess capacity charges, if you compare 2000 -- what we're going through now with 2009. In 2009, we were into the mid-to-high 40s, now we're in the mid-to-high 50s, and I think that really points to the structural improvements we've made in our business in terms of cost and mix and the competitiveness of our products. So while it may seem the same to you, it actually I think is faster, and we are still maintaining a higher gross margin.",201

For my follow-up question is kind of specific to the Data Center Group. Some of the ARM-based server players are arguing that they can now address a significant part of the workload from the Googles and the Amazons and Facebooks data centers. Is that some competitive dynamic that you're seeing in that area or do you think that ARM is still isn't competitive in that realm?,67

So that may be a roadmap planning opportunity that they're pushing, but the products that are being shipped today certainly don't have those feature sets. You can look at some the workloads, things like Hadoop, Jim, that would be conducive to, let me say, an array of microservers. And those can easily be run on Atom. We've got our second generation of the Atom microserver chips out now, with the first one on -- the first one's on 32 nanometers now, we're now sampling the 22-nanometer one. And we've decided that we're just going to push Atom as hard as possible in this space and have it be a better offering for our customers than having to switch all their software and worry about all the reliability features.",154

Just some more color, if you would, on what kind of mix you're seeing out there and where you expect it to go and what -- what you're relying on to get those inventories clear, say, by the beginning of 2013?",86
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2586.0,365535.0,17451957.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,53,"Let me start with the last part. The inventory thing is straightforward. The work in process and finished goods that we're expecting to come down over this quarter are our Ivy Bridge products, which is the mainstream, high-end product we have today. So -- and as the market picks up, Windows 8 launches, Ultrabooks pickup and so forth, that just consumes that inventory. And as I said earlier, in my comments and Stacy's, our OEMs are running very lean right now. So any kind of demand blip would cause us to be able to reduce that even more perhaps. In terms of the mix, there's really not much more to add than we put in our prerelease and in the comments today, which is that, the U.S. and Western Europe PC markets remain soft in terms of consumers. The change that we have seen and we talked about at the pre-announcement, was that the enterprise PC market has gone relatively flat now. And I think that's just a reflection of large corporations making hard decisions on CapEx versus people and where they want to put their investments. And now that seems to have spilled over from the client side of the enterprise to also the data center server part of the enterprise. And I think we'll see how that sorts out over the next quarter or so as CEOs and CIOs make their next round of decisions. In terms of China, the slowdown there was -- it's principally a notebook business, and the slowdown there was in consumer notebooks.",259

I mean, the GDP forecast for the year have come down -- for next year have come down. There's also a reasonable amount of anxiety around the change in government. And that tends to put a little bit of nervousness into the system, and what I don't know is how much of that clarifies after they change because people -- it's not so much they don't know who's coming in, the issue is, what are the policies in terms of stimulus and taxation and so forth that have been pretty generous the last year or so -- a year or 2 rather in terms of stimulating domestic consumption. And the question is will those policies continue or not?",140

That's hopeful. And I wanted to talk quickly about Data Center. The trend that we're seeing in ASPs right now of down 7% last quarter, I'm just kind of curious how you see that over the next couple of years here, because when we take a look at your cloud segment forecasting pretty robust growth there, you talked about 50% of growth last quarter. Has that continued to really outstrip growth from your more traditional server customers? I mean, what is the -- what kind of impact does it do to your blended ASPs?",98
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2012",2012-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2586.0,365535.0,17451969.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,65,"I think the better comparison for the Data Center is year-on-year, which the ASP was up a bit, up 1%. The down a bit was really a big shift in the mix between the -- what would be normal enterprise growth and of slowing in the enterprise growth. In general, for storage, for networking and I think for some aspects of the Internet Data Center, the mix is actually quite good. Sometimes two-way machines versus four-way machines, but they tend to -- a fairly high mix. And one of the fastest-growing elements of the business is High-performance computing, which buyers buy the top-of-the-line of our SKUs. So as those product lines get flushed out more and more, I really don't see the mix shifting away from where it's been the first half of this year. I see the current mix being a bit of an anomaly as a result of the softness of corporate Data Center server purchases.",159

It's either up or down or sideways. I'll hold off on triangulating on a capital forecast or on a unit growth until we get to next quarter.

And then Paul, maybe this question for you. Notionally, we weren't expected to see -- when we have an operating transition like we're seeing a spark to PC demand, and yet we don't seem to be seeing that.

We know it's not happening yet. I'm very excited about this operating system as I said earlier, it brings touch into the mainstream for the first time. And we know that the last couple of years, tablets have changed the paradigm for people to use computers. They like touch. They like to make their photos get larger with their fingers and everything else is good about that. So I think we haven't had a chance to really judge how the consumers will embrace this in mainstream PC space or not. I'm very optimistic as we've been playing with these things and we see the products being built and we take them out for testing to consumers, and we've now run tests on Windows 8 touch-enabled Ultrabooks in a number of the major cities around the world and across mobile demographics. The feedback is universally positive. So I think we're just too soon to tell. I mean the darn thing hasn't even launched yet. And we'll know a lot more about this 90 days from now.",181

We are seeing a very cautious environment. That I think it's a combination of what they're seeing from a macro standpoint and a slowing enterprise and an operating system transition and a weak consumer mature market segment.

Has the uptake on the higher SKUs stalled?
