Thank you for joining us. As you've heard, Intel has been in the midst of a major transformation to strengthen our CPU franchise while evolving into a multi-architecture XPU company. The business is well positioned to capitalize on key technology inflections and extend our reach into fast-growing markets.
Under Bob's leadership, Intel has made significant progress on this strategy and once again delivered record results in the past year, which Bob and George will detail shortly. But before that, I'd like to say a few words about the CEO transition we announced last week. This decision came after very careful consideration and planning by the Board and in partnership with Bob. Pat Gelsinger will rejoin Intel on February 15 as our new CEO and a member of our Board. Bob will remain in his role until then and will work with Pat to ensure a seamless transition. On behalf of the entire Intel team and Board of Directors, I'd like to thank Bob for his leadership and significant contributions through this period of transformation for Intel.
The company faced challenging issues when Bob took over, and he has been a fantastic leader. Bob clarified Intel's growth strategy, reenergized its culture and made significant progress on improving execution. He leaves Intel in a strong strategic and financial position, and we deeply appreciate his ongoing guidance during this transition.
Last week, Bob and I introduced Pat to Intel employees around the world who gave him a very warm welcome. We believe this is the right time to make this change, and we are confident Pat is the right person to lead Intel forward.
In addition to deep technology expertise and unique insights on Intel's technology evolution based on 30 years as a leader here, Pat brings a distinguished record of driving growth and performance and shareholder returns. He lives by our values-based cultural leadership approach and has a hyper focus on talent development and operational execution. In sum, the Board is confident that Pat, together with the rest of the leadership team and our incredible dedicated 110,000 employees around the world, will ensure strong execution of Intel's strategy, build on its record of product leadership and capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead to create long-term shareholder value.
While he does not step into the role for another few weeks, he has kindly agreed to join us today. So you will get to hear some of his initial observations with more to come after he officially takes over on February 15.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Pat for a few words.",439

It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. I am thrilled and humbled to be coming home to my dream job as Intel's CEO. I was only 18 when I first joined Intel, and I am proud to say I spent the following 30 years learning from such industry giants as Grove, Moore and Noyce. My experience at Intel has shaped my entire career, and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to now lead this great company. I have tremendous regard for Intel's rich history of innovation and the world-changing technologies invented here that now power the world's digital foundation. I can't wait to help lead this great technology innovator during a critical time of change and disruption.
I know you're all very anxious to hear more from me on our long-term plans, and I'll be sharing my detailed perspective after I assume my new role mid-February. That said, I do want to provide my view specifically on 7-nanometer progress. I've had the opportunity to personally examine progress on Intel's 7-nanometer technology over the last week. Based on initial reviews, I am pleased with the progress made on the health and recovery of the 7-nanometer program. I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally. At the same time, given the breadth of our portfolio, it's likely that we will expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products. We will provide more details on this and our 2023 road map once I fully assess the analysis that has been done and the best path forward.
Bob and George will walk you through the financials and provide guidance for the first quarter shortly. We are holding off on providing guidance for the full year until I join, but we will do so in a timely fashion, no later than on our next earnings call in April.
Looking ahead, the world is becoming more digitally connected, expanding the market in front of us. Intel is the only semiconductor company in the world that has the depth of intelligent silicon, platform vision, design and manufacturing capabilities and scale that our customers need to fuel their next-generation innovations. There is enormous opportunity ahead for Intel, but to be able to seize these opportunities, we have to deliver the best products and stay ahead of our customers' needs. We need to become more agile in a very competitive market. We need to execute flawlessly and deliver on our commitments. We need to passionately innovate with boldness and speed. Intel culture and values must be healthy and vibrant, assuring our ability to attract and retain the best engineering talent in the world.
I look forward to working with the incredibly talented global Intel team and industry partners to continue delivering the best technologies for our customers around the world. I also look forward to engaging with you, our shareholders, in the coming months to hear your perspectives and discuss our vision and strategy for Intel. We will position this company for sustained growth and leadership for our industry, our country and an increasingly digital world.
I also want to extend my deepest respect and appreciation to Bob for his leadership and significant contributions to Intel through this critical period. I'm just starting to dive into the business, but already I'm confident that the strong foundation and progress achieved under his leadership put us on the right track to build on Intel's great history and to create value for our customers and shareholders in the years to come.
Thanks again. Bob, over to you.",604

It has been an honor to lead this incredible company and its talented team. It gives me great confidence in Intel's future knowing that I'll be passing the baton to Pat, whose technology expertise, industry knowledge, execution track record and commitment to our company is indisputable.
Over the last 2 years, we made significant progress on our strategy to transform Intel into a multi-architecture XPU company to move from silicon to solutions and to contemporize our IDM model. I am proud of what we're able to achieve together as an Intel team in a relatively short period of time and echo Omar's words that Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this transition.
As demonstrated by the results we announced today, demand for Intel's innovative technologies remains very strong, and our investments to capitalize on future growth opportunities are paying off. Our Q4 results significantly exceeded our expectations, capping off our fifth consecutive year of record revenue. We generated $20 billion in revenue and $1.52 in EPS, exceeding our guidance by $2.6 billion and $0.42, respectively. For the full year, we delivered $77.9 billion in revenue, up 8%, and $5.30 in EPS, up 9%. The client, data center, memory and Mobileye businesses each set all-time revenue records.
In Q4, we continued to advance our 3 strategic priorities: improving our execution to strengthen our core business, extending our reach to accelerate growth and redefine our position in the industry, and continuing to thoughtfully deploy capital to create value for our shareholders. Let me briefly discuss some of the highlights. Starting with improving our execution to strengthen our core business, let me start with an update on process technology and our product road map. Over the last few years, we've been evolving the IDM model to ensure we can deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products, preserve our IDM advantage, continue to invest in process technology leadership and generate attractive returns on capital. This evolution includes a disaggregated design strategy, adoption of standard industry processes and common tools, flows and methods and deeper engagement with the industry ecosystem.
In July, we highlighted a challenge with our 7-nanometer technology and started a process to improve it while evaluating the best approach for our 2023 product lineup. Since that time, we have made tremendous progress on our 7-nanometer technology.  
When 7-nanometer was originally defined, the flow contained a particular sequence of steps that contributed to the defect issue we discussed in July. By rearchitecting these steps, we've been able to resolve the defects. As part of this work over the last 6 months, we also streamlined and simplified our 7-nanometer process architecture to better ensure we'll be able to deliver on our 2023 product road map. The in-line data we have been collecting and our pipeline of proven yield development projects gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments going forward.
At the same time, as Pat mentioned, we will continue to leverage the relationships we've developed over the years with our external foundry partners and believe they can play a larger role in our product road map given our disaggregated designs. Once Pat has had a chance to join, he'll further assess our analysis and drive the final manufacturing decision for our 2023 CPU products. Therefore, we'll communicate that decision soon after he takes over but not today.
Turning to products. We've qualified several new products in the fourth quarter, and we have an incredibly exciting lineup of CPUs for '21 and '22. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we introduced more than 50 processors, resulting in more than 500 new designs for laptops and desktops coming to market in 2021. We are also seeing tremendous market response for PCs based on our new 11th Gen Intel Core Tiger Lake processors. Our PC customers now have more than 150 Tiger Lake-based systems in the market, well ahead of expectations.
We believe we gained market share as PC CPU units grew an impressive 33% in the quarter. In a market where competitors are seeing supply challenges, this is a powerful example of the incredible value and scale of our factory network as we continue to deliver greater performance and cost efficiencies for our customers.
Moving to Data Center. We are now shipping our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable CPU, Ice Lake, and we'll be ramping volume through the first quarter. Customers are going to see significant value in Ice Lake across cloud, network and edge workloads with excellent performance improvement and innovations such as PCIe Express Gen4, next-generation Intel Optane Persistent Memory and security enhancements such as SGX.  
As we look ahead, we are excited about the capabilities we are bringing to customers with Alder Lake for mobile and desktop PCs and Sapphire Rapids for the data center. These products take advantage of our enhanced SuperFin process technology and numerous architectural improvements, and both are broadly sampling to customers. We will qualify Alder Lake desktop and notebook for production and begin our volume ramp in the second half of '21, and we expect production qualification of Sapphire Rapids at the end of 2021.
In the expanded market opportunity in front of us, CPUs are critical, but multiple architectures, or XPUs, will be required to help customers optimize for specific workloads. We had a big XPU leap in the fourth quarter as we entered the discrete graphics market with Intel Iris Xe MAX Graphics, Intel's first Xe-based discrete GPU. We are now shipping discrete graphics into thin and light notebooks from Acer, ASUS and Dell. And we introduced our first discrete GPU for the data center, which is already delivering great cloud gaming experiences for customers such as Tencent. We also announced the gold release of oneAPI, our cross-industry open standard-based unified programming model that delivers a common developer experience across architectures.
Second, we've made strong progress extending our reach to accelerate our growth. Over the past several years, we have been making investments that have positioned us to lead key technology inflections such as AI, 5G network transformation and the intelligent autonomous edge. We infuse AI capabilities into everything we make from the cloud to PCs, and we see tremendous growth prospects as we build our position in data center training to complement the strength of our Intel Xeon for inference.
We made a significant step in AI this quarter when Amazon announced EC2 instances that will leverage up to 8 of our Habana Gaudi AI training accelerators and deliver up to 40% better price performance than current GPU-based EC2 instances for machine learning workloads.
We've also invested to drive networking workload convergence on Intel silicon. In 2020, we expanded our footprint into the radio access network, delivering Xeon, SoCs, FPGAs and custom solutions for 5G base station designs and reaching our goal of 40% share 2 years ahead of our original target. Today, we are the leading network silicon provider winning in wireless, enterprise and cloud networks and delivering $6 billion in revenue this year, up approximately 20% versus 2019.
Finally, we have enviable assets to lead the explosive growth of intelligent and autonomous edge computing. Our IOTG and Mobileye businesses have a combined annual revenue of $4 billion. Mobileye delivered a record fourth quarter and had an explosive start to 2021 with a number of exciting CES announcements.
Third, we maintained our discipline in thoughtfully allocating our shareholders' capital. Since 2015, we have grown revenue by more than $22 billion and more than doubled EPS. We've driven spending from 36% of revenue to 25% of revenue while investing in manufacturing capacity expansion, adding more than $1 billion of R&D targeted to higher growth initiatives and focusing our product portfolio.
As a result, we anticipate approximately $12 billion in proceeds from our NAND and McAfee exits over time. At the same time, we've been delivering substantial capital returns to shareholders, including $19.8 billion in 2020 alone through dividends and share buybacks, the latter of which included a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase announced in August.
Building on this, today, we announced that we are increasing our annual dividend by $0.07 or 5% from $1.32 to $1.39 per share. 
Before I pass it to George for more details on our fourth quarter results, I want to reiterate that I couldn't be more proud of the team at Intel, and I cherish the time I've spent here. I look forward to watching Pat and the team's continued progress as they build on Intel's purpose to deliver breakthrough technology that enriches the lives of everyone on the planet. I also thank our investors and analysts on the line today for their continued support of Intel and for our valued engagements over the years.",1463

Q4 marked a much stronger-than-expected finish to a record year. Both Mobileye and our PC-centric segment achieved record quarters. Q4 revenue was $20 billion, exceeding our guidance by $2.6 billion. The revenue beat was broad-based, led by stronger-than-expected notebook and cloud demand, along with contributions from desktop and enterprise and government. Data center-related demand also led to stronger revenues in NAND.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4%, exceeding guide by 3 points due to flow-through on higher revenue and the benefit of Ice Lake server achieving production qualification prior to year-end. Q4 EPS was $1.52, $0.42 above our guide due to strong operational performance and further boosted by gains from our ICAP portfolio. Excluding a onetime tax adjustment, about 2/3 of our EPS beat was operational and 1/3 was below the line.
For full year 2020, we achieved record revenue of $77.9 billion, $4.4 billion higher than our January guide, which reflects a 1 year acceleration relative to our 2019 Investor Day target. EPS was $5.30, up $0.43 year-over-year and $0.30 higher than our January guide.
We generated $21.1 billion of free cash flow, up 25% year-on-year, and returned 94% of free cash flow to shareholders. In total, we have repurchased approximately 17.6 billion shares as part of our planned $20 billion share repurchases announced in October 2019. We intend to complete the remaining $2.4 billion balance in Q1 '21. 
Moving briefly to segment performance. Our Data Center Group generated record revenue in 2020, up 11% year-over-year. In Q4, DCG delivered revenue of $6.1 billion, down 16% year-over-year driven by enterprise and government weakness and cloud digestion, albeit lower than expected. 
As a reminder, Q4 '19 was a tough compare with an all-time record for revenue with strength across all segments. DCG operating margin in Q4 was down $1.4 billion year-on-year on lower revenue and increased investment. 
Our other data-centric businesses were up 1% year-over-year in 2020. In Q4, these businesses were down 5% year-over-year driven largely by COVID-related demand impacts, partially offset by Mobileye growth.  IOTG revenue was down 16% year-over-year due to COVID effects on demand. We expect recovery in IOTG in 2021 and saw sequential growth of $100 million in the quarter on stabilizing industrial and video segments. Mobileye revenue was up 39% year-over-year in the quarter, and operating margin was $110 million, both records as IQ SoC demand continues to be strong. 
NSG revenue was $1.2 billion, down 1% year-on-year on lower ASPs, partially offset by higher volume growth. Operating margin was $76 million. PSG revenue was down 16% year-over-year due mostly to 5G ASIC transitions at key accounts in the communications segment. 
CCG delivered a 5th straight year of record revenue, up 8% year-over-year. For the quarter, revenue was up 9% year-over-year driven by record notebook unit volume. ASPs were down 11% due to increased volume in consumer entry and education segments. Adjacency revenue was down 31%, driven by modem ramp down and the divestiture of our Home Gateway business. Operating income was $4.5 billion, up $420 million year-over-year on higher volume, partially offset by the ramp of 10-nanometer products.
Moving to our outlook. As Bob and Trey said, we believe it is important to give Pat time to assume his new role and dig into the business before announcing our full year 2021 guidance and longer-term plans. However, I will provide our Q1 outlook, and then, for the year, discuss high-level headwinds and tailwinds we expect.
As a reminder, our outlook for 2021 excludes the NAND business. We expect Q1 revenue of $17.5 billion, down 12% year-over-year or down 6%, excluding NAND. We see continuing strong demand for notebook PCs in Q1, up significantly year-over-year, and expect desktop volumes to be down year-over-year. We anticipate further cloud digestion and continued COVID demand impacts on IOTG. The Q1 revenue estimate also includes approximately $500 million in corporate revenue that is onetime in nature and relates to a prepaid revenue arrangement.
As we look at the remainder of the year, we see solid TAM growth in our core markets in 2021. We expect PC demand to be more first half weighted than normal seasonality and expect data-centric demand to be more concentrated in the second half as cloud digestion eases and COVID-impacted markets such as enterprise, data center and IoT improve. We have strong product road maps but have anticipated a more competitive market and a continued mix shift to entry consumer PCs in our revenue plans this year. Finally, we will see lower modem revenue this year from our exit of that business.
Gross margin in Q1 is expected to be approximately 58%, down year-over-year by approximately 4 points on mix-related ASPs from lower Xeon XCC volume and higher small core PC units, partially offset by lower margin impact from divested businesses and some improvements from our DCG adjacencies. Q1 operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. We are forecasting EPS of approximately $1.10 per share and a tax rate of 14.5%.
With that, let me turn it back over to Trey and get to your questions.",850

I guess first question is around the fact -- clearly, the final decision hasn't been made yet, but it certainly sounds pretty clear that you're pursuing a dual path strategy of manufacturing at the leading edge, both internally and externally. So how should we think about the impact to CapEx? Will you need to make investments with your foundry partner to secure capacity? And porting certain products to very different foundry design rules, what impact will that have on OpEx? And is that what is driving higher OpEx intensity in Q1?",106

Maybe I'll start, and George, you can finish up. First, yes, we've been through an exhaustive effort over the course of the last 6 months. And as we highlighted, we've made tremendous progress on our 7-nanometer process technology, and that gives us a lot of comfort that the #1 priority that we set in the middle of the year, which was a predictable cadence of leadership products that we would be able to deliver our 2023 road map using i7 or for our next-gen technology. So the progress that the team has made has given us the confidence that we'll continue to leverage the IDM advantage and invest in technology development leadership in the future.
At the same time, we also realize that with our disaggregated designs that we launched a few years back that we have enhanced flexibility to see if, when and what technologies or tiles will make inside, which will be the majority of our '23 road map, but it gives us the flexibility to look at things outside. And the trade-offs that we make in doing that are: one, performance of product in a predictable manner; two, economics; and three, ensuring that we have the capacity and the control of the supply chain so that we can -- our customers can count on our deliveries. So over the course of time, preserving the IDM advantage while being more and more flexible in our architectures and our designs.",244

And C.J., in terms of spending, I would say, yes, we're increasing spending on 7-nanometer inside the company in preparation for the next generation of tools. I wouldn't tie it explicitly in any way to the trade-off between manufacturing internally or externally. That's really going to be decided as Pat looks at the product road map. Most of our spending increase in the year compared to what we thought is tied to more spending on AI and on our Xeon road map, which pretty much was a redirection of the savings that we got from the divestitures.",98

I guess my question, Bob, probably just around gross margins. Clearly, you significantly upsided in the December quarter. I would have thought that, going into March, given the divestiture of NAND and that being gross margin accretive, that maybe you'd get some better leverage on gross margin. So maybe you can address that. And I guess, more importantly, from the March quarter, Bob or George, can you talk about how we should think about the puts and takes to the cost sides on gross margins as 10-nanometer begins to ramp?",107
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3843.0,2178259.0,85345080.0,Answer,George Davis,,Executives,14,"John, I'll take it. This is George. In Q1, what we're really seeing is, again, a typical seasonality. So when you look at the fact that we're in a digestion phase, and we're actually in the third quarter of it, that has a significant impact on mix that's affecting our ASPs. You're also seeing tremendous demand in PCs well above our expectations, obviously, contributing to the beat in Q4 continuing into Q1 and actually, we think continuingly strongly into the first half. And that's largely small core type devices, so we have an ASP effect there as well.
We are seeing some higher 7-nanometer costs impacting the -- our outlook for gross margin. And we are getting the benefit from NAND, as you talk about and -- but we're also seeing more savings in 10-nanometer costs as we're making more progress there than we've -- than actually we were even expecting. It's accelerating. So we're pleased with that. 
As you think about the full year, I think trying to take a compare off of Q1 when we're impacted on ASPs, both from DCG and from CCG, makes for a difficult full year extrapolation. We're going to come back to you with a full year outlook, and we can go more into it. But in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that we see as we go into the year, obviously, we're going to have higher 10-nanometer volume, which is going to impact gross margins overall. The client mix is going to continue to be heavily weighted, particularly in the first half on small core.
I think on data center, we think there'll continue to be competitive pressures on ASPs, but I think DCG is really going to be more of a cost story with 10-nanometer coming in, although we're much further along in the maturity of 10-nanometer, so it won't be as impactful as we saw with CCG last year. And then, of course, for DCG, you can expect the inclusion of Optane will have a little bit of impact on margin as well.
So the tailwinds still look very strong. Obviously, the ramp down on modem, our divestiture of the Gateway business, the sale of NAND and improvements in 10-nanometer, all tailwinds that should help us in gross margin. But we'll go into more detail on that when we guide the full year.",393

And I would -- I'd put maybe, John, just, I think, history here as a reasonably good indicator of the commentary that George provided for '21. And if you go back a year, we said gross margins would be 59% for 2020, and we ended up at 57.5%, so down 1.5 points. And if you look at the fundamental drivers of that 1.5 points versus what we thought at the beginning of the year, first, we generated $4 billion more revenue than we thought. So volume was much higher. And then when you look at the makeup of that volume, it was -- in my mind, it was all good things that foreshadow important things for '21 and beyond. First, the demand for our 10-nanometer products was much -- was higher or greater than we expected, and that was a very positive in terms of income but slight degradation in gross margin.
Second, the PC demand that we experienced during the course of the year, which, relative to where we were at the beginning of the year, was off the charts, including what we believe were share gains in the fourth quarter, came predominantly with consumer entry and education. So those 2 segments tend to be lower margin but real strong demand. And that was the gap that we didn't fill when we were capacity constrained last year.
So I think in terms of the mix of more 10-nanometer, much more PC demand at the lower end, those were things that drove down less margin percent but a lot more income than we expected a year ago. And those things, as George mentioned going into '21 are going to be -- you're going to have a much better mix because of the exit of modem and NAND, number one. Number two, 10-nanometer product cost, as George mentioned, is going to get much better during the course of the year. Number three, 14-nanometer is going to be more fully depreciated equipment. Those 3 things are very positive as of end of the year.
At the same time, George flagged 2 issues. One of it is mixed dynamics of PC TAM, we think, is going to be relatively strong, but it's -- we do believe it's going to be at the lower end. Education will be a big part of that demand. That has lower margin. And we renewed our commitment to 7-nanometer process technology, and that, in fact, will have a degradation. So in so many ways, we generated a lot more income and revenue in 2020 as the adoption of our better -- of our 10-nanometer products and lower end in consumer were very positive impacts for earnings. And those trends you'll see as we go in the first quarter and throughout 2021.",464

I wonder if we could drill down on the progress on 7-nanometer. If I look back at the comments from July, you had talked about having your first client product first half of '23. Is that still the right -- I know -- I don't want to be too granular about time frame, but it seems like early '23 versus late '23 would make a big difference. Are you still kind of on the track that you talked about in July for the first 7-nanometer output?",87

I think at the time, we said that, in effect, given the process challenges we are doing with the product road map, we expected to shift a couple of quarters into '23.

Bob, my question is if you're saying Intel will get to 7-nanometer by 2023, the competitive foundry products will still be one node ahead. TSMC is planning to ramp their 3-nanometer node next year, right, and will probably have a much bigger ramp by 2023. So I'm curious, what does Intel need to do to kind of match or leapfrog foundry capability? Because in the 2 or 3 years that you're trying to get to your 7-nanometer, competition, several with ARM-based capabilities, is still making progress. So I'm just trying to think to what is kind of the conceptual state of competitive play when we get to 2023.",116

Vivek, 2 things and we've talked about this a bit over the last couple of years that, first, our belief on delivering leadership products over time is going to be dependent on a multitude of factors. Process technology is very important. Packaging technologies become increasingly important in our mind, a multitude of architectures, CPU to XPU or including graphics and AI capabilities, memory, security, and last and not least, software. And you'll remember that we talked about those as the 6 pillars of technology required to deliver product leadership where process is very important, but it's not the only thing. So that's kind of the strategy we've been on for the last couple of years.
But secondly, we're going to continue to invest in process technology. So some of the progress we made on 7 over the last couple of quarters is important for the next generation of process technology. So as we leverage our 6 pillars of technology to deliver leadership product, we will also continue to invest in next-generation process technology beyond 7-nanometer.",176

This is Pat again. As we said, we believe the majority will be on our 7-nanometers, but we will be increasing the use of foundry capabilities in that time frame as well. Overall, it is about building, as Bob said, a competitive product that is leadership in the marketplace. And that's what our intent is to do. And as we broaden the use of our technologies across packaging, software, internal and external, we are confident that we can deliver a leadership product family in the marketplace across all of our major product categories.
Additionally, I was also very pleased to see some of the long-term innovations coming out of TD, right, as we work to close any gaps with external foundries as well as leap ahead. And clearly, we're not interested in just closing gaps. We're interested in resuming that position of the unquestioned leader in process technology, and that's our commitment.
Also, with the IDM model, we believe we have the right combination of being able to deliver supply to meet our customers' requirements by leveraging internal and external capabilities, which our competition doesn't have. And between all of these capabilities, we believe, we're striking the right balance of internal and external to deliver an unquestioned leadership product in the marketplace that meets our customers' requirements for the long term.",231

And a few general comments would be, one, is this is a great company and one that I have just great history with. As I said, 30 years as part of this company, Grove, Moore, Noyce, these are the people that I grew up, right, at their feet of learning. And to me, it really is a privilege and an honor to come back to this company. As I said, my dream job.
Second, this is a national asset. This company needs to be healthy for the technology industry for technology in America. And to me, it's an opportunity to help and to unquestionably put Intel and the United States in the technology leadership position. So I'm excited by that opportunity to do that.
It was also very exciting to see the unity of the Board in calling me to the role and with that, working closely with the Board and their enthusiasm to bring me into the company as well as the alignment on the look-forward strategy that we're laying out. And those together, and I would say the timing wasn't necessarily. I was enjoying my time at VMware, but the opportunity to come back now, be part of this great company -- and Intel has gone through cycles before, right? and clearly, as I was here, economic cycles, we've had periods where we were ahead and periods where we were behind others. Personally, I was very involved in the period where we were very, right, diminished in the marketplace and late to the multi-core. And in that period of time in 2005 through 2009, we turned around the company and unquestionably established the leadership position after a period where many were questioning the ability of the company to be successful yet again.
Great companies are able to come back from periods of difficulty and challenge, and they come back stronger, better and more capable than ever. And that, I believe, is the opportunity at Intel. And I'm confident that this company has its best days in front of it, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to be part of that.",359

Glad to see you here. I'm going to address the elephant in the room a little bit. And Pat, I understand your initial perspective on 7-nanometers looking at it for a short period of time. But at the same time, what I got to say, the company was telling us for a year that 7 nanometers is on track that it looked great, and then all of a sudden, it wasn't to the point of considering potentially massive strategic shifts. So now I mean, I guess how can we, as investors, have confidence that after a brief look that you've given at this point that things really are on track? What are you seeing that gives you that confidence? And how should we think about the current process and I guess how they feed into the risks potentially the future nodes since it sounds like you're sticking around on internal manufacturing essentially just given what we've seen at both 7 nanometers but also 10 and 14, the last several nodes before we've had problems? Like how do we get that confidence?",186

So even though my investigation was really just a few days, I'm looking at data that's been thoroughly analyzed trends over the last 6 months that clearly is bringing them to a point of greater confidence for it. I looked at that data. I came to the same decisions that they were.
At the same time, we're pausing, right, to say that everything is resolved to give me a little bit more time with the team to understand the road map and to dig deeper into those decisions. And like we said, we'll be giving more clarity on that in the near future after I've had time to analyze it more carefully.
Also, the team has been making adjustments of leadership. Ann has been doing a great job as we move her into that role. You'll be seeing we're making adjustments in the leadership of our product development teams as well, where talent is going to come into the company, are excited about the road map that we're on. You might have seen, we just announced a new fellow coming back, one of my absolute favorites while I was here, and Glenn Hinton coming back to the company. And you'll be seeing other announcements of key leaders coming back in.
So I think the team has been doing a great job getting us to this point.

Underlying the strong performance of the Data Center Group, last year was the continued penetration of Xeon, ASICs and networking connectivity solutions into your large 5G service provider customers as they continue to virtualize the core and radio access parts of their networks. I think this helped to drive the 50% growth in data center adjacencies. Last year, your networking compute segment was $6 billion and up 20% as you mentioned. So just given the continued build-out of 5G this year, does the team continue to see double-digit type of growth profile for the networking compute segment this year? And compute networking has been a segment where Intel, I think, still owns 100% share in the x86 server CPU market. Are you guys starting to see competition stepping it up in this fast-growing segment?",157

You gave most of my answer on your inquisition. I mean, first, as we've been saying for the last couple of years that we view 5G and network transformation as a significant opportunity for us to expand the role we play as more and more compute moves from the data center to the cloud, to the network, and those dumb pipes become smarter and smarter pipes. So this has been a pretty large thrust for us for the last several years.
We've made tremendous progress in migrating a custom-oriented environment to general purpose compute, and that has been a big source of growth from $1 billion business probably 5 or 6 years ago to $5 billion last year. That came primarily by leveraging the core GPU in the network environment.
But a couple of years ago, to your question, we expanded the role that we thought we could play as more and more compute happen at the network. And that included moving into the radio access space with more -- with general purpose compute but also custom architectures, including FPGAs and ASICs. And that allowed us to play a much bigger role in our customers' success in a key emerging technology that we've been focused on for a while.
So I think that maybe the one other point that I would make that we've gone -- we targeted about 20% share in that radio access space by 2022, and we hit that 40% share in 2020. So we're well ahead of where we expected. The role we play at 5G and the network is much bigger. We've developed partnerships along the way in this space, including with VMware. So I can only imagine those partnerships and complementary capabilities will allow us to play a bigger and bigger role as more and more compute moves to the network and to the edge.",315

So this is one I'm actually quite intimate with. And the opportunity at 5G as it becomes a horizontal versus a vertically controlled industry is absolutely enormous. But it's even more important than that because 5G is going to represent a platform that is redefining edge computing. It will open up smart cities, smart factories. It will displace WiFi. This is a powerful technology. It will also be deployed in private 5G environments as well.
So not only is Intel establishing a beachhead in a very important market that was never a major source of revenue for it in the past, but it is redefining all aspects of distributed computing in the future. So this leadership position that is established today is one that we'll be harvesting for the next decade. And 5G isn't just faster LTE. It is a new network with increased security, connectivity, bandwidth, better than wired capabilities and truly will open up markets as we've never seen before. This one is exciting, and the leadership position that's already been established here will be harvested for many, many years to come.",220

And the big opportunity, we're on 2 fronts. In the event of an increasingly east versus west world, we saw an opportunity for us to play a bigger role in 5G. So we talked about that. And I think as a result of the incremental investments we've made, the team has made tremendous progress on our 5G space.
At the same time, we also talked about addressing a growing need in an east versus west world where supply -- where there are dual supply chains and increased anxiety about having all your technology dependencies more in the east. So for us, what that meant was engaging both with the U.S. government and with commercial players who just were increasingly anxious about their exposures. And what we've heard from the U.S. government is, one, we need advanced access to advanced microelectronics, technology and manufacturing here in the U.S.
We need greater industrial manufacturing base here in the U.S., and we need a safe and secure supply chain increasingly here in the U.S. And with those 3 things, and this is both U.S. government and commercial customers, we're the only company that can really check all 3 boxes. So along the way, as you know, Matt, we told the U.S. government that we would be in a position, too, for the good of the industry, frankly, for the good of the country, for the good of Intel, we would leverage our competencies, our capabilities to provide foundry services to the U.S. government; and then been working very closely because foundry services require scale, how do we make sure that we have the technology that can meet both USG needs and commercial players' needs. And that's a dialogue that has been back and forth for a while. And we think we played a role both with ourselves and the Semiconductor Industry Association in trying to shape some of the incentives coming out of Washington, in effect, do a more effective job in leveling the playing field to invest in foundry services here in the U.S.",425

I think what I said is that our focus is on how do you deliver a predictable cadence of leadership products, preserve IDM advantages and invest in technology development and along the way, as a company, be much more open and engaging with the ecosystem to make sure we understand the inherent technologies that are out there and embrace technologies to the extent they might be better than what we have or not as critical in the determination of product performance differentiation. So that's a -- what we've characterized is just engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way; and broadly speaking, that may mean sharing technologies that we have that they could use or leveraging technologies that others have developed that we can use as well.
So that's -- I just think it goes back to how do we take this wonderful business model called IDM where we co-optimize, design and manufacturing. We make all the money, and we control the supply chain. How do we evolve that very powerful business model in industry and an ecosystem that's made dramatic advancements over the last 10 years where we think we can be more open minded in engaging and leveraging those?",210

Thank you, Trey. And thanks again to Bob, and it really is incredible to come back home and have my dream job. And thank you, Bob, for being the vehicle to deliver that up to me.
Four areas that I touched on briefly in my formal comments that you'll see me focus on as I come into the company: One is great products, right, where we simply will be the leader in every category that we participate. You'll see me dive into details. We'll build out the partnerships with our customers, but we're going to deliver leadership products and have a development machine that consistently does that.
Then execution. Obviously, we have to regain the confidence of our customers that our supply chain is the best, that our road map is the best and that they can rely on us for their products and their strategies for the future.
Innovation. We're going to continue to be a source, a fountain, a continual delivery vehicle for the greatest innovations of the industry. We'll be doing that with the IDM model, 7 nanometers beyond, but continuing to find radical areas to innovate because the world is looking for more digital technology as more and more of every aspect of humanity is coming online and coming to the digital foundation that we uniquely build and deliver.
And finally, culture. I was trained at the feet of Grove, and we will have the Grove-ian maniac execution, transparent, data-driven culture and rebuilding that as part of this company. And as we look across these areas, as I said, I'm convinced the best days for this company are in front of us, and this is a priority for Intel, a priority for the technology industry and our nation. And it is a sovereign duty, responsibility and opportunity for me to be taking on that role. Thank you all for joining us today.",317

Good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you for my first earnings call. I consider it an honor to be CEO of this great company. Thanks for joining today.
Intel delivered a strong Q1 that beat our January guide on both the top and bottom line, driven by exceptional demand for our products and exquisite execution by our team. We shipped a record volume of notebook CPUs. We launched new competitive Intel Core and Xeon processors. Mobileye had its best quarter ever. With tremendous industry support, we unveiled our IDM 2.0 strategy, setting a bold new course for technology leadership at Intel. The response from employees, partners and customers has been incredible. Our teams are reinvigorated, innovating and executing. It's amazing to be back at Intel, and Intel is back.
Before George takes you through the financial details of the quarter, I'll begin with the industry trends we're seeing and why Intel is well positioned to aggressively capitalize on them. Said simply, Intel is the only company with the depth and breadth of software, silicon and platforms and packaging and process with at-scale manufacturing that customers can depend on for their next-generation innovations.
There are 4 superpowers driving digital transformation: cloud, connectivity, artificial intelligence and the intelligent edge. Intel's mission, and we are uniquely positioned to do so, is to help customers harness these superpowers to improve the lives of every human on the planet.
The digitization of everything was markedly accelerated by COVID and has spurred innovation and new models of working, learning, interacting and care. Technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence, and semiconductors are the foundation. This is creating a cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors that will result in sustained growth for a decade or more.
The PC ecosystem, in particular, is experiencing a resurgence. This remote work and learning dynamics of COVID led to more PC shipments in 2020 than at any point since 2012, and that's continuing. 2021 is shaping up to be the largest PC market ever. In fact, we shipped more notebook CPUs in Q1 than in any other quarter in our history. Total platform unit volumes were up well over 30% in the first quarter. In many markets, 1 PC in every home is no longer enough. The number of PCs per household, what we call PC density, is increasing. We are seeing strong growth in education where, on a global basis, the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers still remains in the single digits. Every student needs a laptop, and we have a long way to go. In addition, there are over 400 million PCs running Windows 10 that are over 4 years old today, which is an enormous PC refresh opportunity.
Intel is leading this rejuvenation of the PC with marketing, user experience and purpose-built innovation at the software, silicon and platform level. We shipped Tiger Lake-H for notebooks and Rocket Lake for desktops, and customer reception has been enthusiastic. As a sign of our improving execution, we qualified Tiger Lake-H ahead of schedule in 10 nanometers, and we expect 10-nanometer unit volumes to cross over 14 nanometers in the second half of the year.
Our Intel Evo platform gives buyers the very best mobile experience, and we're deepening our ecosystem engagement with partners, including Microsoft, Google and Samsung to advance the PC experience in new, innovative ways. We see no signs of PC demand slowing and believe the industry will return to shipping more than 1 million units a day.
With over 100 million Xeon servers in the installed base, the world runs on Intel. Building on that foundation, we recently launched our most advanced high-performance data center platform optimized to power the industry's broadest range of workloads from the cloud to the network to the intelligent edge. At the heart of this is our new third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor codenamed Ice Lake, which offers nearly 50% gen-over-gen performance improvements across a range of workloads. We are already shipping Ice Lake to more than 30 customers, including major cloud providers, communication service providers, enterprise and HPC customers.
Another trend driving demand for more and more optimized computing performance is the infusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning into nearly every application. As the only x86 data center CPU with built-in AI acceleration, Ice Lake provides 74% gen-over-gen improvement on AI workloads. And our Habana discrete solutions address the needs of those customers with extreme AI demands in areas like training. Sometimes customers want both. For example, you see San Diego will use Intel Xeon and Habana AI accelerators to power their new Voyager supercomputer.
Mobileye set a new quarterly record. Mobileye's assisted driving technology continues to win over automakers with 8 new design wins in Q1. We have programs with 13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs. Mobileye continues to open new categories such as delivery transport with the win at Udelv and is rapidly evolving to power L4 fully autonomous robotaxis beginning next year.
We continue to have extraordinary success winning the next-generation 5G environments. A great example from this quarter is our collaboration with Google Cloud to develop solutions that help communication service providers accelerate 5G deployment across multiple network and edge locations. We're already seeing significant adoption of OneAPI and OneAPI-powered toolkits for high-performance computing, AI and data analytics. Developers and customers are embracing One API's open standards-based approach for unified programming across architectures and vendors. This includes leading cloud service providers who are embracing OneAPI at scale.
The unprecedented demand for semiconductors has stressed supply chains across the industry. We've doubled our internal wafer capacity in the last few years, but the industry is now challenged by a shortage of foundry capacity, substrates and components. We expect it will take a couple of years for the ecosystem to make the significant investments to address these shortages. This fundamental industry challenge underscores the importance of our unique and differentiated IDM 2.0 strategy. IDM 2.0 utilizes our internal factory network to reliably deliver leadership products and provide the industry another source of foundry capacity through our new Intel Foundry Services.
Leveraging our IDM advantage, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to solve substrate shortages to satisfy our customers' surging demand and gain market share. For example, by partnering closely with our suppliers, we are creatively utilizing our internal assembly factory network to remove a major constraint in our substrate supply. Coming online in Q2, this capability will increase the availability of millions of units in 2021. It's a great example where the IDM model gives us flexibility to address the dynamic market.
It's clear the industry and Intel will need more capacity to meet strong future demand, which is why we are dramatically expanding our foundry capability with Intel Foundry Services starting with a $20 billion investment for our first large-scale foundry operations in Arizona. We plan to expand other locations and establish Intel Foundry Services as a major provider of committed foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe while ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply for the world.
Since its announcement, the industry response to Intel Foundry Services has already been incredible. We are engaged with well over 50 potential customers today. We're seeing excitement from some of the top technology giants in the world across industry verticals ranging from automotive to high-performance compute and cloud service providers.
We've been responding to and proactively engaging with automotive component suppliers on how we can help them with their supply chains and alleviate shortages in both the near and long term. We're doing our part to address this global supply crisis, but we cannot do it alone. The investment needed at the scale required is immense, and it will require close industry and government partnership to address this need. Governments around the world are recognizing the critical nature of semiconductors and the need to increase advanced chip manufacturing capacity and prepare for the future. We are encouraged by President Biden's recognition of semiconductor manufacture as a critical component of our national infrastructure and its inclusion along with key research and infrastructure investments in broadband in the American Jobs plan.  
Looking ahead, we're confident our strategy will drive innovation and technology leadership for Intel. 7 nanometers is progressing well, and IDM 2.0 puts us on a path to restore process performance leadership and build on our industry-leading packaging technologies. With IDM 2.0, we will have superior capacity and supply resilience by leveraging our internal and external capacity and a superior cost structure.
By accelerating our clock rate of innovation, we will deliver leadership products in every category. In the PC business, we will follow the successful launches of Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake with Alder Lake, which is currently sampling and will ship in the second half of this year. Within the next couple of weeks, we'll tape in the compute tile for Meteor Lake, our first 7-nanometer CPU for 2023. In the data center, we will follow the strong ramp of Ice Lake with Sapphire Rapids, which is scheduled to reach production around the end of this year and ramp in the first half of 2022.
Overall, our 2023 road maps are firm and under execution and our 2024 and 2025 plans are well underway to provide unquestioned leadership products in every category we participate in. The Intel innovation machine is fired up. Before I pass it to George for the details in the quarter, let me reiterate how excited I am to be back. You can feel the energy inside of Intel, the passion to innovate and the drive that made us great.
We are reigniting our culture to attract, retain and motivate the best and brightest engineers in the industry. In fact, we've onboarded over 2,000 engineers so far this year, including the recent key hire of Sanjay Natarajan, who will co-lead our Logic Technology Development. In total, we expect to add several thousand more engineers by the end of the year.
2021 is a pivotal year as we lay the foundation of our winning IDM 2.0 strategy and invest in our future to accelerate our trajectory and execution. Given the incredible demand for computing, the strength of our IDM 2.0 strategy and the technology investments we're making, I'm certain Intel's best days are in front of us.",1728
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3423.0,2256000.0,87531444.0,Presenter Speech,George Davis,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a stronger-than-expected start to the year with both our PC notebook and Mobileye businesses achieving record quarters, when revenue was $18.6 billion, exceeding our guidance by $1.1 billion, led by strength in our PC business and the first signs of recovery in the enterprise and government portion of our data center business.
Our IOTG, Mobileye and PSG businesses also posted strong sequential growth as they began to emerge from an adverse macroeconomic environment driven by COVID. As noted in our January guidance, Q1 revenue includes an approximately $580 million onetime corporate revenue item.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4%, exceeding guide by approximately 40 basis points, largely due to flow-through on higher revenue. Q1 EPS was $1.39, up $0.29 versus guide, with the majority of the beat on strong operational performance and the balance on gains related to our ICAP portfolio. Note that these non-GAAP results exclude the impact of a charge related to VLSI litigation that are included in GAAP results.  
In Q1, we generated $5.5 billion of cash from operations and free cash flow of $1.6 billion. We repurchased $2.4 billion of shares, completing the $20 billion repurchase plan announced in October 2019. Going forward, we expect to have lower stock repurchases as we enter an investment phase to support strong demand growth in clients, build initial infrastructure for future foundry volumes and make necessary investments to accelerate our return to process leadership. We remain committed to growing the dividend.
Moving to segment performance in the quarter. CCG revenue was up 8% year-over-year, driven by all-time record notebook unit volumes, up 54% year-over-year. Increased volume in the consumer entry and education segments resulted in platform ASPs being down 20% year-over-year. Excluding this upside volume, ASPs were flat year-over-year. Combined with growth in our WiFi and Thunderbolt connectivity businesses, revenue grew overall in CCG despite the ramp down of our modem and MAX sales and the impact of exiting our connected home division. Operating income was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year on higher 10-nanometer mix and increased R&D investment.
DCG delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, somewhat above our expectations, but down 20% year-over-year on a challenging compare. Enterprise and government saw initial recovery with sequential performance above seasonal expectations, while cloud inventory digestion persisted through the quarter as expected. Strong network SoC growth and product mix drove more than half of the 14% year-over-year ASP decline.
DCG operating income in Q1 was down $2.2 billion year-over-year on lower revenue, transition to 10-nanometer, and increased R&D investment in our Xeon road map. Our intelligent edge businesses were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as COVID-related demand impacts began to subside. Specifically, IOTG revenue was up 18% quarter-over-quarter with strength in retail and industrial segments.
Mobileye revenue and operating margin were both all-time records at $377 million and $147 million, respectively. Mobileye continues to execute well and gain market segment share as the auto industry recovers from pandemic blows. PSG revenue was up 15% quarter-over-quarter with strength in its communications and embedded segments.
Moving to our Q2 and full year outlook. For Q2, we are guiding revenue of $17.8 billion, down 2% year-over-year, excluding our NAND business. We continue to see very strong demand for PCs with fulfillment challenges on industry-wide component and substrate shortages. In data center, we believe revenue bottomed in Q1 and will increase in Q2 as cloud digestion impacts begin to subside and enterprise and government momentum continues.
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, up approximately 1 point year-over-year, driven by lower inventory reserves and improved 10-nanometer cost, partially offset by factory start-up costs. We are forecasting EPS of $1.05 per share and a tax rate of 13%.
For full year, we are increasing our guidance provided in March, now forecasting $72.5 billion in revenue, up $500 million from our prior guidance, gross margin of 56.5% and EPS at $4.60, up $0.05 from our March 23 call. We now expect free cash flow to be $10.5 billion, up $500 million versus prior expectations.
We continue to see very strong PC demand with both TAM and our internal PC supply growing double digits year-over-year. But we expect CCG revenue to be more first half weighted than normal seasonality due to industry-wide supply constraints and the continuing ramp-down of modem and Apple Mac revenue. In data center, we expect increased demand in the second half as both cloud enterprise and government segments returned to growth.
Gross margin percent will be lower in the second half of the year predominantly due to increased 7-nanometer start-up costs and industry-wide supply constraints impacting client volume and mix. We expect increased R&D throughout the year as we invest in our road map and IDM 2.0 strategy.
As stated in March, this guide is tempered by DCG-related entity list uncertainty and industry-wide supply constraints primarily impacting our client, IOTG and PSG businesses. We are working closely with our supply chain partners and leveraging our unique IDM capabilities to mitigate these supply constraints, gain market segment share and outperform this guide.
With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.",860

It was good to see the unveiling of the IDM 2.0 strategy back in March. Was also good to get the 7-nanometer update and continued execution on getting that ramped in 2023. But that's just the point milestone, right? So in order to sustain your technology and performance leadership with the IDM 2.0 strategy, it's going to require the team to maintain a cadence on both internal optimization but also more importantly, to maintain a cadence of continued node shrinks to 5 nanometer and then ultimately to 3 nanometer.
I think the Intel team had previously articulated node migrations kind of every 2, 2.5 years. Pat, I think you said a yearly cadence back in March, but I assume that, that was internal optimization. But on the move to 7 to 5, can we expect the team to ramp 5 nanometers 2, 2.5 years after your 7-nanometer ramp and then 3-nanometer ramp 2, 2.5 years after 5?",164
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3423.0,2256000.0,87531448.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,7,"Thank you for the question, Harlan. And overall, as I said on the call, we're seeing very good progress on the 7-nanometer team. They're executing now. We're very confident of the changes that we made on that, right, and the move to really embrace EUV. And since we've done that, we've just seen superb execution.
And as I said, in the Unleashed event, we expect to move to a yearly cadence or better for our process technology. And we're going to be laying that path out very clearly. We're excited about our team's ability to get us back to process parity and ultimately to sustain leadership yet again. And I'm very happy with the team and some of the investments we're making, the hiring of Sanjay Natarajan that we talked about. Team is getting fired up to execute on that. 
We also see this is just one piece of our technology leadership strategy. And as we've seen in our IDM 2.0 strategy, it's about packaging. It's about the process. It's about the full set of IP that we're bringing to the table and at-scale manufacturing. And I will say some of the early enthusiasm that we've seen from some of the foundry customer pipeline is really bringing together our packaging technology with the full IDM 2.0 strategy.
So overall, getting back to the heart of your question, exactly. We are going to increase the cadence of our process technology innovations. We're seeing very positive signs since we made this change, and we're on track to parity and again, sustained leadership out in the future. Our team is firing on all cylinders, and I'm excited about what we're seeing as we monitor those milestones very rigorously going forward. This team's on fire, and we're executing.",294

I guess a follow-on question, Pat, to your foundry strategy or IDM 2.0 strategy. I get the division of gaining scale by investing for yourselves at the leading edge and then backfilling fully depreciated capacity into '22 down to 10-nanometer nodes over time and the benefit to you guys. But what's the benefit of opening up the business at the leading edge to foundry customers? And how are you going to control folks to redesign to your design? And will you have to subsidize them? Or would that be a subsidy that comes from the U.S. government? Would love to hear your thoughts there.",105

Overall, let's just paint the picture a little bit more broadly, C.J., and thanks for the question. On the IDM 2.0 strategy, we're all about making leading-edge capacity available for our foundry customers. And the world needs more leading-edge capacity, and there's very few companies that can supply it around the world. So we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm for that. It's going to cause us to build and expand our capacity more aggressively. And as you suggest, it also means we have a better monetization on the longer life cycle of a foundry business, and we're planning on getting to foundry kind of margins with that investment.
Now as we have already begun engaging with customers, we've seen enthusiasm, right? We've seen enthusiasm that they get to design on our leading process technology, and they have more choices for wherever that might be coming from. We're also seeing enthusiasm for this idea that they can bring some of their IP and bring our IP to the table. And in particular, some of the cloud customers have been very excited about that ability to say, hey, I can take some of my cool ideas and be better optimized, including things like x86 cores, to have a more optimized solution for their market requirements. This is compelling for them. And then we combine that with all the other strengths that we've talked about such as at-scale manufacturing. And in the supply-constrained environment like we're in right now, boy, that's bringing enthusiasm from customers.
Also, we get to do that with all of the other assets that we have with packaging, our software technology. Yes, we think this is a strategy that will be very powerful for the industry. And we've seen that response, early customers, the EDA tool chains, the IP suppliers. This has really hit the right time in the industry, and we are seeing the international aspects as well as the government aspect saying, ""Yes, we need a more geographically dispersed, resilient supply chain for something that's critical to the future of humanity and semiconductor technology."" This is the right strategy for the right time, and we're seeing great response from it.",364

I'll start on that one and ask George to jump in a little bit. Overall, as George said in his comments, Q1 was a little bit better than we expected for DCG in terms of revenue, and we see it improving as we go through the year. So we saw this as the bottom.
A lot of that was driven exactly, as you asked in the question, by cloud digestion. We had an extraordinary last year, and now customers are almost through the digestion of that, and we're starting to see signs that they want to start the next build phase in their cloud. But we also saw some just great successes with the enterprise business starting to pick up. Some of the networking business wins were very strong for our 5G area. So overall, we believe we're on a path back to growth.
I'd also emphasize that the Ice Lake launch, superb, right? This product, major gains in generation, the generation improvement in absolute areas of differentiation like the AI performance. And as I said, this is AI infused now into the 100 million-plus Xeon sockets as we're bringing AI into every 1 of them. This is a powerful new capability and getting great response from our customers overall.
So we feel very good about the path that we're on. And our overall outlook for the year is that we're going to continue to see that momentum build as we go through the year and expect to see the business response, the competitive position, the customers getting onboard.

I would say, really, if you think about the impact year-over-year in the first quarter, more than half of it was just the fact that we're comparing the bottom, what we now believe to be the bottom of the digestion phase with a very, very strong Q1.
The other piece is our investment is going up in this space. This is clearly -- we're -- as we make progress on 7 nanometer, you're starting to see 7-nanometer costs reflected that weren't there year-over-year. That's a good thing. That gets much better over time. Also, almost on the same scale, we've increased OpEx to drive the Xeon road map even harder in line with some of the things that Pat was talking about.
And then finally, you also have -- this is start-up of the 10-nanometer generation for server, and so you're starting to see the initial cost impacts on that. We're already seeing very strong 10-nanometer cost improvements in the client side of the business. Some of that's obviously helping DCG today, but it's going to -- they've got some work still to go through as they start to ramp their mix from 14 to 10.",197

So if more than half or about half of whatever of the ASP decline year-over-year, the 14% in data center, was due to SoC mix and product mix, what would the other half coming from? How much of that is direct ASP decline? And what should we expect on that front as we go into the second half? And how does that tie into the implied gross margin guidance in the second half, which is -- for the company, which is down something like 250 bps second half versus first half?",101

So I think -- let me just clarify, Stacy. So the lower revenue includes the ASP and volume effects compared to what we were seeing in the first quarter of last year. So that's what was over half of it. I would say the remaining was split between the factory start-up costs that I talked about, higher OpEx since we're talking about operating margin and then just the unit cost impact of ramping 10 nanometer relative to what they saw year-over-year.
And when we think about the second half of the year on the overall margin, we think you're seeing -- going to see some margin impact actually from the supply situation impacting the mix and the volume that we're going to see out of client, again, the 7-nanometer start-up costs ramp throughout the year. So that's probably the next biggest factor and then a little bit offset by the fact that we're going to see server start to recover.",161

And overall, Stacy, I'd just add, it's about building leadership products. Ice Lake is a great product, and we're seeing a strong ramp for it. As the products get better, ASPs will get better, and we're going to be very aggressive in terms of market share in this area.
So we feel like we're now very much on the front foot again in this business, and we're starting to see the market respond that way. And with some of the things that we've talked about with Ice Lake, in particular, and our Sapphire Rapids program following up, we're on a good competitive dynamic, and we're leaning into this area of our business, and we're seeing great response from our customers.",121

We're going to fight for every socket in the market. This is an area that is core to our business. We're going to be aggressive. We've just delivered a great new product for it. We're going to be using our system design, our validation, our software assets. Our customer relationships, our supply chain, everything that we can to bring value to our customers, right? They are looking for us building on that 100 million installed base of servers that we have now. This is a great business and one that we're going to be very aggressive in bringing the best things to our customers. 
And I'd also say, Stacy, that as you think about this business, this is an area that, with our cloud partners, our IDM 2.0 strategy is powerful because now we're saying to them not only are we going to be building better and better products for you in this area, but we're also going to be co-designing, co-innovating and bringing new capabilities for them to optimize solutions for their markets as well.

Pat, just sticking on the theme of data center and the cloud business. Can you help us understand why you're comfortable that this is digestion and not something more like cloud guys going to more internal solutions or solutions away from Intel? And I sort of asked the question because cloud was down about 15% year-over-year in Q4. It's down about 30% in Q1. I know you have another hard compare year-over-year on Q2, but what gives you confidence that this is digestion and not something more? And I know in George's prepared comments, he said all of data center would be up sequentially in June. Do you expect that for the cloud portion as well?",119

Our people are in their environments. We're working supply chains. We're building forecasts with them. We know what their inventory levels are. These are very intimate relationships. So I'd just say, at that level, we're confident when we speak that -- what they're doing and what we're going to see in the future on how they're digesting and deploying the products that we delivered to them last year are now ramping in and becoming instances they're selling and services they're selling as well.
I'll say, because of that intimate relationship that we have, we're quite confident in those comments. Like we said, as we see the sequential growth, we expect that across the business. We see that in networking. We see that in enterprise and government, and we see that in cloud as well.
We do see some of the elements that we talked about with respect to some of them exploring some of their own design work. And I'll just say, with that, we're very close to that. Those are fairly modest overall in terms of their volumes so far. And as I mentioned in the last question, this is an area that the IDM 2.0 strategy, the Intel Foundry Services is powerful. And the response that we've seen from those customers saying, ""Wow, now we can co-innovate without doing all the work of creating a new architectural point in the cloud environment,"" this is powerful and something that we think is uniquely going to help us to navigate them to an answer that is much more favorable for them as well as for us, and we're on -- off to a great start.",290

George, you mentioned that ramping down on buyback, which makes sense, so you addressed somewhat capital allocation. But how should investors be thinking about the impact to P&L as you go through implementing IDM 2.0?
And kind of related to that is free cash flow impact as you go to an elevated level of capital spend. And what really are the milestones that investors should be looking for?",82
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3423.0,2256000.0,87531472.0,Answer,George Davis,,Executives,31,"Yes. And thanks for the question. We're clearly going to cover a lot of those details at our Analyst Day, which will be much more forward looking. And as you know, the investment cycles are -- for foundry are long. Not only does it take time to qualify. Customers also -- capacity additions take a certain period of time.
What we're doing to be nimble is investing aggressively in the build-out of shells, which will give us -- and Arizona is a very good example of that, where, first off, we've been chasing demand for -- certainly since I've been here for a number of years. And the idea being we've got to have more optionality to respond to the market, both for foundry and also for our core market, which we cannot fulfill today.
And so what you'll see from us is really building in that optionality. So you would expect capital to be up somewhat reflecting that. That will have some impact on free cash flow, but we also -- we have a good growth forecast and -- which helps obviously with the growth of cash from operations. And so overall, I think the investment cycle for this will be logical as we lay it out. The types of returns you can get will be in investment phase for sure for the next 2 to 3 years. But then you start to see customer demand starting to balance out the investment.",243

And I'd just add to that from some of the things building on the Unleashed announcement in March, right, this is a good market, $100 billion foundry market, huge emphasis on that for leading-edge capacity, which we're uniquely suited to give. And I'll say, competitors aren't able to catch up with demand in this area and factories take a long time to build. And we're -- clearly, as George has laid out, this is something that the optionality helps our existing business as well as our foundry business.
And finally, the characteristics of the foundry business for somebody like us, it's a good business. Not only is it large, but it has good margin characteristics, and we expect that we're going to be able to produce good returns over the long term.
And as we think about this, again, we go back. The world needs more semiconductor capacity. It wants a more balanced supply chain. We're seeing industry say that. We're seeing government say that, and we're uniquely positioned to fulfill that.",173

On the near term, your implied gross margins in the back half are about 55% plus/minus. Is this the trough or -- and is this kind of the starting point for calendar '22 that we should keep in mind as you start to invest more in 7 nanometer?
And then longer term, when I look at your CapEx now, it's about 25%, 27% of sales, much higher than depreciation. So what is the additional pressure as those things converge? And when I look at the foundry business that you're talking about, the best foundry in the world makes 50% gross margin. So how should we think about gross margin both near term and the longer term?",134

First off, we're probably not going to be able to forecast '22 and beyond on this call. We'll certainly give you an idea of what margins will look like over time at Analyst Day. But for the remainder of the year, as I talked about, the first half, second half dynamics are really -- we're in a supply-constrained environment in client, and it's constrained in a way that exposes us to more small core than we would -- than our higher ASP and higher margin products.
The other piece is the 7-nanometer start-up, which I talked about, which is a good factor. This is really the -- showing the readiness of both the process and products to move forward on 7 nanometer. We will get some help because we will see strong recovery from server. Some of that is muted a little bit because this is really where they're ramping to 10 nanometer off of 14, which was a very mature node. And so it won't be quite as rich as we would expect, but I feel good about where we can drive margins over the long run.
You're not going to see material impacts this year from the IFS activities. Obviously, we'll be making some investments, but those investments for the next year or 2 really are critical just to meet -- much of that investment is critical just to meet the increasing demand that we see on a client.",242

I'll just say this is a pivotal year, right? I mean this is where we're building out the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're getting our product road map back in shape. Leadership products produce leadership margins.
And as we see, as we go through the year, we have opportunities of supply, right? As we drive revenues, if we're overachieving and as George said in his prepared remarks, we'll -- if we overachieve in supply, we will see revenue. We'll see gross margin improvements and leadership products as we're committing to on our road map over time will get us back to leadership margins.

I guess the first thing is the $500 million in prepayments that was corporate related, where was that reported from a segment perspective? Or was it sort of like sprinkled throughout all the segments?
And I guess the second part is just on CapEx, I know you had talked before about some CapEx had pushed from last year into this year. I think it was about $1.5 billion, something like that. So I'm sort of wondering what the right sort of new normal is as you trajectory into next year. Is it -- is like $20 billion the right number? Or is it a little bit less than $20 billion?",116

First off, the $500 million was not spread. It was in other revenue, so all in 1 place. On -- in terms of the CapEx, yes, we had basically 8 weeks or more of capital pushed out just because of the pandemic. It really affected the construction activities. And as you know, it continues to be challenging. But that was the -- probably the biggest factor that we saw last year.
So maybe $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, you could argue, is really just catching up with where we were behind from last year. And so you could add both that to our free cash flow estimates for the year. And also, you could bring down the CapEx requirements for this year. So I think $20 billion for this year is a good number, and we'll talk more about next year later.",143

One is bringing a foundry service where your clients can integrate what they want to design with Intel's IP, and one is more like being like a mainstream general purpose foundry to compete more directly with existing players like Samsung and TSMC.
And so what I -- and I think these 2 are very different in nature. And what I was wondering is, in the 50 conversations you've had so far, what would you say the percentage of conversations were more centered on the first one versus the second one. And then in your own mind, if you think about Intel in the long run, how do you see the balance between these 2 ways of being a foundry in your business mix?",148

Thanks for the question, Pierre. I think it's a good question. And to some degree, I say we don't know, right? We're in this phase where we're beginning to engage with customers. We have a good pipeline of customers that fit in both of those buckets, right? And definitely, some of the cloud customers, particularly interested in where they can co-mingle or create, I'll say, hybrid design, some of their IP with some of our IP. And then we have a very rich pipeline of customers really across pretty much every segment of the industry, communications providers, automakers, et cetera, that would fit into the second bucket where it's much more about them using us as a world-class foundry for all of their designs.
I'll say, we view this as a very, I'll say, right, broad set of customers that we're aiming at with a broad set of IP. And as we get IP for the RISC-V, the ARM ecosystem and the x86 ecosystem, our value proposition to customers is across that spectrum, where they don't need to opt priority side ours versus theirs. They get to design with that full spectrum.
The other thing I would say, Pierre is we're also seeing extreme interest in our packaging technologies. And here, it might be a tile from Samsung or TSMC being combined with a tile from Intel, right? And those might be on older process technologies, newer process technologies and taking advantage of our world-class packaging and assembly test technology. So we really see that full spectrum coming to bear. And it really is that combination of world-class foundry, world-class IP, world-class assembly package and test that we think gives us a unique proposition in the industry. And so far, the enthusiasm is very high for that offering.",299

And Pierre, I would add, as you talk about the 2 different alternatives, 1 of the things to remember is that if you look at our internal road map, people are used to seeing a highly differentiated and very specific to Intel set of IP capabilities. We've said over time that it's very clear that we're going to be adopting more and more of the industry ecosystem, IPs and libraries because it makes sense to do it, and it makes sense in terms of cycle time, in terms of taking advantage of capabilities that already exist out there.
So we're closing -- we're not going to -- when we intercept on some of these [ e-mails ], we're not going to be as far away, I think, as people might think in terms of being able to demonstrate a lot of knowledge around many of the IP blocks that our customers depend on today.",155

And let me just add to that. I think it's a great point, George, because every IP that I generate from the industry increases the IP available to my internal design teams. Every piece of IP I develop internally is going to be made available to the industry, right, for their use as well. This becomes a powerful reinforcing cycle, right?
Also, wherever we're being benchmarked against the industry for our process technology as we move to industry standard PDKs, right, we're seeing strong embrace from the EDA suppliers. So we see all of this as it makes our process better. It makes our products better. It increases our efficiency and takes our clock rate of innovation up with the industry.

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3423.0,2256000.0,87531490.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,49,"The simple answer to the last part of the question is, yes, that's what we just announced, right? x86 cores will be available on our foundry services and available for people to design with them. So that will include the cloud service providers to take advantage of that. So the simple answer is yes. And we do believe that the ability for our customers to take advantage of x86 this way will be a meaningful shift in how people think about ARM versus x86 because part of it was we weren't giving them the flexibility to design, to co-mingle IP as I've described it.
So they really -- if they were trying to do unique design work, they didn't have a good x86 choice. We gave them our standard products, which have lots of capabilities. But in some of -- particularly for the cloud guy, I'd say, ""Boy, I don't use those particular features. I really could optimize with a few of these other things in the network and the memory hierarchy."" And now we're saying, ""Absolutely, come on in."" And we're opening the doors of our IP, the doors of our leading process and packaging technology to be able to say let's do this together or let them do their own designs in our foundry as well. It's a very powerful strategy that I think will be a meaningful shift in the exact question that you asked.
Overall, we do think that making the x86 available this way is powerful. There are trillion lines of code that have been optimized for the x86. This is a powerful ecosystem that continues to have very great innovation and capabilities associated with it. And we're enhancing that with new capabilities like AI being integrated into the core instruction set of the new products, as you saw with Ice Lake. These are powerful differentiators. We're continuing to innovate, and the ecosystem is excited about what we're doing in our standard products as well as what we're making available through IDM 2.0.",338

And I think on the strategy event, I asked a similar one, and maybe we can dig into it a little bit more here.
I know you guys just launched Ice Lake and a lot of new features and capabilities as you lay out, but it is a platform transition from Cascade Lake and then another platform transition on to Sapphire. And I just wonder, first, what's been the feedback from Ice Lake as you guys have sampled it and now launched it in terms of platform compatibility issues that customers might be facing? And I guess the second part of the question is what has been the feedback from customers that you've sampled Sapphire Rapids to, particularly around the change from a single die to a tiled architecture and what that does to the memory system.",154
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3423.0,2256000.0,87531493.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,52,"Yes. I think we could spend an hour on that question. So let me try to be quick here for it. The response from Ice Lake has been very strong. Early ramp is very strong. Obviously, with the platform change, that does put a bit more work on the part of the customers, but we've been working through that with them. Good response to that as well. And as your question suggests, I mean, clearly, it would be better if we weren't bringing a new platform transition with Sapphire Rapids as well. But there's so many good things in that platform that the customers are excited about, new PCI, new DDR and probably most seminally is the new CXL launch, right, as part of that.
And I'll tell you, opening up, right, that additional interface on the platform has gotten tremendous support from the industry, new capabilities, co-processor capabilities, memory pooling capabilities. It really has been maybe the most exciting new platform capability since the PCI gen when we introduced that quite a number of years ago. So a lot of excitement about that. And particularly for cloud customers, who have seen their memory portion of their TCO costs rise quite rapidly, there's a lot of enthusiasm in that area of the platform.
So I'd say, overall, yes, we would have probably liked to have less platform transitions than this has induced, but so far, the response from customers is they're going through those transitions with us. They're seeing value in those transitions. And particularly, as I say, as we look out to the Sapphire Rapids generation, there's a lot of value in there with some of the major, major enhancements that are part of that.
Obviously, as we look further out in time, having more platform stability in the architecture, I think, is something we're striving for. And I think as we lay out the '23, '24, '25 road map directions to the industry, you'll start to see that theme much more seminally, right, centered in the road map. Also, I think as we get all aspects of our core leadership, our vector AI leadership, process leadership, all of those start to come into play, I think we'll see a very nice view of how that platform architecture lays out over time.",383

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. It's a thrilling time for both the semiconductor industry and for Intel. We're seeing unprecedented demand as the digitization of everything is accelerated by the superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure and, increasingly, ubiquitous compute. Our breadth and depth of software, silicon and platforms and packaging and process, combined with our at-scale manufacturing, uniquely positions Intel to capitalize on this vast growth opportunity. 
Our Q2 results, which exceeded our top and bottom line expectations, reflect the strength of the industry, the demand for our products as well as the superb execution of our factory network. As I've said before, we are only in the early innings of what is likely to be a decade of sustained growth across the industry. Our momentum is building as we once again beat expectations and raised our full year revenue and EPS guidance. 
Since laying out our IDM 2.0 strategy in March, we feel increasingly confident that we're moving the company forward toward our goal of delivering leadership products in every category in which we compete. While we have work to do, we are making strides to renew our execution machine. 7-nanometer is progressing very well. We've launched new innovative products, established Intel foundry services and made operational and organizational changes to lay the foundation needed to win in the next phase of our company's great history. Here at Intel, we're proud of our past, pragmatic about the work ahead but, most importantly, confident in our future. 
Now let me share some more detail on what we are seeing in the market. As compute is becoming more ubiquitous, we're seeing sustained strength in client demand. The ecosystem is back to shipping over 1 million PC units a day despite grappling with component shortages. I expect PC TAM growth will continue in 2022 and beyond driven by 3 factors. 
First, PC density or PCs per household is increasing as COVID has irreversibly changed the way we work, learn, connect and care for each other. For example, even as we emerge from COVID, we're seeing many companies opt for hybrid work models versus full return to the office. Second, replacement cycles are shortening on the larger and aging installed base. The shift to notebooks, the deployment of new operating systems and new better experiences, such as our Evo platform, will continue to drive refresh on the 400 million PCs over 4 years old that are running Windows 10. Finally, new markets and users are adopting the PC as the device of choice, and penetration rates are increasing as worldwide GDP growth makes the PC more affordable to more people. In areas like education, we see huge potential as the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers remains in the single digits. These trends underpin my belief that we are still in the early stages of a sustainable cycle of PC growth, and our OEM and channel partners have resoundingly affirmed this perspective. 
Beyond client, we are seeing near-term recovery across traditional data center market as well as explosive long-term demand from the cloud to the intelligent edge. Our digital society is creating data at an unspeakable pace, and AI is the key to unlocking the value from this data and turning it into information. As the appetite for meaningful data grows and the cost of compute falls, AI workloads are proliferating into more areas. And as a result, we expect the AI market to grow at more than 20% a year. This is why we are infusing AI across everything we do. 
Similar revolutions are occurring in the areas of connectivity where the data center will be transformed by silicon photonics and 5G, which is hitting its stride with open RAN, and in autonomous driving, all markets in which we have substantial leadership positions. 
On the other side of the equation, the strong demand environment continues to stress the supply chain. While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another 1 to 2 years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand. IDM 2.0, which combines our internal manufacturing capacity with the use of third-party foundries, best positions us to weather these challenges and work with our ecosystem partners to build a more resilient supply chain. 
With major fab construction projects underway in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland and Israel, we are investing for the future. But we are also taking action today to find innovative ways to help mitigate industry constraints. For example, on our Q1 call, I talked about using our internal assembly test network to help with portions of the substrate manufacturing process, a benefit uniquely enabled by our IDM 2.0 strategy. I am pleased to say that this effort is now online and is significantly accelerating the availability of millions of substrates for our products. 
We are also working to build the EUV ecosystem, which require significant support around the equipment, including photoresist, mass generation and metrology. A great example is IMS Nanofabrication, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel. Using a novel multi-beam technology, IMS provides the large majority of EUV mask writing tools to the industry, and we plan to accelerate investments to advance this pivotal ecosystem capability. 
In the second quarter, we continued to see Intel Foundry Services build momentum. We are now engaged with more than 100 potential customers on the basis of our 3 key value propositions. 
First, IFS will have the widest offering of IP ranging from x86 to ARM to RISC-V, which allows our customers the flexibility to design products using our IP catalog as well as their own. Second, we will offer our customers comprehensive access to a range of mature and leading-edge process and packaging capabilities. I am pleased to announce we recently signed our first major cloud customer to use IFS packaging solutions. I'll have even more news to share on IFS customer momentum on Monday. Third, IFS will offer scale manufacturing that gives our customers confidence we can meet their demand. 
As part of that, we are committed to creating a more robust, geographically-balanced and secure supply chain. Along with our $20 billion fab investment in Arizona and $3.5 billion advanced packaging investment in New Mexico, we plan to build additional capacity to support both internal and IFS growth. The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is a tremendous step forward to catalyze investments in manufacturing here in the U.S. and will serve as a tailwind to our IFS efforts. After my recent visit to Europe, we are seeing similar enthusiasm from EU governments, customers and overall ecosystem. And we expect to announce our plans for our next U.S. and European sites by the end of this year. 
Moving to our continued focus on execution. As I said at the start of the call, we are pragmatic about the work in front of us but supremely confident of our future. Under IDM 2.0, our factory network continues to deliver, and we are now manufacturing more 10-nanometer wafers than 14-nanometer. As 10-nanometer volumes ramp, economics are improving, with 10-nanometer wafer cost 45% lower year-over-year, with more to come. We will talk more about our plans for process and packaging leadership in our Intel Accelerated event this Monday. I hope you will join me for the critical update. 
On our path back to unquestioned product leadership, customers continue to choose Intel. Using our broad portfolio of assets, we will continue to compete aggressively for market segment share. In Q1, we gained PC share with record notebook sales, following that with record Q2 revenue. We launched 12 new processors, and Tiger Lake is ramping even better than expected with more than 50 million units shipped to date. Finally, our future client road map remains strong, and we expect to ship several million units of Alder Lake to customers in the second half. And Meteor Lake remains on track for production in 2023. 
Beyond the CPU, we reached a major milestone with our partners at Microsoft with the announcement of Windows 11. We deepened our co-engineering efforts to enable new experiences, including running Android applications seamlessly on PCs and optimized for Intel-based platforms. 
We're gaining similar momentum through the year in the data center. Q1 was the low point in revenue for the year, and we exceeded our plan in Q2. We expect DCG to grow sequentially, achieving double-digit year-on-year growth in the second half as it accelerates through the year. 
Ice Lake is ramping broadly to customers, including Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu, Oracle and other major service providers and enterprise customers. Additionally, we continue to extend our leadership in networking by delivering a truly cloud agnostic platform using Xeon scalable processors and accelerators in partnership with Ericsson. This will allow operators like Verizon to introduce a virtualized RAN solution across all deployment scenarios, including existing footprints. 
Finally, Mobileye further solidified its position as the leading supplier of advanced driver assistance platforms. In Q2, we announced a major win with Toyota and closed 10 additional design wins for over 16 million total lifetime units. Earlier this week, we had another exciting milestone as Mobileye became the first industry player to start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City, a challenging driving environment for humans, let alone AVs. With vehicles in Israel, Germany, Detroit, Tokyo, Shanghai and coming soon to Paris, Mobileye has the largest global footprint in the AV industry, enabled by our unique REM distributed mapping technology. By year-end, we will have over 1 million vehicles providing telemetry for dynamic crowdsourced mapping, a unique and powerful advantage of Mobileye. 
At Intel, we have a saying, ""We begin with sand and the rest is our people."" At no other point in our history have our people and culture been more important to our success. We've recently made strategic organizational changes to further strengthen our technology leadership and accelerate our execution. We have restructured our data platform group into 2 business units: the Data Center and AI Group led by Sandra Rivera, an Intel veteran with deep knowledge of data center silicon and software; and the Network and Edge Group, which will be led by Nick McKeown, a renowned leader in the networking industry. We have also created the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group led by Raja Koduri, to increase the company's focus in key growth areas of high-performance computing and graphics. We're also highly encouraged to have Shlomit Weiss rejoin to strengthen our design engineering core. Finally, Greg Lavender, who joins as Intel CTO and GM of our Software and Advanced Technology Group, will drive a unified vision for our software strategy across Intel and ensure it remains a competitive differentiator for us. 
I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team to drive the future of Intel. Together, we will continue to sharpen our focus on execution, accelerate innovation and unleash the talent inside Intel. 
While there is more work ahead, we are moving at a torrid pace, and I look forward to providing several updates in the coming months. On Monday, I invite you to attend Intel Accelerated where we will lay out our road map to regain process performance leadership and share what comes next for our world-class packaging technologies. In October, we will hold our Intel Innovation event, a geek fest for the industry to come together and explore the technology that will drive the next decade and beyond. 
Finally, at our Investor Day on November 18, we'll pull it all together and present a compelling long-term business plan to drive sustained growth and shareholder value creation. As you can see, we have a lot planned for the rest of the year. 
But for now, I'll turn it over to George to discuss our Q2 performance and outlook.",1968

As Pat said, we had a very strong Q2 and are raising full year revenue guidance by $1 billion despite a highly constrained supply environment. 
Q2 revenue was $18.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $700 million. This upside was led by continued strength in our PC business and earlier-than-expected recovery in both our IOTG business and the enterprise portion of the Data Center segment. The PC and Mobileye businesses both achieved record Q2 revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, exceeding guide by 220 basis points, primarily due to improved mix and strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q2 EPS was $1.28, up $0.23 versus guide, largely on strong operational performance across the board. In Q2, we generated $8.7 billion of cash from operations, free cash flow of $5.1 billion and paid dividends of $1.4 billion. 
Moving to segment performance in the quarter. CCG revenue was $10.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The growth of our core client business is up 14% when we exclude the impact of the ramping-down Apple modem business and the exit of our Home Gateway business. This shows the strong underlying growth in our client business despite a supply-constrained environment. Platform ASPs in Client were up 4% sequentially on richer mix within notebook and increased desktop volume. On a year-over-year basis, the strength in consumer entry and education led to lower overall ASPs. Operating income was $3.8 billion, up 32% year-over-year on higher revenue, lower inventory reserves and reduced 10-nanometer cost. 
DCG revenue was $6.5 billion, exceeding our expectations, but down 9% year-over-year versus a challenging compare and a continued competitive environment. Sequentially, DCG grew 16%, with all segments growing quarter-over-quarter and enterprise returning to year-over-year growth. Operating income was $1.9 billion, down 37% year-over-year, primarily on lower revenue, the 10-nanometer production ramp and increased R&D investment. 
IOTG revenue was $984 million, up 47% year-over-year on a broad-based recovery from COVID-driven lows and up 8% quarter-over-quarter led by strength in the retail segment. Operating margin was $287 million, up 310% year-over-year, returning to pre-COVID levels of profitability. Mobileye revenue was $327 million, up 124% year-over-year but down sequentially due to COVID-related slowdowns at automotive OEMs. Operating margin was $109 million. Mobileye continues to execute extremely well, and we are seeing continued design win momentum. 
PSG revenue was $486 million, down 3% year-over-year due to significant supply constraints. Demand continues to significantly exceed supply for FPGAs. Operating margin was $82 million, up 3% year-over-year. 
Moving to our Q3 and full year outlook. For Q3, we are guiding revenue of $18.2 billion, up 5.4% year-over-year. We remain in a highly constrained environment where we are unable to fully supply customer demand. 
In CCG, we continue to see very strong demand for our client products and expect TAM growth to continue. However, persistent industry-wide component and substrate shortages are expected to lower CCG revenue sequentially. We expect supply shortages to continue for several quarters but appear to be particularly acute for Client in Q3. 
In Data Center, we expect enterprise and government and cloud to show further recovery in Q3. As a result, we expect to see strong year-over-year growth in the quarter. Sequentially, we are expecting modest growth that is expected to accelerate further in Q4. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 55%, down approximately 150 basis points year-over-year as 7-nanometer gains momentum and the Meteor Lake pilot line ramps. We are also seeing pre-PRQ reserves on our Alder Lake product. 
We are forecasting EPS of $1.10 per share and a tax rate of approximately 4%. The forecast includes approximately $0.10 of onetime tax benefit from our onshoring of certain entities as part of our long-term tax planning. 
Turning to our full year outlook. We are raising our revenue guidance by $1 billion to $73.5 billion with gross margin of 56.5% and EPS of $4.80, up $0.20 from our prior guide. Consistent with the investment mode we are in under IDM 2.0, we expect CapEx of $19 billion to $20 billion this year and free cash flow to be $11 billion, up $500 million versus prior expectations. 
In our CCG business, we expect full year revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year as growth from an increasing TAM is offset by supply constraints and the ramp down of our Apple modem and CPU revenue and the exit of our Home Gateway business. Adjusting for all of the Apple and Home Gateway business, CCG would have been up high single digits year-over-year. 
For DCG, we expect full year revenue to be slightly down year-over-year but with second half revenue significantly higher than first half as E&G and cloud recovers. As a result, we expect Data Center will return to year-over-year growth in both Q3 and Q4. 
Gross margin percent is expected to be lower in the second half of the year, predominantly due to 7-nanometer factory ramp, worsening supply constraints impacting client volume and mix and a onetime charge in Q4 related to our Intel federal business. For your models, absent this onetime charge, the implied Q4 gross margin would be approximately flat to Q3. It is good to remember that our investment in 7-nanometer represents a normal impact to introducing new process technologies. Since April, we have seen supply chain inflation happening faster than we are electing to pass-through to our customers, further impacting our second half gross margin outlook. We expect increased R&D through the year as we invest in our road map and IDM 2.0 strategy, resulting in year-over-year growth in OpEx of approximately 10%. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.",942

And I'm wondering, can you just comment? Broadly, do you think that M&A would significantly accelerate your foundry efforts?

So first, I'd say, obviously, we can't comment specifically on the speculation that you've been hearing but feel well to say we are very happy with the build-out of the IFS business. As you say, it will include mature nodes, our 22FFL. It will also include our leading-edge nodes, as well our packaging offerings. Overall, we're just seeing great momentum over 100 customers in our pipeline, and we fully expect that this is going to be a great business for us. 
At this point, we would not say that M&A is critical but nor would we rule it out. Our view is that industry consolidation is very likely. The intense R&D, the need to move to modern and leading-edge nodes, the massive capital investments required, we just simply view that smaller players simply won't be able to keep up, and foundries without leading edge capabilities will be left behind. And we're continually seeking ways to accelerate our plans with IFS. If an acquisition can help, we will certainly not rule it out. Thank you.",187

It sounds like within the client business, mix explains a lot of the decline in ASPs year-over-year. But when I look at the Data Center Group, especially with enterprise up and calms down year-over-year, I was a little bit surprised to see ASPs in that group down about 7% year-over-year. Can you help us understand what's mix versus like-for-like? And as you think about regaining product dominance, how do you use pricing to kind of maintain a share as you get sort of your feet back underneath you?",108

And broadly speaking -- my comments will be a little bit specific, to start with, on the Data Center business proper. Data Center business, good, good recovery in Q2. And with that, there was some ASP decline, some of that's competitive driven. A little bit of that is mix driven but a bit more competitive. Our outlook there is that we see fairly stable pricing and market segment share in the Data Center business for the second half of the year. And that's driven by, I'll just say, we are bringing everything we got to the table to continue to win back the market and, with that, our software resources, our deep investments with our customers, the increasing strength of our product line. 
I'd also highlight that we have a very strong ramp for the Ice Lake product, which is very competitive, a clear leadership on a number of metrics, the critical ones such as AI performance. And we're also starting to see the return to growth in cloud, as you note, but stronger growth in the enterprise portion of the market. So overall, DCG, good growth second half over first half. We'll be very competitive with that business. But it's a supply-constrained environment overall, which is the similar case for the Client business. So overall, we don't see a lot of movement on ASP first half to second half in either of those businesses. It really is about supply limitations. 
And as George commented, we're not passing through all of our supply constraint, price increases that we're seeing, from our supply chain. We really see as an opportunity to be investing with our customers, rebuilding their confidence and partnership for the future. And we're feeling very good about our overall strength, momentum and competitiveness as we go into the second half.",303

(sic) [ John ], I would just add, the Q2 number, which looks like a double-digit ASP decrease for CCG, I would just remind you that that's a year-over-year comparison where we have a much bigger mix of the small core products, which is really driving that. You saw units were up 33%, and ASPs were down 15%. It's really the mix that is reflected there.",69

Thanks, Joe. I'll take that one. And overall, as I said, the Data Center business, strong momentum. And we really felt Q1 as the low point, Q2 gaining momentum second half, Ice Lake ramp being very strong. And obviously, customers are now very anxious and excited about Sapphire Rapids, huge performance improvements but also a huge feature capabilities as part of that. So we did add a bit more time for the validation cycle for it. We are now deep into the validation. It's in the hands of customers with volume sampling underway, and they're quite excited about not just the performance capabilities, core count increases, but a lot of the new technologies in the area of new memory capabilities, new PCI gen 5 capabilities, many of the new features that we brought in here for AI performance in particular. 
So overall, it's going to be a great product, and we're expecting to see a very strong ramp of it in the first half of next year. And this, we think, will just continue to build the momentum of the Data Center business. As we've indicated, a strong second half as forecast, and we're going to build on that as we go into next year with Sapphire Rapids.

Because when I look at the fabless landscape, it's not the cloud vendors who are the large fabless customers, right? It's Apple. It's Qualcomm. It's NVIDIA, Marvell, AMD, et cetera.

Vivek, this is George. A couple of things, number one, we're short of supply. So we're the first big customer going into that expanded capacity. And we'll open up those facilities. Getting the shelves and, what I would call, the lower cost elements in place is something that, quite frankly, we've fallen behind on over the last few years. So this is -- we're playing a little catch-up just for our own requirements. 
With foundry, we'll be talking about some potential customers. We've talked about 100 customers that are talking to us about foundry opportunities. Obviously, when you bring on a new foundry customer, as you look at the lead times that are needed for that and the lead times that are needed to actually do the most expensive part of adding to your capacity, those things actually line up pretty well. So we'll manage that quite tightly. We'll go into this in more detail in November. But it's not a -- this is not intended to be we'll just keep building and hoping that somebody shows up. It's going to be tied to the demand signals that we're receiving not only for us, which are significantly in excess of our capacity today, but also for the customers we're working with, which I believe we'll be talking about more next week at our event.",225

We're going to have a range of offerings on the menu, if you could, for modern nodes as well as leading edge nodes. We expect a range of customers across different segments of the marketplace, including some of the largest users of wafer capacity in the industry.

Thank you, Matt. And Greg will be CTO, the company's CTO. So as part of that remit will be all of our labs, advanced research capabilities. We have a pool of hundreds of PhDs doing advanced research and some of the most leading edge work is done. And as you probably know about Greg as well, he was a UT professor and was my CTO at VMware. He will also be the leader of all of our central software activities. This is a large organization. It's BIOS, drivers, compilers, all of those core things and the One API initiative, which we're now starting to see major partners come and align with us around One API. 
The third and maybe most important area under his remit will be standardizing the upper layers of the software stack for us and, in particular, the AI software offerings for us. And this is an area that we have, I'll say, not managed well. We've had too many pieces and different portions of the organization, so he will become the AI software leader at scale for us in an area that's going to be critical to standardize, deliver and just deliver some of the world-leading research that we have in the area of our software remit for our AI product offerings overall.

And we're really -- the first half, second half year-over-year, you got it, right? We're seeing the growth for it. And like we said, we saw the bottom in Q1, great Q2 momentum continuing into the second half and next year. And we saw strong growth in enterprise and government, recovery in cloud, and we're seeing growth in that area. But as you say -- I'll just say, we are so well positioned on the edge and the 5G. The open RAN, VRAN initiatives in the industry are now hitting stride. And I think I've only been on 3 major service provider calls this week on exactly that topic, right, where they're really starting to look at those deployments at scale for a standardized software-driven edge environment for their 5G networks. 
And I'd also say this is a victory for innovation. Just a year ago, we were very -- just 3 years ago, there was grave geopolitical concerns around 5G and would there ever be flexibility for how that would get deployed nationally. Now everybody is aligning against the ORAN, VRAN initiatives as the way to do their 5G broad deployments. And the Intel platform sits in the center of those almost everywhere in the world.

So in terms of -- if we're looking at the -- particularly, let's look at Q3 because that's where we discussed the Alder Lake pre-PRQ reserves. It's one of the 2 top movers. When you look at being down 400 basis points, certainly, it's not the majority, but it's a meaningful impact in the quarter. 7-nanometer start-up costs ramping is the biggest impact far and away. 
In terms of supply tightness, the challenge is -- part of what made Q2 so great was customers really challenged our sales teams and our factories to remix within a quarter to provide them with the components that they could then match with what their supply chain was providing them so they could get to market. And this was -- watching it was super impressive, a little bit scary at times. But the team did a fantastic job. So we did a really good job of eating up a lot of our substrates, some of which we thought we would have available to us in Q3. So the supply impact is more of a volume impact. Customers are already starting to mix upwards. So that's usually a positive for gross margin. And if there's upside in the second half, it will come from both higher substrates and the ability and a higher mix. And that could well be the case. 
We were cautious. Q3, we could see we had a real supply challenge. I mean it's acute. But Q4, we're doing everything we can to help our substrate suppliers increase supply, including finishing up some of their manufacturing in our own facilities, which is something we could do as an IDM. If we have more success than we can forecast today, maybe Q4 could be seen as conservative.",295

But as you know, the fact that we have the 7-nanometer start-up ramping is a good sign that we're getting close to being able to get products ramping.

We do think it generally moderates market share movements in the industry, period. And if anything, we're able to use it as an advantage because we're able to pull some of those substrate steps. And just to be clear, we're still relying on our substrate network, but we're pulling some of the back-end processing into our own factories, which allows us to essentially get more out of the capacity that's available in the industry. And that's what's enabling us to, I'll say, continue to overachieve on the overall market share gains that we've been seeing. This has been an important factor. We do have some factored into our second half. We do hope to continue to overachieve in that area. 
And if I'd say, why did we overachieve so much in Q2, the heroes for the quarter for us were our manufacturing and operations team. They just did a superb job for us and really relying on them for the second half. And as George said, hey, if there's more opportunity for us to overachieve on the guide that we set for the second half, it's going to come at the hands of their ability to essentially create more out of nothing, find capacity in the industry, build it out. And we're doing quite well in this respect. But overall, it is a constrained environment. And as a result, we and everybody else are trying to drive our factories harder, drive yields better and be able to improve the supply chain of the industry. And we're quite excited about the enthusiasm we see in this consistent strong demand signal as the world becomes more digital, and we're going to be building our internal factories rapidly, our supply chains rapidly and working with our supply chain quite aggressively.",298

It's great to see that it improved from first quarter to second quarter. And given the revenue trajectory, I would assume it would improve again in the back half of the year. But kind of from trough to trough, 2018 digestion period to this most recent one, the operating margin is about 10 points lower, mid-20s roughly versus mid-30s prior. And I really wanted to understand why is it lower this time. And perhaps even much more importantly, going forward, is there anything structurally that is going to stop that from returning back to the 40% to 50% operating margin range you guys have historically driven? Competitive dynamics need to catch up on the manufacturing side, so you have headwinds there, people customizing more cloud competition internally.

Maybe starting at the latter part of your question, there's no long-term reason why you could not see DCG return to more historical margins. What you're seeing today is a reflection of a couple of things. First off, year-over-year, you've got significant factory start-up costs embedded for them as you look at their operating margin. I would say another thing that people maybe are overlooking is our OpEx investments. We have significantly increased the OpEx in key areas of the company, even as we've taken down about $2 billion of OpEx since 2018 on various portfolio actions. And the DCG and the Xeon product line is absolutely critical to the company. And so we have substantially increased OpEx within that as well. So that's the second largest impact, and we're going to continue to do that for as long as it's needed. 
And as you know, ultimately, it is your product competitiveness that gives you more flexibility to drive up ASPs further from today and drive higher gross margins. But I think the early comparisons this year were just off of such a strong compare. I mean the first half of last year was just super strong, high XCC count quarters in the first half of this year, although Q2, quite frankly, was a lot better than we thought, coming into it for DCG on strength in enterprise. But the comparisons year-over-year were quite tough. As you noted, it's coming up. And yes, 7-nanometer startup's got to be absorbed and higher OpEx. But I think as you see, our product portfolio continue to get stronger and stronger with Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids and then for the generations after that. There's no reason why, over time, we don't get back to historic levels.",294

And this, in fact, creates a unique competitive differentiation where our IP with their IP is creating products that are very uniquely beneficial to their TCO and very co-engineered, so very sticky for both of us. And the example customer that we said, very large cloud customers, one of our IFS early customers, is an example of that kind of co-engineering that we expect that we'll be doing at scale for that portion of the marketplace pretty uniquely.",100

So in your slide deck for second quarter, you said that the ASPs were down and you referred to an increasingly competitive environment in servers. But in response to one of the questions earlier on, you said you expect a more stable share and pricing environment in DCG. And then the final thing that caught my attention was on the substrate side, you said you were kind of leveraging that back end to moderate market share. So is that true for the -- did I get that correct that the competitive environment will be stable versus what it was in the second quarter? And then is the substrate also enabling -- your captive footprint in the back end is allowing you to probably stabilize share losses in the Data Center side as well.",152

So I'd just say, I think that the substrate and the overall supply limitations keeps, I'll say, a bound on market share movements in that area of the business overall. We do think incrementally, our IDM capabilities give us a bit more capacity, and we saw market share gains, for instance, in the first half of the year in the Client business as a result of that. And we do think that gives us some ability to hopefully do a bit better than we've even guided with if it occurs. But overall, yes, your question is in the right domain, fairly stable ASPs, fairly stable market segment share in the data center in the second half of the year, which, as we've already said, has substantially improved from last year as well as from the first half of this year. 
Products are getting more competitive. Stronger products give us more ASP capabilities as they become more competitive. So overall, we're feeling like the bottom was Q1, Q2 showed that to be the case, even a bit above our expectations, and we're in a great trajectory for the second half and into next year. Thank you. 
Well, I think we'll wrap up at this point. And before we sign off, one last opportunity to say that it is an honor to be back for my dream job, to run this iconic company at this pivotal time in the history of the semiconductor industry. We're rebuilding our heritage of execution, innovation and growth. Along with the 110,000 talented, passionate Intel employees, I am just absolutely confident that the best days for this company are ahead of us.

Q3 was a solid quarter where we navigated a challenging supply environment to deliver year-over-year growth on the top line while beating expectations on gross margin and EPS. We had record third quarter revenue in DCG and Mobileye, while IOTG had an all-time record as it continued its recovery from COVID slowdowns. Our focus on execution continued as we delivered on our initial IDM 2.0 commitments. We broke ground on new fabs, shared our accelerated path to regain process performance leadership and made our most dramatic architecture announcements in a decade. We also announced major customer wins across every part of our business, including in the data center with AWS and Google, new Evo designs and client and exciting Mobileye partnerships with ZEEKR and Sixt SE. 
The demand for semiconductors remains strong, and our factories performed exceptionally well in a highly dynamic environment where match sets posed huge challenges for our customers and overall industry supply remained very constrained. The resilience of our factory network was on display, delivering considerable upside and reacting to rapid demand shifts, reinforcing the unique and strategic value of IDM 2.0. 
While we are still in the early stages of our journey, we are getting better every day. It is clear that we have to move even faster, be even more nimble and invest now to achieve our goals of undisputed leadership down the road. I can see the enormous potential that lies ahead, and I couldn't be prouder of the Intel team and the progress that we are making. 
Let me begin with what we are seeing in the market. Demand remains strong across all of our segments, and I continue to believe that we're just starting a cycle of sustained growth, which we are well positioned to capture. The digitization of everything accelerated by the 4 superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure and ubiquitous compute are driving the sustained need for more semiconductors, and the market is expected to double to $1 trillion by 2030. In that time frame, the market for leading-edge nodes will rise to be over 50% of the total, while the market for leading-edge foundry services will grow at twice the rate of the semi industry overall. 
We are one of the few companies with both the technical and financial resources to win in a market that is increasingly leading edge and challenged by the extreme physics of rejuvenating and continuing Moore's law. PC demand remains very strong, and we believe the 2021 TAM will grow double digits even as ecosystem shortages constrain our customers' ability to ship finished systems. Dell, HP, Lenovo, along with other OEMs and ecosystem partners agree that PCs are now a structurally larger and sustainably growing market. As we head into 2022, we expect the ecosystem supply situation to gradually improve and the PC market will continue to grow as tailwinds from Win 11, hybrid work models, a larger installed base and compelling new platforms drive PC density, shorter replacement cycles and penetration of new markets. 
Against this backdrop, our products have strong momentum driven by compelling platforms, including 30 new Evo Tiger Lake designs with 13 of our OEMs. Tiger Lake has shipped more than 70 million units this year, making it our fastest-ramping notebook ever. 
We are raising the bar again with Alder Lake, our first performance hybrid architecture product which I am pleased to say began shipping in Q3 on Intel 7 and will start to launch next week at Innovation. The Alder Lake family will offer customers significant advantages across a range of workloads, including gaming, content creation and AI acceleration. Alder Lake will scale from ultra mobile to desktop and will go to market across our range of segments, form factors and power envelopes faster than any new architecture in Intel's history. 
Turning to the data center. New and existing workloads continue to move to the cloud. Security and privacy requirements are driving enterprise deployments, and the 5G build-out is powering networking. I remain confident about the long term of the data center despite regulatory changes in China and short-term ecosystem supply constraints impacting some customers. 
Customers continue to choose Intel for their data center needs, and our third-gen scalable Xeon processor Ice Lake has shipped over 1 million units since launching in April, and we expect to ship over 1 million units again in Q4 alone. All of our OEMs are currently shipping systems, and we expect all our major cloud customers have announced instances by the end of the year. This includes Google as well as AWS who have already launched their highest-performing Xeon EC2 instances ever, a tremendous milestone resulting from our close collaboration of almost 15 years. 
Looking ahead, customers remain very excited by Sapphire Rapids, which we expect to have in production in Q1. Sapphire Rapids sets the standard for next-generation data center processors and was recently selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to power compute-intensive modeling supporting their stockpile stewardship program. In core and mobile networks, Intel is powering the transformation to virtualize cloud-native deployments, 50% of new core network deployments are now running on off-the-shelf servers, and we expect that to increase to over 80% by 2024. 
The next-generation transformation is the virtualization of the radio access network known as vRAN. We're working with service providers globally to enable this transition, including Verizon, Rakuten, DISH Network and others. Today, nearly all early commercial deployments are running on Xeon and our FlexRAN software reference architecture. We see tremendous opportunity in vRAN, and in Q3, we announced the collaboration with Juniper Networks to accelerate future deployments. Overall, we expect global vRAN base station deployments to move from hundreds to hundreds of thousands and eventually millions with private 5G over the next several years. Finally, edge compute needs continue to grow, and our IOTG business had an all-time quarterly record in Q3. 
In mobility, the market for automotive silicon is expected to more than double to $115 billion by the end of the decade as AVs begin to move from the garage to the streets. Mobileye is helping to lead this change, and we recently announced that we will begin offering driverless robotaxi service starting next year in collaboration with Sixt SE. From PC to data center to the network to the edge, Q3 was full of examples of the increasing need for semiconductors and where customers continue to choose Intel. 
Since my return, we've not only laid out our road map for success, but more importantly, we've already started executing in what I like to say is a torrid pace. Back in March, when we unveiled our powerful new IDM 2.0 strategy, I outlined our course for a new era of innovation at Intel, where I committed to: one, expand our internal and external manufacturing to address unprecedented global demand for semiconductors; two, open our doors to be a world-class foundry; three, regain process leadership; four, deliver leadership products in every category in which we compete. 
We are driving progress in every area, so let me talk through each one starting with how we are expanding our manufacturing capacity and our foundry business. Our factories are executing superbly, and construction is on or ahead of schedule across all major sites. Last month, we broke ground on our 2 new fabs in Arizona, 3 months ahead of schedule. As we expand capacity, we're using a smart capital approach so that we can adjust quickly to opportunities in the market and to gain share while managing our margin structure and capital spending. There are 3 elements to smart capital. 
First, we are focused on aggressively building out shelves, which are the smaller portion of the overall cost of the fab but have the longest lead time. Having available shelf space gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online. Second, we will make effective use of external foundries, leveraging some of their unique capabilities to ensure we are delivering leadership products. We're already one of the largest foundry customers. In this quarter, we announced that key products such as Media Lake and Ponte Vecchio will leverage third parties for some of their tiles. 
Finally, we expect our plans to benefit from investments from governments who understand that a healthy semiconductor industry is vital to their economic well-being and national security. With bipartisan support in both houses, we are hopeful the CHIPS Act will be passed by the end of this year, allowing us to accelerate decisions for our next U.S. site. This will also enable a more level playing field with our competitors who enjoy significant support from their governments. 
We've also seen considerable interest in the EU with the European CHIPS Act, and the process to select our next site in Europe is proceeding rapidly. Intel remains the only global company committed to building a leading-edge foundry in the U.S. and Europe for customers around the world. Together, IDM 2.0 with smart capital uniquely positions for an enormous and unique market opportunity, including our foundry ambitions. 
IFS will enable Intel to grow faster, expand monetization of our process and packaging capabilities, leverage our design IPs more broadly and provide sustainable, superior cash flows from our assets. Since March, we have shipped our first IFS packaging units for revenue, engaged with well over 100 potential customers, including several large customers who are working with us on our leading-edge Intel 18A and we have multiple customers planning test trips on Intel 16 that will be in our factories early next year. 
We also had a significant win with the U.S. government, which selected Intel to provide commercial foundry services in the first ramp of its RAMP-C program. We are proud of this achievement and the confidence that U.S. government has in us to deliver them a trusted foundry capability. 
In July, at our Intel Accelerated event, the team and I shared the most detailed road map we've ever provided for process and packaging technologies, a road map that brings us to performance parity in '24 and clear leadership in '25. I am happy to share that Intel 7, Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 20A and Intel 18A are all on or ahead of the time lines we set out in July. For example, on Intel 4, we said we had taped out our compute tile for Meteor Lake, and this quarter, it came out of the fab and powered up, and within 30 minutes with outstanding performance right where we expected it to be. All told, this is one of the best lead product start-ups we have seen in recent memory, which speaks to the health of the process. In fact, we are using a preproduction release of Intel 4 in our newest neuromorphic computing chip, Loihi 2. 
Finally, on the product front, we are intent on delivering leadership products in every category in which we compete. In August, at our Architecture Day, we started delivering on that promises we made 5 major architecture announcements, our most dramatic updates in the last decade. We introduced hybrid computing with 2 new generations of x86 cores, enabling power-efficient designs that are performing for the most demanding workloads. 
We unveiled our Intel Arc brand for discrete graphics starting with our Alchemist product, which will be on shelf in Q1 of next year. We continued our central role in the evolving data center landscape with Mount Evans, our first ASIC-based infrastructure processing unit or IPU. Developed in close collaboration with a major cloud provider, our IPUs enable superior security capabilities and let our cloud customers move infrastructure tasks off the CPU, thereby allowing them to rent 100% of their CPU capacity to their customers. 
We also gave additional detail on Sapphire Rapids and its compelling AI and accelerator capabilities. And last, but not least, we opened the curtain on Ponte Vecchio. With our highest-ever compute density, the 100 billion transistor device delivers industry-leading flaps to accelerate AI, HPC and advanced analytic workloads. Early Ponte Vecchio silicon is already demonstrating leadership performance, setting an industry record in both inference and training throughput on popular AI benchmarks. 
Next week at our Intel Innovation event, we will take the next step forward with the renewed commitment to developers and a host of new tools, technology and product announcements, announcements that really underscore how we are rapidly bringing the geek back. 
As I have said, we are repositioning the company for long-term growth, and we are analyzing the investment plans required to achieve our goals and provide attractive long-term results for our shareholders. It is abundantly clear to us that we must invest in our future right now to accelerate past the rest of the industry and regain unquestioned leadership in what we do. 
Our investment plan is aligned with our IDM 2.0 strategy to rapidly build our manufacturing capacity in response to the expanding market, grow our share and to accelerate innovation, enabling Intel to leap ahead with new businesses and capabilities in the future. The recent reorganization around these businesses, along with the new leadership we have added is already having an impact. However, our CFO, George Davis, recently advised us that he has decided to retire in the first half of next year. We are very grateful to George for his dedicated service and the leadership with the company, and he will be working with us for a smooth transition. We are currently engaged in a search for George's successor, and he is helping us with the process. 
I naturally want to give his successor an opportunity to participate  in optimizing our long-range plan, and we would not want to hold a critical Investor Day without the new CFO being in place. As such, we have decided to move our event to February 17 of next year. This has the added benefit of hopefully being a more in-person event while giving us a better view of the government investments from which we expect to benefit. We have made this decision for very practical reasons of George's retirement. 
The company is running well. We are confident in our process technology and product road maps. Our business is healthy, and our markets remain strong. And above all, we are executing on our plan. 
Given the new timing of our Investor Day, I do want to take this opportunity to paint a general picture of what our plan looks like, and George will share a few more details in a few minutes. 
We have a huge opportunity with new businesses in graphics, networking, foundry and mobility, all large and growing segments. When combined with the continued expansion of our current client and data center markets, we cannot and will not miss this opportunity. Investing now will enable us to reposition the company to deliver double-digit revenue growth as these investments pay off. 
While these investments will pressure free cash flow in the short term, our operating cash flow will remain strong, reflecting the high quality of our business, and we remain committed to a healthy and growing dividend. 
As with free cash flow, our gross margins will be below current levels for the next 2 to 3 years before recovering but will remain comfortably above 50% as we continue to exercise financial prudence. We have the utmost confidence that our investment plans will ensure the company's long-term success and deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing the details with you in Q1, and I am confident you will agree. 
Before I turn it over to George, let me finish by saying that when I came to the company, I had 3 goals for the year: create the strategy, build the team and rebuild the culture and execution machine. We are only 8 months into the journey, but we have already achieved a lot. 
We now have a clear strategy. We've built the team by bringing in new leadership and adding over 6,000 new engineers to bolster our incredibly talented team. We've reorganized our business units to focus on our key markets. And starting next year, we expect to begin breaking out our results to more closely align with these changes and to drive increased visibility and accountability. 
And finally, as I outlined today, momentum is building as we drive a path to our roots of execution and innovation. The entire Intel team understands the work we have ahead of us, but we remain confident about our future. We have the right strategy, the right team, and we are motivated to win. I remain convinced that our best days are still ahead. 
With that, let me turn it over to George.",2781

We delivered solid results with revenue up 5% and gross margin up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong demand in our DCG and IOTG businesses despite the highly constrained industry-wide supply environment. 
Q3 revenue was $18.1 billion, slightly below our guide due to shipping and supply constraints that impacted our businesses. Demand remains strong in our PC business with particular strength in commercial, desktop and higher-end consumer notebooks, offset by inventory digestion in lower-end consumer and education segments. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 57.8%, exceeding guide by 280 basis points, primarily due to an increased mix of desktop and premium notebook products. 
Q3 EPS was $1.71, up $0.61 versus guide. $0.47 of this beat is predominantly due to a McAfee-related special dividend associated with the divestiture of their enterprise business and a onetime tax benefit. We had a strong operating beat of approximately $0.14 per share as well, largely driven by demand for higher-end products and client and lower operating expenses relative to guide. 
In Q3, we generated $9.9 billion of cash from operations and free cash flow of $5.9 billion and paid dividends of $1.4 billion. 
Moving to segment performance in the quarter. CCG revenue was $9.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year on a challenging compare and continued industry-wide component shortages that are restricting lower-end system sales. Note that when excluding the impact of ramping down our Apple CPU and modem businesses, CCG revenue is up approximately 10% year-over-year. This highlights the strong execution and underlying demand in our client business. 
Platform ASPs in client were up 9% year-over-year and 16% sequentially on increased desktop volume and a richer mix of premium notebook products. 
Operating income was $3.3 billion, down $237 million year-over-year, primarily due to increased investments in our technology and product road map. DCG revenue was $6.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year on continued recovery in our enterprise and government segment and Ice Lake ramp. These results were slightly below expectations due to industry-wide component supply constraints that primarily impacted our enterprise customers and areas of softness in PRC, including cloud, as customers adapt to new regulations. Platform ASPs were up 3% year-over-year on improved mix, driven primarily by increased enterprise and government volume. 
Operating income was $2.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year on higher revenue, partially offset by increased investments in our technology and product road map. 
IOTG achieved all-time record quarterly revenue of $1 billion, up 54% year-over-year on a broad-based recovery from COVID-driven lows with particular strength in the industrial and retail segments. 
Operating margin was $276 million, up 352% year-over-year, returning to pre-COVID levels of profitability. 
PSG revenue was $478 million, up 16% year-over-year. Demand continues to significantly exceed supply, impacting Q3 results and Q4 forecast. 
Operating margin was $76 million, up 90% year-over-year. 
Mobileye revenue was $326 million, up 39% year-over-year and achieved an all-time Q3 record. Operating margin was $105 million, up 123% year-over-year. Mobileye continues to execute well, winning key designs and rapidly growing revenue and profits. 
Moving to our Q4 outlook. We are forecasting $18.3 billion in revenue, up $200 million quarter-over-quarter, with DCG seeing modest -- more modest growth than previously expected, as China demand and supply challenges persist. CCG is expected to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter as strong demand for our higher-end products, bolstered by the launch of Alder Lake, are being offset by weaker OEM demand for lower-end products as they prioritize their limited component supply to support higher-end system sales. We see our edge businesses continuing to recover year-over-year from COVID-related impacts. 
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 53.5%, unchanged from prior expectations and continues to include the impact of a onetime charge related to our Intel federal business. Excluding this charge, gross margin will be approximately 55%, down 3 points quarter-over-quarter on new product ramps and factory start-up charges. 
We are forecasting EPS of $0.90 per share and a tax rate of 13%. We had previously expected $0.13 of the Q3 ICAP gain to have occurred in Q4, which accounts for the change from prior Q4 expectations. 
Turning to our full year outlook. We are holding revenue guidance at $73.5 billion with gross margin up modestly to 57% and EPS of $5.28, up $0.48 from our prior guide. Consistent with the investment mode we are in under IDM 2.0, we expect CapEx of $18 billion to $19 billion and free cash flow of approximately $12.5 billion, up $1.5 billion versus prior guidance. In our CCG business, we expect full year revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year as growth from an increasing TAM is offset by the ramp down of our Apple modem and CPU revenue and the exit of our Home Gateway business. Adjusting for all of the Apple and Home Gateway business, CCG would have been up approximately 9% year-over-year. 
For DCG, we expect full year revenue to be down low to mid-single digits year-over-year due to a more competitive environment consistent with our expectations, lower demand from China and industry-wide component supply constraints. 
Before moving on to some comments on our longer-term performance, I want to briefly cover changes to our non-GAAP reporting beginning in 2022 to more closely align with our semiconductor peers. First, we will be removing stock-based compensation from our operating segment and non-GAAP results. Secondly, we will exclude all gains and losses from our ICAP portfolio, a change that allows better comparability between periods by eliminating large variations in performance as we saw this quarter. We also expect to align our segment reporting with our announced new business unit configuration. We will have more details on what to expect here next quarter. 
Moving to long-term financial guidance. As Pat mentioned, with the movement of Investor Day to Q1, we want to provide some insights into the early years of our plan. First, our revenue outlook reflects fundamentally strong TAMs across our operating businesses, with growth driven by our leadership products. We see revenue in 2022 of at least $74 billion despite ongoing supply constraints. As supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products into the marketplace, we expect to see our revenue growth accelerate to a 10% to 12% CAGR over the next 4 to 5 years. For gross margin, with the impact of our investment in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, we expect gross margins between 51% and 53% over the next 2 to 3 years before moving upward. 
We are in a time of accelerated investment in capital, process node acceleration and R&D as the foundation for changing the trajectory of the past few years. In alignment with our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are forecasting 2022 CapEx of $25 billion to $28 billion with potential for further growth in subsequent years. We believe our investments position the company for very attractive long-term returns. 
Before I hand off to Q&A, as Pat mentioned, I plan to retire from Intel in May next year. I've been a public company CFO now for 15 years, and it is time for me to spend more time with family and friends as part of the next chapter in my life. It has been a true privilege and frankly, quite exciting, to work with Pat and the leadership team on the launch of IDM 2.0. And I look forward to following our transformation over the next several years.

I wonder if you could talk about the gross margins next year. What is the -- you talked about investment in 10-nanometer, but you took those ramps this year. Is it the sort of simultaneous ramp of 10 and then start-up costs of 7 that pulls that down? And why wouldn't you recover from that in subsequent years as you mature the yields thereafter? 
And I also wanted to ask just as a follow-up to that, does the accounting change? Would the numbers have been lower if not for the change to take stock compensation out of the numbers?",100

First, I'd just say, this is a pivot point for the company. We are repositioning Intel for growth to be a long-term growth company. We see the massive opportunity that we have. Near term, we could have chosen a more conservative route with modestly better financials. But instead, the Board, the management team, and this is why I came back to the company, choosing to invest to maximize the long-range business that we have. Overall, these are great markets that we're going to be leaning into with very unique positions that we have with our technologies and products. 
As you look specifically to next year's margins, we see that the decline is driven really by 2 factors. One is the new manufacturing nodes. And as you've heard us say, we're going to rapidly move through our 5 nodes in 4 years, and this will have pressure on the margins near term as we ramp those up but will quickly at an accelerated pace give us leadership capabilities that will improve margins over the horizon. 
We're also investing in our future. These investments that we're making now in our road map will pay off as those products return to leadership -- leadership products begets leadership pricing, which begets leadership margins. So as we said in our prepared remarks, comfortably above 50%, and we're confident in the multiyear recovery of the margins that result from, again, competitive process, competitive products, will produce great results for us long term. 
So overall, a couple of years of pressure returning over that horizon as we see these growth areas in our data center, our client business and these 4 new growth markets, the networking, graphics, mobility, autonomy, foundry. And we've made a strong choice. We're going to be decisive and we're very transparent, right? 
And upfront, we're laying out an understanding of where we're going. And we elected to give that guidance earlier than we might have otherwise, not just for next year, but over the horizon as well. So now is the time, and we're making that decision boldly and aggressively. 
George, do you want to help on the last part of the question?",377

Joe, the -- we're announcing the accounting change in 2022, just to give people a heads up. It's -- we think it's a pretty modest impact on gross margin. So it works within the range that we've given for the next couple of years. Obviously, we guided the next 2 to 3 years, not 2022. And so Pat did a good job of laying out what are the key drivers there. 
And the changes that we're doing on the accounting side are really -- we're out of alignment with the industry on stock-based comp. And we're also -- I think like you, probably -- we just assume not to see these large adjustments in a quarter that are for ICAP-related activities, and so we're taking that out of non-GAAP as well. Quite frankly, it -- with those 2 combined, it was net accretive with those 2 together over the last couple of years. But we think it's the time to make these changes, and we think it's consistent with what the industry has done.",178

Kind of a similar question on the longer-term side of things, Pat. If I look back over the last decade, Intel has grown double digits, I think, once in a single year. So talk a little bit about what gives you the confidence in the company being able to be a double-digit grower a couple of years out from now.",66
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3644.0,2409518.0,91673803.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,12,"Well, thank you. And as we look at these markets, we see clearly the client business with CCG, we don't expect that to be a double-digit grower. We do expect growth coming from the client business, and even IDC now is agreeing with us on growth next year. We do see the opportunity for us to be a share gainer as well as gaining more of the bill of materials of the clients as well, but our expectations there are modest in the growth of the client business. 
Clearly, the data center business, we do expect to see stronger growth. And as our products get stronger and as we've noted with Sapphire Rapids next year and the road map over '23, '24 and '25 that  we do see ourselves in a position that we'll be gaining leadership, which allows us to have pricing, margin improvements in that product line, and data center is growing. But it isn't just the data center, it's also at least 4 new business areas that we've laid out. 
And next to data center, the networking business, we have a very strong position already but also the ability to reach into the network. And the large growth that we see in the edge where Intel is very uniquely positioned. And the edge market as the 5G becomes an open RAN platform. Also, the edge deployment, smart factories, smart cities, we are very well positioned, and we expect to see substantial growth there. 
In the graphics area, we have a good business today in the integrated graphics, but the opportunity for us to reach into this large and rapidly growing GPU business, discrete graphics business, high-performance computing, we are extraordinarily well positioned to be able to satisfy what we see almost as insatiable demand in that area. And then, of course, the mobility business, we're already well underway with our Mobileye business, very unique technology position. Another great quarter from that team. And then finally, the great synergies we get from leveraging our core manufacturing assets as well as our process technology innovations. 
And as we noted in the formal comments, over half of the technology industry is going to be leading edge, right, in the second half of this decade. Very few companies can do that, and we're finding great interest for our foundry business to be able to satisfy those. 
So if you think about the growth in the core business, plus these major new business areas, and we've done a lot of modeling against this and really built a very robust plan to go execute it, we feel very confident in the double-digit CAGR that we described. We're excited about it. The teams are leaning into it. And even better than that, our customers are excited about it. And with that customer enthusiasm, I'm very confident in what we've described here. We are leaning in. Now is the time to make it happen, and we're making the investments to realize that today.",498

Pat, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the long-term growth rate question that Ross just asked, but specifically towards the foundry business. I'm kind of curious when you think about the gross margin guidance next year and the long-term CAGR of 10% to 12%. What's the impact of foundry? 
I'm assuming foundry is still going to be relatively small next year in the business. But I'm just trying to get a sense as foundry grows, how big of a contributor is it to that 10% to 12% long-term CAGR? And how do we think about the margin profile there as it unfolds?",116
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3644.0,2409518.0,91673806.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,15,"Yes. Thank you. Great question, John. And there's a -- first will be that the revenue impacts and the investment impacts of foundry are fairly modest in the next couple of years. They don't add that much to the top line. They don't detract that much from the bottom line as we're really building that business now. It's really in the later years where you're going to start to see the revenue impact really start to matter. And this is very typical of the foundry business. It takes a couple of years for a customer to pick a foundry, move a design, start to ramp it into the industry. So it really has minimal impact for the next couple of years, and then it will start to really deliver in years 4 and 5 and in the second half of the decade more significantly. 
With respect to margin, we expect that we are in our foundry business having very similar margin structures to the leader in this business today. And we see that as a good business, maybe a little bit lower margin than our best product margins today, but still would allow us to comfortably be above 50%, as I said, in the long-term guidance that we laid out. This is a great market for us to be reaching into. It allows us to leverage the R&D investments that we have in process technology to more markets. Many of our AFP blocks, as we open up the x86 architecture for increasing innovation, we get to leverage enormous amounts of R&D for new monetization opportunities. 
Also, we're leveraging our smart capital strategy where we build shells, and we start that process early that allows us to get those investments in the ground to start building some of that IFS capacity. But it also allows us to have capacity for increased market share gains and leveraging the balance between our internal and our foundry customers as well. And to leverage government investments, we expect, will be driven substantially to benefit the IFS business. 
So when we take all of that together, unique technology position, more flexible and leveraged capital positions, unique IP benefits that we bring to it, we're seeing great interest from our foundry customers already. We're seeing that on mature nodes like our Intel 16, but very much from some of the largest customers in the industry with our leading-edge technologies, where we're getting a lot of excitement to be on the best transistors that are available on the planet with the manufacturing capacity that we can bring. We see this as a great complement to our business. And so far, things are going even better than I would have thought when I announced this business early in the year.",461

A couple of things, Stacy. First, the mix of products in the quarter were more weighted towards what I would call our HCC products down from an ASP standpoint from our XCC. And that -- part of that is coming out of the lower cloud than we expected. 
The -- I would say the other piece is we saw a bounce up in our network SoCs. And as you know, those have much lower ASPs and tend to be dilutive to ASP. And that was relative to Q2.",89

So overall, we just say it was a mix discussion this quarter. It wasn't an ASP discussion at that level, even though, right, you average those together, you get different effects. 
Also, as we said for the data center business, we did have some unique issues in China this quarter, which led to some different behavior in that business, some of the regulatory issues there. So overall, not where we would have expected the data center to be for the quarter, but still a very strong performance. And we're happy with the growth that we're seeing in that business. 
And as we've indicated, the momentum of Ice Lake is growing. Sapphire Rapids, great interest in that product. So we're seeing that the overall competitiveness and the growth of that business area is looking very good for us for the future.

So you're saying 51% to 53% over the next couple of years and then kind of moving higher after the next few years. But at the same time, CapEx is also going to 25 to 28 next year, and it sounds like it might be higher than that. And the depreciation is still only $11 billion right now. So that's going to obviously go up a lot, too. 
So I think that the obvious question is going to be how believable it is that gross margin can ultimately come back given that -- I would think that the depreciation is going to really be ramping in those out years. So can you just sort of hold our hand there in terms of how believable it is that gross margin can come back when there's just such a gap between depreciation and CapEx?",158
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3644.0,2409518.0,91673819.0,Answer,George Davis,,Executives,28,"Yes. Yes, for sure. First off, I think part of the reason for spending this amount of CapEx is to catch up with the capacity shortfalls that we've had and also to build in more flexibility. These things all support higher revenue over time, which helps absorb, as you know, some of the depreciation. That being said, it will be growing. No question, our depreciation impact will be growing over the next couple of years. 
The impact of OCOS, which is the -- all the investment that is going on outside of depreciation and the node acceleration that Pat has been talking to, that has a big impact, particularly over the next few years because of the number of nodes that are being worked in parallel. So we think that gets better coming out of this period. And we've had a pretty reasonable assumption inside of our gross margin estimates for how much unit costs are going up and then how much of that you can recover in ASP. So there's no big missing element. I think it's -- we expect to -- as we've said, we expect to grow into our investment, and we expect the investment in node compression takes less of a toll as we come out of this period.",213
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3644.0,2409518.0,91673820.0,Answer,Patrick Gelsinger,,Executives,29,"Yes. And ultimately, we're making those investments in node compression to get more competitive products and more capabilities. And as the products get more competitive, better pricing, better margins, which enable us to have not only better gross margins, but obviously, we'll have the flow-through benefits into cash flows as we're impacting our CapEx investments. So all of these things start to generate positively as we get back on top of our competitive position. 
And as we said, we've had an extraordinary quarter since we've last met. Every one of our process nodes that we described. Some said when we described 5 nodes in 4 years, it has never been done in history. And we said, ""That's right and we're going to do it."" 
And as I updated in the formal comments, all of those nodes, Intel 7, Intel 4, Intel 3, Intel 20A, Intel 18A on or ahead of schedule Relatively speaking, we're closing the gap in the industry, probably even more rapidly than I would have expected just a quarter ago. And as a result of that, these investments will be producing superior products with superior pricing and margins more rapidly than we would have forecast even a quarter ago. 
So overall, we think all of these things are now starting to play together. Obviously, we have a couple of years to work through. But this is going to be a great outcome, and we think all of our aggressive lean-ins right now are going to be handsomely rewarded in the marketplace to our customers and to our shareholders over time.",263

I guess a question on CapEx. So you've outlined a higher number for calendar '22. But as I think about and contemplate higher intensity at the leading edge nodes, it would appear that, that would really be for Intel only. So should we be thinking about a step-up above and beyond that level as you build out capacity for IFS over time? 
And then second quick question around that. Are you making any changes to how you're accounting for depreciation, lifetime on equipment or buildings or anything like that as part of the accounting changes that you've outlined tonight?",100

So the initial CapEx of use, obviously, as you said, building out shell capacity, building flexibility into it. As George indicated, in subsequent years, might be going up a bit more. But as we've also said, we do expect to see the opportunity for government's investments to enable us to go bigger and faster on our CapEx investments. 
So the numbers that we've given reflect the initial build-out of our foundry business. So we feel comfortable in that. And we've also described our smart capital strategy that gives us more flexibility for what we do internally, what we do in our foundries, the ability to benefit from government investments, the flexible build-out of shelves. 
And overall, we see these investments allow us to grow right, and grow share, right, gain foundry customers, where as those get committed, right, we will build out the specific capacity. And then balancing a foundry, which enables us to leverage industry capacity as well as our own and everything we bring internally, we have better margins associated with it. So overall, we think it's a very uniquely powerful, resilient and favorable strategy for us to execute over time.",194

One, just near term, the federal impact in Q4, just remind us if that continues into the first half. And then you're starting at 55%, now you're guiding long term kind of 51% to 53%. And it seems pretty clear as you ramp more Intel 7 products, the margin has been going down substantially. 
So I'm just trying to think about it. I know you probably don't want to guide next year, but trying to figure out, within that range are you going to be closer to the bottom of it as you ramp more of the client and you cross their majority in Q4 and then you obviously have servers on the way as well. So just trying to understand the impact in the near term here on gross margin and then kind of just long term as well. 
It does seem like -- listening to your comments, Pat, that it does require that double-digit top line. So I just want to understand, I think a lot of people may think the CAGR is maybe half that on this call.

The Intel Federal impact is a one-quarter impact, and so it does not carry forward. 
We're -- to the extent that we want to think about '22 gross margin, I think, again, 51% to 53% for the next 2 to 3 years and really the biggest hitters being the impact of higher capital, which you see accelerating in Q4 this year going into next year and then the effect of the multiple node compression. Those are the key dynamics that we see. So that's all we can guide at this point.",122

And overall, as we said, we feel confident in these numbers. We're giving a lot more transparency. We're taking the opportunity to give you more understanding of our business. We're electing to do that earlier in the process than we might otherwise because we're making these decisions. We're choosing to give you a lot more understanding of the business. 
We're confident in these growth outlooks as well. These are exciting new market categories, right, that we are leaning into. They are large market categories. And it's not just that they're large categories, right? They reinforce each other. The stronger I am in networking, the stronger I am in data center. The stronger I am in client, the stronger I am in graphics. The stronger I am in my process technology, the stronger I am in my foundry business. Every one of these is building on each other and creating synergy value. 
And overall, right, as we move to leadership in these areas, and we are well on track on doing that, we feel quite confident in the growth rate, the margin profiles. It will, of course, take the opportunity at our Analyst Day to dig into the business areas quite a bit more. And we're going to help you understand those. We're going to give you segment reporting that helps you see those and be able to get transparency and accountability through it. But overall, we believe we're laying out a pretty exciting path that the management team, Board of Directors and our customers are really leaning back into us to say, ""Yes, this is Intel."" We're excited for the future. Now is the time.",276

It might be weird. 
And so maybe I'm dying to ask you another question on gross margin, but I won't, just to make sure I give you a bit of fresh air. I was actually wondering, it's not necessarily a question just for you, George, also for Pat. 
You haven't talked about market shares over the transition period. For the next 2, 3 years, okay, your gross margins will take a big step down, you're going to invest a lot. How do you see your market share evolving and why? 
And then I can't help relating that to gross margin. In your gross margin guide, is there an element of taking prices down to protect gross margin during the transition? Or is that purely driven by investments?",151

We've been woefully short of capacity for a number of years. There's just great opportunity in the industry. And as everybody in every industry, anywhere in the world realizes, semiconductors are hot. We need more of these, so we're building the capacity to satisfy that. In the near term, capacity is destiny. Building more capacity enables us to gain more market share. And we think we can do that as our products get stronger with very favorable pricing conditions as well. 
And for instance, in the client business, Alder Lake is in production. We'll be talking more about that next week, a tremendous product that will be a great market share gainer as well as a pricing leader, right, as well as structured across the segments that allow us to gain share across multiple segments of the client marketplace. 
Also, I'd point out that these 4 areas, these 4 new growth businesses, we're very small in those businesses today. These have massive growth potential for us, large, favorable markets that are looking for leadership, logic capabilities that Intel is just uniquely positioned to supply into the industry. 
And overall, clearly, the near term, as we've laid out with great transparency, some of the margin impacts in the near term, that these are great investments, great investments in large, growing, favorable markets that very few companies have even the opportunity to participate in. And we bring such massive assets to them that we believe that we're going to be well positioned to gain leadership positions across networking, accelerated computing and graphics, in the autonomous vehicle category, in the foundry business. And you combine that with share gaining positions and client and data center, this is a tremendous period of time. We're seizing the opportunity. Carpe diem.",318

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3644.0,2409518.0,91673833.0,Question,Matthew Ramsay,,Analysts,42,"I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the data center business, one on product and one on the results. On the product, I think you guys reiterated that Sapphire would be shipping in Q1. Pat, I wonder if you might give some commentary on when you expect to see some legit volume ramps at Sapphire? And has that timing moved? 
The second part of the question is on the results. It looks like the cloud segment was down 20% year-over-year off of a plus 15% last year. So I don't know, by my math, we're down, say, mid- to high singles from Q3 cloud levels 2 years ago pre-COVID, and CapEx has been pretty strong since. So you guys called out China, but there's some other things going on with market share. Maybe you could address those and talk about how we reverse some of that share loss.",150

On Sapphire Rapids, it's exactly what we said back in June of this year that it's going to be in production in Q1, ramp in Q2. So no change in its timing. We're working through the latter stages of the production process with the design, getting all of the elements of it worked out as we're ready to begin that volume ramp in Q2 of next year and on track for our Q1 launch. 
With respect to the data center cloud business in Q3, and we'll see some of this in Q4 as well, largely is exactly what we said. Unique exposure to China, where we have uniquely high market share, nothing else significant going on in that business. That really is the story. 
Overall, the server business is constrained by supply, right? And this would be things like ethernet controllers and power supply devices that are holding us back from achieving. And trust me, we would be shipping a lot more units, right, if we weren't constrained by the supply chain of these other components in the industry. Our customers, both cloud customers and OEMs, very strong backlogs that they're pressing us aggressively to satisfy, but really limited by these match sets, as we call it in the industry. So other than those 2 factors, China and match sets, everything else is going as expected for the data center business. 
So maybe then let me just wrap up our call today by saying, I am so proud of the talented, committed team here at Intel. Despite all of the challenges of working through the supply constraints, our teams, our factories, our product designers, the software developers are performing so well. The execution machine that we have is restoring very rapidly and a deep sense a desire that we can, and we will win. 
I also want to take the chance to personally thank George for his leadership, all the things that he's done for our company and just his commitment to seeing through a smooth transition to his successor. 
We've taken the first steps of our journey, and I can't wait to share more of our successes in the future. Thanks for joining us today.",367
