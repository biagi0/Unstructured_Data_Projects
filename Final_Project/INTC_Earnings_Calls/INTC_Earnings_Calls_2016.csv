By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Also, during this call, we'll be using non-GAAP financial measures and references. GAAP financial reconciliations are available in our earnings material, which was posted on our website, intc.com, in advance of this call. The forecast that Stacy speaks to today will be on a non-GAAP basis.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian.",185
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3006.0,953797.0,40529328.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mark. Our results for the fourth quarter were consistent with expectations and marked a strong finish to the year. Taken as a whole, 2015 demonstrated the benefits of our strategy, which is designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure powering the smart and connected world. That strategy is also resulting in the evolution of our business model to focus on 3 key areas of growth: the Data Center, the Internet of Things and Memory. 
Our results reflect that evolution. Revenue for the year was nearly flat despite a significant decline in PC demand. 2015 was also a year of revenue record and important milestones, and I'd like to take a minute to review some of them with you.
Even though the Client Computing Group ended the full year down 8%, we were excited to see that we were able to grow sequentially in the second and third and fourth quarters. As of November, 14-nanometer products made up more than 50% of the Client Computing volume, and for the year, high-end Core i7 microprocessors and our K SKUs for gaming both set all-time volume records, leading to a rich product mix.
In our Security business, we've refocused the organization on endpoint technology where we enjoy a solid leadership position. And we've driven material efficiencies as we fully integrated the McAfee organization into Intel. The results of these changes have been dramatic. On a constant-currency basis, Security revenue rose 6% for the year, while the organization's tighter focus drove a remarkable 44% improvement in operating income. 
The IoT Group grew revenue 7% in 2015 to $2.3 billion, an all-time record as the retail, transportation and video segments all saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth.
In our NAND Solutions Group, we introduced a revolutionary new class of memory called 3D XPoint, the industry's first new memory technology in more than 2 decades. 3D XPoint is a great example of our growth strategy at work using our technology expertise to innovate and expand into profitably adjacent markets. We think it's a game-changing technology moving forward. Our confidence in the technology led us to announce in the fourth quarter that we were upgrading our Dalian, China fab to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint, with production beginning later this year.
For the full year, our Memory business grew more than 20% to $2.6 billion, another all-time record. At the same time, the Data Center Group grew 11% over last year to an all-time record of $16 billion in revenue. Macro weakness weighed on enterprise demand and resulted in slower growth than we expected at the beginning of the year. However, DCG's overall performance highlighted the underlying trends driving data center demand as cloud and communication service providers' revenue both grew more than 20% for the year.
Within the cloud segment, 40% of our volume was custom SKUs as we left the year, demonstrating the ongoing value of working directly with the customers to tailor solutions to their needs.
And finally, just after our fiscal year ended, we closed our acquisition of Altera. We're thrilled to welcome the talented Altera team to Intel. Combined, our 2 companies will deliver powerful synergies based on Intel's process technology leadership and the integration of Altera's FPGA.
Wrapping up, our results over the last year lead me increasingly confident in our strategy. While our outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution about overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016. 
Because it provides tremendous return to our shareholders, we will continue to drive innovation and differentiation in our core PC business. This business provides a foundation of IP and a source of cash flow, but it's not the sole driver of our growth. Our future as a company will increasingly be a product of the virtuous cycle of opportunities in the Data Center, Memory and IoT market segments. 
In fact, you can see the impact of that virtuous cycle in our 2015 results. DCG, IoTG and Memory delivered nearly 40% of Intel's revenue and more than 60% of Intel's operating margin in 2015. Additionally, these 3 adjacent markets delivered $2.2 billion in profitable revenue growth in 2015 alone. And as we look ahead to 2016, we'll continue to build on that strategy.
Now with that, let me turn it over to Stacy.",725
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3006.0,953797.0,40529329.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year with record revenue at $14.9 billion. We had record revenues in the data center and the Internet of Things businesses. Gross margin of 64% was up 2 points to outlook. Net income was $3.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.74, flat over the same horizon.
I would like to provide context behind our full year 2015 financials as it provides insight into how we are executing to our strategy. Growth in the Data Center, Memory and Internet of Things businesses partially offset a weaker-than-expected macroeconomic environment and a weak PC Client market. 
Overall, revenue for the year was $55.4 billion, which was down 1% from the prior year. The Client Computing Group achieved $32 billion in revenue and was down 8% for the year.
Within the Client Computing Group, we achieved almost $1 billion in mobile profitability improvements over the course of the year, exceeding our goal. The Data Center business, at about $16 billion in revenue, grew 11%. The Memory business, at over $2.5 billion in revenue, grew over 20%. And the Internet of Things business, at about $2.3 billion, grew 7%.
Gross margin for 2015 was approximately 63%, down about 1 point from 2014. Higher unit costs as we ramp 14-nanometer were offset by an increase in ASPs, driven by strong results in the Data Center business and a rich mix in the Client Computing business. Operating profit for the year was $14 billion, down 9% year-on-year.
Earnings per share for the year was $2.33, up 1% from the prior year. In 2015, the business continued to generate significant cash, with $19 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $7.3 billion in capital assets. We paid $4.6 billion in dividends and repurchased about $3 billion of stock.
Total cash balance was $25.3 billion, up over $11 billion year-over-year. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is approximately $6.6 billion. We issued about $9.5 billion of new long-term debt to finance our acquisition of Altera. And in November, we announced an $0.08 dividend increase to $1.04 per share on an annual basis effective in the first quarter of 2016.
The acquisition of Altera was completed in early fiscal 2016, which means that the 2016 guidance includes the expected results for the FPGA business. As I talk to our guidance for 2016, it is important to note that we have excluded noncash and onetime acquisition-related charges for Altera.
The CFO commentary prereleased before this call and available on intc.com includes the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the first quarter of 2016, the midpoint of the revenue range is expected to be $14.1 billion. This forecast, which includes an extra work week and the newly acquired FPGA business, is on the low end of the average seasonal range. This outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China.
We continue to believe the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy with appropriate levels of inventory. Gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 62%, and spending is expected to be $5.5 billion.
Turning to the full year 2016. We're expecting revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits relative to 2015. This outlook is higher than our previous guidance provided in the November Investor Meeting. This higher range is driven by the addition of the FPGA business, partially offset by some caution as a result of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Gross margin for the year is expected to be 63%, and spending is expected at $21.3 billion. The capital spending forecast for 2016 is $9.5 billion, up from 2015.
As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment lengthens, we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our factories from 4 to 5 years. This change in depreciable life drives approximately $1.5 billion in lower depreciation expense for the year. Inclusive of this change, we are forecasting depreciation expense to be $6.5 billion this year, down $1.3 billion from 2015.
Our results demonstrate that we are transforming the company. We are pivoting towards the cloud with a diversified portfolio of businesses. Client is still the largest segment, but the other businesses now make up about 40% of our total revenue, and 2015 marked the first year where these businesses made up the majority of our operating profit.
The Data Center business is growing fast and is now a $16 billion business. That growth is being driven by growth rates in cloud computing that were over 40% year-on-year. Our Memory business grew over 20% year-over-year and is well positioned to disrupt the industry with the launch of 3D XPoint technology. Internet of Things business grew in 2015 and is expected to contribute more growth this year. And with the Altera acquisition, we expect to broaden our product portfolio in the Data Center and Internet of Things businesses and enable even more innovation.
Most importantly, we are pivoting towards the cloud, diversifying our client business and building a strong foundation for long-term growth for the company.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.",874

This is Brian. It was the same type of trend we saw throughout 2015 with clients buying up the stack. And you saw that our record revenue in Core i7 and K SKUs, which are really our top end SKUs. The forecast for '16 has us relatively flat in this space. So we don't know if it'll continue, but right now, we forecasted a flat on the ASPs for '16.",74

In total, we see ASP is up a little bit in '16. You can see it in the gross margin recon. It's not -- as Brian said, we're maintaining the client ASP, but we are expecting that server becomes a larger percentage of the mix. And so we get some mix impact based on what's going on in server.",70

And then just for my follow-up. The depreciation change, was that something you had known about when you talked about the full year guidance at the Analyst Day? And what was it that prompted you to make that change now?",44

No, the depreciation change was not included in my forecast that I provided back in November. We were in the middle of the analysis. What prompted it was we did an in-depth analysis based on the cadence of moving from one process technology node to the next. We talked about that at the beginning of 2015. And the third wave of products and we kind of completed our long-range planning in the fourth quarter, and that's what triggered the change in the depreciation cadence. I'll also say -- so just to then tie this out for you, in November, I was forecasting a 62% gross margin for the year. I'm now projecting a 63% gross margin for the year. And the difference there is this change in depreciation. So you can kind of see it in that gross margin recon.",141

I was hoping you could provide us some more color around that, if possible, by your different segments and perhaps by geography.",37

It's the same type of trend we saw in 2015. Emerging markets slower than the mature markets. U.S., Western Europe looking okay. China and the rest of Asia, slow. It was both consumer and enterprise. I'd say it's a little bit heavier on the client side, so the PC side, then the data center side, but we're seeing some of it on the data center side as well. And those are the 2 big drivers, and it's all the same geography.",83

And for my follow-up, maybe for Stacy. Yes, Stacy, can you talk about the leverage in the model? Because if I take your full year sales growth number, OpEx is roughly about 35-ish percent or so of sales, which is in line with what you had given at Analyst Day. But I'm wondering, what steps can you take to drive more leverage in the model? As an idea, shouldn't the goal be to get to at least 30%-plus operating margin? And so what steps can you take this year to help drive more leverage in the model?",99
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3006.0,953797.0,40529341.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,15,"Sure. And first, let me -- if you'll bear with me, let's take a second to detangle the 2016 numbers because with the extra work week, the Altera acquisition, which includes some onetime costs and the change in depreciation, it becomes a little hard to, I think, get to the bottom of what's actually happening operationally in the business. If you recall in the Investor Meeting in November, Brian and I talked about the fact that we were looking to reduce spending as a percent of revenue by 0.5 point. If you just take all of the adjustments out, so you don't adjust for the change in depreciation, you don't adjust for Altera, anything like that, we're getting that 0.5 point. When we add all of that in, we're getting a bit more than the 0.5 point improvement from 2015 to 2016 in terms of our projection. So we feel we're delivering what we committed to, and when you put some of these adjustments of top of it, we'll deliver a little bit more. In terms of the opportunities there, we articulated -- and I'll let Brian come in over the top, but we articulated in the Investor Meeting that we're still committed to drive spending as a percent of revenue down. We're in the midst of a transformation right now, and so we are going through a period where we're weeding and feeding our portfolio. We're making some disinvestments, but very importantly, we're investing in areas that we think are critical for the long-term growth and health of the company and where we get lots of return, i.e., the data center, the Internet of Things, our process technology leadership, the Memory business. And so we knew going into this year it would be a time of elevated investment. We're delivering what we committed, but there's more to come in future years.",312

This is Brian. So let me just kind of give you a broad picture of Altera and where we're at. So as you said, we just closed. We have just gotten through the employee integration. Everybody's got a badge. You'd go by, the signs out front say, ""Intel now."" Really excited. We're starting to dig into some of the product road maps. The good news is we'd been working separate companies on the first of the server chips, which is a multichip package, so the FPGA and our Xeon in the same package. That will actually start sampling to select customers in the first quarter of this year. And it'll continue to select to -- in limited quantities, it will continue to sample throughout this year with production in '17. Our road map will then -- we're still working on our road map beyond that as when do we integrate the full IP into our silicon, so make a monolithic die. And we're now -- we're actually spending an equal amount of time on that same kind of a road map, an MCP or a multichip package followed by a monolithic die in the IoT space. So it's -- we feel pretty good about the progress, and we're already in the first quarter going to be sampling to this, the kind of leading-edge cloud guys you can think about.",231

It's all logic, for the most part, and it's not as much a macro we're adjusting the capacity or anything. It's just the ins and outs. And as we went from the Investor Meeting into the actual firm forecast for 2016, the teams just sharpened down all the numbers and went through it in more detail.

So I guess 2 questions. Was it all enterprise that drove the weakness? And do you expect to get back to a double-digit growth trajectory in the March quarter? And is the team still confident about driving mid-teens growth for DCG in 2016?",71
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3006.0,953797.0,40529350.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,24,"Yes, there's a couple of things I want to talk about then on the data center. First, when you compare Q4 to Q4, you're looking at a comparative where Q4 '14 was one of our strongest quarters as long as I can remember with very strong, greater than 20% growth for the quarter. So that quarter was a little bit of unique so the quarter-to-quarter comparative is a bit tough. If you take a look at how the second half, which is really -- Q3 and Q4 kind of looked similar. Enterprise actually stabilized from the first half. So enterprise was weak in the first half, and tended to -- it got a little bit more stable in the second half. And what we saw was the normal; the cloud guys tend to slow down in the fourth quarter because that's when a lot of the cloud -- they don't want to be upsetting the cloud infrastructure while the holiday seasons are on and people are buying things. And then we -- but we -- and then we continued to see strong growth and strong share gain in the networking and telco side. We're absolutely -- we continue to look out. And again, we're very careful to not look at it just on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We're looking at the long view, and we're very confident that yes, we'll continue into this double-digit growth in the data center. It will continue to be fueled by the cloud in the first side and then secondly, by our growth in telco and networking as our share grows there. There's -- remember we entered the year less than 10% share in that space, and there's a lot of space there for us to grow in the networking and telco space.",297

I don't think -- we weren't surprised by where we ended up in the data center. If you recall back in November, we talked to you about data center growth rate for the year being in the low double digits. That's exactly where we came in. Based on what Brian was just talking about in terms of the strength of Q4 '14, we were expecting this to be a tough compare, and that we'd have growth rates in the single digits.",94

And then for my follow-up, the team is going to be launching its 6th Generation V Core product line for enterprise, desktop, PC, I think, next week. There also hasn't been a refresh of desktop for 2 years.

We're past the Windows 10 launch, which is another positive in this space. We're hearing very good response as far as people's interest, the form factors you're seeing, right, you're seeing all-in-ones, you're seeing classic desktop platforms, you're seeing great graphics, you're seeing OLED displays.

So I know you were hopeful that eventually you'd be able to get your node migration trajectory back from 3 years to 2 years. But this sounds like a fairly permanent change in terms of extending your equipment life. And so what should we take from this action in terms of how you view the potential improvement ability of your node migration trajectory going forward?",75

This is -- whether we're at 2 years or 2.5 years or 3 years, it wasn't going to dramatically shift that life expectancy like this. This is more about the amount of reuse and the efficiency and speed at which we can do the conversion. And so both of those numbers have improved. Now the cycle clearly doesn't hurt to have from this perspective, the longer node cycle. But independent of that, this is a change that was fundamental to the shift in reuse and rate at which we're able to move the tool from being able to run, say, 14-nanometers to 10-nanometers.",111

The reuse of something that's been shifting over time and it gives us a lot of economic benefit. I'll give you the accounting answer here, too, which is if we got to 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer and there was something that caused us to look at depreciable life, the economic usefulness of the equipment, we would change it. But we're certainly not expecting anything like that. But this is -- we go through this analysis every year.",85

For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at the extra week that's in Q4. How much of your guidance is actually coming from that extra week?

And just the -- so look, the background on this is we go through this every 5 to 7 years because we're on a work week calendar. Over a 5- to 7-year period, we get out of sync with the actual calendar and then we add in a work week in order to get back on sync. It's a little -- it's easy actually to quantify the spending associated with that extra work week because we've got lights on and factories running and we're paying people. The revenue associated with it is a little harder to calculate. When you look at where the week actually falls, it's that week between Christmas and New Year. Our fiscal year ended, I think, the day after Christmas, and so it's that week between Christmas and New Year, that tends to be a billings week that's dramatically lower than any other week we see during the year. So some revenue impact; kind of hard to quantify it. The way I'd look at it though, when you look at our guide and you take out Altera and you take into account any impact for the extra work week, what you'd see is that the guide for the first quarter is kind of at the low end of what we normally see from a Q4 to a Q1 is how I think of it. And then you add Altera back on top of that and you get to the revenue number that we provided. And just to be totally transparent, the revenue number for Altera in Q1 is on the order of $400 million. So you can kind of do the math from there.",286

This quarter, the December quarter, you saw a modest drop in ASPs, both sequentially and year-over-year, which is somewhat of an anomaly for that business. And I guess I understand the mix shift as cloud grows faster than enterprise. I'm kind of curious. Do you think this was a 1 quarter anomaly? Is this something we should expect more of as networking grows faster in '16? And within the individual segments, are you still seeing customers buy up to stack?",91
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 14, 2016",2016-01-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3006.0,953797.0,40529366.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,40,"Okay. So that's actually a great question, John. So for Q4, the decline -- or the decrease in ASP was mostly driven by the much higher growth rate in the networking as you mentioned and the fact that the percentage of Atom in networking tends to be a bit higher. And so if you look at networking as a whole, the ASPs in networking tend to be lower than, say, cloud or enterprise. However, if you look at Q4's networking ASP, so if you took out just that ASP, and you compared that ASP relative to the prior quarters, it was actually up as an average. So it has a lower average selling price but that average selling price is increasing as more people buy and as NFV and SDN take off, more people tend to buy up to core because they're really searching for that performance. We do hope and expect this trend to continue into '16 as we gain share in networking. The relative strength -- so then if you take a look at the cloud space and the enterprise space, we expect those to continue on the trends you've seen over the last few years. We don't expect any major shifts there. But I -- we have very strategic plans to continue to grow in the networking storage, in the -- especially around the telco and networking space as SDN and NFV really take hold. And you will see a slightly lower ASP from there, but we expect the ASP to continue to increase in that space as we bring more functionality. Did that answer your question?",270

And then, Stacy, as my follow-on, you raised sort of the full year gross margin by about 100 basis points. But if I kind of do the math, a $1.5 billion decrease in depreciation on a $60 billion revenue stream is more than 100 basis points. In addition, the Altera gross margin was higher than your Core. And so I guess I'm trying to understand what are the offsets, is 10-nanometer cost kind of coming in higher than expected? And if you could help us understand sort of the progression of 10-nanometer cost throughout the year, that would be helpful.",105

And a great question, and I know there's a lot of moving parts here. Let me just focus in on the depreciation change for a second. And I actually try to be very transparent. In the CFO commentary that was released, you'll see some of this written out so you can always refer back to it. But the change in depreciation, you're right, in total is about $1.5 billion. But only about half of that is flowing through COGS impacting gross margin in 2016. And that's where you get to the kind of 1 point shift, and that really is the primary difference. There's a few other moving parts, but nothing that's material. That's the thing that changed from 62% gross margin forecast that we had in November to 63% gross margin forecast that we have today. The rest of the change in depreciation, about 1/4 of it will flow through OpEx because remember, all of the spending we do for research and development facilities actually flows through our research and development line so you see a little bit of a benefit there. And then you have some of it that goes into inventory and then ships out over time.",201

There's a couple of things that feed into that. Units were a little weaker for us in the client segment in Q4. As we worked our way through the Christmas selling season, what we saw is the sell-through all the way to the end customer was a little less than we thought. We made up for that with our rich mix, so that's why we ended up with a pretty good result, but a little -- we're watching that carefully. And then the -- our team on the ground in China has gotten fairly cautious about what's going on in China right now. And as you know, that's the largest PC market. So we're just a little cautious on the growth rates there. In terms of from here, I think Brian said it well. We're expecting this is the environment as we work our way through 2016. So I guess the backdrop of a somewhat weak macroeconomic environment, we'd kind of expect the year to play out kind of normally from here.",191

And then as far as the Altera revenue, I think you said $400 million. I think that's down like somewhere in the mid-teens or something like that sequentially. Why the conservative forecast?

I can tell you from our perspective, we didn't see anything that was surprising in terms of what we've seen about their business levels. We actually expect some revenue growth as we go from '15 to '16. I'll give you kind of in total what we expect for Altera, it's a little north of $1.6 billion in terms of revenue. It's gross margin that, as John was saying, is a little higher than the corporate average. So it gives us a slight mix but because it's a relatively small business against the backdrop of Intel, it's not a big shift in our gross margin. And then we're expecting spending that's at a run rate of a couple of hundred million dollars a quarter. In addition to all of that, there'll be a bunch of kind of onetime acquisition deal-related costs, there's amortization of acquisition, related intangibles. You'll see all those in the GAAP number. I've excluded them from the non-GAAP numbers I just gave you.",196

As you referred to, in the Investor Meeting, I showed an up and down arrow chart, and the magnitude of those shifts was on the order of $1 billion for some of the big movers as we added investments in some areas and subtracted investments in others. And I'll also say there's a point at which we expect that we get more and more leverage in businesses like the data center as well. So I think there's lots of opportunities for us to bring down spending as a percent of revenue as we go forward.",121

So we believe that 2015 ended with, I'd just call it, very healthy inventories. In fact, one of the things we saw was a slight decrease in the inventory levels as we exited the fourth quarter. And if you take a look at what we had originally projected and what would have been more an industry norm, would have been a slight increase in inventories. We expect those kind of healthy inventory levels to extend through '16. There's no sign that anybody is adding inventory or not moving off a cautious position on inventory. And that's what's been built into our forecast as well.",105

And to the question on internal inventory levels, I'd just say we ended Q4 with a little more inventory than I was expecting and a little higher than I'd like. Two drivers there we saw: as I said, a little bit weaker units have made up for us and rich mix. So a little bit weaker units. And we saw yields get better on 14-nanometer and the combination of that left me with a little more inventory leaving Q4 than I'd like. You'll see it, if you look on a dollar basis, will go up in Q1 as a result of Altera. So Altera will cause the inventory levels to go up some. But when you look at it from a business standpoint, I think we'll work through the inventory we have and when we get into the back half of the year, we'll bring inventory levels down.",149

Those are somewhat an example of what happened as you integrate and you really get to focus on the business at a much higher level. Same thing for Altera; we plan to fully integrate it. It's going to look like a business group no different than, say, CCG that does PCs and modems -- or phones, or DCG that does data center. It's called PSG, Programmable Solutions Group. It reports directly to me, and it will be fully integrated. The sales force at the beginning, because of the sales, tends to be a bit more technical and a bit more like a field sales engineering type role, we're keeping it separate. But that's something we're going to continue to evaluate. But the organization, the engineering, already in the first 2 weeks, we've had -- really, for me, I'm really pleased with the level of integration and help that we've done to get the products and the road maps focused and integrated into our internal systems.

It's -- there will be some pretty significant costs, and it's in the gross margin recon associated with the startup of the factory in China. And we'll be in production in the back half of the year, but we're just ramping production. So I think if you were just looking at the 6-month time period, you'd say it's kind of negative.

It doesn't change the fact that you -- we make these investments, and then we get this what I would say tremendous long-term benefit out of making that investment.

In other words, we have projects. We know what we need to do, introduce products, align which SKUs are coming and move products onto that. So I'd say a large percentage of that is well-planned through the year, but it's throughout the year so I can't tell you, ""Oh, I've already got $200 million of it"" or something like that. Not here in the second, third week of the year. 7360, it's out. It's sampling.

By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release, CFO commentary and the announcement of our restructuring program. If you've not received all 3 documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. And a brief reminder that this quarter, we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures following the acquisition of Altera, now our Programmable Solutions Group. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures. The CFO commentary and earnings release, available on intc.com, include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.

Our results in Q1 were in the lower half of the range we set in January and reflect an extra work week in the quarter. Revenue increased year-over-year, driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes the Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera. Strength in our Data Center, Internet of Things and Programmable Solutions businesses partially offset weaker-than-expected PC revenues in our client business. I'll take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restructuring program we're announcing today.
DCG revenue grew 2% year-over-year. We saw ongoing declines in the PC TAM, particularly in China and other emerging markets, which also led to greater-than-anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory. Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and the 14th work week. 
The Data Center business posted another good quarter, growing 9% over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand, partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise.
The Internet of Things Group grew a remarkable 22% year-over-year, due largely to the performance of the video and retail vertical. In the Memory business, strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines, leading to revenue that was 6% lower year-over-year. And in our Security business, revenue grew 12%, as this team continues to tighten its focus and execution.
And finally, the PSG group, formerly known as Altera, got off to a great start. It delivered a revenue of $359 million, and after adjusting for $100 million in acquisition-related accounting charges, the business achieved mid-single-digit growth. In less than a quarter after the deal closed, we are shipping our first FPGA Xeon co-packaged parts to customers in sample form. 
These results tell the story of Intel's ongoing strategic transformation, which is progressing well and will accelerate in 2016. We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices. The Data Center and Internet of Things businesses are now Intel's primary growth engine and, combined with memory and FPGA, form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth.
Last year, we achieved record revenue in the Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses. They delivered a combined $2.2 billion in revenue growth and made up 40% of our total revenue and contributed the majority of our operating profit.
Today, we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of those franchises and accelerate our strategic transformation. Through this initiative, we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies that fuel the growth in the Data Center, IoT, Memory and FPGA businesses. And we expect it will result in an even more profitable client business. 
These changes will reduce our global employment by about 12,000 positions by mid-2017. We'll do this through site consolidation, voluntary and involuntary separations, project reevaluation and an intensified focus on efficiency across a variety of programs. 
These are not changes we take lightly. We will be saying goodbye to colleagues who have played an important role in Intel's success. Yet, acting now gives us flexibility, flexibility to continue to invest in those client segments that are growing, including 2-in-1s, gaming and home gateways, among others. Even more importantly, acting now enables us to increase our investments in the areas that are critical to our future success. This restructuring program will allow us to expand our investments in the Data Center, the Internet of Things, Memory and connectivity, even as we reduce our spending run rate by roughly $1.4 billion by mid-2017.
This is a comprehensive initiative. It's designed to create long-term value by accelerating the fundamental long-term change already happening at the company today. We will emerge as a more collaborative, productive team with broader reach and sharper execution. And we expect it to result in the highest revenue per employee in the company's history.
Last, but certainly not least, we have one additional announcement today. I'm happy to share that Stacy Smith will be taking on a broader new role within Intel and reporting to me, leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Stacy has been a great business partner and a world-class CFO, and I'm looking forward to continuing the partnership as he brings his leadership, his depth of knowledge and his breadth into these critically important areas for Intel's future. We expect this transition to occur over the next few months, following a formal CFO search that will assess internal and external candidates. Stacy will remain in his CFO role throughout the search and transition process. Congratulations, Stacy. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to you.",773
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3557.0,959670.0,40738489.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thank you very much, Brian, and I really appreciate the kind words. Revenue for the first quarter was $13.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The quarter showed year-on-year growth and was in the low end of the range of our prior outlook. Within this, we are seeing growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Security and Programmable Solutions groups, all of which helped offset a weak PC market.
First quarter gross margin of 62.7% was approximately 1 point higher than our expectations, driven by lower 14-nanometer costs. R&D and MG&A was $5.4 billion, down over $100 million from our guidance. Operating income of $3.3 billion was up 13% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, about 7 points lower than our prior outlook. Earnings per share of $0.54 was up 20% from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 2% increase year-over-year. This was below our expectations due to a weaker-than-expected PC market. Operating profit for the Client Computing Group was $1.9 billion, up 34% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower 14-nanometer unit cost in notebooks, lower overall total spending and margin improvements in our mobile products. 
Data Center Group had revenue of $4 billion, delivering 9% growth on a year-over-year basis. Relative to our expectations, we saw a weaker enterprise business, offset by strength in the Cloud segment. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year, as we ramp our 14-nanometer server product.
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $651 million, with year-over-year growth of 22%. We saw strength in both the retail and video display segments of our business. Internet of Things' operating profit was $123 million, up over 40% relative to last year. Our Security business had revenue of $537 million, up 12% year-over-year. Our Memory business had revenue of $557 million, up 6% year-over-year. The segment had an operating loss of $95 million as a result of challenging pricing, increased 3D XPoint spending and startup costs as we ramped 3D NAND in our China factory. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $359 million. When adjusted for the approximately $100 million of deferred revenue and compared to Altera's results from a year ago, the business achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth.
Operating profit was a negative $200 million. This included over $300 million in noncash charges for deferred revenue and inventory adjustments, with certain acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges would result in low double-digit operating margin growth for this business.
We generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We purchased $1.3 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock in the first quarter.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $15 billion, down $10 billion from the prior quarter as a result of closing the Altera acquisition. Our total debt is approximately $25 billion, consistent with our prior commentary on the financing plan for the Altera acquisition.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $13.5 billion. After adjusting for the extra work week in the first quarter, this forecast is in the low end of the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of points. This decrease in comparison to the first quarter is driven by lower platform volumes.
Turning to the full year 2016. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits from 2015, down from the prior guidance. We are forecasting robust growth rates in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions groups, which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing group. We now expect the PC market to decline in the high single digits in 2016 versus our prior forecast of mid-single-digit decline. Our projection of the PC market remains more cautious than third-party estimates.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the full year gross margin to be 62%, a 1-point decrease from the prior outlook, driven by lower platform volumes. Our execution to our strategy is driving growth. We are building on our strong position in client, and are investing for growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things markets and disruptive, differentiated memory technology. 
The trends over the last 2 years demonstrate that we are well into this transformational journey. From 2013 to 2015, the PC TAM declined 10%, yet Intel's revenue grew 5%, and our operating profit grew 14% over this horizon. But as Brian mentioned, we want to accelerate that execution. 
In order to do that, we're going to go through a significant restructuring over the next several months. The goal is to come out of this more agile, more efficient, with more investment on our key growth initiatives and more profitable. When completed by mid-2017, these actions will result in a 12,000 person workforce reduction and a $1.4 billion reduction to our spending run rate. Relative to full year 2016, we are now revising our spending guidance down by over $700 million to $20.6 billion. We expect to realize over half of the total workforce reduction by the end of this year.
In the second quarter this year, we are taking a $1.2 billion restructuring charge on the GAAP P&L as an estimate for the related actions. These actions are significant, and we don't embark on this lightly, but we are confident that they will build on the strong position we have across markets and accelerate the transformation of the company that is already underway.
I would like to end on a brief personal note, by saying thank you to Brian for the upcoming new leadership opportunity. Intel changes the world with amazing technology, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited about the opportunity that's in front of us. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",1010

So if you could just talk us through some of what's changed strategically in the company that's led to such a large amount of turnover so recently?",69

I mean, if you take a look at it -- so let's step back for a second and just talk about why are we doing the restructuring now, and then we can talk about some of the specifics beyond that. So the -- we've talked about this transformation, that we're moving from a client-centric -- Intel's been typically known as the PC company too, a company that is focused more and more on a much broader set of products and really focused around the cloud, right; and the cloud and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud, and the connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud. And that includes the PC, but it's much more than that. And so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say it's time now to try and -- we've made enough progress, right. You take a look at it, 40% of our revenues, 60% of our margin comes from areas other than the PC right now. It's time to make this transition and push the company over all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction. So that's why we wanted to do it now. Let's talk then about the leadership changes. There's really only been 3 leadership changes, if we just take the last couple of quarters. We had Doug Davis. He's simply retiring. Those are personal reasons; it has nothing to do with his leadership or direction of the company. There's IoT. We've talked about IoT as one of our growth segments that grew 22% this quarter. So clearly, his in the group is strong. And he's staying until we find his successor, or roughly the end of the year, we think, something like that. Kurt chose to leave for some outside opportunities, and the one with Stacy, Stacy and I have been working for several months, actually several quarters, on what does he do next. How do we grow his both exposure to other parts of the company, but also let the rest of the company see his leadership style. And so what we wanted to do is as soon as we'd made the decision to go ahead and start a search and start looking for a CFO replacement, we wanted to be completely transparent, be very open about that and let everyone know. This is going to be an orderly transition. We are just going to start the search. Stacy's solid in the CFO seat in that meantime. But this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company. If you take a look at the group manufacturing operations, which is everything from purchasing to building construction and all and sales, it's roughly half the company in people. And so it's a really good opportunity to see how the real operations of the company work.",475

I guess my follow-up would be the full year guidance of mid-single-digit growth. When I put that together with the high single-digit decline now that you have in the PC business, I'm having a little hard time seeing how, if you take the seasonality of PCs out of the equation in large part, what would be the levers that would get you there in the back half of the year, considering that a ramp to well into the $15 billion range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite? Are there some moving parts you could describe to us that get you comfortable with that number?",106
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3557.0,959670.0,40738495.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,9,"Sure. Let me kind of walk you through how we're viewing the year. And first, let me just put it at the highest level, right. What we're projecting for the year is overall growth and we think we'll see growth in the Data Center, growth in IoT, growth in Memory that's offsetting some -- oh and, of course, we've added in Altera now into our product family. And so you take that and that's offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in the PC market. Specific to the PC market, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are now expecting that the PC market is down in the high single digits and when we started the year, we were kind of in the mid-single-digits decline. The linearity -- so first, you have to understand, the first half is impacted by the fact that as our customers' view of the market came down, and if you recall, we were -- we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we started the year. That they were bringing down inventory levels. And that impacted us in Q1, and I think you'll see the same impact as we forecast a roughly seasonal second quarter, that we'll continue to see those customers burning off inventory. We think that doesn't repeat in the back half. So that's a little bit of a tailwind. I'd also say you want to be careful of we guided to mid-single digits. That's a range. If you're mathematically trying to drive to a specific number there, you may be driving kind of more back end than what we're really anticipating. So just a caution there that that's a range; it's meant to be kind of directional of how we see the business. All of that said; I just wanted to add, I think Brian and I are very comfortable with the back -end and what's implied in our guide based on everything that we know.",331

If you take a look at it, 2016 to 2015 in the areas of Memory with our NAND technology, IoT, Data Center, even before this action, we were investing more in 2016 than in 2015 in those areas. This will allow us to -- even with the cut, even with the dollar figures that Stacy's read out on the savings, it's allowing us to invest even more in those segments. And I always want to make sure it's not just about cutting costs necessarily in the client area. We think that we can become more focused. There are areas at the client space that are growing. 2-in-1s are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Our gaming PCs are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Set-top boxes are growing and we're gaining share in the set-top box space. So we're doing very well in segments that are growing in the client space and the PC space. And we are going to continue to double down focus on those. So it's really a narrowing down and allowing us, as a result also, to invest more in those growth areas. That's really what we're doing here with this restructuring.",220

Does the team anticipate double-digits growth this year in DCG? And if I look at it fundamentally, I mean, cloud and hyperscale CapEx looks to be up this year. There seems to be a big upgrade cycle in networking with the move to 25-gigabit Ethernet. You guys are rolling out 14-nanometer Broadwell.

You did a great job explaining exactly why we believe that the Data Center will continue in double-digit growth this year. And if you take a look at the numbers that Stacy's talked about, they incorporate double-digit growth. And it's for exactly for those reasons. We believe we have great products that we're introducing with the Broadwell lineup. We've got -- we started shipping our first Xeon plus FPGA samples to customers, which was part of our additional gaining more footprint and more performance in certain segments of the Data Center. We're shipping an omni-path fabric now. Later this year, we'll have silicon photonics. We've got 3D XPoint starting to be sampled, and we'll start to ramp later this year. So we're very -- are confident on our Data Center road map, and we are still absolutely forecasting double-digit growth in that space.",144

And then on the Memory Solutions Group, I mean, that's a business that grew 20% last year. I think it was up year-over-year every single quarter last year. Obviously, it was down in Q1. You guys mentioned aggressive price declines. Can you just talk about some of the trends that you're seeing there? Are the sharp declines more focused on capacity or performance-optimized SSDs? And then you also mentioned your view on a strong growth outlook for the full year. So what drives the acceleration from the Q1 decline?",90

So let me start and then we can just talk about -- remember, the majority of our memory space is built into SSDs that are going into the Data Centers. So you call those -- really those higher end performance class systems. What we're seeing is if you take a look at the units, units grew quite nicely year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter for the Memory Group. You're right; we are seeing aggressive pricing in this space. There's -- this -- the Memory segment, the NAND segment especially tends to go in the cycles, where there's overcapacity in the industry and aggressive pricing and then it shifts back to a more normal pricing and then tight pricing, which is always very positive. So this is just a normal cycle. We think we've done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence. If I look forward, we believe the 3D NAND technology that we're just beginning to ramp in our factories today and we're building out the Dalian factory for later this year startup, gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to then be more profitable in even these kinds of environments. So we're still confident that this business will continue to grow. We'll ride through this capacity situation within the industry, and our 3D NAND technology will position us very nicely as we move out of this and start up our Dalian factory in China.",251

So like we said when we started the quarter, that extra week was that week between Christmas and New Year's, when you look at where that 14th week fell. It's a relatively light week. It certainly had some impact. I don't want to say none, but it's a little hard to figure it out on any given business. Certainly, it had some impact on DCG though. In terms of the pricing, it's pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that we saw in the networking segment. So what you would see if -- at a constant mix, we would have seen ASP up in the Data Center, but the networking segment grew 60% year-on-year, which is exactly consistent with our strategy. And so what you see there is strong unit growth offset by a little bit of a mix down.",143

For my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on channel inventories. So you had your notebook and desktop volumes, I guess, down kind of low single digits year-over-year. I think it's fair to say that PC builds in the industry were down quite a bit more than that. And you suggest that you drained out -- I guess, so the channel drained out inventory. What happened with your own inventory in the channel? And how do you see that changing for the rest of the year?",88

I mean, maybe it's some share gains, maybe it's the extra week, although you just said the extra week didn't amount for very much.

So I would point to 2 things relative to the overall, like what we saw from our customers. One is yes, we had a 14th week. That's going to make our compares different from an IDC and a Gartner for sure. But then the second thing is when you look at the results of our customer base, they would see a weaker quarter and I think that's because they were catching up to our view of the market and bringing inventory levels down. So we saw -- we were impacted by 2 things. I'll put it like that. We're impacted by a TAM that wasn't terribly strong and the fact that our customers were bringing their inventory levels down some.",121

A bit of a complex question. So let me try and give you a lot of data that I hope will answer various parts of that question. So first, a simple answer. If you take a look at our forecast, we continue to forecast ASPs increasing through this year. So that's absolutely built into our forecast and we've modeled in things like you described, the weaker enterprise computing and the difference between the pricing segments. And I always remind people that let's just start at the very top is when you take a look at the Data Center, it's not 1 product, right. It's a family of products that really span from Xeon Phis that sell for several thousand dollars to the networking processors that are a few hundred dollars at times. And -- but within each one of those families, so whether you have networking or cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing, our ASPs are increasing and that's mostly due to bringing in better products, people buying up the ladder in product and resulting in a higher ASP on average for any one of those segments. So you will see slight shifts in the overall Data Center ASP. We have a boomer quarter like this, like Stacy talked about and networking is a little bit higher or something like that. But if you take a look inside any one of those segments, ASPs are increasing, and our forecast for the overall segment for the year is an increasing ASP. And that's driven by people buying up the stock and that's because we're bringing more performance for a better price to those customers.",274

Certainly, we are equally focused on efficiencies in the factory space. There's a little bit baked into the 2016 gross margin. I think you'll see a bit more of it kick in, in 2017. And just realize that the labor cost in the factories is a relatively small component. The real opportunity for us is some of the other things around capital efficiency and how fast we convert over processes and things like that, and that takes a little while to play through.",84

Revenue was down about $309 million sequentially. Operating profit was down $411 million sequentially. I know there's lots of moving parts. You had the extra week of OpEx that might not have been fully covered by revenue. And, Stacy, you talked about, in your opening comments, the 14-nanometer ramp starting to hit there. But with this new narrative sort of declining ASPs because of mix, I'm kind of wondering if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the business going forward. I think it was about 44% in the March quarter, down pretty significantly in the December quarter. Is this change in mix also having an impact on operating profits?",136
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3557.0,959670.0,40738529.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,43,"Yes. So John, you nailed it in terms of what's going on with operating profit in Q1. It's just the earlier cost of the ramp of the 14-nanometer server product. That's what's causing that to behave a little differently from revenue. And back to Brian's point, I would say no, there's nothing in the mix that, per se, would cause me to have a different view of the overall profit potential of this business. So taking networking as the example, it does have a lower ASP than the Xeon product line does. It also has a very different cost structure than the Xeon product line does. So it doesn't cause us to be in a different space from overall operating profit percent.",122

And then maybe for my follow-up to Brian, you guys gave us your view for the PC market this year. I'm just kind of curious, in lieu of the restructuring, kind of how you're thinking about the PC market longer term. And specifically, there's lots that's going on in the market that you probably can't control, but there's always sort of been this view at Intel that the best use of cash is to invest in the business and to innovate and innovation drives growth. How do you kind of balance that innovation desire with kind of the realities of the PC market? And how do you think about kind of the structural unit growth of PCs going forward? And do we want to risk, at some point, that PCs just don't provide the scale that you've talked about in the past to invest in other businesses like PCG and IoT?",154

So that -- again, John, that's a bit of a 2-sided question. So let me start with the back half and then we'll move into the first half. So first is no, I'm not worried that the PC will shrink to a point where the scale will get large enough to fund either the factories or the other innovations. The fact that we talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the PC, thus allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas. Remember also those growth areas are growing. And so they are replacing some of the volume in the factories as they grow. Now let's talk about the PC. You asked how do we take a look at the PC long term, and how do we make sure we're making the right investments, which to me, that's the key, right? That's what we've really tried to do with this restructuring, is take a look at the areas that are growing that we believe we can bring innovation to, that will make a difference to the end user. You're going to see more investments in 2-in-1s. You're going to see more investments in thin and light devices. You're going to see us push even harder on high-end gaming systems, which are growing at a very fast rate and they tend to buy up the stock to the very, very top. And then we're continuing to gain share in segments like set-top boxes, which are becoming more and more PC-like in their capabilities, if you think about it from a hardware standpoint. So they're absolutely segments we'll continue to invest and continue to innovate in. There are some very innovative systems in design right now that bring new functionality and new thinness and lightness to the market for the second half of this year. And we will do that. What we're going to do is make sure we're not doing -- or that we're doing this as most efficiently and not doing it spread out across all PCs and all form factors. And that's what we've really tried to do with this effort right now.",359

And if you look at the CFO commentary, we actually gave you desktop and notebook. What you'll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an ASP standpoint year-on-year. Desktop was up 6%.

We -- on a year-on-year basis, I think I termed it in the CFO commentary, up significantly as we weaned ourselves out of some of those contra revenue programs that we talked to you about.

Good question, Vivek. First, I'll just tell you that having been raised by Andy Grove, always paranoid about the competition, always driving and we know that we live or die by the performance of our product. We believe, if you take a look at our road maps, we have strong competitive leadership that should allow us to continue to have the position in the market that we currently have. I think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming much, much broader than just the CPU. What we're trying to do is really provide top-of-rack to bottom-of-rack solutions that bring -- that work together and bring performance across the whole rack, and that starts with Rack Scale Architecture itself, which is a very unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much more denser and lower cost way through silicon photonics or within rack communication. We've got the 3D XPoint and then you have our whole CPU architecture from networking, storage, up through server. So we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack of viewpoint and have everything work together and come together to bring really performance that is just unbelievable. And that's what's key to really keeping our position, is to own that -- is to understand that whole rack from top to bottom. And that really is our strategy when you take a look at it. In the other areas, like you said, networking and storage and the telco area, those are areas that we're gaining share and where, as they move to software-defined infrastructure and basically virtualized infrastructure, it plays right into the Intel architecture and really, what we do best, which is general-purpose computing. And that same architecture, from top of rack to bottom of rack, plays out in those areas as well, like in the telco area. So we believe our strategy absolutely will maintain our position in that. But we're always paranoid and we're always realizing we get there by performance of those products.",344

As a follow-up, I know you probably have answered different pieces of this question. But perhaps if, Stacy, you could help us quantify what Intel's started operating margins are this year and -- or maybe even longer term. Because when I look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies, they can get towards 20%, 25% operating margins. And when I look at a foundry like TSMC, it's able to get close to 40% operating margins. So given sort of those bookends, where should Intel be after all these restructuring actions are taken?",94

But I'll give you some insight into how Brian and I are thinking of this. First and foremost, we believe there's growth potential here. So just from a top line overall company standpoint, we think that there's significant opportunity to grow, and I think we've done a -- we've executed well in terms of growing over the last couple of few years, even as the PC TAM declined. And that's very consistent with our strategy, is invest in the Data Center and Memory and IoT and things like 5G, where we think there's opportunity and focus our investments on the client that we've talked about. In terms of the overall model then, the financial model for the company, I've given you this range of 55% to 65% gross margin as being kind of this most of the data points landing between those goalposts. If you look at it over the last 5 years, we've very consistently been in the very high end of that gross margin range. So it's more like between 60% and 65%. Last year, we were 63%. This year, we believe we're at 62%. So that just kind of continues. I don't see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term. And then, with these actions that we're taking, when we get to full realization, and I want to stress, we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth. But if you just look at the cost side of it, it's 2 to 3 points of spending as a percent of revenue when we get to mid-'17 and full realization. That takes our spending, as a percent of revenue, even just based on your estimate of 2016 revenue, it's 2 to 3 points, it takes it back down into the low 30s from a spending as a percent of revenue. And you can do the math from there and see kind of what we think we can achieve next year in terms of overall operating margin.",370

So should we assume that total expenses will drop roughly $150 million a quarter from 4Q '16 to the second quarter of 2017? And then, if you guys could break that out between how much of the savings would be on COGS versus OpEx?",55
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3557.0,959670.0,40738546.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,60,"So no, I'm not going to give that level of granularity of forecasting by quarter in '17. But I'll say, and I want to be clear, that the $1.4 billion is all OpEx, so that's an OpEx savings number that we think we get to by mid-'17. And so just to kind of recap some of the financial data that we provided to you, we get to that level by mid-'17, that's $1.4 billion in savings. I think that is a net number. So that's including some reinvestment that we plan to make. We think that that's 12,000 positions that get eliminated, which is a very difficult thing for us to go through, but that's what's in these numbers. We think we achieve half of those employment reductions by the end of this year. And overall for 2016, we've brought down our OpEx by $700 million. That is again due to this restructuring program. And we've added in a line that you'll see on the GAAP P&L of $1.2 billion in restructuring charges to achieve that. So beyond that, I'm not going to go into any more granular data. I think that should be plenty, and now we want to go have the conversation with the employees and help them understand what this program means.",215

And as for my follow-up, in terms of the growth opportunities that you guys are really pushing for IoT, DCG, et cetera, I guess if you look at the margin profile of 2 of the memory and basically cell phone processors, it's substantially below your current margins. So I guess my question is why would you want to pursue 2 markets like that, where the margin profile is so much lower than yours?",79
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3557.0,959670.0,40738548.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,62,"Sure. So let's dissect those. From memory, one, we believe that if you take a look at our typical margins, they're better than cell phone margins on typical quarters. But also it's integral to the Data Center. So it really actually is this virtual cycle that, especially as we move to 3Q NAND and then to 3D XPoint, as we've talked about 3D XPoint and how that really re-architects how memory and storage is played out in the server rack and in the Data Center overall, it's a chance to really, very uniquely shift backhaul infrastructure. So we believe that's actually critical to our strategy in the Data Center and will bring a product with good margins. Let's talk about IoT. If you take a look at it, first, it's growing quite well. And if you take a look at the Data Center right -- or, I mean, the IoT right now, it grew 22% this quarter, and it has PC-like margins. So this is not cell phone chips. They don't tend to be cell phone chips. If you take a look at the segments we're really going after, which are things like automotive or what I'll call autonomous vehicles, industrial and retail, they tend to be systems that have fair amount of compute at the edge. They tend to have machine learning capabilities. These are systems -- and they tend to have high degree of COGS and more and more will move into 5G. So that link also between those products in IoT and 5G, and the 5G infrastructure, we believe also plays into the Data Center and the whole Data Center strategy and will be critical that you can provide end-to-end solutions. So if you're somebody out trying to build whatever that autonomous vehicle is, you need to be able to provide the 5G back end, but also, the 5G out on the device, whether it's a car or a drone or a robot or whatever it is out there autonomously moving about.",335

Those businesses lever IP that we create broadly for the company. And so our cost of entry in something like IoT actually is relatively low because we have the Atom core, we have the graphics, we're investing in the connectivity, we're investing in the wireless WWAN for other businesses. And that's where we really get leverage in this model, and that's one of the reasons that the IoT profit margins have been as high as they have been.",118

A couple of years ago, you had laid out a 20% CAGR target for this. Then I think a year later, you had brought it down to mid-teens. And yes, it grew very strong this quarter, but last full year, it was a 7% grower. So the question is what's the right way to think about the growth profile for this business? And what happened in the past? Was it a one-year-off event? Or kind of just help us understand the drivers and why it should reaccelerate? And why the first quarter is not an anomaly? And then I have a quick follow-up.",111

I would tell you that I'd reiterate what I said, which is it's a mid-teen type of growth rate. And you've got to take a look at this over the long haul. The IoT space is like similar to the embedded space evolved to some extent into the FPGA space, where you have -- especially where we're trying to go, where you're trying to go into products that require that higher level of compute, the machine learning, those capabilities you have, a design time, a design-in time to win the design and then you have a ramp for that product. And so those tend to take a little while. Autonomous driving vehicles are a good example. If you're out winning designs today, you're winning '18 -- 2018, 2019 car designs. Those are what are being won today. So as you bring your products to market, that's what you're winning. So I'm still believing that over the long term, this will be a mid-teens growth. It'll have, for the most part, PC-like margins. And we've tried to pick the segments that play to our strengths and that also used the connectivity that we believe we're uniquely qualified to bring.",199

For the reported quarter, the big driver of the tax rate was a discrete item associated with one of the divestitures that we drove out of our Security business, and we got a onetime tax benefit associated with that. And it's -- just tying back to the strategy, you can see the performance of the Security business, both in terms of the revenue growth and their profit growth. I think the team there is doing a really good job of focusing in on a few key areas where we think we have competitive advantage and then driving them hard and we've divested a few smaller businesses and we happen to get a tax benefit on one of them. As we look at the year, so part of it is just what happened in Q1. And then the other part is we would expect to have a higher proportion of our profit in lower tax jurisdictions as we work our way through the year. It will bring down the tax rate a little bit.",174

It does not touch that at all. And as Stacy talked about, even our CapEx and how the CapEx that we're spending this year, which has not moved is mostly for either the 3D NAND ramp or 10-nanometers. As far as Moore's Law, we are always constantly striving to get back to 2 years. We've given you a timing that's for 10-nanometers; that's more like 2.5 years. We haven't talked about 7-nanometers. Partly, it's still in definition and alignment. So we're not sure, but we're -- I can truly tell you we're constantly working to get back to 2 years. And trying to lay out though, if you look at the history of Moore's Law, there have been anywhere from 18 months to 3 years in the lengths of cycles over the time. More importantly, what I always remind people is the leadership you have over the competition, which is always what's important, right. All of these are getting harder, and they get hard for everybody. And so you want to make sure also that your leadership gap, what you're able to do relative to their competition remains constant as well. Both of those are as important as the other.",212

Our top line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook and profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall as we transform Intel into a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices. We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation as evidenced by results in the Data Center, IoT and Programmable Solutions business this quarter. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications.
I'll start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year-over-year this quarter, while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the 2-in-1 and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our 7th Generation Core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem known as 7360.
Next, the Data Center, where revenue grew 5% year-over-year, cloud service providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10% and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year.
In the Data Center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year-over-year in every microprocessor product segment from Atom and Xeon D SoCs at the low end, up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. We continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment as Intel Architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFV and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in Data Center CPU average selling prices.
Progress in the Data Center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production unit in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew 8x in the first 6 months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments.
Omni-Path, our high-performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's top 500 supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market.
This quarter, we also shipped our first silicon photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, Silicon Photonics and Ethernet to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year, and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue.
The Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals, offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see tremendous potential in this business. A great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard, open platform for autonomous driving. In addition, we are bringing Indian computing technology to power the next-generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, from the door locks to the data center. 
Our Memory business was down 20% over last year and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we are bringing to this market. Fab 68 in Dalian, China started its initial 3D NAND wafers late in the second quarter but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3D XPoint SSDs branded Optane by the end of the year and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry.
The Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year on strengthening comms, infrastructure and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14-nanometer Stratix 10 samples this year. Been very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution.
Our Security business was up 10% as the restructuring the team completed last year and their focused execution continues to deliver results.
And finally, our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing. In April, we announced some important changes to our road maps in areas like SoCs and perceptual computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to a company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our client business. In total, we expect this initiative will drive in a net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017.
Looking ahead, I'm very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in high single digits of this year, we're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double-digit growth in the third quarter. We are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid foundation for growth built on the Data Center and the Internet of Things business, reinforced by the combination of Memory and FPGAs and bound together by connectivity. 
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.",978

In the second quarter, we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals. Our forecast reflects growing momentum as we enter the back half of 2016.
Revenue for the second quarter was $13.5 billion, in line with expectations and up 3% year-over-year. Gross margin for the quarter of 62% was approximately 1 point higher than our expectations, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $5.2 billion, in line with our expectations. We are on track to the restructuring announced on the last earnings call, with a reduction of about 6,000 employees in the second quarter.
Operating income of $3.2 billion was down 2% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Earnings per share of $0.59 was down $0.03 from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year. Client Computing Group operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower overall spending and margin improvements in our mobile products and higher ASPs in the PC segment. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in the second quarter and as we enter the second half, they are at healthy levels.
Data Center revenue was $4 billion, up 5% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp 14-nanometer Data Center products. As we enter the second half, we expect the Enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the Cloud segment growth rate to accelerate. In addition, we expect increasing ASPs as we ramp our Broadwell-based server products.
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $572 million, with year-over-year growth of 2%. Our Security business had revenue of $537 million, up 10% year-over-year. Our Memory business had revenue of $554 million, down 20% year-over-year. This segment had an operating loss of $224 million as a result of continued pricing pressures, higher startup costs as we ramped 3D NAND in our China factory and increased 3D XPoint spending.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $465 million, up 12% year-over-year when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was negative $62 million. This includes about $160 million in noncash charges for inventory adjustments. Excluding these charges would result in about $100 million in positive operating profit.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17.7 billion, up $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Our total debt is $28.6 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is negative $5.7 billion. We are projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year.
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated in our Q2 results as we generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter, purchased $2.3 billion in capital assets and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock. In the second quarter, we also paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and as of yesterday's close of market, our dividend yield was about 3%.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.9 billion. This forecast is at the high end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%.
Turning to the full year 2016. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We continue to expect the overall PC market to be down in the high single digits and we expect to achieve low double-digit growth in our Data Center business. Gross margin for the full year of 2016 is expected to be 62%, consistent with our prior outlook. You can see our strategy playing out in our first half results and our expectations for the second half. We expect above seasonal growth in the back half of the year, led by strong growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses. And for the year, we expect the growth in those businesses will offset the PC market decline and with the addition of the Programmable Solutions Group, will result in mid-single-digit revenue growth. Additionally, we are executing to our restructuring program, which allows us to increase investments in strategically important areas, generate financial returns for our owners and build the foundation for future financial growth.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",778

What's giving you the confidence that things are going to bounce back so nicely?,25
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539915.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,7,"Sure. I'll start and then Stacy can add. This is Brian, Chris. I think it's really a mix of a couple of things. One, we saw in the second quarter and we project out into the second half a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of the market. The enterprise side was down only about 1%, which is a bit more stable than it has been. Second thing is we are ramping our Broadwell e-server in the second half of the year and then so we expect a strong demand. And we typically see an ASP uplift as people buy up in the stack with the new server systems coming out. And we have customer signals that just indicate that there's a second half seasonal buying pattern kicking in a bit as well. So those 3 things are the second half keys. But if you take a look at a broader view of this, right, just overall, our view of the Data Center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud's going to continue to expand. It's going to be driven by the many, many machines that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitude, more data than what the average human creates today and that's getting to the cloud. So there's the kind of the short versus the longer-term point of view.",227

And for my follow-up, you mentioned you started shipping the 7360. Was that material to Q2 or will it be material to the second half? And any comments on profitability there?",32

So I'm not going to talk specifically about the 7360 because we -- our policy is let our customers announce any design wins that they want to announce when they want to announce them. In terms of the overall impact on financials, when I look at the second half, you'll note that we have an above-seasonal growth rate in there. The biggest driver of that is what Brian just talked about in the Data Center, so that's kind of the biggest driver. We were kind of below the average annual growth rate in the first half. We expect to be above that low double-digit from the back half driven by the 3 things he talked about. But in particular, the cloud buying patterns that we've identified with some of those large customers. And then behind that, we see an improvement in revenue, in memory and an improvement in revenue in IoT. So those are the big drivers as we go into the back half.",165

I'm just kind of curious as you look into the third quarter, the guide is sort of the high end of normal seasonal as you talked about it. How would you characterize kind of your view of the PC business going into Q3? And to the extent that it's still a subdued view, is this really confidence in Data Center or what other parts of the business would drive sort of above seasonal -- or high end of seasonal, sorry?",104

And then Stacy can get into the where is the above-seasonal numbers coming from and all. I think if you look at the second half, we already said that Q2 ended up being a little bit better than what we had anticipated. And we had built the year at the high single digits. And if you take a look at Q2, it ended up coming at the kind of a mid-single-digit decline. We've tried to be relatively cautious as we look out into the rest of this year and built the year and the forecast around that high single-digit numbers set for decline of the PC. We are carrying momentum out of Q2 so there's still data that needs to be collected on how it looks. But right now, we've maintained our cautious view of the high single digits.",160
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539922.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,14,"Yes. And so just to translate that into seasonality against the backdrop of what Brian just said, which is high single-digit decline in the PC business, we're expecting that segment to play out more or less seasonally, John. We tend to do a little bit better than that because of mix and ASP but from a unit standpoint, it should be fairly seasonal. And then the driver is what I just talked about. The Data Center growth rate as we move into the back half should be significantly higher than what we saw in the first half based on stabilization in enterprise, what we see with the cloud customers and then some ASP uplift as we ramp Broadwell server -- 14-nanometer Broadwell servers into that product mix.",127

Then maybe for my follow-up, just looking at the Memory business. As you guys characterized -- tough quarter in the June quarter, you annualized kind of the operating loss. It's a fairly large number. I'm just kind of curious have startup costs there peaked? Did we have another couple of quarters of startup costs going up in memory. And I guess more importantly, as Dalian ramps and as you think about XPoint, how should we think about kind of your profitability goals longer term? And kind of what the fall through on that business looks like as revenue does start to accelerate?",106
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539924.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,16,"Yes. So there's a short-term and a long-term component to this. So in the short term, as I think about the second half, in kind of rough math, I'd expect the kind of consistent loss in the second half to what we saw in the first half. I think startup costs will be slightly higher. We'll see the first production costs play through on 3D XPoint which, as you know, from watching us over the years, those first production costs tend to be fairly high in any factory when you're starting it up. Offset by the underlying existing NAND business I think it's a bit better as we go into the back half, so that's the short-term answer. To your longer-term question and I'll turn this over to Brian but -- to tell you about the technology, but I think the combination of 3D NAND and the cost structure we're going to achieve and then the disruptive nature of 3D XPoint, we should have a very good value proposition and a very good overall profit position for the business.",179
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539925.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,17,"Yes, John, I would just echo what Stacy said. We're just now starting to ramp our 3D NAND. So as we go through this back half of this year and into next year, it's really starting to ramp up. We think large cost advantages and good performance position there. And then as we've said, 3D XPoint SSDs start to ship at the end of this year. 3D XPoint DIMMs next year. And so these investments that we're making this year, which we've talked about, are really playing forward those 2 technologies. So I'm still very bullish on the long-term prospects. The units and the gigabytes continue to grow. Our cost structure gets better and better as we go through the back half and into next year. And then 3D XPoint, as we've said will really, in our minds, change the whole memory storage architecture.",144

The growth, your mid-single digit growth for about 3 consecutive quarters. And I know you had higher expectations for that a few quarters ago. Can you talk about, is that entirely an enterprise phenomenon or is that a timing issue around cloud? Just how should we think about the last few quarters of DCG?",65

I'd say -- so overall, relative to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year, let's say, it's primarily enterprise-driven. And then there's what we commonly use as lumpiness quarter-on-quarter. So to how you asked the question. We actually weren't surprised by the Q2 results. In fact, they came in right in line, actually just a hair above what our internal forecast was. We have, I think, pretty good insight into the large cloud customers. And so we had some good insight into the buying patterns as those customers went from Q1 to Q2. And now as we look at the back half, we see several purchasing cycles kicking in for some of the large guys, so we expect that the cloud piece will accelerate as we get into the back half.",135

That's helpful. And then with regards to the balance sheet, I noticed both day sales outstanding and days of inventory bumped up a little bit and I hadn't expected that. Can you just talk about what drove that?",39
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539930.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,22,"Yes. Those are 2 different things. I'll just start with the easy one, day sales outstanding, I'm not seeing anything unusual there. It's just the amount of net billings at the end of the quarter. The average day paid and all of that, so it looks really healthy, so I'm not seeing anything unusual there. On the inventory side, as I talked to you last quarter, we ended Q1 higher than where I wanted to be. Our yields got better in Q1, frankly, they got a lot better in Q2 as well. And we undershipped a little bit in Q1 relative to the units that we were expecting. So we took some actions in the second quarter to start bringing inventory levels down. What you see inside of inventory it was kind of flattish, right in line with what we expected Q1 to Q2. It was a remixing, so you see some more expensive server parts and some Skylake parts going up, and then you see some of the older generation CPUs going down. And as we get into the back half, we'd expect inventory to click down and be down pretty meaningfully by the time we get to Q4.",200

Your desktop ASPs are up again in Q2 maybe due to the strength here. It seems like the graphics guys are rolling out some new products. There appears to be a good pipeline of new games for the second half. So I guess the question is, did the PC gaming segment continue to drive double digits growth for the team in Q2? And how do you see that trending into the second half?",96
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539933.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,25,"Sure. If you take a look at it, there was 3-ish, maybe 4-ish major segments of the PC that did better and continue to do better than the rest of the segment and just kind of overall. Laptops, mobile, PCs continue to do better and they did better in the second quarter. 2-in-1 devices, specifically, are doing very well and continue to grow in double digits. And then as you said, we call -- often called enthusiast gaming, you see our K-SKUs in there. And then you saw us also announce the X-SKU, which is our new 10 Core system that has been selling much, much better than even we anticipated. And so yes, gaming and enthusiast continues to grow at a double-digit rate.",124

It was not one vertical. If you just look at it, I think our customers got a little ahead of their skis in the first quarter. If you remember, I think we had a 21% or 22% year-on-year growth rate in Q1. There was a little more inventory out there than we anticipated and that took some of the -- it was a bit of a headwind as we started Q2. To your question on the back half, we do expect a reacceleration. So I had said at the Investor Meeting that we expect kind of double-digit growth in excess of what we had achieved last year. We still expect that. We had a strong Q1, an inventory burn in Q2 and we expect a strong Q3 and Q4.",150

And from a -- which verticals. The verticals that have been the strongest growing for us, especially in recent has been industrial and in the security, video-type applications. Those have been the 2 real growth. We have a lot of, I'll call it, longer-term growth vectors, retails are longer-term growth vector.

On the DCG, I guess, growth target into the back half, it sounds like you need enterprise to keep getting better into the second half, as well as for the, I guess, the cloud and comm side of DCG to significantly reaccelerate to get there. I mean, cloud was up 9% year-over-year, I mean it's good but it's -- that's a significant deceleration. Can you sort of give us a feeling for what you need for enterprise into the back half? And what drove the deceleration in the high-growth parts of this business into Q2?",100

So I'd say I'd characterize enterprise in the back half consistent with what we saw in Q2. If it stabilizes at that rate, that gives us the ability to grow the levels that we're projecting. And then for the cloud, yes, you're right. It's what I said earlier. We had actually forecasted a pause in purchasing based on what we knew of the customer -- the big cloud players' ordering patterns and based on the signals we are seeing from them, we do except -- expect a reacceleration in the back half to something more consistent with like what we were seeing through the last couple of years.",109

So first, let me start with your question on Data Center. There's a lot in there. So I do expect an operating margin improvement in the Data Center as we work through this year. I think we were kind of around mid-40s in the second quarter and historical range has been closer to 50. As I expect it, that ticks up some as we move into the back half. The big driver there is costs. And so that the early production on the Broadwell server is fairly expensive, costs come down as we get into the back half and as you said, we do expect some ASP uplift in the back half. Overall for the company, what we're seeing, so I'll just use Q3 as the anchor point, we're seeing some good news in Q3 associated with higher volumes. And then the big offset there is we're seeing 10-nanometer startup costs going up pretty significantly in the back half. So that may be the piece that you're missing in the equation in Q3. That continues into Q4, by the way. We see a little bit more startup cost. If you do your algebra, you're probably coming up with a gross margin for Q4 that's about 62%. So think of that as some good things happen but we have, again, an increase in startup costs and we have some of the Dalian cost with the first production of 3D XPoint that also kick in a bit more in Q4.",249

You talked about the customers taking down the inventory a little bit less than you would expected in Q2. Can you clarify why they chose to do that?

So overall we continue to see inventory levels as being very healthy. I think that the PC -- the worldwide PC supply chain has moved towards a stance of being fairly lean and fairly cautious, and we see that continuing. You would typically see an inventory burn in the second quarter. It was a little bit less of an inventory burn than what we expected. I think it goes back to Brian's comments that he made at the beginning of the call that from their perspective, the PC market was a little better in Q2. So I think they probably just brought down inventory levels a little bit less.",110

As a follow-on to that, maybe you can clarify what you consider to be normal PC seasonality in that third quarter because I think that's been changing over the past several years.

I mean, how do you characterize the build this year relative to what we've seen last year and the year before?",73

So I would say for the company, you would expect to see the seasonality -- or revenue seasonality for us that's in the high single digits as we go from Q2 to Q3.

The DCG business is obviously going to diversify itself some going forward with some of the new products that you're introducing and the networking business taking off. The operating margin percentage is down fairly sharply year-over-year and I would expect that to ramp back up some as revenue reaccelerates. But maybe, Stacy, you could talk about what the long-term margin structure looks like from an operating margin perspective in DCG as the business diversifies some?",96
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539958.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,50,"Sure. So we'll talk about that in more depth at the Investor Meeting but I'll give you some off-the-cuff comments here. First, to just put it into perspective, the operating margin percent decline that we saw in Q2 had nothing to do with the new products or first order -- the new products weren't driving it. It was the 14-nanometer costs of Broadwell server. And we get in the back half, we're going to see on ASP impact associated with that because we think that the performance that, that product brings enables customers to get a better value proposition by buying a richer mix. So that's why I'm pretty confident when we get in the back half, we see the margins snapping back towards that 50% that we've articulated as our long-term goal. We'll talk more about the mix of products and whatnot at the Investor Meeting. But the one thing I'd point you to is, remember, something like networking, which is Atom-based server product that's going in, while it does have a lower ASP than the average within DCG, it has an ASP that's actually been going up and it has a very different cost structure than a Xeon does. So I wouldn't just immediately assume that because it's a lower price segment of the market that it's a margin-hindered segment of the market because that's not the case.",230

That's really helpful. And then, I guess the follow-up on that sticking on margins, maybe you could talk a little bit about how adding the third chip on 14-nanometer may affect margins going into 2017 in the PC business to offset some of the 10-nanometer ramp costs you had talked about? I think it's a little bit of a different dynamic than we've seen with the [indiscernible] traditionally with the tick-tock approach. So any sort of broader comments you can give there about margins would be really helpful. Appreciate it.",91

But the -- from a -- so first off, we haven't forecast 2017 margins. So we'll give you the first glimpse of that when we get to the Investor Meeting and then we'll put a formal stake in the ground when we get next to January. But I would say that there's nothing that I'm seeing in the overall road map that for me is a significant headwind as we go into 2017. So yes, we'll give you a lot more insight in a few months but I'm not seeing anything that has me worried as we go into '17.",136

So one of the things we've learned on 14-nanometers is how to make meaningful performance in improvements both in the silicon and then with the silicon combined with the architecture. So we said we already started shipping Kaby Lake to our customers and OEMs. We're seeing meaningful performance across all of the various SKUs of Kaby Lake relative to Skylake. It's -- Kaby Lake is built off a Skylake Core. And as a result, the die size doesn't significantly grow, so you don't see -- there's no driver in the silicon itself to shift the margin structure of this product. We're able to get the performance and feature enhancements with relatively small silicon increases but good improvement on the silicon -- raw silicon technology itself. So there's not a -- an intrinsic driver that should say, ""die size got twice as big so margins are cut."" There's nothing like that.",161

As you said, South America and Latin America continues to be weak. We see weakness in Asia but it did get a little bit better than in the past. And that, combined with North America, were the 2 drivers that made Q2 perform better than what we'd modeled in our high single digits. And as I said, I'm being relatively cautious in this and making sure that we put an estimate out there that we are very comfortable with and that's why we've gone with a -- stuck with our high single-digit view of the year.",135

And we're hearing that same thing from our customers. And as we go out and talk to CIOs, we're hearing the same thing. Those cycles though can sometimes take -- you'll hear them and then they sometimes can take some time to really kick in. So again, we kind of built that into the cautiousness of the second half and making sure that we know what we're going into the second half with. But we are hearing similar things around the enterprise conversion. And it's comfort with Windows 10, ability to make that transition and wanting to do it on new hardware.",103

So we haven't really tried to -- we have a pretty wide spread guesstimates and models right now in sizing the market because we're still really learning. We've actually started to ship some sample units to customers already to let them try out and start to learn. Those are to the big cloud service providers is mostly who we're sending those to. You're going to see it enter as SSDs. You'll see those SSDs, both enterprise-class SSDs and also commercial consumer type SSDs. We demonstrated in several live demonstrations anywhere from 5 to 7, 8, 9, 10x improvement in performance depending on the workload through those SSDs. So you're going to see those be the first implications. When I think about where the big volume will come from, I think it will come in that DIMM form factor. You're going to see it in cloud applications, everything from machine learning, Big Data, any place where you have memory intensive and where you could do in-memory applications, the 3D XPoint is going to be nicely configured for that. It allows you to bring large amounts of storage-like data into a memory-like performance. And that's the real key here. I also believe you'll see it in consumer devices. You'll see laptops and devices like that. Gaming machines. We think it'll have gaming applications where you can preload in a cache-like environment the next level of your game. And so it loads almost instantly as you transition from -- within the game. So there's going to be a variety of those. And actually, the more we go and start to play with it, start to give it out to customers, the more types of applications and workloads we're finding that it can be used for.",293

And at what point would net leverage, net cash, we should start to see more aggressive buybacks?",40
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539972.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,64,"Sure. As I communicated I think at the Investor Meeting or in the last 6 months, our goal is to get back to net cash 0. At one point, I had predicted that, that would happen in the back half of this year. The combination of business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the year, as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push that out. So that will happen sometime in '17. Although I do think we'll make good progress towards net cash 0 as we move into the back half. Today, our net debt level is right around $5 billion. So we'll take a big chunk out of that as we move into the back half. In terms of then -- now that said, we're still generating excess free cash flow. You can see that even in the first half even inclusive of the restructuring charges we did. And so you can see we did, I think, $1.6 billion of buybacks in the first half and we have a dividend yield. But as of yesterday it was about 3%. So I think we're -- you see us executing to the priorities that we had articulated.",203

So let's just talk about modems. Really to stay on a leading-edge modem, you need to have a yearly cadence of modem technology. And so we have just that, a yearly cadence laid out. We had the 7260 last year. We have the 7360 this year. We have a series of modems out. We've got them built out and planned for the next several years. We haven't publicly stated when we'll bring it inside but clearly, we plan to. We'll do that when the right point of intercepting the road map and getting the right performance off the 14-nanometers is required. Right now, I'm more concerned about getting the leading edge momentum going for us with the 7360 and then the follow-on in '17 and really showing that we are a world-class modem company.",135

And I guess as part of that, what role does competition play into it with all the recent noise around SoftBank buying ARM and presumably putting more resources into it? I understand there are no near-term implications. But just longer term, how do you think about growth and competition in DCG?",76
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3178.0,1009852.0,42539978.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,70,"Sure. So let me try and talk about why I'm so confident in growth. Well, we can talk about competition. I -- and then we'll see if that does not answer your question. When I think of the cloud, the cloud that we have today is really built on the backs of people. It's your Facebook data, it's your Salesforce data, it's your Twitter data. It's all data that is really across the devices that we pretty much handle day-to-day. The current estimates are, if you look out into 2020, that average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes a day of data off those devices. And those are going to be all your posts and pictures and all that kind of information. If you take a look at the average autonomous car in 2020, the estimates right now are it is -- it will throw off about 40 gigabytes a minute of data. If you take a look at the average autonomous drone doing some kind of scan, looking for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine, it's going to throw off about 20 gigabytes a minute. If you take something like our replay technology that is filming in virtual reality a basketball game or a football game, it's throwing off 200 gigabytes a minute right now. And as we continue to refine the accuracy of that, that number will likely just grow. So it's that growth in data and the need to both process it at the edge and then through the Data Center and into the cloud to be able to store it, to be able to apply machine learning to all of those applications, those all tell me that the cloud is going to continue to grow. It's going to be lumpy. These guys don't build out their data centers in a linear fashion. They go, they build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go then sell that and have expansion space and they don't build for a while. And so I know people worry about, well, is it slowing down? But these trends in data that tell me, no, it's not slowing down over the long term. And that what we're really going to see is just the buying patterns and the buildouts of the various structures that are going up. As far as competition, there's always going to be competition in this market. I expect it. That's okay. We think of ourself as competition, in fact. We are built on a model that says, we have to build a continuous improvement of our products such that we're replacing ourself with a better cost-for-performance model over time. And so we know that just even if there was no competition, the competition is we've got to build a product that's better and drives replacement as well as growth. And so I look at the competition as -- it's welcome. It keeps us better. It's always been out there. There will always be somebody out there. But really what we have to do is build products that are so competitive that people want to replace our products with our new product. That then is one of the best models to use for making sure you stay ahead.",545

Q3 was an outstanding quarter, which produced records in a number of product lines and serves as evidence of our transformation to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. As a great proof point, third quarter revenue grew 9% over last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses. I'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now.
I'll start with the Client Computing Group, which had a stellar quarter. This team's focused on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products. Improving product costs and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margin. The Client Computing Group's revenue grew 5% over last year. But just as importantly, CCG is playing a direct and impactful role in our transformation.
In the Data Center Group, revenue grew 10% year-over-year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the Data Center Group accelerating at a rate above our forecast. The cloud service provider segment was up 32%. In the cloud service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth, as the market converts to NFV and SDN and demand for our products increased.
In addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%. This category includes our new Omni-Path high-performance fabric, which is leading in performance and gaining design win momentum. It includes our silicon photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began their ramps this year. However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year-over-year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the full year will likely be in the high single digits.
Another key growth opportunity for Intel, our Internet of Things business grew 19% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $700 million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video and transportation segments.
Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year-over-year. 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule with yields matching those of our other production facilities. We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology, 3D XPoint, and we're making steady progress towards bringing it into production.
Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wireline, industrial and broadcast segments. I'm very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continue to execute against our DL [ph] thesis. And PSG has produced 3 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera's results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges.
In the third quarter, we began sampling our Stratix 10 product, Intel's first FPGA produced on our own process technology and also, the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA. We are shipping our first co-packaged parts from the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with PSG products across many of Intel's businesses. PSG's results show the tremendous progress and execution.
The Intel Security business was up 6% over last year. Last month, we announced that we will sell 51% of Intel Security to private equity firm TPG to establish a jointly owned independent cyber security company named McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent company while allowing Intel to continue to participate in McAfee's success and growth.
Intel's transformation continues, and the restructuring program that we announced in April remains on track. I'm really proud of the work our employees are doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard, and going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed and resilient this team is.
And finally, I'd like to welcome Bob to the company as our Chief Financial Officer. He brings a wealth of leadership experience to Intel, and his financial acumen and strategic insights will be an asset to the company. At the same time, I'd like to thank Stacy for an outstanding 9 years as CFO. He's been a great partner, and I'm excited to have his leadership in manufacturing, sales and operations moving forward.
Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with our results in the third quarter. We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials and continued to realign our resources to our strategy. The progress we're making leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",745

In the third quarter, we achieved record revenue of $15.8 billion and also achieved $5.1 billion in operating income. Revenue growth of 9% year-over-year is driven by solid growth across the Client Computing, Data Center and Internet of Things Groups.
Gross margin at 64.8% was higher than expected and up 3 points from the second quarter. Operating income grew 18% from a year ago. Earnings per share of $0.80 were up $0.14 from a year ago.
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we saw strengthening of demand and an inventory build in the worldwide PC supply chain. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing 37% from a year ago, as revenue increased, costs came down and investment levels declined.
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year. In the third quarter, we continued to see robust growth in the cloud segment of the business, which grew over 30% year-over-year, partially offset by a 3% decline in the enterprise segment over the same horizon. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $2.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year as we increased investments and ramped Broadwell, the first 14-nanometer server product.
Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $689 million, growing 19% year-over-year, driven by strength in our retail, video and transportation segments. Operating profit for the business was $191 million, up 27% year-over-year.
Our memory business had revenue of $649 million, down 1% year-over-year. This segment had an operating loss of $134 million as a result of start-up costs for our China factory and costs associated with 3D XPoint.
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million, up 6% when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was $78 million.
Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 6% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we announced a newly formed jointly owned independent cyber security company called McAfee. The transaction values the business at approximately $4.2 billion, and at deal close, we expect to realize a pretax gain on the sale of roughly $500 million when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2017. The costs associated with the transaction are factored into our restructuring and spending guiding. Post deal close, we will own 49% of the new company.
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enables us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated in our third quarter results as we generated $5.8 billion cash from operations, purchased $2.5 billion in capital assets, repaid $1 billion in commercial paper, repurchased approximately $500 million of stock and paid $1.2 billion in dividends.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, roughly flat to the third quarter. This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce inventory.
Since the last earnings call, our review of second half 2016 revenue has increased as a result of strength in the Client Computing and Internet of Things Groups partially offset by weakness in the enterprise segment of the Data Center. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the fourth quarter gross margin to be 63%. Spending is expected to be approximately $5.2 billion.
Intel is in the midst of a significant transformation. We are focusing on being more efficient, investing in higher-growth segments, and with the McAfee transaction, we are focusing our business on core strategic areas. Given that, I would like to provide a little more context on each.
We are on track to achieve the run rate savings and employment reductions associated with the restructuring program announced earlier this year, and in fact, we are moving faster than we anticipated. In addition, the deal involving the Intel Security Group, which was announced in the third quarter, will result in additional restructuring charges, a pretax gain and reduced spending levels in 2017.
As a result of those restructuring charges and the increased mix of retirements and European severances, we are increasing the restructuring and other charges forecast by $700 million to $2.3 billion. The majority of the remaining restructuring charges will be realized between now and the middle of 2017.
We are on track to the original restructuring and focusing our business on core strategic areas. This is allowing incremental investments in critical areas like the Data Center, Internet of Things and memory. The overall impact of the announced reductions, Intel Security Group transaction and reinvestment is that we expect our 2016 spending as a percent of revenue to be down almost 1 point versus 2015, and we expect to achieve another 1 point reduction in 2017 as we accelerate our transformation.
In the third quarter, we achieved record revenue and strong operating profits, but since this is my last earnings call, I would like to take the opportunity to provide some historical perspective on how the company has changed over the 10 years since I've been attending these calls, which I really think shows the transformation of our business. 10 years ago, virtually the entirety of our business was tied to the PC market. Today, we have a diversified portfolio of growing businesses with roughly half of our profits coming from the Data Center and Internet of Things businesses.
We are also a different company in terms of how we look financially. 10 years ago, our revenue was approximately $35 billion with a gross margin of 52%. In 2016, we are on a path to almost $59 billion in revenue with a gross margin of 63%. And over the past 10 years, we have increased our dividend from $0.40 per share to $1.04 per share, and we've repurchased about $55 billion of stock.
Looking forward, Intel is positioned with technology leadership, an amazing workforce and significant market opportunity as we power the cloud at the heart of all of these smart and connected devices. I am excited about how we're positioned for growth and my next role in the company and about the leadership, experience and continued focus on driving long-term shareholder value that Bob will bring as CFO.
With that, let me turn it over to Bob for a few words.",1065

Curious how we should think about contribution from enterprise looking into 2017 when you think that could stabilize. And then as you start to think about greater contributions from hyperscale and networking, is that 10% to 15% sustainable? Or should we be thinking high single digits going forward?",61

So yes, I mean, as we just said on the call, what we're seeing in the Data Center is very strong growth rates in the cloud, very strong growth rates in networking and storage as those areas become virtualized and our products extend into those areas. And then we saw some weakness in the enterprise in Q4 and -- or in Q3, and that's what we're expecting for Q4. I think we're going to hold off on providing a forecast for 2017 at this time. We would normally provide that to you in January and then have a much more in-depth conversation in the investor meeting in February.",121

And I guess, on the PC front, given the volatility there, I wouldn't expect you guys to put the flag down and say that we've completely stabilized.

And I would agree. We're not going to raise the flag and say the -- everything's good again. If you take a look at this quarter, what we saw was kind of an increased strength in the areas that have been strong in the past, so definitely, the mature markets were a bit stronger. The one that was probably a little bit of a shift is China. It was a little bit better than we had forecasted as well. Enterprise was again strong. Consumer was better, but it's still not back to where we consider it -- where we'd like to see the consumer side. And it was a good mix between desktop and mobile products, laptops and 2 in 1s and devices like that. So it was kind of an increase in what's been strong in the past is really what drove the growth for this quarter.",149

I know you had sort of highlighted some increased investments, but we also have cloud growth and networking and some of the other non-CPU stuff that's been growing as well. How should we think about that change in the growth drivers in terms of impacting the margins over the last year? And how should we think about the likely margin trends for the business as we go into next year?",80
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3726.0,1057062.0,44289276.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,13,"Yes. I'll take that, and Brian may want to talk about more the longer term. But it's not a driver in what we saw in the third quarter. There really are the 2 issues. We have been very consciously increasing investment there. We see a tremendous long-term opportunity. So that's been an ongoing process for us. But then the thing that really kicked in this quarter is they're ramping their first 14-nanometer of server product, which is Broadwell for the server market, and that -- those first products coming out on that product line are fairly expensive. To the mix question, it doesn't really drive things probably as much as you would expect. We have very strong product margins across the portfolio of server products in the enterprise or in the Data Center, ranging from enterprise to storage to networking. And in fact, when we look at that server ASPs, we actually saw ASPs up kind of across the board in every one of our server categories, so MP, DP. And so it really is a mix impact of what you see happening this quarter where it's a little weaker on enterprise and a little stronger in places like networking.",200
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3726.0,1057062.0,44289277.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,14,"Yes. And Stacy, maybe -- this is Brian. Maybe let me help you just think about the Data Center from a larger perspective, right? As Stacy said, what you have to really take a look here is the growth areas that we said we are going to continue to grow in, the cloud service provider, the telco base, the networking and storage. Networking specifically is -- it was the more -- [ph] fastest growing areas of the Data Center and then the adjacencies, which are all new emerging markets for us around things like silicon photonics and Omni-Path fabric and all. All of those are growing at or above what we had forecasted and doing quite well. And as Stacy said, across each of those, our ASPs are both increasing. And if you take a look at that, even if you go down like to like an Atom server, the Atom-based server, yes, their ASPs are lower, but the margins are still quite healthy down there because their costs are quite a bit lower. So that -- you got to keep all of that into perspective as you look at the mix that goes across these. What happened this quarter is we had anticipated the enterprise to go from that low single-digit decline to roughly flat, and it just hasn't -- the enterprise market hasn't shored up there yet. We're working on tactics to shore that up over the next couple of quarters, and we're still very convinced on the long-term path of -- that those growth areas that we described are going to be what drives the Data Center.",270

So enterprise is, like you said, disappointing this quarter. But I mean, let's be honest. Enterprise has been in decline for years. Why would it stabilize? Why would it start growing? Why is the -- I know we've probably talked about this before. Why isn't the cloud growth that we're seeing -- in the enterprise weakness indicative of that cloud growth? I just -- I don't understand why we should expect that business to ever turn around. Can you give us some color on that?",100
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3726.0,1057062.0,44289279.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,16,"Sure. I think there's 2 parts to this. Certainly, a certain amount of the enterprise weakness, right, that has occurred over the last few years is certainly driven by movements of those enterprise applications to the cloud. And we're very comfortable. It doesn't really matter for us from a product definition or product performance standpoint, whether it goes -- those applications go to the cloud or whether they stay in the enterprise. That said, there's several enterprises that we are in talks with that all want to grow their own private clouds, and they're really looking at how best to do that, when do they do that. So I think it's more the customer feedback we're getting that gives us some confidence that the enterprise side with their own private clouds will continue to see some improvement. It's not going to be a growth area though, so don't take this as I'm saying, Stacy, that this is going to be our growth segment. What we're saying is given what we're seeing from customers, we should see some level of stabilization or less of a decline. Didn't show up this quarter. We'll have to take a look at that as we move through into '17.",204

So first question is again staying on the Data Center theme. Can you quantify the enterprise mix in DCG now? And is that required to be flat in order to maintain the double-digit growth in DCG? Or can it actually start growing double digit if the growth in other areas remains at this current pace just because of the mix effect?",74
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3726.0,1057062.0,44289283.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,20,"So let me take a shot at the quantification question. And again, I think we'll -- Brian talked about this bullishness on the long term for the Data Center, but we'll hold off on specific CAGRs and 2017 forecasts to both earnings and then the investor meeting. On the -- I think you're referring back to what I showed a year ago, which was the size of the enterprise versus the size of the data center for the -- or size of the cloud for the server segment of DCG and that we were heading towards a crossover between those. Again, we'll update that explicitly come February. But based on what we've seen this year with really robust growth still occurring in the cloud, so again, this quarter, over 30% and a weaker-than-expected enterprise, I think that crossover point pulls in. And then I think you have a phenomenon that says the cloud portion of the enterprise becomes so big and continues to grow at a fast pace that we can certainly maintain a robust growth rate even if the enterprise segment is not growing to slightly weak.",188

And as my follow-up, a longer-term question. I think there's a debate in the industry that computation is becoming more parallel with this growth in deep learning and machine learning, which benefits products like GPUs more than CPUs. I'm wondering, would you agree with that? And do you think this parallel computing market is incremental or cannibalistic for Intel?",61
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3726.0,1057062.0,44289285.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,22,"Sure. So first, the -- to your first question, I 100% agree with what Stacy said, and I expect that these growing segments, that's why we focus on them so much and will be the dominant as we move out into the later parts of this decade. Your question on accelerators, really, is what you're asking when you talk of -- take a look at GPUs and things like deep learning. The first thing you have to separate out is things like are you talking about the deep learning on the learning portion or the scoring portion. And so we don't look at accelerators as cannibalistic because you still have to have a Xeon system with those when you go to actually do the implementation of the deep learning application. The second thing we'd tell you is that we actually had worked over the last 2 years or so to really implement a much broader collection of accelerators when you think about these. And if you want to think about kind of the rates of performance of each one of these, you have FPGAs, which are accelerators, and we see those accelerators go into everything from networking devices to machine learning applications. Those have high levels of flexibility that can be programmed on the fly but maybe not quite the performance. Then, you have GPUs. GPUs do have, as you say, good accelerating performance in certain linear algorithms. Those are quite good, and we have our Xeon Phi in that space. And then the highest performance area are ASICs, where they're very workload specific and designed around the algorithms specifically, and you saw our applications of Nervana. We also did an acquisition of Movidius earlier this quarter. Those are all very specific workloads around machine learning that are ASIC driven and even give higher performance. So we look at those accelerators as being enhancing this growth. You sell a Xeon typically with that, so it doesn't cannibalize the business. And we believe we have the widest, really, offerings of these accelerators from FPGAs through the Xeon Phi and into ASIC-driven devices.",351

That's a good question. So typically on the shape of start-up costs, you would expect that 10-nanometer costs go up in the back half of this year as you're seeing. They stay high into the first 2 to 3 quarters of next year, and then they start to fall off in the back half of next year. So I'll just stick with that for now and then leave it to Bob to show you the kind of start-up cost trends as he thinks that, that's important. On the memory costs, what you're seeing is really 2 impacts. One is the start-up cost associated with Dalian and -- or China factory for memory and then some of the first wafers coming out for 3D NAND and 3D XPoint. And I'd expect that, that starts to get better into next year. Hard to pick the quarter but it should become a tailwind as we get kind of into 2017.",162

As my follow-up, I have a question on CapEx as well. Based on your annual guide, I think the implied Q4 number is close to $3.5 billion, which is clearly a pretty big number. Should we take this as a new normal for Intel? Or is this a one-off quarter where you're spending aggressively in both the core business and in memory and that the quarterly run rate going forward should revert to somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range?",84

I think if you go back to the guide that, I think we probably talked about it sometime prior April, that I pointed to Q4 as probably being a pretty high CapEx quarter. And it's the combination of where we're at in purchasing the first production set for 10-nanometer and where we're at with the memory factory in China. So I think you're seeing some lumpiness here. I wouldn't run rate that out.",74

I mean, just having managed CapEx in this company for years, you really have to take a look at our annual guidance because, literally, what's in the quarter end -- quarter-to-quarter, tools will push out. We'll try and always be more efficient, and/or you'll have these kinds of onetime kind of upsides as things combine -- come together. So we expect our annualized run rate for this year to be the $9.5 billion or so that we forecasted and don't expect that quarterly run rate to be indicative of Q4.",94

It's going to be a little bit more difficult to kind of track because of CCG, including the mobile. And if you kind of look at the volume growth in the September quarter, it was clearly above normal seasonal trends for the Core PC business. So how much below seasonal do you think PCs will be in the calendar fourth quarter? And how are you guys thinking about sort of the inventory channel management in Q4?",94

I'd say from an end market standpoint, it's pretty seasonal. And then from our business, the -- it's the impact that Brian and I both talked about, which is we saw some strengthening of demand in the third quarter. We saw some refilling of the pipeline, which was kind of lean coming in. And then in Q4, we're expecting kind of seasonal in demand but some depletion of inventory pipeline. And it doesn't take much. If you think about the size of the PC market, you're down to changes in inventory levels across worldwide PC supply chain that are measured in days or certainly less than a week of inventory that kind of shifts around.",116

And then, guys, maybe as my follow-up, all year long, you guys have sort of been giving what's turned out to be conservative gross margin guidance by quarter. You've been beating that guidance, in part, this quarter helped by all the PC volume. But I'm just kind of curious. As you look at the calendar fourth quarter, I guess, I understand the headwinds coming from memory and 10-nanometer startups. But what about some of the tailwinds from 14-nanometer? I mean, you're kind of going into a period now where you're reaching mature yields in PCs on 14. You should start to be reaching mature yields on servers for 14. How much of a tailwind is that? And are we looking at another quarter of conservative guide on the gross margin line?",133

I highlighted for you the 2 big items from Q3 to Q4, which are the things that are worth a point, and it's, as stated, the increase in 10-nanometer start-up costs and what we see going on in the memory business for the elements that I saw. Yes, I think we'll see some slight benefit associated with 14-nanometer. I also think we'll be down a little bit in terms of PC volume, but those are all relatively small impacts to the gross margin forecast.",107

That's a great question. So yes, you -- and we published what we saw happen in notebook and desktop ASPs. The piece that's missing is relatively small, but it has a fairly big impact on the averages that within the phone and tablets products, we saw relatively less volume in Q4, so we got -- or Q3, sorry, we got some mix effect and that ASP is up dramatically on a year-on-year basis as a result of the abatement of the contra revenue program. So that's the missing piece you need to get to the overall platform ASP math.",100

I guess, as a follow-up switching over to the OpEx side of things. Stacy, in your script you mentioned about the OpEx to revenue improving by about 1 point this year year-over-year and then again another point next year.

So let me just -- let me take you all the way back to -- because I think this gets very confusing because we obviously had the restructuring program in place. We now have the spinout -- or the divestiture, excuse me, of the Intel Security business. The timing of those things will play out differently over the course of next year, so I just thought it was best to clean all of this up and give you one metric for the year that summarizes everything. And so starting with restructuring. It's on track. When you look at the savings that we've already generated this year, really, the only adjustment to the spending guide that we've made when we started restructuring is the fact that profits and revenue is up, and we have some profit and revenue-dependent spending. But you can kind of see we're, over 3 quarters, saving on the order of $700 million. You can think of that as an annualized run rate of a little north of $1 billion of savings that then rolls into next year. Then, we'll get some incremental savings. We throw McAfee into the mix here, and we're going to make some reinvestments as we talked about in some of the areas that are important. Think of Data Center and IoT and memory. And so when you add all that up, it just gives you an all-in number that captures the full calendar 2017. What we're expecting is that from the starting point of 2015 we're down about 1 point in 2016, and then we should be down on the order of another point next year in 2017 with all of this all in, the restructuring, McAfee and the reinvestment. I hope that helped.",298

We had some indications from some of our partners that there was some inventory building tied to various SKUs. And we're also watching the sell-through as it goes all the way through the OEMs and out into the retail sectors. So it's never a guess on our part. It's always some combination of that dataset that is what the OEMs tell us, what we see in retail and our discussions with retail and even just our own -- we go out and collect that data in the retail space of what people are doing, how -- what's the, basically, population density in a place like Best Buy, how many people are out there buying PCs versus something else in the store. We compile all that data to get that forecasted. Like Stacy said, we're not talking about a major shift in the inventory. We're talking about a couple of days. But a couple of days, when you ship 1 million units a day, is a big number when you take a look at the ASPs in 1 million units a day. So it doesn't take a big swing. We're not talking weeks here.

The -- what we saw is a reduction in CPU inventory in the third quarter and even within that, a pretty sizable reduction in first-generation 14-nanometer products being replaced by second-generation 14-nanometer products. So that played out as expected. And then we saw some increases in other areas in inventory, kind of non-CPU areas. And then we're still on track.

We tried to talk about the numbers in the preview at the start of just showing you by segment there cloud, telco, networking and storage and then the adjacencies. They all grew at or above our forecast. Those are still, as we talked about earlier in one of the questions, growing in a percentage of our overall Data Center business, so they weren't quite enough to offset the 3 percentage decline in the enterprise side. But absolutely, that was the story for the quarter. We're quite happy, and I think our thesis of what continues to drive their growth is holding. When we go out and talk to our partners and customers about what's driving cloud growth, what's going to drive the networking and storage requirements out in time, we start to look at devices like autonomous cars and the IoT network in general. All of those things are driving large requirements into those data centers in those growth segments. And so that's what gives us the comfort that, yes, this will continue.

Absolutely, first, as we said and I think, Stacy said a couple of minutes ago as well, at our Dalian, China factory, we are now running wafers. The yields are quite good. They're as good as our existing factories. So you'll see that factory now ramp through the first half roughly of next year. And as -- most of that spending will occur in that same time frame as far as adding the equipment to facilitate that ramp. And from there, then, it's just purely just running the volume and continuing to grow in that space. That's primarily 3D NAND, and again, we believe we have cost performance that is quite good relative to the rest of the market. With the 3D XPoint, we are in the process of shipping samples now to customers by the -- as we go through this quarter, we'll ship thousands of samples to customers. We're targeting to start -- or to finish qualification at the end of this quarter, and that ramp really starts -- it's really a 2018 ramp for that product. So you'll see it again, the revenue, and hence, the costs go down on 3D XPoint as we go into next year as well.",218

Let me -- I'll hit on the margin. But I do want to do a shout-out to the China factory team. I was just out there, and Brian was being a little humble. The yields on their first production material matched the yields on the mature production facility, which is a phenomenal result for a factory. So they're doing quite well. In terms of the overall margin, if you look at -- let's just focus on Q3. What we saw in Q3 is an improvement in the underlying NAND business being offset by increased start-up costs associated with Dalian in China and some increased costs associated with 3D XPoint. As Brian said, when we get into the first of half next year, those products are ramping, and so we should start to see pretty significant improvements in the overall P&L because that headwind, if you will, goes away. And we have a very competitive, very cost competitive product line that we're selling in the marketplace.",166

I think I had my years off. So on the 3D XPoint, it'll be qualified at the end of this quarter. We're shipping thousands of samples to customers -- we're shipping samples already. We'll ship thousands through this quarter, and it ramps in 2017. I think I said by mistake 2018. I'm sorry. I'm just -- too many years that we're talking through here.

I mean, if you take a look at Broadwell, the Broadwell platform, the performance is quite good. What we find is that each one of these generations, as long as you stay on this cost performance curve, people are willing to go buy those, that are running these cloud platforms, quite quickly. And so the -- we're seeing demand for Broadwell from the cloud service providers, from the networking and telco side and quite strong. So we don't think we see -- if we're going to see performance-based cannibalization, you'd see it in those real high-level performance sectors first, actually, I would think. So we don't see that. The -- on the Purley platform, we are actually starting to sample those products already to some of the leading-edge customers. And they're seeing not only just an overall TCO performance advantage that we typically see with each one of these, but this also continues our integration of things like the Omni-Path fabric. It has more integration of the silicon photonics, so it's those adjacency functions that are quite strong as you -- and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these. There'll be a second generation of Purley that includes 3D XPoint. It allows pooling of memory, and then there'll be future ones that allow additional pooling of things like FPGA. So each one of these now adds some additional features across the rack that really helps in the overall system performance.",255

I -- So first the -- [indiscernible] outgoing [indiscernible]. It's ASP. It all flows through. Firstly, I do want to recognize that our OEM partners are putting out some great products. And I think you're going to have to take a look at this and really ask. That's a pretty interesting scenario, and I'm very hesitant to this. But typically, Stacy's right. If ASPs go up across the board at the system level, it tends to float all boats. So our OEM partners would see an increase. We'd see an increase. The other partners within that infrastructure would see it. We really more think of our pricing though as value based. So as we bring out new products and bring out new features, we make sure that the value-based pricing is there and that people are either getting more value for the same price or quite a bit more for a slightly increased price. So I think it's -- that's such a unique scenario, is that just over across the board all of a sudden, 1 day, prices go up? Actually, we wouldn't necessarily flow through that ASP to our end partners because we didn't necessarily drive that from -- on the new features. If it happens with our 10-nanometer launch and it's because of features, then we do add those. So we do it based on what value we provide to the end user and our OEM partners.",240

We don't raise our pricing, but the way you articulate this, if it's a bunch of high-end notebook, ultra-thin, thin and light, we would see a mixing up of our overall demand. And in fact, it is one of the phenomenons that we've been seeing. I think we've done a good job of creating a differentiated product line. And this quarter, we saw great sales of i7s and notebooks. And so it's consistent with what you're seeing in your channels.",98

You continue to see -- we put out the case SKU of 12-core monster, and we wonder how many people are going to buy it, and we find we're sold out. Yes. So I think that's an example where ""our ASPs"" go up, but it's really a mix function. But otherwise, it's going to be -- we always just do pricing based on value and features that we bring.",81

So can you rightsize us sort of on what enterprise will be as a percentage of DCG just in the fourth quarter?",55

And I think I did a stab at this earlier, but let me just reiterate what I said. And to be clear, I was talking CPUs, enterprise server CPUs. And so if you take the slides that I showed back a year ago, we've seen robust growth rates in the cloud. We've seen less-than-expected growth rates in the enterprise, so if anything, we've pulled in those crossover points. Beyond that, we haven't given a new percentage, and that would be something that we would logically talk about when we give the longer-term perspective to the market in this coming February investor meeting.",107

And then I want to ask a question on the mobile losses. I know that you don't break out MCG anymore, but I think I asked you last call about feeling good about this $800 million improvement in losses this year. So I guess, that'll get you to roughly a loss of 2.2 to 2.3 in the former MCG. Can you talk in light of the iPhone win? Can you talk maybe how you think about the degree to which you could get further improvement in that number next year?",93

So first off, let me just say, as is our standard practice, we don't talk about our customer, what technology they use inside their products in this space. So I'm not going to confirm or anything on a particular win. But I'll take you back to the mobile loss here. So as you got right, we no longer have a mobile segment. We haven't for a while. We had articulated that in 2015 we expected to improve the loss by $800 million. We actually ended up closer to $1 billion. We said, hey, based on everything we know, what's going on with contra revenue and investments and margin improvements and all of that, that we'd expect something on the order of an $800 million improvement in '16. Everything I know from there would say we're on track or exceeding that just because we know that as we've gone through our restructuring, we've made some further disinvestments. We've -- as you just heard earlier, our volume's a little lower. Our contra revenue's looking a little lower. The product margins all look good. So I'm not seeing anything that would say it's smaller. If anything, it's going to be bigger in terms of the overall savings. And I do just want to reiterate, it's impossible for us to detangle it going forward. So where you really see this is in the CCG operating results, and as we started this call, they had phenomenal operating margins this quarter. And everything went right. They had revenue growth. They saw unit costs coming down. They're making, I think, prudent disinvestment decisions. When you add all that up, they become a real kind of cash and profit driver for the company.",286

Can you just talk about the sustainability of the double digits year-over-year growth trends and the sustainability of that 20% plus operating margins on a go-forward basis? I know you mentioned broad-based strength across the verticals. Maybe can you just also talk about some of the product segments that are powering this growth?",65

So I'm trying to make sure I really think about what question you're asking. From a -- can we sustain the double-digit growth? We absolutely believe that we can, and we've tested that with our -- the deals that we see on the plate going forward. So we've kind of forward tested that. And we've looked at our product road maps and what we're bringing out. And we've got products like Atlas Peak and Atlas Peak II that are coming or Broxton-based products that are quite strong and quite capable in this segment and priced and designed right for that. The segments are going to continue to believe -- be, we believe, the video analytics segment that continues to go well. There are other segments in the industrial segment that we believe will continue to grow on machine automation, machine -- factory automation. Think of it as factory automation. The retail segment will continue to be an area where it continues to grow and then automotive. And you saw us make deals, for example, this quarter with BMW on autonomous driving, which is a little further out, but that's just an example. You'll also see products from Land Rover and a variety of other OEMs that are a mix of everything from autonomous driving programs to in-vehicle infotainment-type systems. And those systems are quite -- we're thinking of them more and more as servers on wheels as you start looking at all of the adjacencies, too. They're needing connectivity. They're needing storage. They're needing silicon photonics for moving the infotainment, basically the graphics video around the system. They use FPGAs for accelerators like we talked about earlier. So when we look across those segments and we test it out, we do believe we can continue that. Those are also high compute areas, and it's what gives us the confidence in the margin functions as well. They tend to reuse a lot of our intellectual property from the PC segment and carry that down over into it, right? That's one of the real strengths of Intel's integrated device manufacturing kind of business model. And so the amount of investment required to bring those to market are less than if you start from scratch and that's your only product. And so that's what gives us the confidence in the margin space as well.",393

Looks like you guys are continuing to drive the road maps. I noticed that your next-generation platform, the 7480, was just qualified at AT&T just this month. This was actually about the same time last year that you guys qualified the 7360 at AT&T. So now that it's qualified, can you just help us understand when should we expect 7480 to show up in mobile devices? Would this be 2017? And any other color you can provide us in terms of other global carriers that you've qualified this new chipset with?",109

So I think you really want to think the modem space as really an annual cadence. And I think that's what it's taking us a while to get to, is to get to that annual pace. But we really believe we're on a cliff now. And as you said, the 7480 is now qualified. As you said, it's qualified at AT&T. We typically go, then, out and around the world, so you'll see it at many of the same places that the 7360 got qualified in Europe, in China, other parts of Southeast Asia. So those will be ongoing now. And you should just think about where we're really targeting modem technology advancements on an annual basis. And typically, you're right. They get qualified in the third and fourth quarter of the year before. And then customers start to roll out those devices typically more towards the second half of the following year. So you should see these things start to show up in devices in the second half of 2017. And you should just think about that from this business from here on. We should come out with another series next year at this time with a 2018 kind of target. And that's really our business model for the modems moving forward.",214
