21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 13, 2011",2011-01-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3157.0,91777.0,6444034.0,Presenter Speech,Paul Otellini,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Kevin. Our fourth quarter results represent the third consecutive record quarter for the company, and bring to a strong close the best year in Intel's history. Revenue was up 24% for the year, and we crossed over the $40 billion mark for the first time ever. We exceeded previous records for gross margins, operating income and earnings per share, as well. 
The PC market grew approximately 17% worldwide in 2010. Not only is the market expanding but our customers and end users are embracing our performance leadership and purchasing a richer mix of our products, which led to a rise in our ASP in 2010. One of the notable standout performances in the fourth quarter was our Data Center Group. The world of PCs, plus new emerging computing devices, is increasing the demand for servers of all types. Our Data Center Group had yet another terrific quarter, with revenue up 15% sequentially and annual revenue up a very strong 35%. 
So what is driving this growth in servers and will it continue? Let me share with you some data that can help put the server market in perspective. In 2010, total traffic crossing the Internet was roughly 245 exabytes. This is greater than all the previous years combined. Over the next five years, 1 billion more people will join the global online community with 15 billion new connected devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, embedded devices and smart TVs. We estimate this will increase the data footprint across the Internet to over 1,000 exabytes. 
More people, more devices, more usages. This dynamic will require high-performing servers from Intel for years to come. And it's not just servers. Intel continues to grow its presence in the data center, with processors for storage systems and networking infrastructure. With plans to refresh the entire Xeon server product line in the first half of 2011, Intel is very well positioned to benefit from the growth of the Data Center and the build-out of cloud computing. 
Next, I want to comment on our Atom business. The industry shipped around 37 million netbook units for the year, which represents a 20% growth rate. In 2011, Intel plans to bring some unique innovation to netbooks to keep the category growing, including increased feature sets in products for mature markets and lower price points in emerging markets that will attract first-time buyers. 
But Atom is much more than netbooks. We exit 2010 with excellent momentum in our Embedded business with over 4,900 total design engagements and over 1,700 design wins for Embedded Atom devices. It's notable that nearly 1/2 of all of the Atom-embedded design win activity is coming from China. I mentioned this momentum to highlight that the main drivers of our success was Atom in the Embedded business segment, are very applicable to the smartphone, tablet and consumer electronic market segments. 
Software compatibility, performance, power and architectural consistency really matter to our customers, and the success we are having with Atom in the Embedded segment is an excellent proof point of our value proposition. Many of the wins in this space are architectural conversions against ARM and MIPS. 
In 2011, you will also see Atom in a wide array of tablets, running three different operating systems: Windows, Android and MeeGo. Seven of these tablets have been announced by their manufacturers, with many more in the pipeline for rollout this year. In 2011, you will also see Atom processors appear in smartphones, operating at very competitive power levels, with performance that will lead the industry, demonstrating Intel's advantages in this most important category. 
Let me turn my focus for a minute to what's ahead. In 2011, everything gets better. The economy is forecasted to improve, our product line refreshes from top to bottom and our addressable market expands. With the PC industry now shipping over 1 million units a day, we enter 2011 by launching the best microprocessor we have ever built. As you are all aware, we introduced our Sandy Bridge processor family at CES last week. We think this ultimately will be as transformational to PCs as Nehalem has been to servers. With over 500 design wins, our customers are embracing this product. When you get your hands on the Sandy Bridge PC, you will realize that this is more than just a very fast microprocessor. It's a visually stunning computing experience. 
The combination of an improving economy and the best product lineup in our history gives us confidence that we can grow our revenues by approximately 20% in 2011, and this forecast is before any contributions from the proposed acquisitions of the Infineon Wireless Solutions division and McAfee. As we approach our 22-nanometer transition, we are increasing our investments in manufacturing to capture what we believe is a significant opportunity for growth. Stacy will walk you through more details in just a moment, but in short, the market opportunities for our 22-nanometer products are outstanding. 
As a result, we're growing from a model of three high-volume, leading-edge manufacturing fabs to four. Our 22-nanometer process will be the foundation for growing PC and server segments, as well as a broad family of Atom-based SoCs, serving smartphones, tablets, smart TVs and other embedded devices. 
Many of you have asked these questions about how we will compete with ARM in the new segments of mobile computing. Our answer is very simple. As we have done for decades in the traditional computing markets, we will apply the world's most advanced silicon transistor technology to these new segments to deliver the lowest power, highest performance, lowest cost products on the planet. When these chips are combined with our support for the world's leading mobile operating systems, our proven ability to create broad ecosystem support and our growing software capabilities, I'm confident we will be very successful in these segments. 
These investments are the strongest possible statement of our confidence in our business model and our growth opportunities, and we'll extend our technology advantage even further. With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.",1005
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 13, 2011",2011-01-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3157.0,91777.0,6444035.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Paul. I just want to clarify one thing really quick, that we're all getting used to saying 2011 over 2010. Paul meant 10% revenue growth in 2011 over 2010, is the expectation that we're setting. So 2010 was the most profitable year in our history. As the trends we discussed at the investor meeting played out, the emerging markets, notebooks and server demand all exceeded 20% growth year-on-year. The consumer market, despite a midsummer pause driven by the European debt crisis, still grew at a mid-teens growth rate. All of these demand drivers led to an $8.5 billion increase in revenue to $43.6 billion, up 24% year-on-year and our best year ever. 
Our manufacturing process technology lead extended in 2010, enabling a next generation of leadership products, which drove higher average selling prices year-on-year. A continued focus on factory reuse and efficiency drove costs down again in 2010, lifting gross margin to a record 66%. A noteworthy achievement is that as a result of the combination of our responsiveness to the downturn and our focus on factory productivity, we are able to offset almost half of the required capital investment at 32 nanometer through reuse of equipment. 
Spending as a percent of revenue dropped year-on-year to 29.5%. We also saw significant improvements in our NAND business. All of these things contributed to making 2010 our most profitable year ever. While revenue, gross margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share were all records, two metrics worth highlighting are that we achieved operating income of $15.9 billion, 32% higher than the next highest year and our best-ever revenue per employee of $529,000. 
The fourth quarter was in line with our expectations and was a good finish to an outstanding year. We achieved record quarterly revenue of $11.5 billion despite continued softness in the Consumer Market segment. Demand was strong in the Enterprise market, specifically for servers. The quarterly gross margin of 67.5% benefited from both lower inventory write-offs, as we qualified the Sandy Bridge product line for sale and slightly higher average selling prices due to a richer mix of server products. Operating income was $4.3 billion, 38% of revenue. Net income of $3.4 billion and earnings per share of $0.59 were both records. 
The strength of our business can be seen in the balance sheet. Total cash investments ended the year at $21.5 billion, $1.2 billion higher than the third quarter and $7.6 billion higher than the end of 2009. For the year, we generated approximately $16.7 billion in cash from operations. We purchased $5.2 billion in capital assets, paid $3.5 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. We returned over $5 billion of cash to shareholders in 2010. For the year, we increased the dividend by 12.5% and resumed stock repurchases in the fourth quarter. We also announced an incremental 15% increase in the dividend that will go into effect in 2011. 
Turning to 2011, we are planning on continued growth in our core businesses, resulting in approximately 10% revenue growth. We are forecasting continued strong gross margins, with the midpoint of our annual range at 65%. In support of expected strong unit growth in our core businesses and the movement of graphics transistors to our leading-edge process technology, we are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $9 billion, as we build and equip an incremental high-volume manufacturing factory at 22-nanometer. We are also forecasting an increase of over $700 million in research and development investments, as we look to extend our leadership in PCs and servers and design further generations of products to increase our offerings in adjacent market segments like smartphones and tablets. 
2010 reinforced our view that the demand drivers that we talked about in May, emerging markets, notebooks, consumers and servers translate into significant revenue growth for Intel, and that the work that we have done on our cost structure translates into exceptional financial results. As we move into 2011, we are planning for an even better year. As we start the year, the product line in our core business is outstanding as Sandy Bridge ramps into the marketplace. Our cost will come down even more in 2011. Our manufacturing advantage will continue to extend, which coupled with our roadmap of low-power products, will expand our participation in fast-growing segments of the market for devices that compute and connect to the Internet. With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.",742

They should both run the same operating system, the same interfaces, the same access to the marketplace applications and so forth. And our value proposition is really two-fold for the OEMs: One, we believe that we will offer higher performance in comparable battery life configurations; and number two, by designing an Atom-based tablet, they have the opportunity to run multiple OSs on it, which is, I think a unique value proposition with Intel at this point.",86

I probably won't get to that level of specificity. I'll go back to we said at the investor meeting in May. The drivers of our business right now are emerging markets, it's the Consumer segment of the market, and then we're seeing a build-out of that cloud infrastructure, which is driving our server results. And I really highlight the emerging market piece of this because if I just look at the business, it's 2:1 in terms of unit growth coming from emerging markets versus mature as we think out over the next several years. And the dynamics that's going on there, it's a simple one of economics from my perspective. The price of technology has come down to the point that billions more people can afford that technology and that's highly desirable. And if I may, I'll use China as the example. If you go back to the mid-‘90s, it was, on average, 175 weeks of income for somebody to be able to afford a notebook computer. If you fast forward to 2010, it's now seven weeks of income in China on average for somebody to afford a computer. So you have 1.4 billion people that where the price of computing is coming into a range that is affordable, and it's a big deal to them because it's how they move into the knowledge-based economy. And so that, I think, is the big driver of our business, it has been the last few years, it’s likely to be over the next several years.",254

This is not -- unlike bringing up Sandy Bridge, where you’ve got an installed base of PC software, right, that's just ready and able to take advantage of it.

So from a launch perspective, the ones that have been -- I'm not going to give you launch dates, but the ones that have been announced so far are on Windows 7 and on Android.

I'll take that one, and there's some feedback on the line so maybe people should move the phones away if possible. Let me first talk about what's driving the increase in capital, and then I'll end with a few words on capital intensity, if you'll allow that, Shawn. The primary driver of what's taking us from a three factory model, three high-volume manufacturing model to a four high-volume manufacturing model is the unit growth that we've experienced over the last couple of years and that we expect going forward. I think you can really see how our business is growing when you look at what's happened over the last couple of years. In 2010 and with our forecast for 2011, we're growing our revenues by $13 billion. That's more than a 1/3 growth versus where we were in 2008, where we were in 2009. And so you can see, that business growth is the primary driver of what's taking us into a four factory model. But behind that, what you're seeing is that we're very aggressive of moving transistors to that leading-edge process technology, and we do that because we get paid for that process technology leadership. We get paid in terms of having lower costs and, what was really striking in 2010 as we've started the transition of graphics processors to that leading edge, we got paid in terms of a rising ASP because of the performance of the products. And so, there's a very high ROI for us that we're uniquely situated to take advantage of because of our process technology leadership. And those two things in conjunction take us from a three to a four factory network.",283

What's your view on it? And how, I guess, what your response is?",38

And I can see positives and negatives for Intel in this announcement. Historically, Microsoft has only supported ARM in their phone OS and in their consumer electronics OS. So they've had ARM support for some time, and in fact in big Windows they've had support for, gosh, Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS, and at one point ARM on the Vista program that they dropped. So this is nothing really new from that perspective. The plus for Intel is that as they unify their operating systems, we now have the ability for the first time, one, to have a design from scratch touch-enabled operating system for tablets that runs on Intel that we don't have today. And secondly, we have the ability to put our lowest-power Intel processors running Windows 8 or with Next Generation Windows into phones, because it's the same OS stack. And I look at that as an upside opportunity for us. On the downside, there is the potential, given that Office runs on these products, for -- there's some creep-up coming into, let's say, PC space. I am skeptical of that for two reasons: One, that space has a different set of power performance requirements where Intel is exceptionally good; and secondly, users of those machines expect legacy support in terms of software and peripherals that has to all be enabled from scratch for those devices.",240

You let me off the hook a little bit too early there in terms of the increase in capital when you look at 32 versus 22, so I also want to put that in perspective. It was in my written remarks but I want to make sure it's clear. One of the benefits that we had at 32 nanometer was that as the downturn hit us, we were able to very quickly take capacity that we had put in place for 45 nanometer. So factories that we have put in place in 45 nanometer, and to upgrade those to offset some of the required investment at 32. I think that was a level of responsiveness that you haven't seen out of Intel in the past. We take advantage of the fact that we build in that backwards compatibility in our capital model of record. And we were actually able to offset half of the capital required at 32 by utilizing investment that we'd already made in factories for 45 nanometer. What that means is at 32, we got, in essence, three factories for the capital cost of two. And then it's the unit demand and the movement of transistors to the leading-edge process technology that then takes us from three to four. That helps you put in perspective the size of that jump as you go from the 32 nanometer node to the 22 nanometer node.",243

This is Stacy. The 2011 capital spending of $9 billion is -- the dollars are really being driven by the server and PC business. That's what's driving the increase in the unit cager, those are big die. Remember that products that we have in smartphones, the products that we haven in tablets, by design, are very small die. It doesn't drive a big capital spend for us. Don't take from that, though, that it's not important to get those products to 22 nanometer. That process leadership is what lets us bring down the cost, bring down the power and provide more performance at any given level of power, so it's strategically really important but it's not the driver of the $9 billion of capital in 2011.",131

You'd still get to the same question which is, that would suggest ASPs come down a little bit in 2011 to kind of make that revenue number work. I'll be the first to admit, this is the place where I've been wrong over the course of 2010. I did not anticipate ASPs going up to the extent that they had. The company has surprised me positively, the ability to extend the technology leadership over the competition and get paid for that leadership. That said, my thesis on the market is that the areas where we see robust growth, so remember what I said, emerging markets 2:1 over mature, the consumer market 2:1 over the business market. Those areas benefit from the standpoint that system price points come down over time, and we get a little bit of a mix down, and so I believe that we're going to see, just based on that mix effect, pricing coming down over time. I'll also say it's one of those places where I'd love to be wrong. The company's working hard to try to prove me wrong but inherent in my forecast is that pricing comes down some based on growth in consumer and growth in emerging markets in 2011, and I think that trend is the one I'm betting on for the next several years.",248

It's hard to put a number on it. My sense is given that the corporate refresh started not on the first day of last year, is that we're not halfway yet. There's a whole bunch of people that have not upgraded to Windows 7 and that intend to, and I do think that Sandy Bridge, there may be some momentum built up ahead of that in terms of people wanting those products. Remember, the IT version, Service Pack 1 version of Win7, wasn't released until, I don't know, mid last year or September, August-September time frame. So you really have the tailing edge of the IT shops, the ones that wait for SP1 still to go. So I'm still -- implicit in our numbers when I gave low to mid-teens is a pretty robust corporate refresh cycle continuing in 2011. In terms of client parts of the business next year, or this year rather, I think Stacy nailed it. The stuff -- we look for consumers and particularly in emerging markets continuing to be the driver of that part of the business, in notebooks rather.",188

And while that still is a relatively small percentage of the total of our server business, it's growing exceptionally fast, and I was surprised that it generated 1/3 of the unit growth in servers from 2009 to 2010. And that's a trend that, I think, carries forward into the future. The information moves to the cloud, all these devices compute and connect. I think that continues to drive server results for a number of years.",123

In the fourth quarter, chipset for your client business was down 4% sequentially. Can you talk about what you saw there?

I think it was as simple as what we said at the beginning. The quarter actually unfolded very much like we expected, which is nice when that happens. We saw people bleeding off some of the older-generation technology from an inventory standpoint, which impacted our sales. That's why we are below seasonal, that's why chipsets were below seasonal. I think one of the things you have to think through is as the world moves to notebook, that the chipset is a leading indicator, thesis no longer exists. You don't have nearly as large a market anymore where people are populating a motherboard with a chipset and everything else and waiting for a CPU. It's all happening in Taiwan, and it's being integrated commensurate with each other. And so it's not the leading indicator that we believed in the ‘90s.",140

I can tell you that over the course of the year, one of the reasons that we did increasingly well on Data Center was the shift to MP, the MP products we're shipping. And that includes those Internet Data Center deployments as Stacy was just talking about. Most of the big portals used four-way machines, running six cores now going to eight cores this year. So they’re about the most powerful compute-intensive consumers we have on the planet. And so going into 2011, I think that's still a driver. I think that the Nehalem value proposition is still very critical for, let me say, classic data centers, enterprise data centers who still haven't finished anywhere near swapping out all the old systems. And the same kind of ROI that we saw work in 2010 will apply in 2011 for those companies.",151

In fact, at CES, I said that in 2011, Sandy Bridge alone would represent over 30% of Intel's corporate revenues. So we're very, very confident of the product and its acceptance. The biggest thing for us is sell-up inside the Sandy Bridge family because as we had said, it will populate Sandy Bridge across multiple price points over the course of the year, but will maintain some of the premium feature sets like the Intel Insider for high-value content that we announced at CES, we'll maintain those at the Core i5 and i7 brands. So we'll do sell-up in those over the course of the year. And that will be the focus versus, can the OEMs shave a bit off the bill of materials? They will certainly do that but as everybody does that, that just brings the pricing to equilibrium.",167

I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of feeling on where you might see the most volatility in terms of those drivers?

We're forecasting 65% for 2011. As is pretty predictable because we're on a two-year cadence of process technology, 2011 is the year where we're going to see elevated startup costs. So that takes me down about three points of gross margin. And then as my unit costs come down and my CPUs and chipsets, my platform business, that gets back about a point of gross margin. And then I'm expecting higher revenue in my platform businesses and that's worth another point of gross margin, that's how I get to a point down. In terms of volatility, the startup costs are pretty predictable. The thing that got me in 2010 was ASP. And based on where we're seeing growth in which segments, I could be off on the ASP; based on the competitive dynamics, I could be off on ASP. So that tends to be the thing that is most volatile. And then behind that is business levels. If business is robust and we're running factories, it's beneficial to gross margin; if we have an economic shock that causes demand to fall, we'll see a decline in gross margins. So those two things are likely the things that cause some volatility to gross margin as we go forward.",232

Remember a year ago, we had a problem in the fourth quarter of '09, where people bought ahead on chips from Intel, netbook chips from Intel, and sales slowed down in the first quarter. So there was an anomaly. So what I talked about in my commentary was the consumption of netbooks that we believe was 20% year-over-year, and actually was probably up a bit in the fourth quarter as it is the seasonally strongest quarter for netbooks, and even devices like tablets. That's when people buy them as Christmas presents. So if you’re looking into next year, what we forecast and project is yet another year of growth in netbooks.",124

So first, I think your math is correct, right? Gross margin comes down a point, we offset some of that. I expect to get a little bit better in terms of spending as a percent of revenue but it doesn't offset that full point. That said, the operating margin is at historically high levels. I mean, we're running a gross margin that's in the mid-60s. And our spending as a percent of revenue, as we've communicated our strategy of driving efficiency, continues to improve. But we are making significant investments in 2011, and they're investments that are really important to us. If you look under the covers of the increase in spending from 2010 to 2011, it's predominantly R&D. That R&D is split between investments in our Core business, investments in some of the important adjacencies like tablets and phones. We're investing more in process technology, we're investing more in software capabilities to bring all these devices together.

So it's an interesting phenomenon in that we had ASPs up in '10 and so it gets a little -- it's kind of counterintuitive because we don't see that a lot. So if you think about the world from the standpoint of year-on-year change, it looks like the average for 2009 is about what the average is for 2010 and it doesn't pop out in -- the average for '11 is about what the average was in 2010, and so you don't see it in the year-on-year recon. But what you have to keep in mind is over the course of 2010, our pricing went up. And so I ended at a higher level than my average. And from that, I come down some over the course of 2011. Again, that's a place where we're fighting hard to make that not be true, but that is my expectation inside of the gross margin forecast.",155

I don't think so. I think we're seeing just pretty consistent growth. I mean, it tends to go in cycles. The cycles started with Nehalem eight quarters -- seven quarters ago, and I don't see it abating. It is historically, if I go back before the Internet data center bubbles, strong growth. The fourth quarter was always the strongest quarter for servers because capital budgets expired and people bought servers before the year changed. I haven't seen that as being the driving trend for several years now.",96

I don't think there's a strong seasonal pattern to servers. But I will say in Q1 in the guidance, the thing that caused us to be a little better than seasonal, once you adjust for that 14th week, is the ramp in sales of Sandy Bridge. That's the driver in Q1 and that's not yet in the server market. So you should assume from that, that it's the ramp in Sandy Bridge, which is notebooks.",79

I am very pleased to report another record revenue quarter for the company. As anticipated, consumer demand in the U.S. and Western Europe was soft, but consumer sales and emerging markets, and demand for both enterprise servers and clients were better than expected. 
The combination of a feature-led product segmentation strategy and a simplified branding structure has been very effective in improving the purchasing process for buyers, and leading us to achieve our best product mix in many years. Additionally, the rapid recovery from Cougar Point chipset issues earlier in the quarter enabled a much faster ramp of Sandy Bridge products than we anticipated in January. 
With regards to the tragic events in Japan, I want to first comment that all of our employees and their families are safe, for which we are very grateful. We did sustain some damage to our sales and marketing offices in Japan, but nothing major that would hinder our ability to service our customers. Our team on the ground is actively participating in relief efforts and we are deploying our technology to help connect families that have been dislocated by the earthquake and tsunami. 
As for our business, I want to note that we did not see any unusual changes or fluctuations to our backlog after the earthquake, nor do we anticipate any major disruptions to our supply lines moving forward. 
Aggregate inventory levels of the PC supply chain remained healthy and well within normal operating ranges as we enter Q2. In Q1, our customers replenished approximately half of the inventory that was depleted in Q4 primarily with new Sandy Bridge-based products. Compared to the first quarter of last year, which was a very good quarter for us, we achieved double-digit growth across every major product segment, and across every region in the world. 
Revenue for the Data Center business was up 32% from a year ago, with operating profit improving nearly 50%. Our other businesses also showed solid growth. The Embedded business was up 33%, NAND flash was up 17%. And I'm pleased to note that 1 of our new business areas, the Digital Home Group, grew 129% from last year and is now shipping at a rate of over 10,000 units per day into set-top boxes and smart TVs. 
Our PC Client business remains strong and grew 17% from last year. What we are witnessing is an explosion of computing devices that connect to the Internet, and Intel is a big part of this trend. We not only participate through selling our products into these device categories, but we also profit from the wide array of products that we sell in the build out of the data center capacity required to serve all of these devices. 
Turning to the Data Center Group specifically, the first quarter was another very strong quarter. DCG recorded Q1 revenue of $2.5 billion, putting us on a trajectory to reach $10 billion in revenue for this year across our server, storage and networking products. The cloud build out continues to be a major driver of growth for the company, with demand from China showing notable strength this quarter. 
Within the Data Center Group, the Storage business increased 45% sequentially and was up 65% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched Sandy Bridge Xeon platforms for the single socket market, and early demand for this product has been very strong. 
Looking ahead, we are very bullish about our Data Center business and expect it to be a major growth driver for years to come. This past quarter, we also launched Sandy Bridge for client PCs. As I stated before, I believe that this is the very best product Intel has ever delivered to our customers.
Early demand for Sandy Bridge has been outstanding. In fact, the ramp of Sandy Bridge in the channel is the fastest ramp we've ever seen, and sell through has been robust. The reviews of Sandy Bridge have been outstanding and we expect the ramp to continue on a very sharp growth trajectory. 
We also launched Oak Trail just last week, which is a platform designed specifically for tablets. We are seeing very good design momentum with Oak Trail across multiple operating systems. Over the course of this year, Intel will have tablet platforms that run Windows, Android and MeeGo. 
We remain committed to success in the Smartphone segment, and we're actively working with a large number of handset manufacturers and carriers around the world on met field-based designs. 
Overall, we begin 2011 with great momentum. We've added McAfee and the Wireless Division of Infineon to our portfolio, and have ambitious plans for both acquisitions going forward. We are investing and developing new products for phones and tablets, and are turning our advantages in Moore's Law and computer technology into breakthrough products for these segments. All of our major product segments are growing, and these new segments are expected to add to that growth momentum. 
We remain on track to begin production on our 22-nanometer silicon process technology by the end of this year. This revolutionary technology will further distance Intel from the competition across all segments of computing. 
Let me make 2 final comments about demand and CapEx. Like many of you, I noted that some of the third-party research firms issued reduced forecasts for PCs in 2011. I want to be clear that our views differ from some of theirs. The PC business has evolved into a global industry that is approaching 400 million units this year. 
While some channels like PCs sold through consumer retail outlets and mature markets have deep visibility, other channels, especially in emerging markets, are not well reflected in the forecast of third-party firms until shipments from Intel and its competitors have been reconciled. 
Over the last 5 years, we have put considerable effort into improving our visibility with systems like just-in-time inventory hubs for our major customers, as well as realtime metrics to monitor sales through all of our worldwide channels. As a result, we were able to call the inflection in our business in Q1 of '09, as well as predicting 2010 growth to within 1 point of accuracy. 
Our projections for PC segment growth in 2011 remain in the low double-digit range based on early sell-through strength we are seeing as we begin 2011 and the great reception to Sandy Bridge in both Consumer and Enterprise segments. And while it's too early to call 2012 with an improving global economy, we see no reason for growth to be materially different from what we see in 2011. 
Secondly, we are increasing our forecast for CapEx spending this year. This reflects the widening of our process technology lead and the incremental opportunity that advantage will provide our business. The increased CapEx is focused on both 22- and 14-nanometer capabilities. 
As we tailor our product plans to meet the needs of emerging notebook, tablet and phone usages, we see a need for more platform features to be integrated into the microprocessor, taking advantage of our leading edge silicon capability for power management, performance and smaller, lighter devices. 
These are high ROI investments and will be the foundation for significant growth opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",1209
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3400.0,115790.0,7715480.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Paul. The first quarter of 2011 had several significant milestones. It was a record quarter in terms of revenue and earnings per share. We closed both the McAfee and Infineon Wireless Division acquisitions. Our customers launched our Sandy Bridge platforms, our fastest ramping product in the company's history. 
In addition, the company identified, fixed and recovered from the Cougar Point chipset design issue, completely mitigating the $300 million revenue impact that was originally forecasted. The factory network executed flawlessly, lowering throughput times and significantly increasing first quarter output of Cougar Point replacement parts, fully recovering to customer demand by the end of the quarter. 
As a result of the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division, we will be providing non-GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP for 2011 to provide additional visibility into the operational results of the company. 
Excluding the impacts of deferred revenue write-down and associated costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other acquisition-related accounting impacts, we achieved first quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, gross margin of 62% and earnings per share of $0.59. The rest of my comments will use GAAP financials unless otherwise called out. 
The first quarter ended up significantly better than our expectations. From a market standpoint, strength in emerging markets and enterprise offset the weakness that we expected and saw in the mature market Consumer segment. We continue to benefit from the strength of our product lineup across servers and clients. The introduction of Sandy Bridge extended our leadership and resulted in an increase in average selling prices. 
The third quarter of last year was the first time where our revenue exceeded $11 billion. Revenue for the first quarter of 2011 was $12.8 billion, up $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter, and up 25% year-on-year. The acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division contributed approximately $500 million of the $2.5 billion increase from a year ago. 
Gross margin of $7.9 billion in the first quarter was a record, and the gross margin percentage was 61%. While gross margin benefited from higher average selling prices when compared to the fourth quarter, 22-nanometer start-up costs, higher unit costs, and the impact of the acquisitions brought gross margin down 3 points from the fourth quarter. 
The Cougar Point impact to gross margin was approximately 3 points, consistent with the impact to the fourth quarter. R&D and MG&A, as a percent of revenue, dropped to 28.7%. Our plan for 2011 is to sustain the progress we've made in our productivity and our efficiency, while making some critical R&D investments in the core business and adjacencies such as tablets and phones, and software capability and in process technology. 
Operating profit of $4.2 billion in the first quarter was up 21% year-on-year. Net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.56 were up 29% and 30%, respectively, when compared to a year ago. Our philosophy of both investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders was evident in the first quarter as we completed the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless Division, increased our capital spending, completed a $4 billion buyback and increased our dividend per share by 15%. The cash generation of our business remains strong with cash flow from operations of $4 billion in the first quarter. 
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, flat to the first quarter and in line with historical seasonality. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be flat to the first quarter at 61%. The first quarter was a great start to 2011 and puts us on track to exceed our financial goals for the year. Seasonal growth from the first quarter puts us on the path towards another year of double-digit unit growth, and revenue growth in excess of 20% after the 24% growth we saw last year. 
We are making some critical investments in our business, both in terms of research and development and in taking advantage of our process technology leadership. The cash generation of our business remains strong and the first quarter results put us on track to another year of double-digit earnings growth. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.",715

This is Stacy. The emerging markets now are well over 50% of our total business level. And I think the dynamic that's going on there is really one of economics. The desirability of technology is high and the affordability of technology is now coming into the range where when we look across markets like China, Latin America, Eastern Europe, you've got a couple of billion consumers that now the price point of a PC is within 1 to 2 months of income and it's really driving our growth, and penetration rates are still pretty low. So we think this is something that has legs and will drive our growth into the future.",133

Most -- something like 1/3 of all the PCs sold in emerging markets are not branded machines, their white boxes built by the channel through our distribution network worldwide. We saw strength on Sandy Bridge and even strengthened the Desktop business, which we haven't seen for some time based upon that product in those markets. And of course, those markets are still surging in terms of purchasing notebooks. It's not a low-end mix, I'd also add. It's a pretty average mix of products on a worldwide basis.",111

Paul, you used the word revolutionary and I've heard people at Intel use that before with respect to 22. So I'm wondering if you can shed some light on what that exactly that means. And then as part of the response, with $10.2 billion in CapEx, which is ostensively almost all geared towards 22-nanometer, is it really Intel putting their money where their revolutionary mouth is? Or is it really the money because you're trying to manage the absolute amount of capacity that you have?",96
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3400.0,115790.0,7715487.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,10,"This is Stacy. I'll start with the second part of that, and then turn it back over to Paul. The CapEx number for us is really driven by a couple of things. It's driven by the unit growth and the mix that we're seeing and it protects our ability to meet demand at 22 and 14 nanometer. You didn't say 14 nanometer, but that's an important part of this story. And it enables our strategy to integrate more features and functionality on to that leading-edge process technology, which as Paul said in his prepared remarks it gives us performance, cost and power efficiency advantages. Let me give you an example. Probably the biggest single chunk that's happening inside of this increase in CapEx is the fact that we've made the decision that for the development fab for 14 nanometer, we're going to make that fab bigger. That gives us the ability to actually, at the early stage of the ramp, move more products to 14 nanometer, take advantage of that process technology leadership, ramp it faster. So we're going to spend some construction dollars today to have that capability in place of 14 nanometer. But over the 14-nanometer life, it should save us money by going faster on that first factory. So those are the kinds of things that we're doing to both protect the ability to respond to demand, and also make sure that we have the transistors available on the leading edge to give us the competitive advantage in the marketplace.",253

You picked that up, Glen. I actually thought I was at the first 1 at Intel to use that, so. I thought I’d embargo [indiscernible] a few times already.

And I was wondering on a broader level, how we should think about any of the seasonal trends for the second half of the year given all the different puts and takes on data center and emerging market growth?",94

In terms of McAfee and Infineon, we closed Infineon at the end of January. We closed McAfee at the end of February. The combination of those 2 acquisitions added $0.5 billion of revenue to Q1. And based on having a full quarter in Q2, they should add another $0.5 billion in Q2. In terms -- so now let me help you a little bit with Q2 map, because you've got a couple of offsets. You got this incremental $0.5 billion for McAfee and Infineon. It's offset by the fact that we don't have the 14th week, those are roughly in line with each other. And so when you net those out, what you see is Q2's kind of flat on an ongoing business basis to Q1, which is in line with seasonal patterns we've seen over the last 5 years. Going into the second half of the year, I'm not going to get as discrete as providing a forecast for each quarter, but we're not seeing anything that would cause it to be a different year. We see through all kinds of economic climates. The second half of the year tends to be 2 to 3 points higher than the first half in terms of revenue. That's consistent with our expectations as we work through the year.",228

If you notice what we did at IDF in Beijing last week, that was -- there were a lot of tablet-centric announcements there around MeeGo and Windows and Android. And so we're heads down on a number of designs on tablets on all 3 of those operating systems where we see the Android code, Honeycomb version of Android source code from Google, and we're actively doing the port on that and expect to be able to ramp those machines over the course of this year for a number of customers. In terms of phones, obviously, we lost Nokia, which took a lot of wind out of the sales for phones this year. We've redirected those resources onto a number of other major accounts, focusing on carriers who want their own devices and also on handset manufacturers. They're all based on Medfield, which is, I think, still the first 32-nanometer phone apps processor in the industry. And quite frankly, the limit in terms of them getting to market is going to be the interoperability testing of the networks at this point in time. So I think I would be very disappointed if you didn't see Intel-based phones for sale 12 months from now.",213

You called out storage of $0.45 sequentially. Can you talk about what's going on within the other subsegments of DCG, like IP -- for the IP Data Centers, Enterprise, Network and Service? So if you can, just tell us what's going on there. And we've seen this group grow significantly, faster than one would think servers are growing in terms of units. Can you talk about the trends of multiprocessor servers as kind of what may be driving these ASPs, just so that we can get a comfort as to what the longer-term growth would be?",109

First of all, we recognized this group has had pretty phenomenal growth across all of its various product groups. So what we've decided to do for the Analyst Meeting is do a deep dive for all of you guys and we'll do a full, if you will, keynote session on that, breaking out all the detail on how we see the server market, the market for Xeon-class devices today and tomorrow. But if you look at traditional servers, you're right. We're outgrowing the traditional enterprise server market by a factor of 2 or 3. And as we look forward, by 2014 for example, we think half of the market for Xeon is high-performance computing and cloud. That's a dramatic change from 80% of the market being enterprise servers just a couple of years ago. So when you look at the rate of growth of HPC, of clouds, of the nominal growth in servers, and then the conversion of other parts of the data center, that is networking equipment and storage, from proprietary designs principally now to fundamentally Intel-based designs, you see an aggregate growth rate that is really representative of, I think, all the growth in the Internet. And all these devices connect to these servers or these network machines 1 way or another. And this is where we're benefiting quite well. So you see -- on 1 side you watch the growth of tablets and smartphones. This is where the rubber hits the road for those devices is in data centers around the world.",258

Great, thanks for that. Let me just ask you on the Moore's Law transition you're making now from 22 to 14. I don't know if I should read that as being slightly more aggressive than what we think is a typical ratio as you go from 32 to 22 or from 45 to 32. Is there anything that -- I know Glen asked this earlier when you talked about things being revolutionary at 22. But what is driving the speed now in terms of moving to 14? And in terms of what you're able to do at 14 vis-a-vis say 22 or 32, can you give us any idea as to what comes in here? I mean you talked about having mixed signals capabilities and all that. Is there anything else you can tell us, A as to what's driving this speed, and then also what we should expect?",152

So I'm going to punt on the capability part of that question for another few weeks. You'll see that when we do our disclosures around 22 nanometer and really start to talk about some of the secret sauce that's going to come out in that technology, so that will carry it forward into 14. In terms of the speed, we're still on a 2-year cadence. So that hasn't changed. That is our Moore's Law cadence, and we're driving that faster than anybody else in the industry. So even at that 2-year cadence, we're extending our leadership over others. What we're realizing, though, is that competitive advantage is becoming more and more important to us. And we're getting -- we've always gotten paid for it in terms of cost. We're now also getting paid for it in terms of differentiating our product line and getting paid in pricing. And so at an economical, where you can see it in our results over the last 6 or 7 quarters, as we have extended our leadership, our products have extended over the rest of the industry, we've segmented our product line and we're getting paid in a new way for that process technology leadership. As we get out to 22 nanometer, as we get out to 14 nanometer, what you're going to see is we're going to bring capabilities to the process technology more quickly than we have historically. And so we'll intercept 22 nanometer with our smartphone roadmap, with our netbook roadmap earlier in the technology, we'll ramp our core business more quickly so we get into these kind of square wave transitions. And then get paid for that performance and cost by having the leadership over the rest of the industry.",293

We're running I'd call it in the healthy range of utilization. So as we said before, not too hot, not too cold. Certainly on the chipset side of the business as we had responded to the Cougar Point issue, we ramped very quickly there. But I'd say in general, we're not anticipating shortages. And I think we have the ability to respond. If demand ends up being hotter, we can put the capacity in place. And frankly, if we end up in a situation where demand ends up being less, I think you saw in 2009, we now have the tools to respond very quickly to that kind of environment. So I think we can respond to both sides of that equation as we get into the second half and into 2012.",138

Stacy, in your online comments, CFO comments, you have for your gross margin puts and takes, a hit of 1 percentage point from higher platform unit costs and another 0.5% from lower ASPs for the second quarter. Does Sandy Bridge have a higher platform cost and a lower ASP? Or is there something else happening here on top of the ramp of Sandy Bridge?",69

So as you do the walk from Q1 to Q2, I'll just take you through the full walk. So obviously, we got 3 points of benefit because we don't repeat the Cougar Point impact that's in Q1. We see about 1.5, then it offsets that because it will be the peak quarter in terms of our startup cost. If you think about the trends we've shown you over the years, Q2 is where -- Q2 of an odd-number of years is where those startup costs will peak and then they come down. There's about a point as you pointed out in unit costs. There's really 2 things driving that. 1 is that we're seeing a little bit of an increase in some of our component costs, so think of substrates made in Japan where our supply lines got a little bit tight. So we're seeing a little bit of a pricing impact on those kinds of things. And then we're also again as a result of what happened with Cougar Point, we pulled in the ramp of our China factory pretty significantly. And so what you see is more chipsets coming out of a new factory that's ramping, and that's driving my weighted average cost up a little bit in Q2. And in the ASP pieces, and I realize I have a little bit of a credibility issue on forecasting ASP right now given it was up again in Q1, but we had a very rich mix in Q1. As Paul pointed out, the way Sandy Bridge ramped was at the higher parts of the pricing stack first. Over the course of Q2, we'll see Sandy Bridge flavors across a much more representative series of price points. And I'd expect the Q2 mix to come down a bit and be more in line with what we would normally expect. It's not huge, it's 0.5 point of gross margin. But it does come down a little bit.",330

Second, the dividends. Third, using the buyback to return cash to shareholders and bring down the cash levels. I think you see that we've been very aggressive in terms of all of those in Q1. You do have to keep in mind we have brought down the cash balances quite a bit. But you could temper that by pointing to the fact that in the first quarter, we announced that the board authorized an incremental $10 billion of buyback and we're kind of just at the beginning of that authorization.",110

So the idea that the third-party data is kind of off by 20% and if that's the case, we haven't seen that kind of discrepancy up until now between your data and the third-party data. So what's making that data more wrong this quarter than previous quarters?",93

If you remember in the fourth quarter, we were significantly worse than seasonal, and what we saw in the fourth quarter was a significant bleeding off of inventory, some of which we believe was in anticipation of us bringing out Sandy Bridge. And so component inventories came down, you saw a little bit of a refill of those component inventories in the first quarter. So the amount that it came down, probably half of that went back in, which would be us being above seasonal. When we go out and do our looks across the channel, we see inventory levels being healthy. And I think it really points to the robustness of the supply chain. The people who make motherboards for notebooks brought their builds down. We saw some older generation inventory bleed up. It looks like they're starting to ramp up now they get into the back-to-school season.",167

Or is it that the supply chain drew down a whole bunch of stuff and it kind of rebuilt it during the quarter, which is pretty reasonable?",77

The comments that I made relative to third-party data and ours were on an annual basis, looking at year-over-year, trying to set the granularity for the year. And I didn't comment on the specific comments that were written up recently on Q1, it was x% down from Q4, x% down year-on-year. Because that looks at consumption, and what Stacy was talking about is our billings. And there is a bit of a difference there, at least in the ramp up for Sandy Bridge. So really, it's apples and oranges. And I think what our experience is that on an annual basis, the numbers are closer. Our numbers are closer than theirs together. It's closer together. And that they correct over the course of the year to be aligned. You saw that happen last year as we were predicting 17%, 18% all year long, the numbers were all much lower than that. Then they came back in line as we got to the fourth quarter.",170

We're seeing a pretty robust growth in BP as well. A lot of the Internet data center growth is BP machines in some of those configurations. On the other hand, some of our largest IDC customers are using the biggest, beefiest parts we have. So it really is different. I haven't seen this ship dramatically in the last couple of years. There's just a nice consistent mix of DP versus MP. But the capability of all the devices really is stunning. The amount of compute power that we're delivering per core now is really what is delivering a lot of the value in a very power-efficient envelope. So the ROI on upgrading from old to new servers is really what is compelling both for enterprise and data center -- enterprise and Internet Data Center.",150

I would add because we made this public, too. What we have seen across UP, DP and MP has been a mix shift within those categories, so sort of Paul's point. That has been 1 of the drivers of the revenue growth is because the ROI is so good, we're finding the Data Center group -- or sorry the Data Center providers, what they're doing is they're buying up in that stack for the ROI. So that's been a big driver. To the higher bin split.",90

And the question there is that first, when will we start to see that progress? What kind of metric should we track? And conceptually, what do you think will be x 86, the architectures differentiation versus the established on ecosystem, a lot of very strong players like QUALCOMM, DI, NVIDIA and others?",83
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2011",2011-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3400.0,115790.0,7715552.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,75,"Well, I'm not going to give you more granularity on Mobile than I gave already in the earlier answer, Avik, so sorry to disappoint you there. Watch those things as they come out. Our customers will announce the design wins when they are through their interoperability testing or entering it when it becomes visible. And I don't want to add more to that. In terms of x86 versus ARM, it is not just about the core as much as we would like it to be, and I guess as much as the ARM guys would like it to be. It's about the core, the overall capability of the system on Chip, the things you put around it, the graphics, the com subsystems, the media processing subsystems and the overall power envelope relative to the performance that you can deliver of the SoC. So the Intel advantage that we see going forward is the combination of very robust computer architecture that can scale, the ability to bring on very high performance graphics and media processing, and now a wide array of comps architectures that we can bring in, and taking advantage of the world's best silicon. When you add those together, I think it gives us a very strong value proposition in this market. I'd also point out that all of the major operating systems in phones and smartphones are written at a high-level such as they're cross-platform and portable. And so it is easier for people to move from ARM to Intel or ARM to ARM than it has been in the past in the Windows.",266

I think it's a little bit of each of those, John. But I'll add 1 more, which I think is a big one. Remember in 2009 in the first half of '10, during the depths of the recession, the consumer notebook market worldwide, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, was very strong and it was strong contrary to GDP at the time. Remember GDP was going south and consumer sales were going north. And I think what happened is that people bought a lot of machines in that timeframe and we're still just early in the cycle. So those machines are 1.5 years old or less. And so seeing a consumer refresh right now probably isn't, on average, what you're going to see in mature markets. Because this is not like emerging markets where people are buying their first machine. This is a mature environment where people are buying a new machine when they decide that they need to upgrade or whatever. Now clearly some tablet cannibalization is impacting that, but I think the bigger 1 is that macroeconomics and the prior cycle.",205

From the standpoint of client shipments, you'd say slightly above seasonal, once you net out the 14th week. And again, it comes back to my answer to Jim Covello's question, which is what we saw was an inventory burn in Q4, and a partial refilling in Q1. And that led to units being slightly above seasonal.

And so -- and then I think your follow-up question to that should be, ""So okay, what happens if we get that wrong?"" If we're wrong on the demand, how do we respond to the market? And I point back to what -- the capability we have to very quickly roll forward capacity from 1 generation to the next. And I think you saw that from us in 2009 when the bottom fell out of the market, we were able to bring our CapEx number way down, offset over half of the 32-nanometer investment by repurposing equipment we'd already purchased for 45 nanometer. So if we overestimate, we can respond within a couple of quarters and get gross margins back up into the healthy range pretty quickly. The flipside is if we underestimate, it takes us 2 years to recover. And that's a devastating financial impact on us. So we look at this as being a pretty -- it's a high ROI investment for us, and we have the tools to modulate it, if it comes to that.",205

And you can kind of see that, I mean if you look at just gross margin trend, we're 61 61. This is on a GAAP basis. The annual number is 63. And so that would suggest that the second half is back up towards the mid-60s, 65%. And you got a couple of tailwinds there, 1 is the abatement of startup cost. We start on the trend where they start falling off stream in Q3, and our costs get a little bit better as we go into the second half of this year consistent with what I showed at the Investor Meeting.",130

So it was a 1.5 impact in Q1, and then a similar impact in Q2. I guess my question is, is the impact a little similar in Q2 because it was lower in Q1? Because again, I think the profile was up in Q1 and Q2 per your initial expectations, but I thought that the increase into Q2 was going to be more modest relative to Q1, if my facts in the Analyst Day chart are correct.",87

By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you've not received both documents, they're currently available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Paul Otellini, our President and CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we will hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A. 
I'd like to tell you about a change to our company's guidance and Quiet Period practices. Beginning this quarter, the company's Quiet Period will be reduced by 2 weeks to enable an extended period of dialogue with investors. Intel will observe the Quiet Period from September 16 until publication of the company's third quarter earnings release.
Additionally, certain of our smaller business outlook items, the forecast for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, impact of equity investments and interest and other and tax rate, will be pulled from guidance at the close of business, July 26, and not subject to an update by the company after that time. 
We also want to make everyone aware of the annual Intel Developer Forum taking place September 13 through the 15 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition to keynotes from Paul and other senior leaders, we'll be beholding a number of investor briefings, and invite you to come and hope to see many of you there.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our website. So with that, let me hand it over to Paul.",331

I'm very pleased to report another record revenue quarter for the company. In May, we met with many of you at our annual investor meeting, and laid out our strategy and the opportunities we have before us. The transit of driving the growth of our business that we described then are playing out as expected. The Data Center business remains strong, our Embedded business is seeing rapid growth, the Enterprise PC refresh continues, and the emerging markets continue to be significant drivers of our broad based momentum.
In the comparison of our second quarter results versus Q2 of last year, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth across every business segment. For example, the Data Center business is up 15%; Embedded is up 25%; NAND is up 15%; and our PC Client business is up 11%. 
If we look at the channel, which is an excellent proxy for emerging markets strength, our channel revenue was up 17% versus last year. In summary, this was a very strong quarter across all of our product lines and around the world.
Now let me take just a moment and provide a bit of color on performance of our major business segments. The Data Center Group had another very strong quarter with CPU revenues topping the $2 billion mark for the third consecutive quarter. Demand for our Westmere-EX family that was launched in April is very healthy, and this helped to strengthen server ASPs in the quarter. 
At our Investor Day, we talked a lot about how the Data Center business was more than just servers. To highlight that, microprocessor unit shipments for storage applications set a record and we're up 38% from a year ago. Also, we grew our networking revenue 40% from a year ago. The non-server parts of our Data Center business are growing at an exceptional rate. 
As for servers, the story is much the same. The market remains very strong, with demand from Cloud-based customers leading the way. The Cloud segment is up 50% in the first half of 2011 versus the first half of last year, demonstrating how fast that business continues to ramp. We believe that we are very early in the Cloud build out, and that Intel remains extremely well-positioned to profitably grow from the explosion of Mobile devices and Internet-based services.
In our Embedded business segment, I mentioned that revenues grew 25% from a year ago on record microprocessor unit shipments. We shipped over 1 million units of Atom processors into embedded applications for the first time ever, which is an increase of 76% from a year ago. Overall, we witnessed very broad-based strength in our embedded segment, with the fastest growth coming from the Medical Imaging segment, up 50%; Print Imaging, up 48%; Communications, up 40%; and Industrial applications, up 20%. We're starting to see many of the long cycle design wins that we've been tracking, turn into revenue, and expect Q3 to continue this trend.
McAfee turned in a very solid quarter with revenue beating our expectations. It was a second quarter record for McAfee in terms of revenue. Additionally, the number of large deals signed was almost double that of Q1. McAfee is executing very well and the importance of security has never been more evident. We are excited that later this year, Intel and McAfee will be shipping the very first products codeveloped by both companies that will greatly enhance security for computing applications. 
This new solution is a combination of enhanced software from McAfee and security instructions built into the hardware from Intel. We look forward to providing more details of this product at our Developer Forum in September. 
Lastly, the PC Client Group also had a very good quarter. Demand for Sandy Bridge processors has been very strong, with the ramp rate of Sandy Bridge ahead of the previous generation products by 20%.  Today, 2/3 of all the products that we ship into PC clients are Core i3, i5, or i7. 
Overall, the trends in PCs remain much the same as the last few quarters. The Corporate business remains consistent and healthy, consumer markets are mixed. The mature market consumer segment is still soft, but the emerging market consumer segment is healthy and growing. 
Our guidance for the third quarter assumes a modest growth in the mature market consumer segments of the business. At this point in the year, we believe the PC unit growth will be around 8% to 10%, down a bit from our earlier view, but above that in revenue as Enterprise PC purchases continue to drive a very rich mix.
I previously mentioned that our channel revenue was up 17% from a year ago. Let me add some color to our emerging market results. In looking at the last 3 months of reported PC shipments, you can see why we're so optimistic about the emerging market's opportunity. 
For example, Turkey and Indonesia are up over 70% each; India is up 17%; Russia is up 15%; and China is up 14%. The latest data on Latin America also showed growth of 12%. Brazil remains the key driver of this growth and is poised to become the third largest market for computers in 2012. In general, all of these are large, high growth regions, but PC penetration remains very low, while affordability of PCs continues to improve.
In closing, I want to highlight 2 important announcements made this quarter. The first was the process technology breakthrough that we made public back in May. Intel will be the first company to productize 3-D transistors. Our 22-nanometer process technology remains on track for high-volume production later this year, and will provide substantial improvements in power consumption and performance. This technology is very complex and very innovative, plus that we expect that the lead we have in process technology will expand going forward, providing Intel with important competitive advantages in the markets we're targeting. 
Second was the Ultrabook announcement we made at Computex. Ultrabooks are the next evolution in personal computing that will combine the best of the consumer PC with tablet functionality, as well as consumer electronics features like instant on, and always on, always connected functionality. All in a stylish, thin and light system. We are very pleased with the industry response and customer commitments around this new product category, and will provide more details at our September Development Forum. 
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.",1073

The second quarter was strong and better than expected, resulting in our first ever quarter with greater than $13 billion in revenue. From a market standpoint, the quarter played out as expected, with strength in emerging markets and enterprise, offset by softness in the mature market consumer segment. We continue to benefit from the strength of our product lineup, as mix within both servers and clients was better than expected. 
Demand for our latest product, Sandy Bridge, remained strong and is the fastest ramping product in our company's history. As a result of the acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless division, we will provide non-GAAP financial information in addition to GAAP for 2011 to provide additional visibility into the operational results of the company. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we achieved record revenue of $13.1 billion. Gross margin of $8.1 billion was also a record for the gross margin of 62%. Operating profit of $4.2 billion was up 6% from a year ago. Net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.59 were up 10% and 16%, respectively from a year ago. The rest of my comments will use GAAP financials unless otherwise called out.
Our business growth has accelerated over the past few years. Second quarter revenue of over $13 billion is up approximately $2.3 billion when compared to the second quarter of 2010, equating to 21% growth. The acquisitions of McAfee and the Infineon Wireless divisions contributed approximately $1 billion of the $2.3 billion increase from a year ago.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 61%, slightly down from the first quarter. As expected, our 22-nanometer startup cost peaked in the second quarter, and our costs were slightly higher as we ramped incremental factories on our 32 nanometer process technology. This was mostly offset by the reserves taken in the first quarter for the Cougar Point product issue, which were significantly less in the second quarter.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14 billion, up 7% for the second quarter and in line with historical seasonality. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be up from the second quarter at 64%.
We are raising the midpoint of our outlook for R&D and MG&A by $500 million to $16.2 billion. Some of this increase is due to a significant increase in our business. For the larger portion is driven by investments we are making in innovation to drive future revenue growth. Our investments are focused on redefining the PC category with Ultrabooks, our server product offerings, strengthening our product offering in tablets and phones and further extending our process technology leadership. 
Our long term goal here is to make these important investments that contribute to our growth, while still maintaining the progress we have made on efficiency and keeping spending as a percentage of revenue below 30%. 
The cash generation of our business remains strong, with cash flow from operations of $4 billion in the second quarter. On top of investing in our business, we are increasing the amount of free cash flow allocated to the dividend and actively repurchasing shares. Consistent with the philosophy we outlined in May. This was apparent in the second quarter, as we purchased $2.5 billion in capital and are forecasting CapEx of $10.5 billion for the year, completed a $2 billion buyback, and announced a 16% increase to our dividend.
Our Intel-owned inventory was approximately flat to the prior quarter and the inventory that sits at our distributors were down slightly this quarter. As we look more broadly at the worldwide PC supply chain, we believe inventories are at a healthy level and did not grow this quarter. 
As Paul mentioned, our business results in the second quarter continue to reinforce the key themes highlighted at our May Investor Meeting. The explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet continues to drive the buildout of the cloud and fuel our Data Center Group growth. 
Our Embedded business is growing at a rapid pace, as the demand for both performance and low-power from the Internet of things drives architectural conversions for Intel. 
Emerging markets already make up more than half of our revenue. And as the technology that we sell becomes more affordable to billions of consumers, we will continue to see robust growth from emerging markets. These are the market forces that drove first half revenue growth of 23% from the first half of 2010. And these are the market forces that give us confidence as we enter the second half of 2011. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.",785

And every emerging market is different. For example, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China have a slightly richer mix than the United States on average. When you average China out across all the cities, you get a closer to average mix, maybe slightly down as you move into the Tier 5 and Tier 6 cities. But we really haven't seen the mix go down. The price should be dramatically different in these emerging markets because just like as you'd expect when it's your first time to buy a television, the first time to buy a computer, you want value.

If I look back at what I've been predicting over the last several quarters, what I've been wrong on is that our mix to the core product line, Core i3, i5, i7, has been higher than I've anticipated. And so even with a bit of a seasonal uptick in the Consumer segment, I think that rich mix keeps me approximately flat from the same point of ASP.",86

I'd say across the major businesses, what we're expecting is seasonal. And so what it is, is kind of a continuation of the trends we've seen so far. We've seen relative strength in enterprise and we've seen relative strength in emerging markets. We think that continues into the back half of this year. We've seen relative softness in the consumer segment. But looking back at a decade of data in every year, be it a strong year or weak year, we see the second half stronger than the first half on a unit basis just because that's the buying season both for enterprise and consumer. And so off of that weak first half, we think there's a seasonal uptick in the second half. So nothing significantly different from a normal trend. So I am just starting from a weak starting point and some starting from a strong starting point.",150

And we have the same visibility into our multinational accounts, whether they ship in China or in Cleveland. That is we were off on these big hub. It's a system that basically they only draw what they need for their near term build. And in fact, we're seeing a conservatism there in terms of people moving a bit more to the air lanes versus shipping lanes just to be conservative. So in general, we feel pretty good about that part of the inventory. In emerging markets in general, a larger fraction of sales comes through the channel. A lot of that is white box and build-to-order. And by definition, build-to-order, if someone walks in and gives someone $200 and there's a computer that afternoon. So we get a much more real time feed there, and of course, we don't claim that revenue until it sells out through our distributors. So if anything, it may be slightly more realtime than the mature markets or the enterprise markets.",180

We're public in saying that we'll be in production this year, nothing's changed. We still expect to be in volume production this year. We have not gone public on the launch date because our server customers are very conservative about putting the dates out for exactly the reason you point out.

I think those things are synonymous. I think that we've spent a lot of energy to be able to articulate differentiated features and performance at different price points. That's a tool that we hadn't historically used, and that in conjunction with having a great product like Sandy Bridge and the kind of performance that brings has led to the richer mix within the client segment. I think that in general, that's the bigger driver, and then the fact that the Enterprise market has been relatively stronger than the consumer market is a secondary driver to ASP good news that we've seen.",116

Some of it is we're growing faster. So this is really construction-related spending. Some of it is we're going a little faster on the 40-nanometer factories. The larger portion of it, and keep in mind, we're talking about a relatively small increment. But the larger portion of it is an increase in the scope of those factories. As we guide into the planning, we saw some opportunities to do some things in the infrastructure that we're putting in place that make it easier for those factories to support multiple generations behind 40-nanometer. So kind of putting in place the capability for 10 and 7-nanometer, and when it gets kind of high ROI to do that now versus having to retrofit those factories later. So it's a combination of those 2 things, but if I was ordering, the capability is driving a little bit more and the speed is driving a little bit less.",160

And so I do think we will, over the long term, get some leverage in that line item. But we have a couple of things going on now. We see very fast growth in revenues. So some of this is revenue dependent. When I just step back and look, we grew from 2009 to 2010, we grew the business $8.5 billion. From 2010 to 2011, we're on track to grow the business in excess of $10 billion again. And so that revenue and profit dependent spending is a piece of this. But I think more importantly, we're making some important investments in our business that we believe give us even better position as we go forward. And we talked at the investor meeting about redefining the PC category with Ultrabooks. We're making investments there. We're making investments in our Server business to continue and accelerate the growth rate in that business. And we're making investments in our Tablet and Phone business in order to improve the offering that we can offer to customers there. And Paul can talk a bit about that. And so it's a combination of those things, but right now, those investments are important. They don't change our long term view of the business, but they're important investments for us to make.",255

But if you look at the CapEx that we're doing this year, we said at the investor meeting more of that, much more of that is being driven by building factories than what is normal for us. Andy talked about that in his investor meeting presentation. I'd refer you back to that. It's been a long time since we've had to build incremental shelves, but the growth in our business now requires it. So we're putting in place some clean room space that we haven't had to do over the last couple of generations.

And so that tends to give us higher than normal fall through. But if I step back and we use a reconciliation of Q2 to Q3 and talk a little bit about what I expect for the year, as we go from the second to third quarter, gross margin is going to be up around about 3.5 points. So that takes us up to 64%. The 3.5 points comes from -- we expect it to be a higher volume quarter. We've talked about that. We start to see -- as consistent with our historical patterns, we start to see the falling off of startup costs, so that adds about 1 point. We get about 1 point because we're now projecting to be finished with the impact of the Cougar Point reserves, so we don't have to repeat that in the third quarter, and then there's about 0.5 point as we continue up the ramp of the various 32 nanometer factories, our costs start to improve. We've talked about that on prior calls. So that's what gives us the benefit into the third quarter. And then as I think about the fourth quarter, and you can kind of get the math when you look at our annual forecast. I expect that we'll get little bit of benefit in terms of startup costs. You tend to see that come down over a couple of quarters. And so they think about the fourth quarter gross margin. I put it in the range of a bit higher than the 64%, probably based on what I know today, below the 65% that we've articulated as the high end of our range. So kind of in that zone.",318

Sean was quoted at the Computex as saying that this should be about 40% of the consumer mix by the end of next year. If one were to go back and compare this to CULV from a couple of years ago, what makes you more confident that this will achieve this level of success? Do you enjoy the form factor? I think CULV also had performance issues. So if you can talk about the level of confidence you have with Ultrabooks, and how you see that ramping from now until next year to get to that 40%?",104

That was really a kind of a point product. It was focused on form factor. We didn't really put a lot of engineering into it with our customers, and we didn't look at other features. If you will, it's kind of a trial run in hindsight is the way I would look at it. The Ultrabook project is much more akin to Centrino. It's a very holistic approach to moving the entire market to a different kind of form factor, not just in terms of its thinness, but in terms of the feature set. I talked about always on, always connected. So the machine is always aware of the networks around it. I talk about instant on, instant boot capability. We talked about building in integral touch into it, another feature set. So this is as much about the features around the skin, or inside the skin, as the shape of the skin. And as we look at this with our customers, we also see that there's a great deal of engineering that has to be done. Because one thing we know is that today, these feature sets cost more money. But we don't think that PC prices are going to go up over time. So what we have to do is work with the ecosystem to cost engineer these features for high-volume price point displacement. And that's the only way you can achieve sort of a 40% number as Shawn predicted in that timeframe is by doing price point replacements. And then looking forward a year later, into the next generation, silicon, it gets cheaper to do it so we could penetrate more of the market.",302

How much of that is also, I believe, you can take more build up material share? And specifically, I just want to know if the things like graphic attach rates have changed within the configurations here, seeing and therefore, you're capturing all that value. Or is it a case of Intel taking advantage of the fact that components like memory are a lot softer and therefore there isn't much pressure to take CPU pricing down by your customer?",104

End customers are demanding a higher mix of product, which gets into the branding and feature set questions that came up earlier. In terms of bill of materials, we had a very strong position to integrate graphics prior to Sandy Bridge. That just got stronger for Sandy Bridge. It satisfies more and more of the market and customers are using it, particularly in smaller form factor machines because of the power advantage. So there's no compromise on pixels, as you get a significant advantage on battery life. And as a result, we're seeing a very strong utilization, both in desktops and notebooks for Sandy Bridge graphics.",118

Even after I saw the numbers yesterday from Apple and we get engaged in lots of Win8 and Android tablet design activity across the board. I believe this category is additive to computing. I don't think it's going to replace any one category. I think it may replace some discretionary sales at any point in time. And I think that's one of the reasons that netbooks down year-on-year is this tablet's strength to some extent. The netbooks are probably also down because of the very good value if you can get in low-end notebooks nowadays as compared to, say, a netbook. So there's a number of pressures on that particular segment. Going forward, I really don't see that. I think it's a device that some people will use as a standalone device, but many people use it as a companion device, and that's good for us, and that seems to be the model even if you look at the Apple numbers, it seems to be the model that's consistent with their base.",180

I can kind of tieback our philosophy to our actions in Q2 if you think that's helpful to you. We articulated the philosophy in the May Investor Meeting, first investing in our business, no change there. Dividends, second, and we articulated that we wanted to allocate more of our free cash flow to the dividend, making that approximately 40% of our free cash flow, and then using the remainder of cash generation, one of the things we look at there is the buyback. I think you can see that play out nicely in the second quarter. We kept our cash balances relatively flat. We increased the dividend 16%, we made significant investments in our business including the CapEx numbers. And we bought back $2 billion worth of stock with the free cash flow that we generated that was in excess of what we needed for those other uses. I think that's a nice model for us, and that's very consistent with our philosophy. In terms of McAfee and Infineon, what was your specific question there?",193

So I haven't seen anything there.

So I'm not going to give you a lot more color than we gave there, except to say, in general, I think it's good. I mean, whenever Microsoft has a new operating system, that's good for us. We've been working with Microsoft for several years now on the feature set of Win 8 and optimizing our silicon around it in PC space. I think the jury is out on how that will be received by the public in tablets, and we expect to be hypercompetitive for Win8 tablets. We're involved in the program as aggressively as any of the silicon vendors. And our job is to make sure that we can outperform, out battery, and out compatibility the ARM guys in Win8 tablets.",135

As I said earlier, our core, mainstream PC and Notebook and Desktop business is still forecasted for us at double digits. And we're very comfortable with that part of the product line. The biggest change from 6 months ago is a slower growth rate on netbooks. So still showing growth in netbooks, just at a slower rate. And that has impacts on ASP.

As we've said, we're putting in capacity that's pretty consistent with the kind of TAM growth we've seen for the last several years. And we have some ability to flex up. So we're making sure we're putting in some factory space to go a little bit higher than that. And we have the ability that if things end up being softer than that as you saw us in 2009 to respond pretty quickly and bring down the CapEx number and just upgrade and bring in more capital at the leading edge node. So think of it as pretty consistent with historical unit growth rates with some ability to go higher than that and some flexibility to respond if things end up being a little softer than that. And I think Andy did a great job of articulating that in the investor meeting. If you want to refresh on that, we can take you through it.",165

So to that end, if I can use my follow up on the same topic, if the PC unit forecast that you guys see keeps coming down, is there a number that we could think about that we could then expect you to kind of go more on the slower side on the CapEx as we head into next year? If it came down to 5, which is where the third parties are, maybe the third parties aren't right. But if your forecast kept coming down, is the market number, the third-party number a number where we would expect the CapEx to slow a little bit?",122

But I realize that's not entirely helpful answer to you. But at this point in the year, that's as far as I'm going to go in terms of forecasting CapEx for next year. I mean, Andy also articulated, when we're building factories, and we're equipping those factories there tends to be a couple years cycle. So I gave you a strong hint to expect elevated CapEx next year relative to the historical trend line. If the unit growth is significantly less than we're anticipating, that number would be less than what we're anticipating. If it's more, it's more. But that doesn't help you because we haven't told you the baseline.",128

And as we move from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge next year, we have the ability to mix and match cores, and mix and match graphics engines, much more so than we've ever done before. So if we end up in a quarter [ph] case that you're describing where the markets short-term is much smaller than our ability to supply it, we can up crank our products pretty substantially at very little marginal cost. And really have a much more across-the-board competitive offering than even we have today.",110

It's interesting. There's lots of tools here at our disposal that we haven't historically had. The forward use of our capacity gives us the ability to move capacity quickly to the leading edge. 5 years ago, it isn't a capability we had.

I won't do it at a level of detail any more than I said in terms of I expect to be kind of a bit higher than where we are and under the upper range of 65% that we put out there. When I think about the fourth quarter, I think we would benefit from startup costs coming down. A strong fourth quarter gives us a couple of other benefits. And then I think the big variable for us there is we have a lot of product qualifications that are kind of teed up across the end of this year and the beginning of next year. And where are those product qualifications fall could dictate where the gross margin ends up. So in terms of variability, I think that's probably the biggest variable for Q4.",136

So you see that in the Software and Services Group segment. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles is outside of that segment. So it's a little bit of a mix. That's sitting in the corporate line. I think what you're really seeing there -- so part of this will improve as we get the deferred revenue back from the accounting impact, that should be sometime next year. And you can see us already building up that deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet. So it increases just kind of watch that line item, it's not something you'd typically had to do with Intel. And then the other pieces, remember, there's still a lot of investment inside that Software and Services Group that's in support of tablets and in support of phones and things like that. So there's a lot of investment in there that causes the overall segment results to be, as you say. McAfee, if you just isolated that, looks quite good.",172

I am very pleased to report another very strong quarter for the company with the highest quarterly revenue, earnings, earnings per share and microprocessor unit shipments in Intel's history. In particular, we were very pleased with the momentum in our notebook PC business and consumer demand for our industry-leading second-generation Intel Core processor family. Relative to the third quarter of last year, our notebook business saw double-digit unit growth, leading to record microprocessor unit volume and revenue.
Trends inside the quarter played out largely as we expected. While consumer demand in mature markets like Western Europe and North America remained soft, Enterprise PC demand remained strong and consumer demand in emerging markets continued to rise year-over-year. China was up 12%, India 21%, Turkey 14% and Indonesia 23%.
The Global PC landscape is being reshaped. Emerging markets now represent 2 of the top 3 consumption PC markets in the world. China is now the #1 PC consumption market in the world, while Brazil has become #3.
In total, we grew the business by 28%, adding more than $3 billion in quarterly revenue year-on-year. Even excluding the acquisitions of McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, revenue grew by a full 18% over our Q3 2010 results, which were a record at the time. We have now had 6 consecutive record revenue quarters, and our financial performance is allowing us to return significant cash to our owners via both dividends and buybacks. Our investments to expand our capabilities and create long-term opportunities across the computing continuum are already paying off. Let me give you a few examples.
The Data Center continues to be a key source of growth, with revenues up 15% year-on-year in Q3. During the third quarter, the Data Center business also set an all-time record for storage units. We also announced that our Sandy Bridge-based 2 socket server product, code-named Romley, is shipping for revenue. Demand for Romley is forecasted to be 20x that of Nehalem at the same point of its life cycle, and we expect to launch early next year with almost 2x the design wins Nehalem had at its launch. In addition, we closed our acquisition of Fulcrum Systems, an ethernet switch silicon provider. The deal advances our strategy to deliver comprehensive building blocks across the Data Center from servers to storage and networking.
Turning to mobile computing. At IDF, we were proud to announce an extension of the long-standing collaboration between Intel and Google, which will enable time-to-market optimization of Android on Intel architecture. Work on Medfield-based smartphones and tablet designs continues, and we remain on track for Medfield-based devices to launch in the first half of next year.
I'd like to give a short update on our acquisitions. McAfee and Intel Mobile Communications, for example, contributed revenues of $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Sampling is imminent for Intel Mobile Communications' LTE product, and earlier today, McAfee launched Deep Defender. This groundbreaking new security product is the first fruit of the collaboration between Intel and McAfee.
In PCs, we are beginning to see the first generation of Ultrabooks come to market for the holiday selling season. Industry and consumer interest in Ultrabooks is high, and these early designs offer compelling, thin and light form factors with instant on capability, enhanced security and excellent battery life starting at less than $1,000. And yet, this is just the beginning. Over the next 2 generations, we expect that Ultrabooks will evolve to include features like touch screens and an always-on, always-connected capability, all at mainstream price points, offering a truly exceptional PC experience. With more than 70 designs in the pipeline, we are excited about the future of Ultrabooks.
During the third quarter, we began volume production of Ivy Bridge on our 22 nanometer process technology. 22 nanometers will usher-in the era of 3-D transistors, which will pay dividends in power, performance and density for generations to come. The midpoint of our outlook for the quarter puts us on pace to deliver nearly $55 billion in revenue for 2011, after crossing $40 billion for the first time in 2010, representing a year-over-year increase of 26% or more than $11 billion.
In closing, we are very pleased with the results and accomplishments of this record-setting quarter and year-to-date. We remain very confident in our growth strategy and are excited about our new product pipeline.

Revenue in the third quarter was a record, and it was our most profitable quarter ever. You can see the growth of our business by looking at a year-to-date comparison versus 2010. At the end of the third quarter, our revenue of $40.1 billion is $7.9 billion higher than the corresponding first 3 quarters of last year.
Third quarter revenue of over $14 billion is up over $3 billion when compared to the third quarter of 2010, equating to 28% growth year-on-year. McAfee and the Intel Mobile Communications Group contributed $1.1 billion of the $3.1 billion increase from a year ago.
Intel-owned inventories were slightly down from the second quarter. As we look more broadly at the worldwide PC supply chain, we believe inventories stayed at healthy levels and continue to be tightly managed by our customers.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 63%, up nearly 3 points from the second quarter. As expected, gross margin benefited from seasonally higher volume, lower unit costs as we ramped 32 nanometer factories, lower factory startup costs as we started 22 nanometer production and lower charges related to the Cougar Point product issue from earlier in the year.
Across all measures of profit, the third quarter was our best ever. Operating income of $4.8 billion was 34% of revenue, up over 3 points from the second quarter. Third quarter net income of $3.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.65 are up 17% and 25% respectively from a year ago. After excluding acquisition-related accounting impacts, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 was up 1/3 from a year ago.
In 2011, we have increased our employment by approximately 17,000 people, driven by acquisitions and hiring in research and development and manufacturing. And while business levels remain strong, the uncertainty around 2012 GDP growth rates has caused us a slow hiring for the rest of this year. As a result of this, our R&D and MG&A for the third quarter came in $150 million lower than the outlook we gave in July, reducing our spending as a percent of revenue to 29%.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2011, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.7 billion. Year-over-year revenue growth is expected to remain strong, growing 28% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The midpoint of the fourth quarter range is up 3% from the third quarter, lower than average historical seasonality based on concerns about economic growth in Europe.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be up a couple of points from the third quarter at 65% as a result of higher volume, lower unit costs and lower startup costs. The fourth quarter gross margin forecast assumes a late quarter qualification for sale of Ivy Bridge, our first product on 22 nanometer.
The cash generation of our business remains strong, and in fact, increased significantly in the third quarter, with record cash flow from operations of $6.3 billion. Over the course of the year, we have made both significant investments in our business and have systematically increased the return of cash to our shareholders via increases in the amount of free cash flow we allocate to the dividend and via buybacks. Additionally, in the third quarter, we took advantage of record-low interest rates and borrowed $5 billion, primarily for the purpose of repurchasing stock. This was one of those rare opportunities where the weighted average after-tax cost of the debt was approximately 1/2 that of our dividend yield on the date of issuance.
Total cash investments ended the quarter at $15.2 billion, up $3.7 billion from the second quarter. So far this year, we have generated over $14 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $3 billion in dividends, purchased nearly $8 billion in capital assets and repurchased $10 billion in stock.
Since restarting our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2010, we have purchased over 500 million shares and reduced diluted shares outstanding by over 350 million shares. Additionally, we're announcing today that our Board of Directors has approved a $10 billion increase to the authorization limit for share repurchases.
The third quarter results illustrate several of the business drivers that we articulated at our investor meeting in May. Emerging markets are growing as a result of increased affordability of the technology that we sell. Our Notebook business saw strong unit growth at a very healthy mix. Our enterprise business continues to grow rapidly and generate high returns as data centers are built to support the explosion of devices that are computing and connecting to the Internet. The integration of both the Intel Mobile Communications Group and McAfee went well. Each had strong quarters and offered new opportunities to differentiate our core business as well as grow in new areas. And lastly, we are generating increasing shareholder return via increases in our dividend and we are contributing to record earnings per share via our buybacks. These trends have us on track to achieve record revenue and record profit in 2011.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.",855

Before we begin the Q&A, I want to announce the change in our Investor Relations team here at Intel. When Kevin started in the role of Director of Investor Relations nearly 5 years ago, I told him he couldn't leave until our revenue was over $50 billion. Our revenue is on track to $55 billion this year, so it's time to announce that Kevin will be moving into a new role in marketing, where he'll be responsible for global advertising, online marketing and corporate events for the company. Therefore, I'm pleased to announce that Mark Henninger is taking over the role of Director of Investor Relations. Mark is known by many of you already and brings over 15 years of Intel experience with over 3 years of IR experience to the position. Of note, I'd like to say that I plan to hold Mark to the same standard as Kevin, which means that he can't leave the role until we're up another 55% and hit $85 billion in revenue.
With that, I'd like to thank Kevin for his leadership and welcome Mark to the role. We will now have Mark take us through the Q&A portion of the meeting.",200

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3265.0,173933.0,10746265.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,9,"Well, there are a couple of things. But the short answer to your question is that everything we envision for Ultrabook presumes that this happens at mainstream price points. Right? And so we don't think that people are going to spend more money on average for computers tomorrow than they spend today. So that's built into our model. Having said that, when you look at where Ultrabooks are this holiday season, they're in the $899, to $1,000, maybe $1,100 at the high end some of them. I think a year from now, you'll see them at, say, $699 and up. And at those price points, that there's plenty of room for Intel's Core Processor family to be in there. Second of all, as the form factor comes down, Intel's built-in materials in these Ultrabooks has a chance to go up, integrated graphics is used more often that not, solid-state drives will be used more often that not. And then the third point I'd make is around the ecosystem. Today, thin costs more. And so a lot of the components, not necessarily chips, but other things like the touchscreens or the batteries or the low-profile hard drives or solid-state drives cost a little bit more. And so what Intel's $300 million Ultrabook fund is aimed at is really accelerating the volume price points through volume commitments and investments for those components such that the industry can't collectively hit those price points. So I think that we've really thought this through in terms of how to get volume and profitably at the same time.",262

In terms of all the events happening in Thailand now and the comments from the [indiscernible] manufacturers, what is your sense as to what impact this will have on the PC supply chain?

What do you think is going on? Are you gaining share from AMD? Are you gaining share of silicon content in the PC? Is this just what we should expect for an organic growth in PCs? Any clarification there would be helpful.",63
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3265.0,173933.0,10746270.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,14,"This is Stacy. I think it's really a continuation of the trends that we've been talking about. The emerging market demand was strong across the board. The Enterprise segment of the business was strong and it offset slower sales in the mature market consumer segment of the market. To your question on share gain with AMD, we'll wait and see their results. Our sense is we may have picked up a little bit of revenue share at the end of the quarter. But just to quantify that, I think it was probably on the order of $50 million to $100 million of impact to our business. I think the broader impact there is the leading-edge process technology becomes more and more complex, and we believe, becomes more of a competitive differentiator going forward. And not just with AMD, we're seeing this across-the-board. We're solving these problems a full generation ahead of everybody else. They're very difficult problems to solve. By being ahead of the rest in the industry, we can bring more features, more performance, bring cost down, be more power efficient. I think that has been a big driver of our business, and I think it will continue to be so.",202

And I guess, if you could just share with us your view on the important vectors to compare x86 or Medfield or whatever the proper processor name for you guys is versus ARM, and when should we expect to see you guys shipping x86 into volume handsets?",70
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3265.0,173933.0,10746272.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,16,"Sure. Well, the short answer to your question, the last part of your question, is what I said earlier, which is you'll see Intel-based phones in the first half of next year from a variety of suppliers. And we won't make any announcements until those phones are ready to be shown in public. But the other answer to your question is that there is -- just like there's no one ARM, there's no one version of Atom going into these devices. We have -- Intel has tailored Atom for low-end PCs, it's now tailoring it for tablets. We're tailoring different versions of it for handsets and cellphones, and other versions for embedded and automotive implementations. And the ARM guys have done a lot of that in the past with different derivatives of their products. As the need for computing performance goes up, both the Intel architecture and the ARM architectures face the same fundamental physics problems, which is more performance requires more transistors. So at the end of the day, to deliver multi-core performance, better graphics performance in a battery-constrained environment is going to be a function of the transistors more than the microarchitecture. And that's where Stacy's comments on our transistor advantage, today and going forward, become critically important in understanding how this will play out.",217
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3265.0,173933.0,10746273.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,17,"Okay. Mark, let me just -- let me also add to that. I hear this argument a lot about ARM coming into the PC segment of the market, and the way I hear it articulated from some of our competitors is they're talking about they're going to come into that segment of the market, which is the low -- very low end of the PC market with a $30 processor to compete against our $100 processor and therefore, they win. I think if you look at the low end of the market today, it's pretty instructive. We're there today with $30 processors where we make a very good product margin on, actually, $30 kits in that segment of the market. AMD, our prime competitor, is in there, well under our pricing. They're selling at a $20-kit pricing. We still win the lion share of that market, and we win the lion share of that market because we bring more performance, we bring features, we're a reliable supplier, we have high quality levels. All of the benefits of doing business with Intel shine through there. It's going to be the same issue with ARM. All of those advantages will be even more so against ARM. And with AMD, they're socket and application compatible. With ARM, they're not. And so the cost and the complexity to our consumers is quite a bit higher. So I'm really confident in our play in that space. And as Paul said, at the end, it all comes down to we're solving these problems of physics 2 years ahead of the rest of the industry, that gives us a cause-to-performance a future advantage that become very difficult for people to match.",284

What's outperforming, what's underperforming within your various segments?",35
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3265.0,173933.0,10746276.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,20,"Sure. I'd be happy to. So first, I want to put that in perspective. It's 28% revenue growth year-on-year off of the back of a strong 2010. 2010 was a strong year for us. But you would look at the 3% and say against a kind of wide range of seasonal outcomes, that's kind of at the lower end or below the seasonal average. When you deconstruct what's going on, I think that we're a little cautious on Q4 based on, as I said in my prepared remarks, just macroeconomic concerns, particularly in Europe. And you have to remember that Q4 is a very strong consumer quarter and that has been a section of the market that has been sluggish really all year. So that's one. We're hearing from our customers that they're going to manage inventory to very lean levels, supply chain inventory very lean levels. So that also is, I think, a little bit of a headwind, assuming that in-demand ends up where we're predicting it to be. And then third, our IMC business, Intel Mobile Communications group, is down a bit. We have one key customer that's moved to a multi-source strategy. By the way, we knew that when we did the deal, but it's now coming to fruition, and so they'll be down a couple of hundred million dollars as we go from very a strong Q3 to Q4.",233

And I guess my question there is, are you pulling in the 1272 so that, that will actually come in faster? Is that still on track for where you thought it would be 6, 9 months ago?",72

And remember, the capital we're spending this year is kind of 22 nanometer peak, it's the front edge of 14 nanometer, it's putting in place the space to support the fact that we're now a $55 billion business that's growing. So the kind of short-term movements don't really impact the capital budget. But to your question, 20 nanometer is similar to what we have believed all year.",82

A lot of buckets within that. What's been kind of outperforming versus kind of underperforming? And as you think about maybe that maintaining at 15% top line year-over-year growth rate, you kind of had been flat here for the last couple of quarters. What's the drive to kind of the next leg of growth there?",71
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3265.0,173933.0,10746281.0,Answer,Paul Otellini,,Executives,25,"Well, I think there's 3 elements of the business. There's the classic enterprise data center, which has been going through a sort of secular consolidation over several years now, starting with Nehalem, where people are moving from older generations of 1 and 2P servers to MP virtualized machines. And that, we've only begun to see the impact of that and some of the early hints on Romley that I talked about are indicative of the upside we still have in corporate enterprise data centers. The second big clump is in the Internet data centers. And those -- that growth rate, which is basically tracking the cloud growth rate, is really quite strong. Those customers tend to buy in a more lumpy pattern, around our best technology. So you might imagine that some of those large customers may be waiting for our next generation products to be deployed, which are being shipped now, but they'll start deploying in the next several months. And then the third one is in things around servers in the data center, networking and enterprise, and those businesses have been quite strong. You saw EMC's announcement this morning and our announcement that we had a record quarter in storage. There's really no difference in that. People are adding storage capacity as fast as they're having cloud computing capacity because they go hand and glove. I think that the biggest issue relative to the quarterly trends is probably this lumpiness in the Internet data centers.",247

We looked back at Westmere, and what we saw is in the first 90 days, they converted, that 90% of our sales to them we're on the new technology. And so as Paul said, I think we saw a little bit of a stall in Q3 as they were waiting for the Sandy Bridge version, and that's now telling for revenue and we're seeing acceleration in the business. So I think that skews those quarterly results somewhat.",106

And then as my follow-up, Stacy, you gave us ASPs at the platform level. I'm kind of curious when you look within the PC client group, with MPU revenue up 15% versus chipset up 6% sequentially, can you help me understand on the MPU side, what was unit driven versus ASP and are you benefiting as you're tucking in integrated graphics?

We're selling this as a platform of capabilities. And so I think that the most intellectually honest way for us to talk about it is at a platform level. In terms of what drove the Q3 results, it was really all units. Quarter-on-quarter pricing was relatively flat. It was a unit-driven story. We saw double-digit growth across PC units, and notebooks were notably stronger than the average.",89

We ended Q3 lean and they all continue to be lean. So, I guess, what articulated is I think we're a bit below -- when I say we, the worldwide PC supply chain, kind of a bit below model today. It's healthy to lean, and we don't think that they're going to grow inventory levels in the fourth quarter.",68

Let me add something you didn't ask, but wanted to color my comments, which is the shape of Q3. And as we went through Q3, we saw September being very strong. So we didn't see a tail off at all in the third quarter. In terms of customer forecast, it's really -- it's an interesting dynamic that they are, obviously, moving very rapidly around the enterprise sales, but everyone is cautious around consumer sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe. And not less so obviously in emerging markets. The other dynamic that's here is that there seems to be an adequate supply of components to build, in particular, laptops. So screens, power supplies, hard drives, all the stuff that a quarter ago was a little empty because of the tsunami, seems to be in more than adequate supply. At the same time, for other reasons, macroeconomic reasons, it's now cheaper to ship by air than it was in prior quarters. So our customers have more flexibility on the upside for taking turns environment should they see opportunity over the course of this quarter than we've seen in a couple of quarters. And so I think what you've got is them just staging to be cautious and not get caught on the downside with inventory, but to be ready to pounce on any upside opportunity.",234

We tend to not talk about the level of cash that we're targeting, nor do we talk about, on a prospective basis, buybacks. But I'll go back and talk about our strategy and put it in place. I think you're right. You have identified, we -- between Paul and I and the Board have had robust conversations, made a very conscious decision to prioritize and articulate the strategy of what we're going to do with cash. And as I've said before, it's first and foremost invest in our business. You can see we're doing that in areas where we think we get tremendous value, it's leading-edge process technology, it's buying companies like McAfee and IMC where we think we generate important differentiated capabilities. Second is the dividend. And I will try to be very explicit that we are allocating more of our free cash flow to the dividend, and what I said at the investor meeting is that I'm targeting something on the order of 40% of free cash flow via dividend payout. And then we continue to use the buyback then as the third way that we return cash to shareholders and the combination of generating a lot of cash in 2011 and the fact that we were bringing down our cash balances sum from where they were to where they are, led to a pretty significant buyback to date. And I'm sure it didn't escape your notice that we also announced today that the Board has authorized, at Paul's and my request, another $10 billion buyback authorization.",269

So in terms of mix and uptake of new products, in the last 4, 5 years, the emerging markets, at least, have not behaved materially different than our mature markets. That is the Tier 1 cities in China or Brazil tend to buy essentially the same products that you buy in Tier 1 cities of North America or Europe. And there's a very rich mix of products. In fact, for a while China was actually a richer mix than the United States on average. But now we're seeing Tier 3, Tier 4 cities come on. So that's being mitigated a bit. In terms of being able to have visibility, I think the visibility is as good, if not better. In these markets, there is still a reasonably large amount of the business that is still desktop and that is distribution related. And that business, we have almost realtime a visibility into because we don't recognize revenue until a unit is sold out of distribution, which means it goes into a PC, being built that day basically. So I like our visibility in these markets, I like the buying pattern, and I like the rich mix and I like, obviously, the upside opportunity of new buyers.",212

The commentary often centers around what's ARM going to do to Intel next year.

And I think there's a couple of things next year that are intriguing.  One is the growth of Ultrabook, and the other is a new release of Windows. And historically, a new release of Windows has benefited Intel nicely. I think that we -- while there is certainly some possibility of ARM incursion into PC space, I think it's going to be minimal for the reasons that Stacy said earlier. I actually look at it the other way around, which is to date, our presence in tablets has not been that large. With Windows 8, you have a monolithic operating system across PCs and tablets that Intel can participate in and bring in the advantage of legacy support for applications and device drivers. And in that dynamic, I think we have, net, more upside than downside.",141

What I don't understand as easily is your business versus the other component companies that theoretically should sell into those same emerging markets: DRAM, panels, power management, hard disk drives. I mean, all of those things also would sell into those same emerging markets. So can you give us a little bit of perspective on why your business is so much better than theirs?",115

For every laptop, there's a chip and a panel. There is a bit higher fraction of desktops in emerging markets, but not so much that we would throw the data off along the line that you're suggesting. My sense is that -- those industries are far less concentrated. And so it's probably harder for the third-party to get their arms around the dynamics, particularly as there may be some differential quality going into parts selection to some of these markets. People may sell their off-spec panels into cheaper notebooks going into some of these markets, or off-spec memory and things like that. I don't know that that's a big factor, but it's the only thing that comes to mind in trying to explain that economy.",134

And I said earlier, I think at the end of the day in these markets, transistors are going to be a defining point of differentiation.

And I understand the proof's in the pudding here so to some extent you're going to have to wait until we bring a phone up on stage and run it through its paces and bring a tablet up on stage and run it through its paces vis-à-vis the competition to be able to be convinced to this.",148

Stacy, Q3 gross margins were a tad below the expectations. I think the benefits of the 22 nanometer startup cost declines are not as quickly as I think you had previously hoped. What is behind that? And just in sort of a related question, do you expect any additional startup cost as you start thinking about SoC's next year?",65
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2011",2011-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3265.0,173933.0,10746326.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,70,"Yes. So let me just take you -- let me do the Q3 gross margin walk. It wasn't exactly as you stated. I caught several small things. But we had anticipated that we would get benefit from higher volume, lower unit cost, lower startup cost and less impact associated with the Cougar Point product issue that we've had in the first half. We got all of that. We got a point for volume, we got a point for unit cost, we got about 0.5 point for startup cost, 0.5 point of having less Cougar Point. When I go back to the forecast I made, you probably had 3 things that moved in different directions. We got a little more good news than I expected on product cost. I got a little less good news than I expected on startup costs and Cougar Point. None of those were equal to 0.5 point of gross margin. So they're all relatively small, and the combination of them just caused me to round down. So it's kind of as simple as that. In terms of impact of 22 nanometer SoC startup cost, I struggle to answer that question a little bit. We have startup costs all the time. As I've shown in the past, we have a baseline of startup costs and then when we're launching a new process technology, which is for us odd years, you tend to see an elevation in those startup costs. So that hasn't changed. I'd expect startup costs to be less next year, and then they'll elevate again in 2013 as we're starting to bring 14 nanometer to the marketplace. And SoCs don't change that equation for me.",280

And remember, our billings data, as Paul was talking about earlier, will capture typically the channel sales, which is more desktop-oriented -- actually it's almost all desktop-oriented, and it captures server builds, which sometimes are done inside the market. The rest are built by big MNCs, it tends to be build in either Taiwan or China, and then is shipped into Europe.

We saw much slower growth in mature market consumer in EMEA and you'd say it was sub-seasonal growth in that segment. We would expect those trends to continue into Q4.

But in essence, depreciation for the quarter and for the year is right on what we expected. And I'll provide a depreciation forecast for 2012 in January. I just looked at the data, there's no change, Stacy, to the depreciation forecast.",56

As we look into 2012, especially giving Ultrabooks and potentially what Windows 8 is going to do, how should we think about the enterprise versus the consumer in aggregate and what that may or may not mean to Intel's mix, gross margin and ASPs?",68

Enterprise -- big business enterprise, as opposed to small, medium business, represents about 1/3 of our PC sales. And that hasn't changed. That's a large installed base. That installed base is not going to be an early adopter of Windows 8. Enterprise always adopts it after this first service pack is out, which will be sometime in 2013. So I think we've got another year of conversion to Windows 7 ahead of us. As you remember, it is still -- we're not even halfway through the XP and Windows 95 conversion to Win7 right now. So I think that will continue over the course of next year. People will buy machines that are, of course, Win8 ready in their buying patterns as they -- in enterprise next year. In terms of Ultrabook and Win 8, I just -- that really is a function of the health of the consumer market a year from now. And you've seen the same GDP forecast I have. I think it's too early to call that. I will point out that we have been pleasantly -- we've enjoyed good unit growth and good revenue growth the last couple of years in the middle of difficult economic times. And that really speaks to the nature of what our products do for people and businesses. They're tools of productivity. So even in bad times, we've done pretty well. So even if you have -- if you project another year of difficult GDP environment in the mature markets, I would think we could do equally as well, as we have the last couple of years here.",274

How much of that is still Netbooks? And where should we think about that Atom revenue bottoming, and then how should we think about it going up as the embedded side of Atom starts to gain even further revenue traction versus the design win traction you've talked about before?",73

Actually it is, the downward change is all Netbooks. In terms of your question about embedded, like others that play in the industrial and automotive segment of that market, we saw weak results in the third quarter. It's pretty clear there was an inventory overhang out there that people had to work through. When I dig in, in the Embedded business, the data we showed you in May, where we're looking at the design wins that we're engaged in, the design wins that have been won, the architectural conversions, if anything, it looks like we're accelerating in terms of conversions coming to us from MIPS or ARM to Atom. And so I think the long-term pieces of growth in that business is still intact.",132
