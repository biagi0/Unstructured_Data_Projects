Sellers,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today as usual by our Chief Executive Officer, Paul Otellini; and Chief Financial Officer, Stacy Smith. Our earnings release and updated financial statements were released today at approximately 1:15 Pacific Daylight Time, and can be found on our investor website, www.intc.com.  This quarter, we continued the practice that we started last quarter of posting additional management commentary from CFO Stacy Smith to our investor website. This commentary was posted at approximately 1:30 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time, and contains added detail about our quarterly performance that was previously reviewed, and prepared remarks during our conference call.  As we begin our call, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. If during our call today there are any non-GAAP financial references made, we will post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations to our investor website.  So with that, let me now hand it over to Paul for some comments, followed by brief remarks from Stacy. Paul?",210

Our fourth quarter results capped a great year of execution and innovation for Intel. We started the year in one of the deepest recessions in our history and emerged from it with better products and technology, driving new demand for computing worldwide. Our restructuring efforts have borne real fruit by improving the operational efficiency of the company, driving relatively good results in challenging times and exceptional results in a stronger market.  The demand picture in the quarter reflected broad-based strength across all regions and all product categories, with notebooks leading the way. Our product mix was also a notable highlight. Demand for our latest generation of processors, both PC and server, was particularly strong providing an ASP uplift in the quarter. Inventory levels remain in good shape, with OEM comp inventories roughly flat quarter-on-quarter and below level of a year ago.  Distributor inventories are down sequentially. The combination of much stronger sell through and lower year-on-year inventory levels gives us comfort that the supply chain continues to operate very efficiently.  Looking across our product segments, servers had a very strong quarter. The value proposition of Nehalem is clearly evident, and we are seeing a demand shift towards the high end of the performance stack, improving average selling prices. Looking ahead over the next three months, we are planning to refresh our entire server product line with the new 32-nanometer Xeon in the single, dual and multiprocessor segments. It is noteworthy to point out that the Nehalem EX, our multiprocessor version, represents the biggest leap in performance in the history of the Xeon brand.  We remain in an excellent position to benefit from the build out of cloud infrastructure, as well as the reconfiguration of existing state centers for power performance efficiency improvements. Our Atom processor business also continues to do very well, both in netbooks as well as in winning new designs for our growth initiatives. Atom design momentum is very strong, with our new Pine Trail platform in over 80 netbook designs. In the embedded space, we now have over 600 Atom-based design wins and over 2,500 design engagements across 230 customers, 93 of which are brand-new customers to Intel.  At CES, we also demonstrated progress with handheld and consumer electronics platforms built around Atom cores that were very well received. We demonstrated for the first time the LG GW990, a smartphone built with our yet to be released Atom Moorestown platform, which was awarded best smartphone of the show. This demonstrates the power of our architecture in bringing an uncompromising computing experience to handheld devices. Expect more meaningful news and announcements around these businesses during 2010.  Our Notebook business was exceptional this quarter, with demand very strong across the globe. We have been carefully preparing for the shift to mobile, and our product strategy is a reflection of that. To further enhance our PC lineup, at CES, we formally launched 27 new processors produced with our leading-edge 32-nanometer process technology, the biggest consumer launch of new processors since Centrino. Our new core processors are the first ever mainstream PC processors to integrate the graphics engine onto the CPU. This is Moore's Law at work, driving increased performance and improved power and form factor characteristics to our new platforms.  Our new graphics engine is notable, and that it offers full HD video, great mainstream gaming and enhanced 3D capability. I'm happy to report that early demand for these products is excellent.  In closing, we had an outstanding quarter and entered 2010 in a very strong position. We have delivered breakthroughs in our product offerings and our competitive positioning through the Tick Tock development model. Our recently launched 32-nanometer process technology is the critical process capability that will not only bring computing to new levels, but also allow us to broadly offer Atom system-on-chips into many new product categories. We are pleased with our current momentum and look forward to an exciting year in 2010. With that, let me turn the time over to Stacy for a few comments.",671

The fourth quarter was one of our most profitable quarters ever due to a combination of solid execution, the ramp of innovative new products and a healthy consumer market. Fourth quarter revenue at $10.6 billion was up 28% from a year ago, the largest year-on-year percent increase in more than a decade. Our financial results reflect both significant improvements in our cost structure and higher microprocessor average selling prices. The impact of these improvements can be seen in the gross margin percent of 65%, which was up seven points from the third quarter, and is the highest gross margin percent in our history.  In the fourth quarter, we achieved $2.5 billion in operating profit and $2.3 billion in net income. The PC market has recovered nicely, with our microprocessor revenue, excluding Atom, growing 42% since the market bottomed in the first quarter. In the same time period, Atom microprocessors and associated chipsets have grown to $438 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the year. Fourth quarter gross margin benefited from lower inventory write offs, improving costs and our exceptional product lineup as we ramp and sold the first products manufactured on our 32-nanometer process technology. Total inventories increased $450 million due to these new 32-nanometer products.  For 2009, gross margin was 56%, including a 20-point increase from Q1 to Q4. For 2010, we are forecasting continued strong gross margin, with the midpoint of our annual forecast at 61%. As a result of capital we use in achieving efficiencies, we are able to ramp 32-nanometer process technology and still bring down our capital forecast from our expectation at the beginning of the year. Our capital purchases for the year of $4.5 billion is down from our original forecast of around $5.2 billion, and was less than the annual depreciation run rate.  Operating expenses remain in tight control. This is most clearly seen in spending as a percent of revenue. In the fourth quarter, spending for R&D and MG&A as a percent of revenue remained constant at 29% down from 35% in the first quarter, and 32% in the second quarter. The number of employees decreased by 1,000 people in the fourth quarter as a result of planned factory actions announced early in 2009. Revenue per employee for the year is $440,000, the third highest in our history. The fourth quarter of 2009 demonstrates the strength of our execution and business model. Excluding the impact of the $1.25 billion AMD settlement agreement taken in the fourth quarter, operating profit was a quarterly record $3.7 billion, and as a percent of revenue, was 35%.  Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments and debt security trading assets ended the quarter to $13.9 billion, $1 billion higher than the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was more than $3 billion. During the first quarter, we paid the AMD settlement agreement, paid nearly $800 million in dividends and purchased $1.1 billion in capital assets.  For the first quarter, we are forecasting a seasonal decrease in revenue, taking the midpoint of our forecast range to $9.7 billion, a 36% increase from the first quarter of 2009. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to decrease four points from the fourth quarter to 61%.  In addition to the impact of the unit decline, the decrease is primarily due to the higher costs associated with the early ramp of 32-nanometer-based products.  The fourth quarter was a strong finish to what turned out to be a good year. The improvements we have made to our cost structure and efficiency levels have led to exceptional financial results in the fourth quarter, and serviced a strong foundation upon which we can build in 2010 as we refresh our product line and ramp 32-nanometer process technology.  With that, let me turn it back to Kevin.",643

I think that kind of serves as a baseline to talk about Q1 and 2010. What we saw in the fourth quarter was really a very rich mix. We saw strength across-the-board on our new products, and in particular, what we saw was we took the first production on 32-nanometer we filled from the top. And there was good market acceptance of those products. And so the combination of that led to a rich mix in the fourth quarter. I expect that that comes back down into a more mixed range as we go across 2010. In particular, we'll be bringing out mainstream and value versions of the 32-nanometer products, and that should say that the sales mix gets into a more normal range as we progress across the next several quarters.",143

Keep in mind, you have lots of things that go up and down. We'll have a rich mix at the beginning as enterprise coming in. But at the end of the day, we do bring pricing down because we see unit growth potential and consumer segment of the market in emerging markets. There's good price elasticity there. So it's kind of consistent with what you've seen from us the last several years. The price comes down and we drive unit growth with that, and that ends up driving incremental gross margin dollars.",109

It's entirely due to the new 32-nanometer products. If you look at it on a unit basis, it's pretty flat quarter-on-quarter. But we did have the cost associated with 32-nanometer. Those early wafers tend to be pretty high-cost products. And as you have seen us do in prior transitions of new process technology, we pretty quickly build inventory on the new stuff. You saw it in Q4. I expect to build a little bit more inventory in Q1 as I ramp 32-nanometer products. It won't be the same magnitude that we saw this quarter, but it'll be up some. And then it starts looking a little more normal that progresses through the year and relative to demand. But this is what we do as we ramp our new process technology. It's pretty normal. It's consistent with what I was expecting when I started the quarter.",168

So looking at our authorized channel, those inventories are down. We have visibility into OEM inventories and a lot of that is now held in our hubs and what we see in the down channel.

It's a broad complex market out there. It ranges from emerging markets with small white box players to big MMPs. But I think it's pretty good.

That's about 25% to 30% of our business in units and dollars. And that's the number I gave that was down sequentially. The OEM inventory, we have hub systems with our largest customers representing the vast majority of our OEM volume. So you're dealing with something well above 50% product. I don't know the exact number, but I suspect in the aggregate between OEM hubs and distribution, it's 75% of the numbers that we've got very good visibility into. On the Q1 cycle, we actually moved towards a Q1 refresh cycle quite sometime ago. It was better for our customers. They liked it. They don't want to have a disruption before holiday. It's either in the early summer, late Q2, or it's in January, February. And that works out best for them in terms of inventory management, and gets new products out there for what is becoming a big part of the cycle. That's Chinese New Year's.",164

Our view, in terms of what we build into the model, our model for 2010, is a normal seasonal year off of a very good Q4. So in general, when you extrapolate that out and do the math, that gets you to double-digit growth year-on-year because of the high peak in Q4 and the trough that you had in the first half of 2009. We're building into our numbers that a modest recovery of corporate purchases of PCs, that is we're not building in anything extraordinary out of that. Just sort of normal return to deployment as the evaluation cycles for the new hardware in Windows 7 gets completed. What we are benefiting from in the second half of the year, and I think we'll continue to benefit from throughout this year, is the extraordinary return on investment that is incurred by deploying new server technologies. The last technology was sort of a 9:1 ROI kind of technology as we deploy the new Xeon products out. It's 15 and 20:1. We think that that is compelling. The power conservation associated with that is compelling. And that's one of the things that gives us an optimism independent of PC refresh in the enterprise for 2010.",214

I'd say it's a typical year from that perspective. We put up the forecast for Q1, 61% as the midpoint of our forecast range. Typically, we would see as second quarter, from a unit standpoint, is going to be seasonally down. That means that typically the second quarter gross margin is going to be a bit below that 61% and then when we get into the second half of the year, my expectation is it's a bit above that 61% and that's how we get to 61% on average for the year.",102

I'll just say our expectation is that based on our performance leadership and the software compatibility and the value proposition around IA, that we can grow those businesses with a very healthy product margin, not dilute the overall gross margins of the company. We've run a record of saying that. I think if you look at the two businesses that are of significant size today, they're both consistent with that belief. Our embedded business, the $1 billion-plus business, it's running at product margins that are a little bit ahead of what the rest of our core business runs. Atom in netbooks, we've grown that to be now in a $1.4 billion business for us in 2009. Also the product margin is right in there with the rest of the core business.

Obviously, in 2009, the end market pricing for PCs came down pretty dramatically, roughly 20% to 30% in some instances.

The first half of the year, the lights had gone off, right? What we saw over the course of the year was growth particularly in notebooks and some netbooks around consumer purchases. It was not a robust year for corporate purchases. And that alone, that mix shift alone to consumer and away from corporate, was part of the reason you saw PC prices, on average, being lower, dropping faster than you would have ordinarily seen, point one. Point two is that there really wasn't a new refresh cycle in terms of hardware last year. We had versions of our core product line that are out there, but they were extensions of the existing technology. There was nothing really to drive sell up.

On top of that, I think while we continued growth, just like there has been over the last three or four years in emerging markets where the emerging markets outpaced the mature ones. And clearly, in emerging markets, the average selling price of computers is lower than it is in New York City. I think it's important to kind of separate the mix within the segments of the market from the overall mix of our sales. We are refreshing products who were likely to have a nice benefit from that inside of each of the segments, but the drive over the last four or five years, Adam, has been emerging markets growing faster than the mature markets, consumer growing faster than the rest of the market. And there's good pricing elasticity there. It benefits us to bring the price down and fill our technology into those segments.",152

You guys showed good discipline in the quarterly returns in 2009, and when I look at your first quarter guidance of $2 billion for $9.7 billion of revenue, I'm a little bit surprised because it's roughly the same revenue number that you had in first quarter of 2008, yet your operating expenses are $200 million lower.

We're still absolutely on the path that over time, we're bringing down spending as a percent of revenue. And I think we have had some good results in the last couple of quarters and our goal over time is, that we're going to continue to do that. When we look at 2010, you can kind of think of our spending in a couple of different buckets. First off, we are making some investments in R&D projects this year. We had five years in a row of year-over-year employment declines. We'll actually grow employment a little bit in 2010, so you haven't seen that from us in a long time, but we have some high return on investment projects. We were going to go make some incremental investments. Secondly, there's a series of things that aren't really related to the employment level that are going to impact the spending level in 2010. One is, the categorization of how we categorize process engineering from year-to-year. Remember, last year it was cost of sales; this year, it's R&D. So that shift happens in kind of a digital fashion, and so that impacts the quarter to quarter lock [ph] that you were doing. We're giving raises, we had revenue dependent spending this year that's going to be higher than last year. So the combination of those two things is really what you're seeing on the spending line. Neither of those changes the commitment that we're getting great results through our focus on efficiency, and we plan to continue to bring that down over time.",276

You're building out new businesses that you're not in right now around the mobile space and whatnot.

The OpEx growth, when you kind of think of it over the course of the year, there's a couple of those elements that just gets spread quarter to quarter. So the categorization of the research and development has happened digitally. I failed to mention, we're also picking up Wind River in 2010. That was an acquisition that we did in the back half of last year, so it's kind of spread across every quarter. We do the same way with the profit- and revenue-dependent spending, so it's probably a little flatter than you would expect, and the increase in R&D projects in the scheme of things doesn't move the number that much. And we are, as we have been, we're finding efficiencies in other places that offset some of that. So when you kind of take all that alchemy together, you end up  with a number that's kind of flattish quarter by quarter by quarter.",156

I'll try and give you some color on that, John. I'm not sure I can fill in all the holes. We're all guessing, no one knows for sure. As I said earlier, we're not programming into our guidance or our estimates any kind of overnight recovery of the corporate market. I think for a variety of reasons that will start coming back, but able to come back based upon eval cycles, qualification cycles and IT shops. And then as corporate budgets open up, they have to decide whether they want to first buy PCs or servers in terms of IT equipment. And we really haven't seen enough so far, except the server run-up in the second half, to be confident on when and what the rate of corporate PC refresh would be, although we have built some into this. Number two, in terms of Atom, we've now been at this for 18 months, a little bit more than that, and up to this point in time, now with all that data, we have not seen any meaningful cannibalization of the notebook market by netbooks. Netbooks look to be for, 90% of them are clearly additive and they're clearly going into market segments that were unaddressed prior to this. In the first 18 months of the netbook, most people who bought them were buying them as incremental machines or travel companions, principally in mature markets or tier one cities of emerging markets. I think that in 2010, you'll start seeing that phenomenon move into emerging markets. And as that does, there may be a slightly higher mix of Atom, but it certainly wouldn't be cannibalistic to our notebook business. And so we're kind of playing all these together in a stew and saying, this is how we see the year coming out.",302

I've kind of had to go through a walk, so if you'll bear with me, Craig, I'll do that. Q4 came in, several of the elements as we expected. We did see good news associated with the qualification for sale of 32-nm products, as well as sell through of some of the previously reserved material there. That was about two and a half points of the increase we saw in Q4. We got the good news that we are expecting in CPU volumes. They were seasonally up in the quarter. We got the good news we were expecting in lower excess capacity and, in fact, our excess capacity charges have now gone to zero for the quarter, which we haven't been there since the end of last year. The places where it was a little unexpected is, the bump we saw in CPU ASPs. That was a couple of points of good news that I wasn't expecting when I first set the forecast, and it was a little better in terms of unit costs, and I expected not a lot, but a little. Then if you move into Q1, the drivers that take us from 64% down to 61%, first --  65%, it's even hard for me to say that as an all-time record, 65% down to 61%. The first is, we're going to see some higher CPU cost. This is very consistent with what I showed you at the Investor meeting last May. Those first wafers coming off of 32-nm as we're loading the factories tend to be pretty expensive. That's what ended up in inventory, that's what ships out in Q1, that's going to drive a little bit of a cost increase and then we kind of come down as we go through the year. So very consistent with what I showed you there. And it's a seasonally down quarter from Q4, so we get a little bit of downward pressure as a result of lower CPU sales volumes. And then I do expect in Q1, my mix is a little less rich than what I sold in Q4, that's about half a point. So that's how you get to the 61%. I'll pause there and see if that makes sense, and then I'll take you through the year so I don't get too far ahead of you. In a previous question, I kind of gave what I expected to be the shape of the year. We started 61%, Q2 tends to be seasonally down, so I expect that to be down some from 61%. Then if you do the math, you'd say that we're forecasting a second half gross margin that's something above 61%, in the low sixties. And I think the debate you and I will have at some point is, why is that in the low sixties versus in the mid-sixties? And it really comes back to the conversation we've been having on ASP. A lot of things go right to get us into that low sixties. We've got unit costs coming down, relatively benign period in terms of other cost of sales, so we don't have significant start-up costs or excess capacity charges or anything like that. Paul articulated, we're anticipating a robust unit growth that keeps the factories pretty full. But we are anticipating that pricing comes down some from where we are today, and that brings us down a couple to a few points over the course of the year.",597

It says a lot of things are going right for us, so I don't want to jinx this by talking about what has to go from a great gross margin to a perfect gross margin, if you will. The forecast is assuming declining unit costs. It's assuming that we're in kind of the benign cycle in terms of start-up costs and other cost of sales, assuming good volume growth. So all that's baked in. We see also just continued great performance out of factory network from a productivity and an efficiency standpoint, and that helps our costs. If you wanted the scenario that would take us higher than that, it would be a flattening out of the ASP curve or a richer mix, or more units than what we have baked in. And likewise, I can come up with a list that takes me into the lower end of the range, where we have a less rich mix or the unit growth isn't as robust as we thought, and our factories aren't as full.",190

And as you're thinking about upside to the year, may that play a factor in -- sorry, it's the second part. Do you feel comfortable you're going to have enough capacity?",48

What we saw in netbooks in the fourth quarter, last three or four months of the year, was carriers became a very significant portion of the volume of netbooks, probably in the range of quarter of them, 25%. And what we're seeing -- what led me to my comments earlier about netbook growth in emerging markets was really based upon our view that the carrier model will be very efficient in those markets because there's a low entry price subsidized model just like cell phones are, and you get the PC and the bandwidth the same time. So I think that's likely to be a good piece of the netbook business, a growing piece of the netbook business over the course of 2010. In terms of upside, we built a pretty significant growth in that into the numbers that are ready. So I don't know that there'd be much upside there. Secondly, in terms of capacity, no, I don't see any issues on the horizon. We're planning for a very high end of a robust growth from a capacity standpoint in terms of the wafer starts that we need to put in place. And even then, we have time to make some incremental decisions for the, say, fourth quarter '10 kind of volumes over the course of this year. So we'll watch the first half of the year and then make the calls, but right now we believe we have enough buffer capacity coming on, particularly on the 32-nm ramp, and we have the older 45-nm lines still intact to be able to handle virtually anything I can imagine being thrown at us.",295

Typically, there's no such thing as an average design win in Embedded. But typically, it's sort of a year to 18 months from initial conversation to production, and we are -- and along the way in that initial conversation, you end up closing the design maybe a third of the way through that. And then these units tend to run for multiple years, in some cases, 10 years. We're not projecting, our Embedded business has grown at double digit percent the last three years. It will continue to, I think, outgrow the company in terms of revenue. But I'm not going to give you a precise number.",132

But what we're doing with this cycle, in general, is using the technology to move 32-nm into the mainstream more quickly than we did the 45-nm. And the rate of crossover between 32-nm and 45-nm will be more a function of second half demand in total than capacity planning to cut one off versus the other. If demand is red-hot, the transition will be slower even though we'll ramp 32-nm as fast as possible. And if it's less red-hot, it'll be slower. In terms of Pine Trail, I think we'll move pretty quickly to transition to that.",140

A year ago at this time, the industry was in the midst of a sharp correction with many expecting it to continue for an extended period. We saw signals of the bottoming then, and now a year later, the industry has nearly fully recovered. At Intel, we focused on expanding our Nehalem architecture, getting our 32 nanometer process technology ready and the designing alternatives and derivatives of our new Atom processor for many new market segments. As a result of that focus , we started this year with the best product lineup we've ever had with leadership in all segments and categories. Demand for these new products has been incredible and as a result, Intel achieved a record first quarter in revenue and in operating income. It was notable this quarter the demand for our higher end PC products was particularly strong, which helped improve margins and profitability. Our Mobile business set a new revenue record as demand for notebooks continues to be excellent. We're also seeing signs of corporate demand returning, which we believe will continue to improve given the age of the corporate PC fleet and the compelling ROI that our new generation observers presents. Looking at the supply chain, we continue to see aggregate inventories operating within normal, healthy ranges. Intel's own inventory remains lean. OEM inventories are flat quarter-on-quarter and downstream channel inventories are also within normal ranges. We watch inventory levels and sell-through activity very carefully and we remain comfortable with the supply chain conditions. In our manufacturing environment, our factory teams have executed the ramp of our 32 nanometer process superbly. We exceeded output expectations with lower costs than originally anticipated and are currently shipping over 50 SKUs on 32 nanometers. 32 nanometers is our fastest ramping process ever, and I'm pleased to note that we are accelerating the ramp of our third and fourth 32 nanometer factories faster than our original plan, such that by early Q4, we will have four factories in production on 32 nanometers. Lastly, we were excited about our next generation of processors codenamed Sandy Bridge. We began volume sampling in Q1, shipping thousands of samples to a broad range of customers and are planning for volume production later this year. As we look forward, we are optimistic about the prospects of our business for the rest of 2010 and beyond. Our product portfolio, combined with our excellent execution and the ongoing benefits from restructuring, have us positioned for continued profitable growth. This is a great way to begin 2010 and I look forward to seeing many of you here in May for our Investor Meeting, where we will talk in more detail about how we plan to build on this momentum and further exploit the growth opportunities before us. With that, let me turn the meeting back over to Stacy.",474

The strength in our business model can be seen in the first quarter results. Record first quarter revenue of $10.3 billion resulted in record first quarter operating profit of $3.4 billion and cash flow from operations of approximately $4 billion. This better-than-expected financials resulted from strong sales of our new products. Microprocessing unit sales declined slightly less than seasonal and average selling prices for microprocessors were up slightly quarter-on-quarter. Supply chain inventory levels appear to be healthy after several quarters of replenishment. The Mobile Computing segment was particularly strong with customer demand for our new products leading to an increase in mobile microprocessor average selling prices and record mobile microprocessor revenue. First quarter gross margin of 63.4% was higher than our expectation. The factory network performed well in the first quarter, ramping 32 nanometer process technology, controlling costs and reacting quickly to meet customer demand. The first quarter demonstrates the impact of our work and improving our cost structure. Spending was 30% of revenue and operating profit of $3.4 billion was 33% of revenue. The number of employees was approximately flat in the first quarter with revenue per employee of $129,000, the third highest in our history. Moving to the balance sheet, total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments and trading assets, ended the quarter at $16.3 billion, $2.4 billion higher than the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations was approximately $4 billion. During the first quarter, we paid nearly $900 million in dividends and purchased over $900 million in capital assets. We are forecasting a revenue decrease for the second quarter that is slightly less than our average seasonal decline, taking the midpoint of our forecast range to $10.2 billion, a 27% increase from the second quarter of 2009. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to increase one point from the first quarter to 64%. For 2010, we are now forecasting a record annual gross margin with the midpoint of our annual forecast increasing from 61% to 64%. The investments we are making in leading edge process technology, the strength of our product line, a continued focus on our cost structure and strong worldwide demand led to the record results we saw in the first quarter and a record financial results we are forecasting for the second quarter in the year. With that, let me turn it back to Kevin.",398

Let me start, John, by giving you just, say, kind of a bit of detail about the puts-and-takes. So first off, first half gross margin a little bit below 64%, 64% for the year. So the math gets you to some modest increase in gross margins in the second half over and above the kind of record gross margin levels that we're achieving in the first half. As I think about the second half, let's first focus on the core business. I expect that to be slightly positive to gross margin. I think that we'll see increase in volume, that helps a bit. We're going to see a decrease in cost, that helps a bit. Offset a little bit by a decrease in average selling prices, kind of a less than what you normally see decrease in volume prices, combination of that makes that slightly positive. I also expect in the second half of this year to have a little bit lower start-up cost environment, so those two things are positive. And then offsetting some of that is an increase in write-offs. We'll be building, as Paul said, the Sandy Bridge product. That's the new microarchitecture that lands on 32 nanometer, so in the context of Tick Tock, that would be the Tock. And as you saw with Westmere, the product that we build prior to qualification for sale will be written off. And so we'll see a little bit of an increase in write-offs in the second half of the year, and that offsets some of the positives that I mentioned.",263

We saw it on the first quarter where we've seen some real signs of PC purchases, corporate SKUs picking back up again. Some of that was wrapped around our new products, the Arrandale notebook products. But some of that was also just even some of our older SKUs that are just kind of classic running corporate SKUs also picked up. And to me, that suggests that the average fleet of notebooks is four years old out there, the average fleet of desktops is five years old. You're getting to the point where as CIOs are feeling a bit better about their business, it makes economic sense to swap these out just from an ongoing cost of ownership standpoint.",119

In fact, in the first quarter, we ended up shipping more 32 nanometer microprocessors than we first planned, principally driven by demand for those products and I guess the overall health of the business environment in general, which was not planned a quarter ago. Looking forward, we'll use a combination of the four 32 nanometer factories and our existing 45 nanometer factories to be able to satisfy, I think, almost any demand scenario you could imagine out there. In terms of other people's supply, which is what I thought you were hinting out at first, I really don't see any fundamental constraints. If I look at all the pieces, the components that go together in terms of memory, and screens, and batteries and so forth, that would retard the industry's ability to meet almost any demand scenario.",155

The strength of our business, as Paul said, surprises the strength of cash generation was also surprising. But what you should take from the fact that we've been doing minimal buybacks over the last year is that we're growing our cash balance. Frankly, we're looking at some strategic investments and evaluating those in that context. We're growing the cash balances and we're comfortable with the levels of cash we have. The priority in terms of capital structure in terms of returning cash to the shareholders is the dividend. You saw us increase that in Q4. We've had multiple years where we've increased the dividend without fail. And just putting it in context from 2006, I think, our dividend per share was about $0.40 per share. Based on the increased we just did, we're at $0.63 per share, so a nice increase in the dividend over time and that continues to be the priority.",157

When you talk to your customers, what do you expect, what do they expect in terms of demand trends between corporate versus consumer for the rest of the year? And what will be the implications for your business?",62

Consumer has been the driver, I think, throughout this cycle not just in the fourth quarter of last year. But I think I talked last year about China in particular in the early part of last year, and then the United States and Europe in the second half of last year. I think the overall shift to mobility is one of the mega trends that's out there, both in the consumer standpoint and in the corporate standpoint. The first quarter and even our first half numbers, I think are buoyed by a combination of things, that's a very healthy China and Chinese New Year scenario. I think the new products we've launched have a pretty compelling pull at the end market level, simplified branding, lots of really good features, et cetera. And lastly, now you're to starting to see some corporate PC purchases re-emerge. I'm still not going to go out on a limb and our customers certainly aren't going to go out on a limb and say, ""There's a corporate refresh snapback coming."" I think what we see in this cycle is much more people are buying things to replace older machines because it's just cheaper. And they're doing that on their budgets as they free up a bit more money here and there. I think they'll also make the trade-offs between PCs and servers and software as they go forward. And right now, hardware seems to be doing pretty well on that trade-off.",248

Should we consider that 65% a peak number? And if you guys have some more higher write-offs at the end of this year, is that a good thing for next year, when the write-offs being lower next year in the Tick Tock model?",79

So in terms of the gross margin forecast for this year at 64%, that's an annual record. You're right, we're likely to have some quarters above that. I think you're really asking, ""Does it change my long-term view of the kind of gross margin profile of the company?"" If you hearken back to a year ago, as Paul says, the depth of the reception when we were down in the mid-40s, I articulate this normal range to be in between 50% and 60%. I think we spent one quarter in that normal range and then we've been above it every quarter since. And this year, it looks like we'll be above it every quarter. On that question, I think I'll defer answering it until we get to the Investor Meeting. I think that's a much better platform for talking about how we're looking at longer-term gross margin trends. To the more tactical part of that, there'll be lots of puts-and-takes to the H1 '11 gross margin. But yes, you would expect to see that the inventory that we write off prior to qualification for sale, assuming that, that ends up being sellable inventory, will be a benefit to gross margin where we get into the subsequent quarters. Now that's one of many elements, but that element would likely be positive assuming that, that qualification goes as we expected to and as prior qualifications have gone.",239

But I think there's other things that are woven into it. We're still in the very steep part of the ramp on the 32 nanometers, bringing that into the product line. There's still, as I said earlier, a lot of pull for that product. We were slightly behind, quite frankly, satisfying all the demand that our customers wanted on 32 in the first quarter, even though we were producing much more than we first thought. We expect to catch up to that demand in the second quarter on 32 nanometers over the course of the quarter. So I think part of that is just the excitement around the new products on the PC side, number one. Number two, the Nehalem-EX product, which is our new multiprocessor product, began shipping in the last two weeks of the quarter. I think that'll have a full quarter effect. So far, there's something like 30 systems that have been announced and the receptivity and the pent-up demand for that, I think, is very good. So you get a combination of those things, all driven by new products that I think will give us that better than seasonality picture that we're painting.",205

First is, that we saw a pick up in what we call the transactional business. This is tempt to be uniprocessor servers based on the Nehalem parts that are sold by both the channel and our OEM customers typically into a small and medium business environment. So I think that's a good sign and we haven't seen that kind of demand profile before in the transactional volume, at least not in the last half of 2009. The fact that, that came back was one of the positive signs and is leading us to the guidance we gave for Q2. And then we also, I think, there was some -- as people moved towards the transition of the older multiprocessing lines to the newer multiprocessing line, they basically thin down their inventories in anticipation of the launch of the EX, and now we'll have a full quarter to ship in Q2 with that product line.",176

And if you look at it with a clear economic eye, you refresh the servers first. That builds our infrastructure up, that gives you the fastest return on investment. You probably can squeak out another quarter or so with your PC fleet. And I also think that corporations are likely to deploy Win 7, so that people have to qualify that and get the SKUs ready, and I think that's what's happening now. So I don't think it was really a lag effect. I tend to think it was much more of clear view what the return on investment was, versus the cost savings that replaced in the PCs that you're now seeing a bit more latitude on.",135

If you look in terms of the total year last year and our view for the total year this year, we really don't see a change. I think we suggested that netbooks seem to be settling out at about 20% of the mobile form factors, and on an annual basis, that looks to be about right. And I would expect pretty significant year-on-year growth in the Netbook business. I think that netbooks in general have become -- though they are by definition, a consumer purchase, there is no corporate netbook market that we found. And it was pretty robust in the fourth quarter. You had a lot of new entrants coming to the marketplace, large companies really coming into the first time. And I think that seasonality plus maybe a bit of the overhang from a number of players coming in the fourth quarter is what we saw in Q1 where Atom was down a bit more than what we would normally see as seasonal.",174

And yes, the way you characterize it is the way I see it. Because of the increases we saw over the course of the quarter and demand on the new mobile platform, Arrandale, I wasn't able to get as much inventory in place as I hoped. If you look at it between dollars and units, what you see is units are up a bit more than dollars, but still not as much as I'd want as we kind of move into the second quarter, and based on the strength that we're seeing and the ramp of these new products. If you deconstruct the inventory between the processes, what we saw is more than 100% of the increase in inventory and more than 100% of the increase in units was on 32 nanometer. So we got a little bit in place there, and everything else was down.

The way that we're loading the factories is we're bringing out the high end of the product line first. And so I think what we saw in Q1 was a pretty rich mix, and I expect, as we go through the year, it'll be a more normal mix. But I also think you have to keep, I guess, the contextual background of -- I'm now expecting 2010 to be a year where ASPs come down some, but less than what the long-term model would suggest.

And even within them, certainly, the first quarter, the mix-up to Core i5 versus i3 was very solid. Now as we bring on more capacity, you get a more natural mix. And I think also, that you'll see our customers move towards taking those processors into lower price points. Price points where you'd see Pentium notebooks today, over the course of the year, by tweaking the configurations a bit. Maybe not using discreet graphics as much, because the graphics on the Arrandale platform are so good. Maybe, I think, less memory is when 7 [i7] runs pretty well in 2 gig, et cetera.

My answer to, I think, it was Jim's question, was in regards to our inventory, our component inventory, the channel inventory comments that Paul and I both made were in regards to the inventory that we see downstream from us. It's the inventory held at the multinationals, the retailers, the ODMs that manufacture the -- yes, our own distributors. So that downstream inventory, when we look at, it looks healthy, it looks appropriate to demand levels. Our internal inventories are lower than I'd like, particularly, on the new 32 nanometer products. We were tight in Q1. We would normally want to buffer that transition a bit by having some inventory in place.

There's a number of things going on. The move to cloud, we think, is very good. Not everything will go to cloud, but the shift to cloud-based services is good for Intel. The shift to virtualization is good to Intel there. If you look, you plot out -- and we'll do this at the analyst meeting in much more detail, but if you plot out the growth in data traffic and network traffic, and the kinds of things that modern servers are doing, that growth curve is faster than the refresh rate for old versus new equipment. And we see a very robust scenario for servers, going forward.",121

So you've basically cut the ASP impact on gross margins from your previous guidance by about half. I think before it was about two to three points to the negative, now it's about 1½ points. Can you give just a little more color on what's driving that differential? I mean, is it just continued uptick of 32 nanometers faster than you thought? Is it more servers, more corporate, NAND Flash and less Atom?",82

In the margin we kind of gave you a quarter ago, I was articulating that I expected two to three points from 2009 to 2010, based on ASPs coming down. Based on the strength we saw in Q1 and the take-up of new products, we've cut that impact in half. And it's really those two things, it's the strength we saw in Q1 and the take-up of the new products has exceeded my expectations. And I think some of that strength will continue through the year.",96

Looks like you took R&D up about $200 million, SG&A up about $400 million at the midpoint of your guidance. Can you give us a little more color on what's driving the increases in both of those, and in particular, the greater increase in SG&A versus R&D?",59

I think it gets you there. If you look at it from the prior forecast, we're up about $600 million cycle-on-cycle. About half of that is profit- and revenue-dependent spending. And what you should take from that is, that as we've seen the Q1 results and now have increased our expectations for the year, I'm expecting more revenue, more profits that's driving those two line items. The revenue-dependent spending is almost all marketing. It's Intel Inside, so it gets categorized as marketing spending. And then the profit-dependent spending gets split across the different groups of the company behind that. So it's about half of the increase behind that. We have some incremental investments that we're making. Those are predominantly R&D projects. Again, as our confidence in the year has gone up, there are some projects that we're launching there. And then the third element behind that is, again, an increase to marketing. And we've gone through and redesigned some of our customer programs. And in the process of redesigning those programs, they will be categorized, going forward, as marketing expense. And so that's the other element there.",197

So I would expect that the dual-processor products will continue to be, let me say, the topography of choice for Data Center buildout for the big Internet portal guys. And you can imagine who I'm talking about. The MP servers configuration tend to be much more for -- I think, well, you'll see that much more prevalent in corporate environment and SAP configurations, and people that want to run multiple applications in a virtual mode there. So I really think that they're addressing different market segments as they ramp up, but we love both of our children here.

That's their job to tell you when they're thinking about an IPO. But yes, I'd say, generally, to answer your question is, yes, I think the improvement we have seen over the last few quarters has really been a decrease in the rate at which investments are being impaired. And as I think forward over the next year, yes, I'd expect to start to see some gains and some exits coming in. Nothing on the radar for Q2, but looking out longer term, that would be my expectation. We invest in Intel Capital portfolio companies for two reasons: one is to get strategic benefit to the overall business; the other is to get a return. And the expectation is that we're doing both of those things.",139

So let's put this in a category of just taking a wild ass guess. Having run Intel IT -- I saw Paul is cringing. I think that you probably see that the way that IT budgets work, you'll likely see spending on server infrastructure that's probably stronger in Q4 than it is in any other quarter. You probably see that kind of reduction we saw this quarter where it's down some. So it's going to be somewhat back-end loaded. To get to the quarter-by-quarter split, I don't have that number at my finger.",102

And can you frankly, just operate leaner than you've ever done in the past?",70

So the hub, what it does is you will tend to see less overall inventory through the supply chain, but more of that inventory on my books because I'm holding that at the customer location. The reduction in cycle times  obviously allows us to operate at leaner levels. And so net of those two things, I think you're going to continue to see us like we have been over the last four or five quarters, operating at pretty efficient inventory levels. I want to caution you though that, that won't preclude the need to get inventory in place when we're going through big product transitions or process technology transitions. It's the prudent thing to do to get inventory in place, and that's what we try to do in Q1 and what we will try again to do in Q2.",155

But at the same time, you're expecting some kind of a modest decline in the back half of the year. I guess I'm curious as to why you think that will be the case, given your comments, Paul, of signs of a corporate recovery, servers should be seasonally strong in the back half of the year. Is it just Core i3 being a bigger part of the mix? Can you help us understand what the thought process there is?",95

I expect that to be a more normal mix as we progress through the year. And again, that's against the backdrop of an ASP that's down some, but less than it's normally down. So it is as simple as that. If you zoom way out on this, what we see over time is that Moore's Law allows us to bring new features, bring our costs down. We also bring prices down over time. That drives elasticity of demand. You see it in the Consumer segment of the market. You see it in emerging markets. And it ends up being an important growth driver for the business. So against that backdrop, we're having a pretty benign pricing environment this year based on the strength of our product portfolio, is how I characterize it.",159

On that one, yes, I'll show you in much more detail next month when we're together for the investor meeting. But yes, directionally, it's played out exactly as I had anticipated. Costs came down. It's a very healthy product margin. I showed a comparison of Atom to the existing Core business excluding Atom, and to the Embedded business and show that it got into a fairly similar range. That's how it has played out. From a product margin percent standpoint, which I think is how you asked the question, right?",91

And then sort of as my follow-up, sticking with Atom as the theme, there is some concern in the marketplace and is relevant from your numbers in Q1 that Atom didn't really sell as well in the quarter. Earlier in the call, you guys mentioned that it was related to just seasonality and the over-exuberance in the marketplace to many new entrants. Is there something you can do with Atom pricing to reinvigorate those sales? Is that something that you would look to do? Or what is your strategy?

Someone asked a question earlier about tablets. And there's rumor out there about certain consumer electronics equipment, and phones and things like that. That's not really the heart of the question. The heart of the question is netbooks, and as I said earlier, I think there will still be significant growth in the Netbook business year-over-year. I think that there are -- rather than pricing, I think we would look to features and integration as a technical knobs we would twist here. The next innovation coming out on Atom is dual core, which comes out in the second quarter. And so that'll ramp for the holiday season this year, and I think that'll be a very attractive product. And then in early Q1, we have another integration at much lower powered product coming out that's a derivative of it for fanless Netbook business.

And our customers set those price points, so what I can say is that the amount of design activity -- first of all, Wi-Di products have been very well received. It's selling through the channel nicely at Best Buy, which is where it really is semi-exclusive right now. Over the course of the year, you'll see many more SKUs and many more distributors picking up the product. And I think, it'll be a must-have feature for holidays time frame. They may come down the price a bit. But generally speaking, I think it's going to get broader before it gets a lot cheaper. In terms of other vendors trying to do similar technology, I'd say, good luck. This took us quite a while to be able to develop, to be able to get this done. We have a roadmap of features that take Wi-Di better over time and add more content protection, Blu-ray support, et cetera, et cetera.

In Q2, Intel posted its best quarterly results ever, as the economies of the world continue to reflect renewed economic momentum. Intel growth continues to run ahead of economic growth, reflecting what we believe is a fundamental shift driven by Internet adoption. Our second quarter was up 5% from Q1 versus a seasonal norm of down 2%.
In addition to continuing year-over-year growth in the Consumer segments, this quarter, we benefited from a broad-based return of the Enterprise and Small Business segments. Our Server business had a record quarter, showing strong sequential unit growth and strength from customers opting for richer configurations that drove an improved mix within the Server category.
The return on investment that our new Server offerings deliver is extremely compelling, and is a major reason for the strong demand we are experiencing. One example of the surging demand for Servers is in the IP Data Center segment, which grew 170% over Q2 of last year. As Internet traffic continues to boom, the cloud build-out is accelerating in order to keep pace. In addition to Servers, we also saw companies, including small businesses, refreshing their PCs. Like Servers, this too was broad-based and was an important driver of improving product mix within our PC business last quarter.
Our Atom business also performed very well, growing 16% sequentially. Two important drivers were responsible: first, there was an inventory correction in Q1 that has now normalized; and second, we introduced dual core versions of Atom, which helped drive incremental demand and improved our mix within the Atom category. Since launching the Atom processor two years ago, we've shipped approximately 75 million Atoms, and we still expect the industry to ship around 40 million netbooks this year. In terms of global demand for PCs, many third-party analysts are now projecting annual unit growth of around 20%. Our plans are consistent with this number.
For the last five quarters, we have seen PC sales driven by Consumer purchases, particularly notebooks. This trend is continuing. And in Q2, we saw a return of Corporate purchases that offset seasonal and geographic patterns in the Consumer segment. Our outlook for the year remains robust, and we are planning for a seasonal second half. 
One quick word about the status of inventories. Across the supply chain, we are very comfortable with the levels of inventory. In the channel, we saw a marked decline in inventories as currency volatility caused distributors to cut back on orders, so inventories in the channel are very lean. As for inventories on our balance sheet, the increase was both conscious and important. Over 100% of the increase was from leading-edge 32 nanometer processors in anticipation of a seasonally stronger second half. 
At our Investor Day back in May, we talked a lot about the advantages we have with an integrated business model of both product design and manufacturing. Those advantages were very evident in our second quarter financial results. Our product costs continue to decline very nicely. And when combined with the innovative product lineup we have developed, we are able to enjoy healthy financial returns. Our process technology is and will continue to be a very important source of differentiation and earnings power for the company.
In closing, I want to mention our upcoming product family codenamed Sandy Bridge. Last quarter, I mentioned that we were broadly sampling this product to our customers. I am more excited about Sandy Bridge than I have been in any product that the company has launched in a number of years. Due to the very strong reception of Sandy Bridge, we have accelerated our 32 nanometer factory ramp and have raised our CapEx guidance to enable us to meet the anticipated demand. We look forward to seeing many of you at our September IDF Conference in San Francisco, where we will share more details about this new architecture. 
With that, let me turn the meeting over to Stacy.",657

Revenue, gross margin, operating profit and earnings per share were all records. 
Revenue of $10.8 billion was up 34% from a year ago, and gross margin of 67% was up four points from the first quarter. Operating profit rose to $4 billion, and as a percent of revenue, reached 37%. The improvements we have made in our productivity can be seen in revenue per employee of $134,000, also our best ever. Our financial results in the second quarter were a result of a strong product mix with the continued ramp of our new 32 nanometer products.
Microprocessor unit sales increased slightly above seasonal, and average selling prices for microprocessors were up slightly quarter-on-quarter. All geographies performed better than normal seasonal patterns. 
The Server market segment was particularly strong, with customer demand for our new products leading to a richer mix. The Data Center Group achieved revenue of $2.1 billion and operating profit of $1.1 billion, which was the first time operating profit exceeded $1 billion in this segment.
Second quarter gross margin of 67% was higher than our expectation due to higher platform revenue and better-than-expected costs. The factory network delivered our lowest ever platform cost while accelerating the 32 nanometer process technology ramp as customers continue to demand a richer mix of our latest-generation microprocessors.
We generated approximately $3.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the second quarter. Total cash investments grew by $1.4 billion to approximately $18 billion. We paid nearly $900 million in dividends and purchased over $1 billion in capital assets.
Additionally, we increased total inventories by $350 million. The midpoint of our forecast for the third quarter is $11.6 billion. The forecasted revenue increase of 8% in the third quarter is slightly below the average seasonal increase. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be flat to the second quarter at 67%. For 2010, we are forecasting a record annual gross margin with the midpoint of our annual forecast increasing from 64% to 66%. 
At our May Investor Day Meeting, we reviewed how we have transformed the company's cost structure. The second quarter demonstrates the powerful financial results that can be generated when Leadership Products and a world-class cost structure are coupled with an overall healthy end market. Our business was strong in the first half, and our forecast for the rest of the year is that the second half is seasonally stronger and that the strength of our product portfolio and our cost structure will allow us to achieve our most profitable year ever. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.",469

Any commentary as to where, how you see things tracking now into third quarter within the distribution channel for inventory?",62

I mean, we gave guidance to a very robust third quarter. As Stacy said, it was basically seasonal or just slightly below the midpoint of seasonality. We don't see any inventory issues out there. The prices in Europe, obviously, on a euro basis, would be up slightly. But what we're seeing is people are altering configurations as they free up the cash to build this machine. Distributors principally build the machines to order. Some SKUs are less memory configuration. Some are taking discrete graphics out just to try to keep the price points constant in the channel in that retail.",105

Just as you look at this category and look at it vis-à-vis netbooks, two questions here. How do you see the net impact? And how do you see the positioning of Atom within this category?",64

At this point, my view hasn't really hasn't changed in the last quarter or so. I think this is an additive category of computing, much like netbooks were an additive category of computing. I'm sorry, Uche, let me start again. I haven't changed my view on tablets in the last three or four months since the launch of the iPad. I think they're an additive category to the market, much like we saw netbooks being additive. Netbooks, in fact, had a higher potential to cannibalize and they didn't. I don't see tablets cannibalizing the PC market. I think people used it for different kinds of reasons. In terms of Intel participating in the tablet market, we remain very optimistic about this. At Computex last month, there were over 30 varieties of tablets shown based upon Atom configurations. The advantage of, obviously, Intel in this segment is you can run a number of operating systems. You can run Windows. You can run Android. You can run Chrome. And you can run MeeGo or the other versions of Linux. So we feel pretty good about our opportunity to participate in the growth as it happens.",212

It was up about 12% sequentially. Can you give us a little color on units versus dollars.,27
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-13-2010",2010-07-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3285.0,67290.0,4960957.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,12,"Sure. This is Stacy, I'll be happy to. It was both -- we got some units in place on 32 nanometer. That was our strategy. It's also, as we're seeing those first wafers coming out of the first couple of factories on 32 nanometer, it tends to be just a little bit more expensive inventory. So both units and dollars -- dollars per unit were up and dollars were up some. If I just kind of talk about inventory now as we go forward, the inventory that we have in place is appropriate relative to where we are in the 32 nanometer ramp and relative to how we see demand in the second half, and I expect it to flatten out as we get into the second half of this year. It should be pretty flat in the third quarter as we go forward.",144

I guess, with the Data Center Group up as strongly as it was and Nehalem-EX shipping, I would think that the pricing could have been up 8% to 10% in that segment. Is that mix dynamic? Is my assumption on that correct? And am I in a ballpark in the pricing side?",66

We definitely saw the mix better in Servers, and that led to ASP positive impact. And then we also saw that Server as a percent of the total business was higher. They had a very good quarter. And so we saw a little bit of a mix just based on more Server shipments relative to everything else. Those two things both led to the mix good news we saw in the quarter.",84

Stacy, you've been guiding future growth margin most of the year under the assumption of kind of normal price declines. I'm kind of curious, when you look at the 67% guidance for September then the full year guidance of 66%, are you expecting kind of normal historical price decline? Do you think you'll continue to see the positive mix that you've kind of seen in the first couple of quarters?",78

It's just a richer mix of products than I was expecting. The other thing I'll point you to is in my Q2 to Q3 margin walk, which I can go through for you if you want, ASP isn't one of the drivers. So you can kind of get a sense that I'm excepting it to be a big driver as we go into the third quarter.",105

Which one of those -- can you talk a little bit about what you expect to be better than seasonal. Maybe you're expecting any seasonal softness anywhere.",72

And when I told you we're endorsing 20% as a planning number, it's hard to find any softness in that 20% year-on-year number, right? Let me try and give you some granularity though. Clearly, we said for some time and we showed you at the Analyst Meeting that something like 70% of our business is Consumer on a worldwide basis, and some of that's Small Business built into that. I don't see that shifting. So I think that level of participation in the Consumer segments will be reflected and will be seasonal first half versus second half. I don't see a change there. I think it will continue to be driven by notebooks, and I think Servers will continue to be strong, if I had to guess at this point in time. I see no reason not to. There's two trends inside the Server movement: one is the capacity needs coming off the Internet Data Center build-out, and I gave you some data on that as part of my commentary; and the other is the return on investment that you can get in Enterprise Data Centers by swapping out old versus new equipment in terms of both capacity and power savings, electricity's cost savings. I think those are very big drivers this year that are going to be overlaid on top of this. The last comment I'd make on your question was on Atom, which is I really don't see the -- I gave you my number for the year for netbooks. I don't see that part of the Atom business taking off much higher than it already is. It's a good year-on-year growth. I think the growth in Atom over the course -- the new growth in Atom this year is going to be in embedded and in products like the Google TV product that were launched last month. We didn't talk about that in the last conference call because it wasn't announced yet. But I can tell you that a number of companies are now moving towards production on Atom-based television, set-top boxes, DVD players and so forth around that particular construct. And to me, that is one of the bigger things to watch for the holiday season as those products break market and see what happens.",387

We don't have all the sales-out data yet. We've got two months of it. But the trend so far on that or on a year-on-year basis, everything was up, and in particular on the Commercial or Enterprise side of the business. In terms of China, it was a little slowgoing early in the quarter and it got good towards the end. Similar in Europe, we had the volcano in the beginning and currency disturbances and volatility in the middle, and things settled down in both geographies by the end of the quarter. The net was year-over-year, everything was nicely up.",117

And if you look at the geographic breakdown, you see that Americas and Europe were both the best in terms of seasonality, and that's just because they have -- a larger component of those markets are large companies and Enterprise segment. So the Enterprise strength really helped drive those results.",69

I mean, we viewed for some time that this phenomena had to happen, that the machines were just costing more to keep on the books than they were worth in terms of out of warranty and repairs and those kinds of things and the desire, the strong desire to upgrade to Win 7. So I think now that corporations have some breathing room in the economy and their budgets, you're starting to see that those machines that are four and five years old get refreshed. I can't comment on the rate of refresh. My sense is you're going to see sort of one year-over-year for the next couple of years, but that will be an accelerant.",120

This is the data that we have inside the company and data from our backlog and what our customers are asking us for.

We are building more 32 in the second half than we had planned, say, six months ago. We're also building more 45 in the second half than we planned six months ago.

And as we showed at the Investor Meeting, we're in the range where we're kind of in that sweet spot of loadings. The factories are nicely loaded. We're getting a great cost out of them. We have the ability to a bit of upside. As Paul said in his written remarks, the place where we're accelerating a bit here is getting some more 32 nanometer capacity in place in the second half in anticipation of the demand for Sandy Bridge based on what we're hearing from the customers as they get to kick the tires of that product line. So I think we're healthy from a utilization standpoint, and I'm comfortable with where we are from an inventory standpoint in the second quarter.",138

When that hit the supply chain, across the industry reacted very quickly, much more quickly than they had in prior cycles. We took aggressive action to reduce the loading in our factories, to not put inventory in place. And then we took advantage of that to roll forward some of the capacity we had on 45 to offset some of the investment that we knew we had to make on 32, which drove a great capital efficiency number. So I'd expect if you get into the case where we got hit with another big recessionary kind of scenario like we saw last year, the reaction would be very similar to that.",138

That we haven't put a forecast out for 2011 yet so you don't know how to do the plus or minus to that. But to just piggyback on what Paul said, based on what we're hearing on Sandy Bridge, we're now anticipating a faster ramp of the product.

My sense is that -- I mean, you had two different things going -- you got three things going on. In Europe, you had the volcano and then the debt crisis. And then in China, mid-quarter, you had the change in the housing stands, which dampened down GDP a bit. I think all of those are being worked through now. I mean, to me, if you look through that, through the lens of that smoke, what you see is computers are important independent of the economy cycle. It happened all last year to the surprise of many, and it's happening now. And the difference now is that corporations are buying in addition to consumers.

In the second quarter, it was very good. I mean, our chipset shipments in Q2 always run -- not always, normally run ahead of our microprocessors because of the cycle for back-to-school. That happened this quarter as well. But even inside that, I don't see any cutting back. And then, there's some -- each OEM has their own strategy, Tim. Some are accelerating the use of ocean because they want a lower cost. Some are accelerating the use of air because they want flexibility. And I think that as it all integrates, we don't see a chipset bump in either direction as a leading indicator here this time. It's mostly normal.",120

It's normal for us, as we go through a significant transition as we're going through on 32 nanometer products, to put some inventory in place in advance of those ramps, and in particular, as we look into the demand at the second half. So yes, just to maybe help you a little bit in terms of how to think about it, if you go back to mid-2008, which was the last times when we're going through the 45 nanometer transition, we had a similar amount of inventory in place. Our business levels at that time, so Q2 of 2008, was like $1.3 billion less than our billion, than our business levels today. So when you look at in that context, it says we're still running pretty healthy appropriate level of inventory, given the 32 nanometer transition and the level of demand that we're seeing.",145

That data still is what I stand behind. I think we have moved the gross margin range for the company up. We're at a period of time right now because of our specific product mix that we're a bit above that. You tend to have a few quarters above. You have some that are below. But as we look across the rest of this year, we're 67% in Q2. I'm forecasting 67% for Q3. And frankly, I'd expect to be in that range in the fourth quarter as well.

You're not looking at consumption there. What you're looking at is our billings. And you've seen a couple of secular shifts in Europe that is causing the billings number to decline, which you have to keep separate from the overall consumption market. One is the shift to notebooks means that more of the product is being built outside of Europe and imported in. So that's one of the big drivers, and that's probably the largest. The second is that the multinationals are taking some share against the smaller players. And again, that's what they build in many cases outside of Europe and then import their product into Europe. So you have to separate that from the strength of the end markets.",125

It really is all about mix at the end of the day. And to some extent, Centrino was about up-mixing to the mobile in the early days. What you're seeing now -- what we're very, very happy with the launch, ramp and product acceptance in the market of the Core i3/5/7 series that launched in January, that has become kind of the mainstream with desktops and notebooks now on that brand momentum is part of the lifts you see in terms of selling up from Pentium or Celeron. I think that as we move into the second half and into next year, it's the same kind of thing. We will continue to use technology, feature-driven technology to put platform ingredients together that we think will come into premium. And when that happens, it's good for Intel and it's good for our customers, and ultimately, good for the buyers of the technology.",154

And what we're seeing right now is that in the high-end segment of the business, we're doing really well, and we're going to pay back those features. I think if you think about our business over a long period of time, what you've seen is that emerging markets have grown more quickly than the rest of the business. The consumer market has grown to be a very large percentage of our business. And so, over time, there's that mix effect that does bring pricing down. And so, the key for us is to be able to bifurcate our cost structure. So that in each of those segments of the business, we can deliver a very compelling product margin. And I think you're really seeing that play out right now in our business. We've got strong features at the high end. We've got a great cost structure for emerging markets and for the less feature-driven consumer segment of the market. And that all helps us achieve a 67% gross margin in the second quarter.",199

And I'll also give you a little color commentary on Q4 year-over-year so you can get a sense of what I'm [indiscernible] that. But as you said, as we go from Q2 to Q3, based on the midpoint of the revenue guidance that we just set, we'd expect about half a point of gross margin good news associated with higher platform revenue. That's offset by about a point of inventory write-offs for the Sandy Bridge product that's being built prior to qualification for sale. That's normal what we see in these product transitions. And there's another half a point of relatively small items, and just in an environment where our factories are running pretty full, where demand looks good and we don't have a lot of reserves and those kinds of things, then you tend to see a lot of small things that will give me another half a point of gross margin in my forecast. And that's what keeps me flat at 67%. Could it be higher? Sure. It'd be kind of foolish to say couldn't base on the mix that we had in Q2. But based on everything we know and the fact that Q3 tends to be a seasonally stronger consumer quarter, I think we're in the right space. And we'd have to have a pretty significant revenue mix based on ASP for the gross margin to be higher. And likewise, if the markets fall apart, honestly, it could be a little bit lower. But this is our best information at this time. Well, can I take you through Q4 if you want.",277

Again, I'd expect it to be a seasonally higher revenue quarter. So that's going to give me a little bit of a tailwind in gross margin. Assuming the qualification goes well for Sandy Bridge, which our history says this is likely, we'll have some write-off good news in Q4 because we'll be selling some of that materials because it's been disqualified for sale. And then, I have a bit of an offset to that based on an increase in unit cost. And I'll take you back to what I showed in May at the Investor Meeting. If you recall, I showed a unit cost graph by quarter by quarter, and it showed a little bit of an uptick in Q4, and then more of an uptick in Q1 and Q2 due to the next big 32 nanometer factory coming online. It's a very large factory with a high wafer capacity. The first wafers that come out of that factor are pretty expensive. So that gives me a bit of a mix-up and cost-ups. That's normal if you look at our history. Every two years, we see that. As we're pulling in 32 nanometer, I'm now expecting that cost impact to be a little more in Q4 and probably, a bit less in Q1 and Q2. So that gives me a bit of a tailwind to gross margin. When I net all that out, I think I'm in kind of the same range as I was in Q2 actuals. And my projection for Q3, I think I'm kind of still in that basic range.",278

Actually, as opposed to taking time on the call, whether it's just -- if you go back to the Investor Meeting materials, that's still is my prediction of kind of the shape of start-up cost. And we actually broke it out by quarter for you, so you can kind of get a sense of our best guess. It hasn't changed.

That has been the pattern in the past. It was the big enterprise apps that drove the server upgrade, and that drove ultimately a client upgrade. I don't think it's going to -- it normally works that way, or broadly works that way anymore, Doug. My sense is now, so many of the apps in the enterprise are web-based, that once you put the infrastructure in, that's not what drives it. What drives it is the new operating system environment on the client that will drive an upgrade. A new class of applications where people are putting in some of the cloud-based apps inside the enterprise. And a new phenomena that wasn't really true in the last couple of rounds of these things, which was the return-on-investment pieces around the energy and space savings. And that is really new.

We have margins in excess of what Stacy has been talking about. I won't give you the exact number, but it tends to be slightly less than 50%. And then, we fill in the mix with other products in terms of price points from Atom to Celeron to Pentium. And it's not so much a -- yes, of course, we satisfy all the available demand from the top. We naturally do that. So we believe we're satisfying demand. We are seeing a mix-up, which is based upon the goodness of the products and the feature sets. And that's what we talked about last quarter and as part of the news this quarter. We anticipate a similar kind of embracing of Sandy Bridge when that product comes out to keep that mix fairly rich.",164

If you look at China, in the Tier 1 and some said now the Tier 2 cities, the markets there are as sophisticated in mix and purchasing knowledge as you get in the United States or Western Europe or even Japan. It's when you get out into the places where the incomes are more constrained in Tier 3, 4, 5, 6 cities in China that you start seeing that phenomena. And what we've done there is we worked with our customers and with the distributor channel to produce products. And we've done versions of Atom-based motherboards with the Atom chip is soldered onto the motherboard. So it becomes a very affordable unit of computing that meets those price points. And really, there really is not a China market per se. The China market, if I look at the East Coast cities, is probably a richer mix than we sell in Manhattan.",156

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 12, 2010",2010-10-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3332.0,79750.0,5726414.0,Presenter Speech,Paul Otellini,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Kevin. We are pleased with the financial results we achieved during the third quarter. We realized new records in revenue and operating income in a marketplace filled with uncertainty. Our investments in product and technology leadership and focus on operational efficiencies have better prepared us for improved financial performance in any market environment. This was very evident in our microprocessor revenue, which was up a healthy 25% year-over-year due in large part to the strong demand for higher-end offerings in our product lineup. 
We exit Q3 firmly on track to deliver our best year ever, and this is something we are all very proud off. 2010 is proving to be an unusual year in terms of the revenue patterns. We have not seen the typical quarter-to-quarter seasonality that often accompanies our business. Instead, we have seen steady growth as the year has progressed. 
Overall, we still expect PC units to grow roughly 18% this year, and the industry is now shipping over 1 million PCs a day, which is an amazing milestone. While there was some softness in the consumer market segments of Western Europe and the U.S., other regions such as China as well as the channel had solid results. The Enterprise segment remains steady and consistent, and our mix from this segment continues to be a source of strength to our profitability.
Our results in the Service segment highlight the importance and value of performance leadership. Demand for our high-performance Westmere and Nehalem-EX processors drove server microprocessor revenue up over 30% year-over-year. Shipments into the Cloud segment are up a very strong 200% from a year ago and up 50% from just last quarter. Our Storage business is up 29% year-over-year, emphasizing that the Xeon product family is not just for servers but has become an important brand in the data center. 
The third quarter was also notable for the continued progress we're making in our Embedded business. We set microprocessor unit and revenue records in this segment with improved ASPs this quarter. Our Embedded and Communications business is now on track to deliver over $1 billion in gross margin this year, with operating margins greater than 30%. We are excited about several new categories for SMART computing where we are leading with our silicon solutions. The SMART TV category is launching this month in the United States, with exciting product introductions from Sony and Logitech based on Google TV running on an Intel Atom microprocessor. 
The CE industry is excited about this new opportunity to deliver a seamless Internet plus television experience for consumers in the living room. SMART TVs are a great example of how Intel architecture can bring a great computing experience, not just to PCs but to any device that computes and connects to the Internet. There are also several new categories where we are leading the transformation to SMART: digital signs, in-vehicle infotainment, retail and ATM solutions just to name a few. 
I know that the big question on everyone's mind is how Intel will respond to new computing categories where Intel currently has little presence, specifically tablets. Let me take a minute and give you my perspective on this. 
We think tablets are exciting, and we fully welcome their arrival. Apple has done a wonderful job reinventing the category. We believe that like netbooks, tablets will expand the time for computing overall with a new form factor and new uses that bring computing to even more aspects of our lives. Will it impact PC sales? Sure. At the margin, they probably will. Consumers will have a limited amount of discretionary income, and some will choose to purchase a tablet instead of upgrading an existing PC or purchasing a netbook in any given period. 
We saw the same thing happen when netbooks were introduced. But three years later, both the PC and the netbook market segments have grown substantially, and we believe that will happen again with tablets. We take a longer-term view to the tablet opportunity. And the overarching benefit to Intel and the rest of the industry is to have a new, rolling computing segment where we can participate alongside our growing PC business. 
At Intel, we're going to utilize all the assets at our disposal to win this segment: the world's best silicon process technology, the best compute architecture and our global scale. We are deeply engaged with a number of partners to bring to market innovative tablet solutions. Our design win momentum is very strong and in the coming months and quarters, you will see Intel solutions that run on Windows, Android and MeeGo operating systems across a variety of form factors and price points. We fully expect to participate broadly and profitably in this category and that in the end, the tablet category will be additive to our bottom line and not take away from it. 
In closing, I want to mention our next processor family code named Sandy Bridge. This quarter, we began volume production of Sandy Bridge and expect to ship revenue units in Q4 as we prepare for systems launch in the first quarter of 2011. Sandy Bridge represents the largest increase in computing performance in our history. This is a truly stunning product that we can't wait to bring to market. Early demand from customers is much greater than we originally expected, and we anticipate a very fast ramp. We exit the third quarter with the highest revenue in our history, with expectations of Q4 being even better. Our Tick Tock model is working beautifully and is creating increasing differentiation for our products. 
As we look into next year, we see double-digit growth in PCs, augmented by Intel's participation in the tablet and smartphone categories that should make for another strong year for Intel. With that, let me turn it over to Stacy for a few comments.",974
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 12, 2010",2010-10-12,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3332.0,79750.0,5726415.0,Presenter Speech,Stacy Smith,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Paul. Despite softness in the consumer market segments of Europe and North America, demand strength in the emerging markets and a robust enterprise market segment led to a record microprocessor units. This unit demand, in combination with the leadership product portfolio and continued progress on our cost structure, led to record financial results. 
Revenue and operating profit were records again this quarter. Revenue of $11.1 billion was up 18% from a year ago. Operating profit of $4.1 billion was up 60% from a year ago and was 37% of revenue. Our operating profit for the first three quarters of 2010 was $11.6 billion, by far the best first nine months in our history. The improvements we have made in our productivity can also be seen in quarterly revenue per employee of $136,000, also a best ever.
Revenue of $11.1 billion was up 3% and was a record. However, it was up less than the average seasonal increase of 9%. Microprocessor average selling prices were approximately flat sequentially. As a result of actions we took to respond to lower than expected demand, inventory on our balance sheet increased only slightly to $3.4 billion. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels remain lean.
Third quarter gross margin was 66% as a result of superb execution from our factory network. We generated over $3.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the third quarter. Total cash investments grew by $2.5 billion to approximately $20 billion. We paid nearly $900 million in dividends and purchased $1.4 billion in capital assets. The midpoint of our revenue forecast for the fourth quarter of $11.4 billion would be up 3% below the seasonal average increase of 8%. This forecast reflects continued caution about the strength in the Consumer Market segment and a reduction in customer inventory levels in anticipation of the launch of Sandy Bridge. 
By taking the midpoint of the fourth quarter forecast and results from the first three quarters of the year, annual revenue for 2010 would be a record at $43.6 billion, up 24% from 2009 and up 16% from 2008. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be up one point from the third quarter to 67%. 
We announced two large acquisitions in the third quarter that we expect to close by year end or in the first quarter of 2011. On a GAAP basis, Intel expects the combination to be slightly dilutive to earnings in the first year of operations and approximately flat in the second year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding a one-time write-down of deferred revenue when the McAfee transaction closes and the amortization of acquired intangibles related to both acquisitions, Intel expects the combination to be slightly accretive in the first year and improve beyond that. 
We don't typically talk perspectively about acquisitions and do not plan to in the future. However, given that Intel announced two large acquisitions in the third quarter, I will share that though we always look for opportunities to create shareholder value, there are no other large acquisitions currently being contemplated. 
The worldwide economy is growing but more slowly than anticipated heading into the second half of the year. We are taking advantage of the slower growth to more quickly upgrade older generation factories to support the very strong customer demand we see for our new Sandy Bridge products. Our technology leadership, cost structure and cash generation remains strong. We continue to grow the profit streams in our traditional businesses of server, notebooks and desktops and are creating new profit streams in consumer electronics, smartphones, embedded netbooks and tablets. 
With that, let me turn it back to Kevin.",609

In terms of average selling price, I think you can best see it if you look at my gross margin reconciliation for Q4. ASP is not one of the reconciling items for the fourth quarter. So from that, you should take that we don't expect it to be a driver one way or the other. But it certainly isn't creating or it's not expected to create any negative pressure on the gross margin. If you look at what we are calling out from a gross margin standpoint for Q4, if you want me to go through that I will. It's up about a point from 66% to 67%. We're getting about a couple of points of good news based on lower inventory write-offs that we've had some write-offs at Sandy Bridge prior to qualification for sale in the third quarter. We don't expect those to repeat in the fourth quarter as that didn't go through the process and get to qualification of sale. We'll also have the edge of selling through some product that had been written off once that qualifies. We have half a point offsetting that that's due to higher platform unit costs, that's the early ramp on 32 nanometer. And we have about half a point increase in start up costs and costs associated with taking some older generation factories offline. And so net of all, that takes us up a point from 66% to 67%.",242

If you think about the forecast for Q4, it's really building on what we saw in Q3. We're expecting a continued robust enterprise market, continued growth in emerging markets, a consumer market that grows a little bit more slowly than we would have thought a quarter ago and that's just based on consumers in mature markets taking a bit of a pause. I guess you can kind of get to the answer by saying today, netbooks are primarily a mature market, phenomenon that sells to consumers. So that segment of our market is likely a little bit weaker than the rest. It will still grow, but just grow a little bit less quickly than the rest of the business.",129

After answering that question on the call a couple of quarters ago, I took a wild ass guess at server seasonality. I've since gone back and looked at the data. And the answer is we see wide variations in service seasonality quarter-to-quarter, and it's because we see a big IP Data Center deal can really skew the results in any one quarter. And so there's kind of no good average to compare to. I think the best comparison for the Data Center Group is it's up 30% from a year ago. So you kind of get a sense there of the kind of growth we're seeing. We've now seen several quarters of robust growth there.

I'll answer the second part of your question first. I mentioned in my commentary that the strong parts of the business this quarter in consumer were in China and in our channel, which is typically the white box business that is principally in emerging markets. So that part of the business, as it relates to consumers, was pretty strong. And it was in the mature markets, U.S., Japan, Western Europe that we saw some of the softness on the consumer side. In terms of what we've seen so far, I mean, the fact that we were up, our revenue for Q3 was up slightly above the midpoint of the reset, I think should give you some view that the last four weeks of the quarter were perhaps a little bit better than we had first thought, right. However, we built that kind of run rate into our view for Q4.",156

So they've been elevated, they've been high for quite a while now, a couple of quarters. Can you give us some feeling for how much of the current margin strength, the elevation that you've seen, actually has been due to mix as enterprise strength has really been combining, I think, over the last quarter, so with some weakness in consumer. Could you give us some color on that? How far you think we might be through the enterprise refresh that you see occurring? Can you give me some feeling for what the risk might be as that refresh starts to take a pause a bit and maybe as even combining with seasonal declines in revenue as we get into first half of next year?",130

In terms of the gross margin strength we're seeing, it comes back to what I articulated in the investor meeting. I think we're benefiting from several things. First and foremost is the strength of our product line. It's strong across the board. We're seeing good mix to the high end of products. And as I think about the implication of Sandy Bridge coming into that mix, you can only but be optimistic that it looks to be a great product based on what we're hearing from the customers. Secondly in gross margin is, our cost structure is just fundamentally better than it has been. We've been hard at work at this, and I think the factories have done an outstanding job in bringing their productivity up, their efficiency up, their cost structure up. You can see that in the capital intensity indicators and things like that. And then from a company level, we are benefiting a bit from mix. We divested the NOR business. We have made great improvements to the NAND business. And so those were probably a couple of points of drag to gross margin historically that we've now eliminated. So I think the combination of those three things is what's allowing us to achieve the kind of gross margins that we're achieving. That said, it has been stronger than I thought when we started the year. If we achieve the forecast that we just put on the table for Q4, the gross margin for the year will be 66%. That's by far our best gross margin ever. I think you have to go back to the early 90s when we had a gross margin at 63%. It's just much better than anything we've done in the past.",324

I see this as much more slow and steady. Yes, there are changes swapping over to Win 7 in the enterprise when they get a new PC. But it's really based upon the modulation that CIOs seem to have in terms of just building out the spending, focusing on the oldest machines first and then implementing new security methodologies as they bring them on. From that perspective, I'm actually fairly optimistic about enterprise continuing on into 2011, particularly around Sandy Bridge. Those clients have improved performance, improved security, improved manageability. And because of the quality of the integrated graphics, potentially less pressure on building materials but for having discrete graphics in some of the low-end machines. All that is wind in our sales going into that segment in the first half of next year.",185

Are you still needing to build inventory for that launch in Q1? And I guess relative to your inventory targets for Q4, what's the implication for utilization and potentially gross margin as we move into Q1?",63

So let me start with Q3, and then I'll build to Q4 in terms of what's happening in inventory. We did grow inventory a little bit in the third quarter, that's both units and dollars. More than 100% of the increase is on the 32 nanometer products. But none of that yet is Sandy Bridge, because remember, we haven't yet qualified Sandy Bridge. So we're writing that off prior to qualification for sale. As we get into the fourth quarter, what I'd expect from an inventory standpoint is that the units will come down, the dollars will go up. And again, more than all of that dollar increase is going to be specifically on Sandy Bridge. The entirety of everything else will be down. And it's just we're ramping fast. It's a relatively expensive part because it's coming out in the early phase of the ramp for the 32 nanometer factories. And so when I think about Q4, I'd expect maybe inventory dollars to be up $200 million. But units down, and it's more than 100% Sandy Bridge growth. The second part of your question was around utilization. So let me articulate what's going on there. In the third quarter, as we started to see that demand was growing a little less quickly than we had anticipated, we started to take advantage of that by pulling some of the older generation factories offline. It's not enough that you're going to see it in excess capacity charges or anything like that, but we're trying to be really nimble to respond to the environment and to get ahead of the ramp that we're expecting for Sandy Bridge. And so I think that's a good part of the reason why we grew inventory less than we could have given the changing demand environment. In Q4, we'll continue down that path, and you can see on the Q4 gross margin recon, you're starting to see a little bit of an impact in the gross margin recon. We're taking some of that older generation technology offline and converting a portion of that, half a point that I articulated. It's not huge. But again, I think it shows the responsiveness that we're having to this changing demand environment and lets us get a little faster on 32 nanometer in advance of the Sandy Bridge ramp where we think we're going to need everything we can throw at it.",429

And it sounds like you expect it flat for the calendar fourth quarter. I'm kind of curious, did you cut price or did you experience some mix up in the stack and that's why MPU pricing overall was flat? And if Sandy Bridge comes out, would you expect that to be a price-accretive part?",91

The strength of the quarter was really reflective of the mix and the strength of the product line. And our customers really can't handle incremental volume based upon incremental price moves mid quarter even if we wanted to. Those days are long gone because of the SKU mixes and so forth. In terms of Sandy Bridge, a lot of the product will be price-point replacement. But it will start at the high end of our stack, and I expect very strong demand at the high end of the stack. So there could be an up mix, for example, in the quad cores as we ramp that product. So this could have a beneficial effect. I also think that as I said earlier, our customers are very well aware of the quality of the integrated graphics and the media performance of this product. And that will help them make trade-offs in their building materials as they make SKU selections and configurations and so forth, which I think will benefit Intel.",189

There's two kinds of channel inventories when we talk. One is the inventory in our own distributor channels downstream of us, which we reserve, and that has been pretty lean and remains pretty lean. That was not what we were talking about. The reflection was really on our customers' inventories. And Stacy pointed out in his commentary, we see that pretty lean right now. And in fact, a larger share, I think, of the notebook builds right now going into the fourth quarter are probably shipping by air than by ship, say, versus a year ago. And that allows them to run a little bit leaner on inventory and still meet demand. And part of that, I think, is really reflecting them getting their build plan ready for the Sandy Bridge ramp up. And as we said earlier, we'll start shipping product in towards the end of the quarter in anticipation of that launch.",156

We saw very good growth in the Embedded business in Q3. You can see it in the Other Intel Architecture Group segment. That segment of the business was up significantly, 19% I think quarter-on-quarter. It's now a $0.5 billion per quarter business for us. If you look at it compared to a year ago, it's up almost 50% from a year ago. And again, Embedded is the big driver in that business. Specifically, what we saw in Embedded this quarter is we're seeing the impact of architectural conversions kicking in where a couple of big customers now have taken their blade server product lines to Intel architecture, that's driving that business nicely. And so Paul's talked in the past about the new customers' architectural conversions. We're seeing that kicking in in the business in the quarter as a driver of the results.",167

We started putting Atom-based designs, particularly SOCs, into the Embedded road map two-plus years ago and put them out for sale and design win. And as you know, in that segment, there is a couple of year gestation period between design win and production. And you're starting to see some of these things go into production now, and more and more of that business will be Atom-based going forward. And some of it will take on the classic, embedded characteristics of small to medium volume and lasting forever. Some things, I think, have the potential to be home runs, like the Google TV product line. It just remains to be seen how big that kind of product is or how big -- we've already talked about the fact that we are inside the Mercedes and BMW 2012 model year cars with in-vehicle infotainment systems. If they go across the board or across the industry, those are also much larger than what you would see in a normal embedded application.",184

And we showed a slide in that Developer Forum, and so we've now achieved over a 20x improvement in the last four years in graphics and media performance. So that's the order of magnitude that we're talking about here.

We've been working with Infineon's wireless business for some time in terms of matching up our phone chips to their modems for our customers. And so there was a deep technical engineering engagement going on anyway, both hardware and software. For example, the way you do power management in a phone is across both the chips. And so we have to have access to that technology to be able to construct those power management schemes. That engagement will probably stay at that level for the first year or so in terms of the output of Infineon. Meanwhile, we are working to bring their 3G and ultimately, LTE technologies, into IP blocks that we can put on to Atom phone chips and tablet chips in the three-plus years out. There's really no reason to do that. If you look at the high-end phone and tablet market today, the apps processor and the comp processor are discrete chips. We see that remaining for some time.

I really don't want to announce or preannounce our customers products for them, so that's not a safe place for me to be. Having said that, we have very good silicon with Oak Trail. The value proposition is its performance, its power in this environment. Tablets are more performance sensitive and intensive devices than phones are. The kinds of applications people do on tablets will require that kind of compute capability, the ability to do real, full multitasking. And of course, for many people, particularly enterprise evaluations for tablets, Windows compatibility is very important.

I think the other dynamics in rolling desktop and netbooks and so forth are not going to really change. It's still kind of tough out there. And we're not projecting or we're not assuming inside of Intel that we have a very, very robust worldwide GDP scenario where I think like most people assuming modest growth and not a double dip. So most of the analysts out there right now for 2011 have the PC growth range, and the low-end numbers I've seen are 12% and the high-end numbers are 18% range.

The difference here is I think the step function and performance and features with Sandy Bridge is causing a more pronounced inventory clearance in advance of the new products coming off than we'd normally see. I think the timing of Sandy Bridge also is just being kind of right at the end of the big selling season that's causing that to be a bit more pronounced as well in terms of customers not wanting to end the year holding product on older generation products when we're following it up with this great new product that's really ramping right at that time line.",151

I know you're not guiding for the first quarter, but are there any discrete items that we should anticipate for the first quarter that are kind of independent from the stuff you won't guide on?",56

And I'm not going to go there yet for the first quarter. I mean, I'll provide that forecast when we get to January. We want to get through Q4 and see how the market shapes up, and we'll provide a forecast at the end of the quarter from that for the first quarter. The one thing that you do know that will hit or you should suspect will hit us next year is start up costs on 22 nanometer. You can predict that with a high level of confidence because we're on a two-year cadence on process technology. Next year is the year that will be a little heavier in terms of start-up costs on 22 nanometer. You can look at trends from prior years and you draw the conclusion it will be a bit more focused in the first half of the year. But beyond that, the question we just had on the pricing environment in a variety of other factors, I'm going to hold off on providing anything else for Q1 until we get there.",188

I believe heading into the third quarter you also mentioned that you thought the channel inventory was lean. It seems like you got a bit leaner and looks like you're going to assume it gets leaner again in the fourth quarter. Anyway to quantify where we are now versus the same point a quarter ago to help us in knowing how lean we actually are?,80

So yes, I'm going to direct you, I guess, to go talk to our customers who are holding that and they can probably very precisely quantify it for you if they choose to their inventory levels. We're looking across a broad supply chain in mature emerging markets, MMCs [ph] channel. And what we see is that yes, it has been managed at pretty efficient and low levels for a while now. It's even a little leaner in Q3, and it's likely to come down some more in Q4. I think really, I was surprised when we went through the downturn of 2009 how quickly the supply chain adjusted to the changes in demand and how they brought down inventory levels very quickly, kind of even in that recession. They brought down inventory levels in two quarters. You compare that to the downturn in 2001, and it took more like six to eight quarters for the inventory to clear through. So a very fast reaction time. I think they have managed things cautiously now, and they've got tools at their disposal like Paul mentioned, and shifting to airfreight versus sea lanes that they used to modulate inventory levels. I think they're doing a good job of it. They're staying cautious, and it's pretty lean.",214

I would expect for Q4 that our utilization will come down some, not to the point that we're generating excess capacity. But we'll bring the utilization down on 45 nanometer factories in order to roll that capacity forward to help us with the 32 nanometer ramp that we expect on Sandy Bridge. And inventory levels, again, units down. But we'll put some Sandy Bridge into inventory, and so dollars will be up some in the second quarter.",87

So Paul, if we have to, I guess, encapsulate your view on the current environment and then you go into next year, demand is a little slower, but fine. However, with your Sandy Bridge products and Atom penetration into cell phones and some penetration into tablets, you guys should be able to outgrow the PC market and overall semiconductor market next year?",69

But I'd sit here after 36 years and say, ""My god. This is 18% year-on-year growth, and we're passing 1 million units a day as an industry."" So there's no way you can -- I can look at that those numbers with anything but a view that this is a pretty healthy state of affairs right now. And I don't see that really changing into 2011. I think all the factors are that as an industry, we produce tools of productivity and people need these things. And so you can argue whether it's going to be 12% or 15% or 18% next year, but I don't think it's going to be 5% or 10%. And from that is our opportunity. In terms of outgrowing others, that really depends on the success we have in ramping our volume into these adjacent growth markets. You know our strategy there, you know the design wins as they come out, watch the space.",182

We're not going to start putting forecast out for Q1 or next year yet. We want to get through Q4 first and kind of see what the demand drivers look like a quarter from now. And just to reinforce what Paul said, when you think back to what we told you at the investor meeting in May and we talk about the long-term demand drivers of the business, the emerging markets and how computers become more affordable, the personalization of computers into the Consumer segment, things like that, our view of that is still intact. And then you have these adjacent markets forming around the PC market where our technology becomes really relevant. We're optimistic about the long term. I'm not going to give you a Q1 forecast yet.

And as part of that also, have you made a decision on the NAND business with Micron on the JV?",74

So let me -- I hope I can remember them all. The timing, in terms of McAfee and Infineon, they could be as early as the end of this year or into the first quarter. And that's as granular as we can get right now. Everything we know in terms of how it's working its way through approval process and regulatory process, looks like it's moving along. So that's still our view of closure on those. We have some expenses in Q4 for some of our costs associated with getting these things through approval, that's de minimis. And we've already given the view that says or the projection that says we may close. For the first year of operation, we expect them to be slightly dilutive on a GAAP basis and accretive on a non-GAAP basis once you work through some of the acquisition accounting, and we'll grow them from there. And then NAND was the other one. We have not made a decision yet on NAND. We'll make that sometime this year. So in the next quarter, we'll make that decision. And just to be clear for everybody on the call, that decision being the incremental investment in the Singapore factory. That's the decision we have on the table.",217

So you had a little squishiness in Europe and the U.S. this quarter where the iPad was kind of selling for a lot of the quarter. And there was strength in the emerging markets China this quarter. As the iPad was introduced in China a couple of weeks ago, do you worry at all that you're going to see some kind of weakness in that market similar to what you saw in the markets where the iPad was launched for most of the quarter last quarter?",96

I don't think it's the dominant factor here. I think the dominant factor is the softness in the consumer market after six very, very sequentially strong quarters. And that, to some extent, is to be expected after people buy this much technology particularly in the remaining tough times. So I don't really -- and the reality is nobody in the world knows exactly how much cannibalization is happening and from where it's taking money. We know that there is some discretionary money being spent on tablets. I think the impact though is still you're dealing with numbers that are relatively small in the grand scheme of the ship rate of the PC net notebook, netbook businesses. We're north of 70 million units a quarter now, and growing a few percent a quarter even in this time frame. If you look at the margin on tablet shipment that I've seen, which is maybe they go from 5 million to 8 million from Q3 to Q4, those extra 3 million units, you're talking about some small fraction of those that maybe taking money away from something else. So it really gets to be a factor, but a secondary factor.",220

These are really, really difficult things to kind of triangulate around. But I guess the thing I struggle with is overall consumer spending on tech was pretty good. I mean, smartphones are good in the third quarter, tablets are good in the third quarter, both relative to original expectations. And so it's just hard to kind of reconcile that notebooks, which had been really robust for an extended period suddenly there was weakness in that one segment in the markets where the iPad was launched. And that was all just kind of attributed to consumer weakness even though there was strength in other segments within consumer.",110

Our demand, I believe, coincided much more with that 
than tablet cannibalization here. We have seen in the past that consumers react pretty quickly, and then they come back because of the importance of this technology in their lives. We saw that in 2009. So I believe it has much more to do with just economic uncertainty than tablet cannibalization. As Paul said, the margin, there probably is some cannibalization. And over time, we'll know if it plays out like netbooks, it ends up being additive to the market, in which case it ends up being a very good thing for us because anything that expands that market for devices that compute is something we can sell into. And we plan to have the best products in that space.",143

You talked about Cloud being up 50% sequentially and 200% year-on-year. Is that at a point now where that may start to impact, say, desktop demand or notebook demand in the -- basically a desktop demand in an Enterprise environment? And just can you kind of describe what you're seeing with this kind of strength in Cloud? Are we at a point where we should better describe it as exiting points where the demand starts to really take off in that segment?",92

The virtualized desktop models doesn't seem to be gaining a lot of traction. People still want the portability of a notebook. They want the robustness, they want performance-based solutions and they want media capability even in the enterprise. So I don't really see that as being detrimental. I think it's additive to us because we get all of those apps running on our stuff. And given that there's, in all environments, limited bandwidth capabilities, the cheapest meat is still on the client versus the Cloud. And most applications recognize that. The second part of your question was I think interesting. It has to do with whether there's an inflection point on volume here. I keep asking my server guys that because I'm suspicious that there is, but we just haven't seen it or forecasted it yet. And so our teams haven't picked that up. We're still at a fairly -- it's a good growth in this area. It's a very good growth in this area, but it's not something that I see as a hockey stick. At least our team doesn't see it as a hockey stick, but it certainly one of the possibilities that could come out of this.",236

And so consequently, COGS will go up. So in addition to 22 nanometer start-up cost, should we expect a big step up in cost regarding Sandy Bridge? And consequently, do you think that a feature you're adding is going to give enough ASP boost so that the margins are at least neutral on the other space? And also, you talked about fast ramp. When should we -- I don't if you're public, but when we think this will be more than 50% of your output?",112

But to your die size question, all I'll do is refer you back to the investor meeting. I actually showed some die size projections out in time. And what you see is that as we move the graphics transistors to the CPU, we reduce the chipset die size, we increase the CPU die size. But we get a much bigger performance boost as result of that. So I think we can keep our cost nice and under control with Sandy Bridge, and the performance boost will keep that to be a very positive margin product for us. So I don't expect Sandy Bridge to be margin challenged in any way.",125
