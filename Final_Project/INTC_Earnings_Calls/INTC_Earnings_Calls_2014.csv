21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2014",2014-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2898.0,569125.0,25884877.0,Presenter Speech,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Mark. Q4 was a solid finish to a year of transitions, both for the computing market and for Intel. We spent the year building a foundation in important growing segments of computing and, as a result, we are better-positioned as we enter 2014. Importantly, the beat rate of innovation inside the company has also improved. I'll touch on each of these themes, but I'd like to start with our results.
The company's revenue was down 1% for the year, driven by a declining PC tail. The PC Client Group was down 4% for the year, but the business began to stabilize and actually grew a bit in the fourth quarter, achieving all-time record i5 and i7 unit shipments. The desktop business was particularly strong in Q4, growing 11% over last year.
In the data center, we finished the year up 7% with record server units and revenue. Cloud was up 35%; storage was up 24% and High-performance computing was up 18%. Enterprise, however, fell short of our expectations for the fourth quarter and the year as we overestimated the rate of recovery among corporate buyers. In our other businesses, the Intelligent Systems business, we saw a growth of 21%, with retail up 16% and transportation up 21% for the year. Networking grew 31% for the year. And rounding off the list, our NAND and McAfee businesses grew 15% and 4%, respectively, both achieving record revenue.
When I spoke with you in November, I shared my vision. If a device computes, it does it best with Intel, from the Internet of Things to the data center. I outlined the areas that are changing to make that vision a reality. Among the changes was a shift towards a more outside-in view of our industry and an intense focus on bringing innovation to market quickly. 
Last week at CES, there was evidence of our progress as we demonstrated technologies that weren't on our roadmap just 6 months ago, technologies that we expect will be available this year. We showed Edison, an Intel-based platform for Internet of Things, in the form of an SD card. We unveiled several innovative wearable solutions, and we announced Intel device protection technology to harden IA-based Android for the enterprise. Our disclosure in November of a new smartphone and tablet roadmap that will include SoFIA, our first IA SoC with integrated comms later this year, is further evidence that we are innovating and bringing products to market at a faster pace.
Looking ahead, 2014 will be an exciting year, as we build further on this new foundation. We've established a goal to grow our tablet volume to more than 40 million units, with an emphasis on the value segment. After finishing 2013 with more than 10 million units and a strong book of design wins, we're off to a good start. We also exit the year having made important strides on our 14-nanometer process technology. Yields improved significantly in Q4, putting us squarely on track to be in Broadwell production later this quarter. 
Our customers and partners also continued to evolve the computing experience. By the time we enter the back-to-school selling season, we'll have nearly 70 unique 2-in-1 designs with outstanding battery life and performance across a range of price points of form factors. And later this quarter, we'll launch Ivy Bridge-EX, which will bring the largest generation-to-generation improvement in MT server performance since 2010. 
Our work to improve our velocity and position the company for the future of computing isn't done, but our recent progress is testament to what's possible when we focus and bring all of Intel's assets to bear. We're building on a foundation upon which we will compete for years to come, and we're beginning this year in a better position than we began last year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",643

The fourth quarter came in consistent with expectations, with a return to financial growth and with a solid ending to a challenging year. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $13.8 billion, up 3% from a year ago. PC Client Group revenue was flat from year ago. Our Data Center Group grew 8% from year ago. And relative to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, we saw higher PC Client Group revenue, partially offset by lower growth in our Data Center Group.
Gross margin of 62% was flat to the third quarter and 1 point above our guidance. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.5 billion, up 12% from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.51, up 6% from a year ago.
For full year 2013, revenue was $52.7 billion, gross margin was 60%, operating income was $12.3 billion, net income was $9.6 billion and earnings per share was $1.89. While the PC market was down on the year, we saw the market stabilize in the back half of the year, with fourth quarter PC units up from a year ago. Additionally, we saw strong tablet growth in the back half of the year and, inclusive of PC and tablets, our unit growth in the fourth quarter was up almost 10% from a year ago. We decreased inventory levels by almost $400 million in the fourth quarter. And across the worldwide supply chain, inventory levels continue to be healthy.
Gross margin of approximately 60% in 2013 is down 2 points from 2012, driven by higher 14-nanometer factory startup costs. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $18.7 billion in 2013, 35% of revenues, down from the forecast at the beginning of the year but higher than our long-term model. Operating income was $12.3 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.89, down 11% from a year ago. 
The business continued to generate significant cash, with almost $21 billion of cash from operations in 2013. Total cash balance at the end of the year was roughly $20 billion, up approximately $2 billion from a year ago. We purchased $11 billion in capital assets, paid $4.5 billion in dividends and repurchased over $2 billion of stock.
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion, down 7% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 59%. The 3-point decline from the fourth quarter is primarily driven by higher platform write-offs as we start preproduction builds of Broadwell and 14-nanometer and overall lower platform volumes in line with seasonal trends.
Turning to 2014. We are planning for revenues to be approximately flat. We expect the Data Center Group revenue to be up in the low-double digits and the PC Client Group revenue to be down in the mid-single digit. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 60%, flat to 2013. We expect start-up costs to decline, partially offset by the impact of tablets, as we ramp our volume and provide contra revenue support to our customers. And we are forecasting spending for the year at $18.6 billion and expect capital spending of $11 billion, both of which are approximately flat to 2013.
Within the flat spending, we're advancing the starting of the company by shifting investments toward the data center, tablets and low power SoCs. The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a challenging year. Financially, the fourth quarter of 2013 was better than the fourth quarter of 2012. More importantly, we're making changes that continue to improve our competitive position. For devices that compute, our vision is if it computes, it does it best with Intel. Towards that end, we are well on our way to reinventing the personal computer. With All-in-Ones, 2-in-1s, convertibles and detachables, the amount of innovation in the PC market is unprecedented. Building on this leadership, we will start production wafers on Broadwell, our 14-nanometer product, targeting these form factors in the first quarter. 
In the tablet market, we launched the Bay Trail SoC and have started to expand our footprint and market segment share in this growing market. And in The Internet of Things market, we are bringing new architectures, like Quark and Edison, to build on our current leadership position.
We are uniquely situated to benefit from the other end of the compute continuum as the infrastructure that supports all these devices expands. Our data center business continues to see robust growth as a result of the buildout of the cloud and the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet. In 2013, we extended our leadership at the high end of the data center with the launch of the Ivy Bridge-based Xeon product line and at the low end of the data center, we extended our leadership with the launch of Avoton, targeting the microserver market. We plan to build on this foundation as we launch the Haswell-based Xeon family in 2014.
As the foundation of this innovation, we continue to advance Moore's Law faster than the rest of the industry. This gives us the world's highest performance and lowest power transistors and will result in a growing cost advantage over time. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",910

21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2014",2014-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2898.0,569125.0,25884881.0,Question,Mark Lipacis,,Analysts,6,"At the Analyst Day, you addressed your view on transistor density and your expectation for leadership on that vector. And -- but I have to say this, discussing that idea with investors is a consensus to you that seems to be that Intel has an inherent wafer cost disadvantage that, relative to TSMC, that neutralizes, or more than neutralizes, your transistor density advantage. And that argument is that TSMC ships more wafers and, therefore, has more -- better purchasing power than you and has lower labor costs and, net-net, they have just a big -- huge, advantage on wafer costs that you should have a hard -- too hard of a time to overcome. So my question is do you think that's a fair view, can you help us talk to the relevant -- relative elements of the wafer costs and how you think you can compare -- or any kind of help that you could give us on the cost dimension would be extremely helpful.",166
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2014",2014-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2898.0,569125.0,25884882.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,7,"Sure. This is Brian. I think the first thing to remember is that what really counts in all of this is transistor cost. And what we really talk about in our Moore's Law curves and when we talk about transistor density is driving a consistent cost reduction of the transistors. And so wafer cost is one segment of that. I'm not going to comment on TSMC's wafer costs versus our wafer costs, but we feel confident that our relative level of scaling and our internal wafer costs are such that we believe we have a leadership position in transistor costs. Remember, when you're talking about any product, whatever it is, a logic product that's a low-end microprocessor for a wearable or an Internet of Things or high-end Xeon server, you're talking about the number of gates and, hence, the number of transistors required to put that logic device together. It doesn't matter whose technology it's on, to some extent, it doesn't matter what node. And so the more cost-effective those transistors are, whether it's $500 million or $3 billion, the lower the product cost is. And that's really what we focus on and why we focus on transistor costs. So I think we stand by our -- what we said at the investor meeting.",214

Could you help us understand what's going on, how we should think about what's going on there?",33
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2014",2014-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2898.0,569125.0,25884884.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,9,"Sure, I'll start and then Stacy can talk to you about any of the financial discussion of it. You start these construction projects -- we talked about it in the past that you have to start them 3 years, roughly, in advance. They're very complex, some of the most complex, if not, the most complex construction projects you could imagine. So you start those 3 years in advance, so when you're ready for operation. We started this one about 3 years ago. If you go back and look 3 years ago, our view of the PC industry and PC growth, it was much more robust than what has played out and is our forecast today. And so what we've done as we've brought it online is we've been very conservative with our -- how we manage the project. We've brought it up until the shell is complete and facilitated from a construction standpoint. And we've held back putting equipment in until we see the demand requirement. And that's really what we've done. We've done that in the past. You can -- I've been in Intel's manufacturing for 30 years. You can go back in time and we did that fairly frequently. And that's what we've done with Fab 42 as well. We've held it back until the demand requirement comes about.",221

I don't have a lot to add to that. I would just say that the financial impact of this is actually pretty minimal. The -- as Brian said, we built a shell but we didn't equip it, and we did that. Before we need it, we'll ultimately use it, so the economic cost is just the time value of the money, which is a pretty modest cost. And this is pretty normal for us. It's -- we actually always want to have some pre-position space to grow into as the market grows. As Brian said, it's 3 years to construct one of these things so it's, economically, quite detrimental to get caught short, and the cost of having all of those space is pretty high. Doesn't impact depreciation, doesn't impact gross margin.",133

Can you give us a little more color what happened in the fourth quarter, especially given the confidence that you had, as recently as November, in the growth there? And also what gives you confidence, given the fourth quarter miss in forecasting, still a low-double digit growth in 2014?",57
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 16, 2014",2014-01-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,2898.0,569125.0,25884888.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,13,"Yes. Let me take that, this is Stacy. So if you look at the trends in the fourth quarter, yes, I think the trends actually reinforce the growth rate among cloud, High-performance computing, networking, storage; they all came in consistent with what we thought. Brian went through a lot of the year-on-year growth rates there, so very robust growth rates. So it actually increased our confidence in that. What we saw very specific to the enterprise was we did return to growth. It was a little bit less growth than what we had thought as we entered the quarter. As we've kind of stepped back and look at what happened there, we think there's 2 elements that hit us. One was we had a pretty robust growth rate in Q3. As we entered Q4, we saw that we had -- there's more inventory out in the world than we knew when we started the quarter, so that had to be burned off. And then secondly, we saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter, and we think that, that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling, because when you look at the customers and the segments, it's pretty clear in those segments. We had a range around growth rates for 2014, and at the investor meeting, we had said 10% to 15% based on a slower growth in enterprise in Q4 and maybe a slower recovery in enterprise over the course of 2014. I'd say we're now at the lower end of that range. So we're more at the 10% range than the 15% part of that range.",285

And I guess as my follow-on, switching gears a little bit to the OpEx side. You guided sequentially flat. But it looks like if you just hold R&D as part of that sequentially flat, for the full year, it seems to imply that R&D, as a singular expense, will be coming down as the year progresses. Is that math correct? And if so, what's driving that decline throughout the year?",71

So -- and I think Q1 will be the high point in terms of quarterly spending. It will come down quarter-by-quarter. We'll be bringing employment down over the course of the year. And beyond that, as we talked about at the investor meeting, we're going to be making some significant new investments in things like the data center, tablets, low-power SoCs, those kind of things. So even beyond the headline number, there's going to be kind of a significant shift in investment over the course of the year. But you have the math right, and it's going to be due to just shifting on projects and bringing down employment over the course of 2014.",119

As Diane showed you, we're showing a long-term growth rate in enterprise that's less than what it was 3 years ago. I think she said there is some impact associated with the virtualization curve having played out. But that doesn't stop the fact that we think that there's growth in the enterprise segment. We will just change our view for 2014. I think the recovery just plays out a bit slower than we would've thought a quarter ago.",88

And then kind of similar question on the PC side, to what extent do you think that the strength you're seeing -- relative strength you're seeing in PCs today is a function of the software transition at Microsoft and does it, therefore, end in April? Or do you think this is a more sustainable recovery?",56

So our view that, if you look out from a PC perspective, was that we forecast with a relatively cautious and careful view looking out. We compared against the third parties. We think we're in line with what third parties have forecasted as well. We -- some of the contribution to fourth quarter was the XP transition, which is really what you're talking about. We don't think that was the only thing. As I said, it was most -- a lot of the growth came from desktop, but the desktop was largely enterprise in the mature markets. That really, we think, has to do with a lot of great form factors that are coming in, the All-in-Ones, the great innovation that's coming in there. We saw some of the highest units of i5 and i7 in the enthusiast area. I think those are some great gaming platforms. So we think there's a lot more to the desktop gaming growth. We also introduced the Haswell-based NUC, which is the smallest form factor desktop machine that you can have. So it's those kinds of innovations that are driving this desktop growth as much or more than the software transition.",232

There's something I don't understand. So you just basically took your data center guidance down for 2014 by a little bit. It doesn't sound like you're taking -- you're improving your full year PC guidance at all, you're still saying kind of like single digits. And you didn't take your full year revenue outlook down.

I think, Stacy, you're assuming a level of precision around approximately flat that doesn't exist. Approximately flat can encompass a little bit up, a little bit down.

Let me -- I'll anchor it on Q1 and then give you a sense of how I see it playing out over the course of the year since we've provided specific guidance for Q1. We've guided Q1 at 59%. Coming down from Q4, over 62% in Q4, so down to 59%. The elements there that bring us down, we have about 1.5 points down associated with the start of production on Broadwell prior to its qualification for sale. So you've seen this from us in the past that, that build will be reserved out until we reach the formal qualification date. And then we're about 1 point down in Q1 as a result of just being a seasonally lower quarter. And so I think you'd kind of understand and expect both of those. 60% for the year, so our algebra would say an improving gross margin over the course of the year. I think when we get into the back half of the year, we have a gross margin that's back into the low 60s. When I think about the headwinds and tailwinds to that, the tailwinds are that we expect that we'll see a falling off of 14-nanometer startup costs. We talked about that at the investor meeting and I think that's consistent with what you'd expect from us. We see volume and unit costs getting better over the course of the year, and reserves will get a bit better as we progress through the year. Again, we have this Broadwell reserve in the first quarter. The big offset to that then are the dollars that we're providing in terms of contra revenue dollars for tablets, that we also talked about in some depth at the investor meeting, we're not seeing a lot of those in the first quarter. They really build over the course of the year. So we have the positives that we I outlined and then you'll see that offset as a result of kind of those temporary contra revenue dollars that we're providing to our customers as we take our tablet product line kind of broadly through the different OSs and price points.",359

And for my follow-up, I guess it's kind of on that question. So on the tablet strategy, to get to $40 million, you're saying it's going to be a 1.5 percentage hit. Let's say you guys get into the second half of the year and you're not quite to the $40 million, if it's a pretty significant shortfall, would you consider canning that strategy? I guess I'm just wondering what the commitment is if the volumes aren't there but the cost is there by the end of the year.",90

So this isn't a price reduction as a normal price reduction would be. It's not where you're just simply reducing it. It's truly a BOM cost equalizer. And remember, a lot of our 40 million tablets in '14 will be based on Bay Trail. Bay Trail was originally designed for Atom-based PC segment and the upper-end tablet. And so it's -- what we're doing here is doing a BOM cost delta relative to the -- what the mid and lower-end tablets require. And so those are things like Bay Trail may require more layers of a printed circuit board for the board itself, more components on the board and tighter power management controls and things like that. We have a whole program to reduce those throughout the year, so that gives us confidence that, as we go through the year, the BOM cost delta will shrink. But if the volume didn't show up for some reason, and I'm not going to say that, that's what's going to happen, but I'm confident it will, but if it didn't, it's on a per-unit basis. And so the spending on that contra would be reduced equivalently.",194

And keep in mind, these are costs at the system level, not at our chip level. And it will vary a lot based by SKU, but to give you a sense, for a Bay Trail platform, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, we think that, that BOM penalty drops by more than half. And so it just -- it kind of gets better out in time, and then when we get to the Broxton generation, we think it's de minimis.",109

I mean, I'll bridge back to our strategy here. Our strategy is that -- that we're going to use our process technology lead. We'll have leadership product that also are competitive or maybe even leadership in terms of cost. And I showed some data at the investor meeting that just kind of showed the die size as we progress from Bay Trail to Broxton to SoFIA, so you can get a sense of the kinds of cost structure that we're going to have. On a per-unit basis, I don't think it causes, or on a percentage basis, yes, I can't -- I'm not envisioning a situation where it causes the gross margin percentage to go up. But you can definitely get to a space once we get through these contra enabling dollars, where every unit we sell is accretive on our gross margin dollars per unit. It's utilizing factories that we have in place for PCs, and so it's a nice add [ph] or -- at a gross-margin-dollars-per-unit standpoint.",174

We didn't see any surprise on the notebook side. We saw overall PC units a little bit higher and that was really desktop. And that was, as Brian said, broad-based across desktops.

And I guess the reason I'm asking the question is, I get in the absence of knowing, just guiding the seasonal makes sense, but you do have Bay Trail Android tablets in Q1 that you didn't have in Q4. And then when you look at availability of SKUs in the PC group, you actually have a lot better availability of kind of the SKUs I think people like in Q1 versus Q4, both of which would kind of argue for better seasonality. So maybe if you can give a little granularity, that will be helpful.",135

Part of it is -- let's go back. It's seasonality of growth from Q4, right, so a stronger Q4. So it's a good quarter. I don't want to say that just growing at seasonality is not -- not a [ph] good thing. Second thing I would say is, you're right, on the PC, we do see a lot of the 2-in-1s come in. But also, Q1 is just -- there's not a lot of events that happened that can drive upsides like holidays and things like that. Now, one of your comments you said we'll start seeing Bay Trail Android tablets, most of the Bay Trail Android tablets really start showing up more in Q2 than in Q1. And that's, again, purely -- remember, we made a shift, our original program for Bay Trail was all Windows. As we came into the midpoint of the year, we said let's shift and make it Windows and Android. And so our OEM partners as well are targeting more towards Q2. And it's just when do you go and start putting back in that back-to-school event, which is the next seasonal place where upsides usually occur.",206

And the only thing I'd add -- that's right, I guess, I'd say I certainly hope you're right, and it's better than seasonal. And we have all the ability in the world to respond to that. So that ends up being a good answer. The thing you want to keep in mind as you work through seasonality over the course of the year is that these contra revenue dollars that we're providing to the customers for tablet-enabling, that will come off of revenue. So it's a gross margin hit but it will also be a decrement to revenue while we support them. So it's not so much a Q2 issue, but as you get into the back half, it's going to be one of the minuses out there.",129

And then, guys, just relative to DCG, at the Analyst Day in November, you talked about your expectation for enterprise kind of being, I believe, a 7% or 8% type long-term grower. I know, relative to Glen's question around virtualization, you answered that. I guess my question is have you taken into account sort of cloud and enterprise as kind of offloading infrastructure into the cloud? I know, at the Analyst Day, you talked about 2/3 of cloud growth being consumer and not business, but if you start to lose dollars in enterprise to cloud, is it kind of a 1:1 loss? If you lose at enterprise, you'll just make it up in cloud? Or how do I think about that dynamic?",125

If that's how it plays out, it should be dollar for dollar, or close enough that you don't care. One of the phenomena that we've seen is that we've seen the mix in the cloud actually moving up. So if you look at the ASP impact inside of servers, John, it's more driven by cloud than anything else right now. And so they're buying a richer and richer mix. And so that's why I think you're probably pretty close if you start to see an offload that way. And utilization rates inside the enterprises tend to be pretty high on the kinds of things that they move into the cloud. So I think you're pretty close to 1:1.",127

I would just -- exactly. And I would just say, on the client side, we think what we're seeing in Asia is just that the tablet penetration rate increase that's offset by a couple of years from what we saw in mature markets.

In addition, we don't talk a lot about, but we are already in that low-cost Asia market. We are in Shenzhen, we are working with ODMs there. That's actually where a lot of the innovation is coming out of for some of these cost reductions on tablets and where we're getting the cost reduction ideas. So we're in that market now.

The real usages in the values are going to be in those high-compete areas, things like video, things like media transfer, media manipulation, all the classic things around computing that you saw drive the compute cycles on PC and people are doing more and more with tablets and phones, are going to be the same things that drive 64-bit utilization on these mobile devices.

I think the headline here is that the first half of the year, we saw an enterprise market that was declining, when we got into the back half of the year, it was growing. It was just growing a little less fast than we thought, and recovery was a little less fast than we thought. My expectation is we'll see that segment kind of pop back to the normal rate. I also think that we were just a bit ahead of ourselves in terms of how fast the enterprise market was going to recover and grow. So we have a little bit more of a cautious view with that as we progress to 2014. So I guess the short answer is, yes, I expect that piece to come back.

And so it really is very SKU-by-SKU-dependent. It's not a fixed number out there. We work with each OEM and that's how I'm comfortable that we're going to work this out over the next year or so. We work with each OEM depending on what -- are they targeting a high-end SKU, a mid-range SKU, a low-level SKU, what type of display and graphics and all of those things they want to put in that system, we have a delta in BOM that we're working out.

PC Client platform unit volume was up year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Even as challenges remain in the consumer client segment, we saw continued improvements in enterprise clients, driven by increasing form factor innovation and refresh. 
Mobile unit volume was up year-over-year for the first time since Q2 2012, while desktop units were flat year-over-year with all-time record core volume and mix. 
Our data center revenue grew 11% during the year, and the enterprise segment was again in positive territory, up 3% over last year, while cloud, networking and storage were all up in excess of 20%.
The newly formed Internet of Things Group, which includes our Embedded business, grew 32% year-over-year with particularly strong demand in in-vehicle infotainment and retail, while the Internet of Things group's Atom volume, nearly doubled over Q1 of last year.
We had all-time record NAND revenue, driven by the data center and, particularly, the cloud. And McAfee reported Q1 bookings along -- record-Q1 bookings along with an 8% year-over-year increase in consumer bookings. 
Perhaps more importantly, we made progress against our most critical strategic objective, and I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight that progress.
In PCCG, where we're working to reinvent computing with new form factor innovation, longer battery life and OS of choice, we saw 2-in-1 volume increase more than 20% sequentially in a seasonally down quarter. We're now expecting more than 70 2-in-1 designs for the back-to-school selling season and many will be offered at $6.99 or less. These trends, in combination with renewed interest in Windows 8 from our customers, are encouraging.
At the same time, we are ramping more than 130 Atom micro-architecture notebook and desktop designs with our Bay Trail M and D platforms, significantly increasing our presence in the value segment. And we exit the quarter with market segment shared leadership on Chrome systems and saw a positive traction in small form factor and All-in-One computing.
In DCG, we launched our Ivy Bridge MP Server CPU family known as Xeon E7. The new E7 line, which features the largest memory footprint in the industry, saw a particularly strong reception from enterprise as a result of its high-speed, real-time data analytic capability. 
We also announced an important strategic alliance with an investment in Cloudera, which is designed to accelerate Hadoop innovation and penetration, particularly on IA.
We've broken out MCG results for the first time this quarter. In order to achieve long-term success in all of our market segments, from 2-in-1s all the way through to the Internet of Things, we're making the investments necessary for leadership, and you can see these investments in MCG's result.
For example, at Mobile World Congress in February, we announced multiyear, multi-device agreements with Lenovo, Asus, Dell and Foxconn to expand the availability of Atom-based smartphones and tablets. We set an aggressive goal of shipping 40 million tablet SoCs this year, and I'm happy to say we've tallied more than 90 designs on Android and Windows and shipped 5 million units in the first quarter, placing us squarely on track to that goal.
Our first LTE solution, the 7160, is now available in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo and ASUS Fonepad 7, in addition to the previously announced Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.
Our CAT6 LTE solution, the 7260 with carrier aggregation, is on track to ship this quarter. And Samsung, Asus, Lenovo and Dell are all committed to the platform on a combination of phones and tablets, along with module vendors like Huawei and Sierra Wireless. 
We've demonstrated SoFIA, our first integrated apps processor and baseband, after adding it to the roadmap late last year. We're on track to ship the 3G solution to OEMs in Q4 2014, with the LTE version following in the first half of 2015.
In the New Devices and Internet of Things Group, we're working to extend Intel technology into the fast-growing world of interconnected devices. We completed the acquisition of BASIS. BASIS provides access to new world-class technology and a team of proven innovators. 
We also shipped our first Quark SoC for the Internet of Things, and announced an upgrade of Edison to the Silvermont Atom architecture. Edison is on track to ship this summer. 
And into the Technology and Manufacturing Group, we've worked to advance Moore's Law's foundation to our long-term success. We began production on our 14-nanometer process technology and remain on track to launch Broadwell in the second half of the year. And the Foundry team extended our collaboration with Altera to the development of multi-die devices that would take advantage of our world-class package and assembly capabilities and Altera's leading-edge programmable logic.
Taken together, these milestones give me confidence that the pace inside our company and our progress with our customers is accelerating. We've made a lot of changes, we have more work to do, but I'm confident that we will continue to transform and realize our vision, that if it computes, it does it best with Intel.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",858

The first quarter came in consistent with expectations, demonstrating financial growth and a solid start to the year. 
For the first quarter, revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 1% from a year ago and in line with expectations.
PC Client Group revenue was down 1% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes grow 1% year-over-year and, inclusive of tablets, we saw a high-single-digit unit growth. PC platform average selling prices declined 3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Our Data Center Group revenue grew 11% from a year ago, with platform volumes up 3% and platform average selling prices up 8% over the same period.
Some insights into the revenue results of our new segments. The Mobile and Communications Group is down 61% from a year ago. The underlying dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the investor meeting last November. We are seeing a decline in our feature phone and 2G/3G multi-comm business, as we are in the midst of a transition to integrated LTE solutions. In addition, the ramp in tablet volume is being offset by an increase in contra revenue dollars. 
The Internet of Things Group is up 32% year-on-year. We continue to see robust growth across segments, with particular strength in point-of-sale devices in retail and automotive in-vehicle infotainment systems.
Gross margin of 60% was down 2 points from the fourth quarter and 1 point above our guidance. Spending came in at $4.9 billion, $100 million above our outlook, primarily driven by a current-period charge relating to ongoing litigation. 
Operating income for the first quarter was $2.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. And earnings per share was $0.38, down 5% from a year ago.
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13 billion, up 2% from the first quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. 
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the second quarter to be 63%. The 3-point increase from the first quarter is primarily driven by lower factory start up costs as we ramped 14-nano. We are also forecasting higher platform volume and lower platform write-offs on the qualification of our first 14-nanometer products. This is partially offset by the increase in tablet volume and the related contra revenue dollars.
Turning to full year 2014. We are still planning for revenues to be approximately flat to 2013. We expect PC Client Group revenue to decline in the mid-single digits and the Data Center Group revenue to grow in the low-double digits.
We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 61%, up 1 point from the outlook provided in January. This increase is primarily driven by lower unit costs across both our PC and tablet products and lower non-production manufacturing costs. 
We are forecasting spending for the year at $18.9 billion. This $300 million increase over the prior outlook is driven by increased R&D investments and litigation expenses. We still expect capital spending to be flat to 2013, with the midpoint at $11 billion.
The first quarter was a solid start to 2014, reinforcing our view of the underlying market trends. The PC market is stabilizing and, on a year-on-year basis, we saw unit growth for the second quarter in a row.
In the data center, we continue to see robust growth rates in the cloud segment, and the enterprise segment grew in the first quarter. These trends led to data center growth of 11% year-on-year. We are winning designs and ramping our tablet volume rapidly, and we have design wins in LTE that will result in a second half revenue ramp.
Our Internet of Things business grew over 30% in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis. And we are driving significant innovation in this area as we invest to extend our architecture into the very-low-power space and acquire IP and capabilities.
At IDF Beijing, 2 weeks ago, we showcased the broad range of products we are bringing to the marketplace. These products range from servers in the data center to innovative PC form factors like detachable and All-in-Ones, to tablets, to phones and to wearables.
This is our strategy in action. If it computes, it does it best with Intel Inside. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",736

So it's going up nicely in Q2, but if we look at the yearly guidance, it looks like it's dropping in the second half. Can you just talk about the reason that's happening?",38

I'd be happy to. But let me -- I'll do the walk kind of from Q1 to Q2, and then I'll give you a sense of what I see in terms of the pluses and minuses as we move into the back half of the year. As we go into the second quarter, so we were -- we ended Q1 at 60%. We're forecasting Q2 at 63%. The big driver there is we get about 2.5 points of good news associated with the falloff of 14-nanometer startup costs, so that's pretty consistent with what we've been talking about and what you've seen from us in the past. We'll get a little bit more good news associated with Q2 being a bit up in terms of volume, so that's about 0.5 point. And then we get 0.5 point in Q2 associated with lower platform write-offs as we qualify those first 14-nanometer products towards the end of the quarter. And then there's a bit of an offset as we ramped tablets and we started to see some of the associated contra revenue dollars with tablets. We saw some of that in Q1 but we'll see a bit more in Q2. And so that's about a 0.5-point offset. So that gets us to 63% for Q2. And then, yes, the math, if you triangulate a 61% for the year, would say that we have a gross margin in the back half of the year that's in the low 60s. I think the plus that we see going in is we expect seasonally stronger volume in the back half, so that gives us a little bit of a plus. On the minus side, it's 2 things: one, the tablet volume is back-end loaded for us. Again, as you'd expect, it's, primarily, a consumer product. So we'll see in the back half of the year the ramp of tablets and the associated contra revenue dollars, so that's a bit of an offset. And then we'll also see costs coming down from Q1, Q2 to Q3. And then in Q4, we'll see a lot of volume coming out of multiple factors on 14-nanometer, and so you get a bit of a mix up in costs for those early wafers coming off of 14-nanometer. And again, that's a phenomenon you've seen from us in the past. We would expect that to come down pretty rapidly after that, but the first quarter tends to be pretty expensive.",414

And for my follow up, maybe just give us your take on the PC space. Just talk about how the market is feeling now versus your expectations 3 months ago. And then any impact from the expiration of Windows XP, either into your expectations for Q2 or with what happened in Q1?",54

I can give you a kind of an overall look at how we see the PC market. This is Brian. Now in general, if you look at Q1 and even as we head into Q2, it's playing out as we pretty much expected. We continue to see strength in the enterprise, and that's pretty much across the board everywhere. Consumer still remains a bit weak for us. Emerging markets starting to strengthen a little bit in the consumer, but the rest of the world is still showing some weakness at the consumer level. We think what's driving the kind of overall stabilization is a series of things that start to just play out in Q4 and we see them playing out into Q1 and, we think, throughout this year. And some of it is -- it's a mixture of things from, yes, there is Windows XP, it is a part of this equation. We don't think it's a driver. If you look at the form factors that we're bringing out, the price points that we've been able to enter, you're seeing strong PCs down in the $200 range now. Haswell really coming to market as we enter into Q1 and into Q2. You saw the 130 Atom designs that we have out there. So it's a series of real vectors that are driving the stabilization, we believe.",228

I'd be happy to, Jim. Yes, they -- let me even back up and give you -- again, restate the strategy of what we're doing here, and Brian can come in over-the-top of some of the technology. But what we're doing is we're taking Bay Trail, which is a product really designed for the PC market, and we made the decision to take it broadly across different segments of the tablet market this year. It brings along with it, at least over the course of the 2014, a higher bill of materials. And that's kind of independent from the SoC costs, it's the power management subsystem. It's the motherboard that it goes on. It's the memory solution, those kinds of things. And so we're providing some contra revenue to offset that bill of material delta over the course of 2014. Now as we said, we're doing value engineering with our customers and our partners. And so we're bringing down that bill of material over the course of 2014, independent of any changes to our SoC.

And it's, again, the enablement we're doing around the bill of materials and then we also have new products coming into the marketplace like SoFIA that's targeted at the low end and, in 2015, you'll see Broxton, which is an SoC more for the mid range to high range of the market, coming into our product portfolio. So the combination of all that gives us a better cost structure with our own products and a better cost structure, overall, with the bill of materials as we enter '15 and then work through '15.",126

Just to make sure it's apples-to-apples. The guidance that you provided for this year is for the long term CAGR, does that change now that you have a common infrastructure part also within that group?",42

So interesting what we're doing hear, Ambrish, is we're actually now restating the segment to match how we've been talking about the segment. If you go back to the investor meeting presentations over the last couple of years, we've included the communications infrastructure piece to that because we do view it as part of the server market. So if you go back to Kirk's original presentation, I think it was 2 years ago, 2011, and you'll see it's kind of clearly laid out in that long-term CAGR. Brian and Renée have now organized the company more in line with that. So we have all of that under one group, and so we've redone our segments as a result. I'll also say, for Q1, just to -- because I don't think you can see this anywhere else, but the DCG year-on-year growth rate was 11% in the restated segments. If you took out the CID [ph] piece, so you'd -- if we had not made that change, it still would have been 10-plus percent. So it's worth about a point of growth in Q1. So it -- I think we're pleased with the growth rate, with and without, I guess, is how I did say it.",206

That's helpful because, you're right, at the last Analyst Day also you did have that piece in there when it was not part of DCG. My follow up then is a quicker one, on the MCG side, are we looking at this revenue run rate bottoming out here? Because now you're going to the back half, you also talked about CAT6 shipments. I think, Brian, you were at IDF or somewhere in Shanghai or in China. So is this the bottom for this segment in the quarter?",88

So as we said, we're seeing that on the comm side, that transition from 2G to 3G, so we're seeing a troughing of that business. And as we move into the back half. We'll see the LTE, particularly the 7260, coming to market. So we'll start to see, I think, a nice ramp in revenue on that segment. We'll have significant unit growth in tablets. But remember, that contra revenue isn't just a gross margin impact, it's actually a subtraction from revenue. And so that'll kind of mute the revenue growth for the segment because you have that negative as we get into the back half and ship more tablets. To the prior question, I expect that to abate as we get into 2015, but you'll definitely see that in the back half of '14.",149

But from a year-over-year comparison, from our billing standpoint, you have to remember that Q1 of '13, there was a big contraction in the worldwide supply chain in terms of inventory levels, and I think that impacted our billing. So we're, I think, getting the advantage of a good year-on-year comparison point there. We still expect for the year that units are down in the low-single digits. And, I don't know, we'd love to be wrong on that, but that's our view of the market. I think that's pretty aligned with the third parties.",126

And that's not to say that inventories have grown. Actually, inventories are in very good shape as we look across the entire supply chain, both within Intel and outside. So we think inventories, after that correction in the beginning of '13, are actually normalized now where they'll probably stay. And as Stacy had said and as we've said in the call, you're seeing us in all price points in the space. So you're seeing Bay Trail and even core products down at lower price points. You'll also see us gaining market share in Chrome over this time period. So we're in a significant percentage of the Chrome systems out there. So there's a variety of things that are allowing us to get some upswing a bit in the mobile market as well.",138

As a follow up, so at one point, there was Bay Trail T, M and D for tablet, mobile and desktop. Are -- is the M and D still accounted for in PC and T in tablet?

Great question. So the first answer is yes. The M and D would be included in PCCG's results. The T is included in MCG's results and would be in the tablet volume that we're talking about. And yes, the notebook ASP that you saw was exactly consistent with our strategy. We're bringing Bay Trail in there. It's got the right cost structure. It's -- actually, the volume was a little ahead of what we thought in Q1. It's enabling us to grow units a bit and maintain and grow profitability and the overall company's gross margin looked pretty good too.",102

Our assumption, we haven't change, we've said that, actually, our 450 is somewhere in the latter half of this decade, right? So we're still saying that. You're going to see, give and takes, on 450 spending. These are long drawn out programs over multiple years. And so I think you -- don't grade the whole program by one shift in when we buy a tool or when we move out some spending in some cases. And don't forget, anytime we do that, you typically have just more 300-millimeter that you're going to go spend money on. We've continued to hold our forecast flat for CapEx.

Has the full year expected impact for tablets changed at all? And if memory serves me correct, that was 150 basis points.

I mean, there may be -- the second decimal may have changed, but directionally it's the same. And as Brian said in his prepared remarks, we're actually feeling pretty good about the line of sight we have across the customers, the kind of longer-term agreements we have in place and the design wins that we know are coming to market. As well as the Q1 volume. In terms of the impact in the second half, I haven't done the math that way. But imagine you're probably not too far off because it's 150 basis points, more or less, for the year and it's back-end loaded, so it's going to be in that kind of a range. Do the math for the back half saying that this kind of the -- that as well as a Q4 cost of 14-nanometer out of multiple factories is the thing that kind of keeps us in the low 60s as opposed to higher. So I think your math part is pretty close.",182

And I guess, as part of that, as you think about offering those foundry services to potential customers, how you think about maybe some of the changes you need to do in terms of tool-sets with Fab 42?",87

I'd say the interest since we opened up the foundry has been high. These interactions, just getting people comfortable with what the technology is, take several months, typically those deep interaction between the technical teams on both sides, really understanding what the process -- the silicon technology incorporates, what the design tools are, what IP we have to offer, where they can go get third-party IP, all of those kinds of interactions. Those have been ongoing with many customers. And then you start the business discussions around pricing and availability and all of that. So I'd tell you that the uptake has been strong. We've been in many, many interactions. As far as what does it tell us about what needs to change within Intel, I think we still have a lot to learn about how to be a good foundry. Altera, who is really kind of our lead premier customer, I'd say a big customer, has really been helpful. They've helped us see where we're strong and where we're not and what it takes to become strong in those areas. They're making good progress on their products. I don't think there's a lot of change from a technology standpoint that's outside the changes we're going to make, say, at 10 nanometers of our own product. We're driving to lower power, more mobility, able to integrate better, all of those things into our own products. Integration of memory capability, that's driven by our own need to move into those mobile spaces, and that's helping us with the same roadmaps that are being required by the foundry partners. Fab 42 is purely capacity-driven based on demand. We'll trigger that as we trigger demand, both either internally or from the foundry. Remember, though, the foundry partners signed up today. It's probably 2 years, 18 to 24 months before first silicon, and probably 30 to 36 months before they really have ramped to any volume. And Fab 42 is probably 12 to 18 months from when you'd be able to bring it into capacity. So the 2 have much -- a great deal of overlap.",360

If you're viewing the foundry business as we would have a specific foundry factory, it's -- that's probably not the case.

How do you think about this business? Obviously, you're trying to ramp the product set, you are a bit behind. You're entering from the low end and that pricing seems quite tough. You're facing some subsidies that you have the do on the tablet side. Are there some milestones that you look at to get this business back profitable? Or maybe would you consider this strategic enough that you would consider continuing to run this as a loss?",106

Absolutely, this is a strategic business, so let's just start with that. We think this is critical and we've kind of said this in our prepared statements. It's critical from 2-in-1 devices down to the Internet of Things. When you look across the connectivity requirements there, more and more, the devices are requiring integrated connectivity, whether it be LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, all of these connectivities are becoming more and more required. We don't go into these businesses thinking that we're going to lose money, we believe we have a roadmap to get to profitability in that business. The milestones that I look at, and so I'll give you those for yourself to look at, we have the 7160, the current LTE version out there. We're the second in LTE. We have the 7260 launch this quarter, I think that's a critical there. Again, we're closing the gap with our competition. We're bringing out leading-edge CAT6 capability with carrier aggregation, that's a critical milestone, that puts -- that closes the gap and puts us firmly in the LTE capability. The next one is SoFIA. If you look at the SoFIAs at the end of this year, with 3G integration, and then a big first half of next year with LTE integration. Remember those products weren't even on our roadmap 6 or 7 months ago. So that shows that we are acting quickly, integrating and bringing those products to production. And then after that, as Stacy said earlier, Broxton, which is our internal 14-nanometer product that's targeted towards the mid-to-high level. And as we bring that into the second half of '15 and into '16, there'll be various levels of integration on that. So when I look across this, those are the milestones I look at because those are what drives -- that, along with the just basic cost-reduction capabilities we talked about for this year as we get out of this contra revenue into '15, those products then place us firmly in leadership capability from the low end to the high end with integration. And those are the milestones to me that will lead to profitability long term.",376

I think you left it off because it was so obvious, but the 40 million tablets is one of the things I see, Brian, just laser-focused on. As we've talked it about before, it gets us into the kind of 15% to 20% range of the total tablet market, it gives us a big-enough footprint that we start to see people developing on our architectures, it becomes a self-sustaining kind of ecosystem as we're bringing in these other products to the marketplace.

We will qualify for shipment to customers towards the end of this quarter. Those are the first 2 milestones. We've passed one of them. Then our -- you'll start to see our customers bring products to market as we progress into the second half of this year. It's -- these things are hard, there are always yield improvement efforts that we have and cost reductions that we're going through.

We're looking at this right now, though, so we have the business fall more than 50%, sequentially. You have -- your 7160, which is shipping, but apparently it's not really driving much volume. We have the 7260, which is forthcoming, but we really haven't heard much about design wins. And you launched in the Mobile World Congress without really saying very much there. We have SoFIA coming, which absolutely is integrated but is being made at TSMC for the few next years, which means you'll lose any potential benefits from your own process technology and you look -- seem to be well behind what the market leaders are shipping in terms of 4G. Just what should we be looking for and over what time frame should we be looking for, for the ramp? I guess what I'm asking is how can we get confidence that we are going to actually see the revenue ramp that, I guess, is built into the short-term expectations for this year and then going forward, to make sure that you can actually get a profitable business, which is, obviously, would be driving quite a bit of upside to where the models are today.",234

Remember, the 7160 we gave you a series of products that it's shipping in. And on the 7260, which will qualify this quarter, we gave you a list of OEM partners that have committed to that platform. So we're fairly confident that the ramp in the second half of this year will continue on that product. And it is a leadership product. SoFIA, you're right, is built at TSMC, we went for speed and integration, and it was simply quicker to get to market with a competitive product. From both a price and performance, we actually believe that the IA core will give us better performance than the competition. And the competition is at that same node at TSMC. And it's 3G at the end of this year and LTE in the first half of next year. We then told you that in the second half of next year, and again, we're debating whether it's the second half or the first quarter of '16, but we'll move all of that internal on this 14-nanometers. It's really based on other products that we have moving in at that time and just overall resources, right, with a lot going on, the ramp of Broadwell, the ramp of Skylake in the second half of next year, plus bringing these products inside. But I'm very confident that when you do that, plus you add in Broxton, which is targeted towards the mid-to-high range and, again, is integrated with leading-edge LTE, and don't forget, we have a roadmap of LTE products beyond the 7260 that continue those level of carrier aggregation and product leadership, we're fairly confident that we can continue to grow this business and turn it profitable over that time.",297

It sounds basic but it really stems from our manufacturing leadership. For 2 years ahead of the rest of the industry and extending, it gives us the ability to as we target our products into the right space from a power standpoint, we will have power advantage and performance advantage and the cost advantage. That really is our strategy playing out. You're seeing the first products hitting that theme over the course of this year and into early next year. Bay Trail is a really good product for the high-end of the market. You'll see products coming into the market that are more targeted to the mid range and lower end of the market next year. But that's how the strategy plays out. I would say, for 2015, you would -- I would expect to see a reduction in the loss, not profitability, but a reduction in the loss, we'll feel pretty good when we get there and then we'll keep driving towards the long-term profitability goal.",180

I'd like to drill in a bit more -- actually, into the tablet efforts now. So you're obviously, subsidized. And I get the idea of reducing BOM costs in order to make up for the deficiencies, with the idea being that you can drive -- improve products down the road. But at the same time, if you look at the tablet market, where it is today, you're obviously not going to be going after Apple anytime soon. Maybe there's a little bit of volume at Samsung but -- I mean, if you take those guys out, 75% of what's left is systems that are $250 and below, where your competitors are shipping quad core chips for much less than $10. I'm curious to know like what kind of economics and pricing you see from that market, long term? And are the -- I guess, the total revenue pool and profit pool that's available, even if you were to succeed at your goals, why does that make it a worthwhile effort to actually go after? Or is this simply, as you said, strategic? Is this an attempt to limit further penetration of tablets into the core market?",200
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q1 2014 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2014",2014-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3292.0,610979.0,27557879.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,57,"So I'll start and Stacy is welcome to jump in. You've asked a question that has kind of multiple questions built into it. But what I -- let's start with what we told you was we've got multiple OEM partners building tablets and phones on our products. And we give you Asus and Dell and Lenovo and Samsung on those products. If you look at the tablet business, overall, it's broken up into a series of segments. And you're right, there is a large percentage of them that are $250 and below. Products like SoFIA are specifically designed for that segment. And our dual core SoFIA already performs quite well against quad core systems. As we move into next year, we'll bring quad core SoFIA-based products out as well. And so we believe that we can stay very cost-competitive and have a performance leadership. Remember, Intel has 2 assets. We have our silicon technology, but we also have our architecture. And one of the things an OEM gets when they build with Intel technology is that they can go into any OS and they could build a single platform and move that onto Chrome, onto Android, onto Windows. And that's a very unique capability that they -- that we provide to OEMs for flexibility. So we believe, with a product like SoFIA, as we bring that into the market next year, we can absolutely compete in those spaces and make money. You're probably not going to make as much revenue dollars and as much margin dollars as the PC business, but we think this is still critical. And it's critical for a variety of reasons. Part of it is simply the scale. You want to have those units. You want to have a presence in all areas of computing. And the second one is that in developer attention. You want developers creating new products, doing innovation on your architecture. This is a space that's got innovation. We are going to bring some of that innovation to this market. You're going to see some tablets as you go into the end of this year. We showed them at CES. Some of the highlights were -- you have 3D cameras, you have perceptual computing capabilities for gaming, all of those kinds of things can change the tablet market along with the PC market. So we believe that we can bring a lot of the innovation that we do in the PC, down into the tablet space. And again, that keeps the developers developing and interested in our platform. I think, for all those reasons, we want to be in this space and we will be in this space from now on.",450

We don't fear the low end of the market. You look at how we played out in PCs. You can drive a lot of unit growth by participating in PCs now that are $199 to $250. We can have cost structure because of our manufacturing lead to participate nicely there. And you see that as markets mature, they also segment. And so we have -- looking at our PC business, we have great demand and profitability at Core i7s. And that spans down to Bay Trail, at the Atom segment of the market. So I -- it's a kind of misconception to think that we only want to play at the high end. Our manufacturing leadership can give us the cost structure to play profitably at the low end as well.",142

Between the desktop and the notebook, obviously, there's very different dynamics. Do you see a point in which the notebook side starts flattening out and starts to act like the desktop side, where ASPs have been up strongly both last year and year-over-year in the first quarter? Or is that pressure to the low end going to persist and so we shouldn't think of a flattening out anytime soon?",86

I think you have this range of devices that are computers, and they range from a high end All-in-One down to $199 very-low-cost notebook computer that's being sold. And I think what we're seeing is kind of strength at both ends of the market. And if you look at our pricing over the last 3 years, it's been pretty dead flat, on average, across the PC market. You can see from our gross margin forecast for 2014, I'm not expecting ASP to be one of the big drivers, so you can take from that, we continue to see a pretty benign pricing environment.

It's good to see the headcount coming down in the second half, down versus the first half, but you're still significantly elevated versus your target model. I know you're not going to guide for 2015 with any specifics whatsoever, but can you remind us, if you do end this year with lower headcount than you ended the prior year so you're going into the year down year-over-year, is the tick-tock of process engineering moving from R&D into COGS a headwind or a tailwind in '15?

So in a year like this year, where you see startup costs coming down, that means that the engineers that were working on 14-nanometer that were being classified as cost of sales now moved to 10-nanometer and they're being classified as R&D.

So our mix of OSs reflects pretty much what you see in the marketplace. So I think, depending on how you look at it, it's probably something on the order of 90% Android, 80% Android, 10% to 20% Windows. Our percentages look very much like the marketplace. So if Windows continues to grow and gain traction, I think our percentage would just align directly to that. So you can -- don't separate what we ship from what's basically in the marketplace. We have a leadership capability on all of the OSs now. As far as what is the price point, again, it reflects fairly closely to what the marketplace is. You see us in systems below $100 now. The majority of the systems are, say, $125 to $250, somewhere in there. And then you see us in some of the upper-end systems, $250 to $400. And so -- but the majority is in that, I'd call it, $125 to probably $250 range.",163

The second quarter exceeded our expectations. An improving environment, PC refresh, form factor innovation and the end of life of Windows XP combined to drive better-than-expected demand. In fact, microprocessor volume in the second quarter was an all-time record. 
From the most powerful supercomputers to the smallest energy-efficient embedded machines, the breadth and strength of our results suggest that our reach is extending. 
The PC Client Group's results reflect the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth. In Q2, both the desktop platform revenue and the notebook platform revenue grew year-over-year. The installed base of PCs that are at least 4 years old is now roughly 600 million units, and we are seeing clear signs of a refresh in the enterprise and small and medium businesses.
While there are some signs of renewed consumer interest and activity, the Consumer segment remains challenging, primarily in the emerging markets.
The Bay Trail family of SoCs has been a standout that has helped us expand into new segments. Bay Trail's performance allows us to deliver a much smaller and lower cost Atom-based core in our Pentium and Celeron brands for the first time. 
Our Bay Trail SoC volume in desktops and clamshells more than doubled over the last quarter, and now represents more than 60% of our Pentium and Celeron mix and nearly 20% of our notebook mix. This is enabling our growth at lower price points in our new segments like Chrome-based systems, without sacrificing margin.
The Data Center business had a strong quarter, with 19% growth year-over-year, leading to all-time record revenue of $3.5 billion. Following last quarter's launch of the Ivy Bridge-based Xeon E7 processor family, we saw strong MP [ph] volume and a richer product mix and ASP mix. 
Cloud, networking, High-Performance Computing and enterprise revenue all grew more than 15% in the second quarter. Demand and revenue growth in several segments demonstrated the growing reach of Intel technology beyond CPUs for PCs and servers. Our Internet of Things Group grew 24% year-over-year and set a revenue record, as the retail and manufacturing sectors performed especially well.
NAND revenue grew 20% and McAfee revenue grew 5%. Finally, we are squarely on track to our 40 million unit tablet goal, shipping 10 million units in the second quarter. 
We also achieved some important milestones during the quarter. We qualified the first Broadwell-based Core M processors and at Computex, we highlighted the form factor innovation that 14-nanometer Core M product family will enable. Systems like our Llama Mountain reference design, a fanless, detachable 2-in-1 that is razor thin at 7.2 millimeters and weighs just 24 ounces. We also announced a landmark strategic relationship with Rockchip to accelerate and expand our SoC roadmap for the value and entry tablet market segment. 
And our foundry business announced that Panasonic joined the growing list of companies that will use our leading-edge 14-nanometer process technology.
While I'm pleased with the second quarter results and the strength in the enterprise and small medium businesses, we're watching for signs of sell-through in consumer PCs in the second half of this year. Additionally, we have important work to do in the months ahead. We are working towards qualification of our 7260, our Category 6 LTE product with carrier aggregation early this quarter. And later this quarter, we'll launch our next-generation Haswell-based Xeon E5 platform, code-named Grantley. We also expect the first 14-nanometer Broadwell Core M processor-based systems, including fanless 2-in-1s, will be on shelves for the holiday selling season, followed by broader OEM availability in the first half of 2015. And SoFIA, our integrated baseband and apps processor for smartphones and tablets, remains on track for Q4 of this year.
All of this work is critical to growing the business. Along with our earnings results, we announced a $20 billion increase to our buyback authorization and intend to pursue a sizable repurchase of stock over the second half of the year. Stacy will talk more specifically about our plans, but this change to our capital structure and allocation is a direct result of our ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder value and a thoughtful stewardship of our owners' capital. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",702

The second quarter came in above the expectations we provided in the April earnings call and consistent with the revised outlook we released on June 12. It was a good quarter, representing financial growth and solid momentum, as we enter the second half of the year. 
Focusing on our second quarter results. Revenue came in at $13.8 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Both the PC Client Group and the Data Center Group achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. PC Client Group revenue was up 6% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes grow 9% year-over-year and, inclusive of tablets, we saw almost 20% unit growth.
PC platform average selling prices declined 4% on a year-on-year basis. Our Data Center Group revenue grew 19% from a year ago, with platform volumes up 9% and platform average selling prices up 11% over the same period.
Looking beyond the PC and data center businesses, the Mobile and Communications Group is down 83% from a year ago. The underlying dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the investor meeting last November. We are ahead of our expectations in tablet volume, but the billing increase is being offset with an increase in contra revenue dollars. We are seeing a decline in our feature phone in 2G, 3G multi-comm business as the industry transitions to integrated LTE solutions.
The Internet of Things Group is up 24% year-on-year. We continue to see robust growth across segments with particular strength in the retail and manufacturing segments. Gross margin of 64.5% was up almost 5 points from the first quarter and 1.5 points above our original Q2 guidance. The 5-point increase relative to the first quarter is due to lower 14-nanometer startup costs, higher platform volumes and lower platform unit costs.
Spending came in at $4.9 billion, in line with our revised outlook provided on June 12.
Net income for the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up 40% from a year ago, and earnings per share was $0.55, up 41% from a year ago.
The business continued to generate significant cash, with over $5 billion of cash from operations in Q2. We purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased over $2 billion of stock.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17 billion, down approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $4 billion, and, inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is closer to $7.5 billion.
Our capital allocation philosophy is to first invest in our business then generate shareholder return through our dividend and bring to return cash to shareholders via stock repurchases. Our business generates healthy free cash flow through economic cycles. But as a result of this capital allocation philosophy, we have brought down our net cash balances plus longer-term investments from over $23 billion in 2010 to around $7.5 billion today. We plan to continue our journey of returning cash to our shareholders by adjusting our capital structure to further bring down our net cash balances.
The intention is to repurchase $4 billion of stock in the third quarter, with additional buybacks in Q4. This strategy enables the sufficient liquidity for our operations and provides strategic flexibility to invest in our business while continuing to return cash to our shareholders.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 4% from the second quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the third quarter that we have seen over the last several years. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the third quarter to be 66%. The 1.5 point increase from the second quarter is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs and higher platform volumes. This is partially offset by lower platform average selling prices.
Turning to full year 2014. We are planning for revenue growth relative to last year that is approximately 5%. We are forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range of 63%, up 2 points from the midpoint of the outlook provided on April 15. This increase is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs, higher platform volumes, partially offset by lower platform average selling prices.
As I reflect on the first half of 2014, I believe the strategies that we put in place for this year are playing out nicely to extend the reach of Intel technologies across the spectrum of the smallest embedded devices to the most powerful supercomputers. We have seen better-than-expected trends in the overall PC market, with strength in both nonconsumer and desktop segments. 
We're enabling innovative 2-in-1 devices and lower price points and we are growing our market segment share. We have brought new products into the data center, which drive a strong return on investment for our customers to upgrade their infrastructure, and we are benefiting from both our product lineup and the buildout of the cloud.
The Internet of Things business is growing fast, as we bring intelligence to more and more devices. And we are making investments in communications and tablets that benefit the breadth of our businesses and set us up for improving financial results going forward. 
As a result of these trends and our execution, our financial results are improving, we are generating free cash flow and we are returning more of that cash to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",935

So Brian, on the PC side, obviously good growth in Enterprise. An obvious question is, how long does that last? And then I think you had mentioned in your comments that the Consumer has not yet recovered. And the industry has tried lots of things: different form factors, price points, et cetera, but it has not seemed to revive the consumer. So what will it take to revive the consumer side because that will be an important factor for next year on the PC market?",100

So I'm going to try and answer your questions. The first one was good growth on the enterprise side, small, medium business, how long does it last. We think it's driven by multi factors. It's driven by the good form factors, the 400 -- or the 600 million systems 4 years or older, new price points and Windows XP end of life. So all of those things are coming together to drive this. You'll see them at least lasting through this year, we believe, and that's built into our forecast. So that's kind of as far as we're looking out today. The second part of your question was what does it take to reinvigorate the consumer? We've got a lot of things lined up for the second half of this year to work on that, everything from marketing to, really, we talked about in the call, the Core M Broadwells. Those are going to allow, really, a whole new class of system as we end -- as we go out to the holidays and into the next year, where there are 2-in-1 devices that they now become fanless, ultrathin, very portable, long battery life, strong core performance or core-like performance. We believe that will bring another class of system into the market as well, along with just an overall general refresh of many, many of the form factors. We think that all of those things will start to move it, but that is part of why we've put this caution on, we're still going to watch as the consumer trend goes through the second half of this year.",269

And as my follow-up, you have said previously that you plan to bring baseband production in-house, right, at TSMC today. But I think you have said in the past that you plan to bring it in-house sometime late next year or 2016. Is that still an important milestone? Are you on track to do that? And importantly, will it require any incremental CapEx or OpEx?",66

One of the real advantages of Intel is, it is an integrated device manufacturer in IDM and we believe that integration of the process technology and the design and our leadership in Moore's Law just give us a real advantage when you look at that whole ecosystem. So it's always critical for all of our products to move them inside as fast as we can. And yes, we're still targeting towards the end of '15 or beginning of '16 to move those products inside.",101

And if I look back historically a couple of years ago and I think 4 years ago, you had some gross margin headwinds in midyear when you ramped all of the fabs and the new process at once. And obviously, you don't seem to be seeing those headwinds in Q3. Is that -- am I thinking about that the right way? And is there still some costs of ramping 14-nanometer that's still ahead of us?",83
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2014",2014-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3277.0,658203.0,29288944.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,13,"Yes. So yes, you're thinking about that the right way. And I think if you do the algebra and you look at our actual gross margin in Q1 and Q2 and the projection for Q3, you're going to come up with a number in Q4 that comes down a few points from what we're forecasting for Q3. We haven't locked in on the forecast yet, but it's down a bit. And that is exactly the phenomenon, what you said. When we get to Q4, we're ramping multiple 14-nanometer factories simultaneously. We think we'll see a little bit of an increase in cost in Q4. And in addition, in the fourth quarter, because our 14-nanometer products, Broadwell, is a family of products, we'll still see some pre-PRQ quals that will cause reserves to go up a little bit in Q4 is our best prediction at this time.",146

And then separately, looking at the buyback, what's the timeframe of the $20 billion repurchase? And can you talk about what's kind of the optimal net cash level that you like to maintain on the balance sheet?",38
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2014",2014-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3277.0,658203.0,29288946.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,15,"Yes, great question. Let me answer the second one first because I'm not actually giving you a ton of clarity on the timeline to the $20 billion. But the -- if you think about this as a multiyear focus that we've had, I think you can see this playing out. And if you go back to 2010, as I said in my prepared remarks, and you look at net cash plus some of the other investments that the Treasury Group makes, yes, we had a net cash balance that was running in the mid- to high-20s back then. We brought it down to the sub-10 as of Q2. I think it's really a sign. And along the way, we stress-tested our business in terms of cash generation through things like the economic downturn and that's increased our confidence that we generate free cash flow even in kind of macroeconomic situations that are less favorable. So we're taking the next step there, bring cash balances down further. From my perspective as CFO, if we're targeting kind of the definition of cash I just gave, something around 0 net cash, it still gives us a positive gross cash balance. We have plenty of cash for strategic reasons and operational reasons. That feels like a pretty comfortable number. And then to do that, we'll do $4 billion of buyback in Q3 on top of the $2 billion that we executed to in Q2. We'll do another sizable buyback in Q4, TBD exactly the size of that, that will get us pretty close to that goal. And then you can do the math of cash generation next year and kind of figure out how, in your model, we'll go to the $20 billion. But I think we'll go through a chunk of it just over the next 6 months.",305

I know you gave us some color in your commentary, but I'm kind of curious to what extent -- was that a better mix of enterprise? Was it hyper scale mixing up even more than they did in the calendar first quarter? And to the extent, you said the Grantley doesn't come until this calendar quarter, I'm kind of curious as to how you see that ramp playing out and how accretive that might be to the Data Center business?",110
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2014",2014-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3277.0,658203.0,29288949.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,18,"Sure. I'll start and then Stacy can add in since you've got a mix of the product and then how the financials roll in to that as well. I think if you just take a look, what we said, if you look back at the remarks, we said almost all of the segments of the enterprise were up 15%. That was a mix of volume and ASPs across the board there. You are correct that Grantley doesn't go until this quarter. But we did continue to launch the E7 during this quarter and see that ramp, which definitely helps our ASP and overall product mix. Every one of these launches is a little bit different. They always have a mix of kind of what are our customers doing. If you just take a look at the data center volume in general, it tends to be a bit lumpy. There are big orders, as people fill out their data centers, whether it's in HPC order or a cloud order or an enterprise order, they tend to come in big pieces. And so, as we move into the Grantley launch, we'll have to see how the customers make -- place their orders and what the volume is. So we don't look at it as on a quarterly basis when we look at something like a Grantley launch, we really look at it over a longer period of time. Over a longer period of time, we think it's going to be a very powerful product. But exactly how that transition will occur, we don't try and look at it that closely on a quarterly basis.",272

And so, in terms of the Q2 ASP uplift, as Brian said, it's a combination of things. But one thing you need to keep in mind, we are shipping and selling Grantley today in the cloud and HPC customers and we saw the E7 moving into production. So you had a combination of things in the second quarter. And I think where Brian was taking us, we're really after that 19% growth rate in the second quarter, but we're not -- we're expecting a nice robust growth rate when we move in to the back half but not 19%. We think there was some specific purchasing going on with some of the large cloud providers that probably don't repeat exactly as we get into the back half.",137

And Stacy, going to the solving the algebraic equation for Q4 gross margin, it kind of implies gross margins could be down as much as 400 basis points sequentially, if I'm doing the math right. And that would be about 2x kind of the hit you saw as you were ramping the 22-nanometer node about a year ago. And I'm just kind of curious, is that because you're ramping more volume? And there's clearly been a lot of speculation about how 14 is going and how Broadwell is going in the popular press. So I'm wondering if you can comment whether or not the margin trends you're seeing in the calendar fourth quarter are kind of as expected, and generally just kind of characterize how that 14-nanometer Broadwell ramp is going from your perspective.",138

And I'll let Brian comment on the 14-nanometer, but I'll help you with the algebra. So first, I think we have to be careful not to get trapped in the rounding here because, if you're at 0.2 on gross margin, you get to a different answer for the Q4 number. I'd expect it to be down a bit, but there's nothing untoward there other than the fact that we're ramping multiple factories at once and that we'll still have some -- by the way, Broadwell is rolling out as a family of products, we'll have some preproduction builds that will cause reserves to go up. So I guess I'd be cautious about -- it'll be down some, but I wouldn't hit any alarm bells. There's nothing beyond that that's happening in the fourth quarter. In terms of 14-nanometer, I'll let Brian take that more from the operational standpoint.",149

We said we would, during this quarter, qualify, and we did qualify our 14-nanometer product and we actually are shipping product today to our customers and partners. We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners, and we're on schedule to have product on shelves in the holiday. We talked to you about this. We focused on Core M, which is the Broadwell part that we think really highlights the power of 14-nanometers and the Broadwell architecture. As I said, it will be the first class of PC -- core level PC products that are fanless. We talked to you about the Llama Mountain products, 7.2 millimeters thick, 24 ounces in weight, fanless. Those are going to be devices that we think will start to transform how people think about a 2-in-1 device in the PC versus the tablet. That's what we focus on. The rest of the products as we said, we'll launch and ramp as we go through 2015.",183

If I do the same on the revenues, it looks like kind of flattish revenues, which should be a little bit below seasonal. You guys have done a great job executing versus your plan in the last couple of quarters. You're leave in some room for conservatism in there? Or is that more of a function of kind of the XP end of life, which Brian referred to, sort of playing itself out?",99
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2014",2014-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3277.0,658203.0,29288956.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,25,"Sure. I wouldn't say conservatism. Just -- it's exactly what Brian said, which is we've seen some nice indications of strength in enterprise and mature, some -- and we can see those selling through. What we're seeing from our customers is more optimism on the back half than we've seen in the last couple of years for the Consumer segment, but we won't see the sell-through data on that for a while yet. And so, what we have in for Q3 is a roughly seasonal third quarter. And I think if you look at the last few years, you'd see a flattish Q4 as also being roughly seasonal. So I think nothing unusual there, and we're really watching carefully what happens in the Consumer segment. We've got some great devices coming to the market. And to add on Brian's answer earlier, one of the things that's really exciting is the price points that we're enabling with Bay Trail in terms of touch-enabled clamshells. We think that those will shift share and drive excitement in the market, but we just have to watch it.",183

So I'll give you some high-level numbers. I actually haven't looked at it this way in a while, Ross, so I'll put an asterisk by this data that could be off a little bit.

Well, LTE -- and this is pretty consistent with what we showed at the investor meeting, we're just moving into qualification of LTE, as Brian said in his remarks, it's a little bit later than we thought. So we kind of thought it was going to be the end of Q2, it's now going to be early part of Q3, and then we'll see a ramp that is offset, it's going to be more towards the end of this year, early next year. And in the meantime, the market is transitioning hard away from the 2G/3G platform to LTE. So that part of the curve is consistent with what we saw and you can see it in our overall revenue results in the second quarter for this segment.",129

Regarding sustainability, with Grantley kind of coming out this fall and then Microsoft planning to end-of-life Windows Server 2003 in July, can you comment on kind of the sustainability within that bucket within DCG? Are you getting more confident that we could see multiple quarters of recovery there, please?",67

I'll start, and Stacy can jump in. When you take a look at the data center in general, and this gets back to that comment we made earlier about just the lumpiness of each one of these segments. We said that we believe we can continue to grow the data center in the low-double-digits out into time, of which the Enterprise is a portion of that. As you said, this quarter was extremely strong in the Enterprise, and we don't necessarily -- there's a -- there was a lumpiness or kind of a pattern to the orders where customers came in and made some purchases. What we've built into that low-single -- or double-digits for the whole data center is an Enterprise that's in the mid-ish single digits growth over time. So that's more what we projected. We do believe Grantley will be a good product. The Enterprise, though, we think it's still going to grow in about that midrange.",161

And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about market share in Q2. If I look at PCG, volumes were up about 4% year-over-year. IDC just reported about a 2% decline in overall PC sales and you had some pretty optimistic commentary on volumes for Bay Trail on the desktop and the notebook side. So that growth relative to the market, that outsized growth, is that mostly market share gain or is this something else to do with maybe inventory build, et cetera?",86

One is, I think, it's pretty clear to us that we are gaining some share, and it's not just from the traditional competitors. I think we're seeing at these price points some shift back of tablet where we're shipping a really nice 2-in-1 type clamshell, touched-enabled clamshell, into these price points. So that's a piece of it. And then I think the other piece is if you're -- as you look at this in terms of year-on-year comparisons, if you recall last year, what we saw is the -- our customers were managing inventories very, very lean. I think they had very little confidence in a back half seasonal selling season. And so, part of it is just the year-on-year comparison. What they're doing now is putting in more of a normal build for a more seasonal back half. And last year, that was not the case. So it's a combination of those 2.",162

Presumably, you've got tablets ramping into Q3 and into the back half, but you're not calling out contra revenues as a margin driver for Q3. Is this a function of a tablet volume or is this a function of contra revenues rolling off? I think they were supposed to start to decline as we go through the year? Any color you could give us on that would be helpful.",81

We are on schedule for our 40 million. We did 10 million in Q2, so we did roughly 5 million in the first quarter, 10 million in the second quarter, so you can kind of break out how the rest of the 40 million come in Q3 and Q4 with, clearly, Q4 being probably the bigger of the 2 quarters remaining. We did say that we would continue to drive down our costs and, hence, the contra revenue. We're continuing to do that. Bay Trail adds to that capability. As we exit this year, we said that we're on schedule with SoFIA. SoFIA, i.e. the fully integrated part, really designed for this segment. That allows us to move into '15 with a much, much better cost structure and really drive down the contra revenue to near 0 on those products. So we are on schedule as far as we had stated through the year of what we're doing on our cost reductions and driving down the contra. I'll let Stacy comment on how contra is reported versus the margin.",209

So you're getting into a little bit of, I think, a math issue here, Stacy. Let me walk you through it. First, we saw, more or less, a full point of margin in Q2 associated with that ramp of tablets. If you think about the volume curve that Brian just laid out, let's just -- let's take a precise number of 40 million just to anchor. We did 15 million in the first half. That said, we did 10 million in Q2. That said, you have 25 million to do in Q3 and Q4. Let's say it's 12.5 million per quarter. It's not really that linear, but just take that for the sake of argument. The change isn't that great, so you're really into a kind of change in gross margin dollars, that doesn't add up to something that's significant, or else it would have been on that gross margin recon.",152

So you saw the big change into Q1 to Q2 where it was kind of a full point of gross margin impact. It was a little hidden -- but it's on the recon, but it's a little hidden in the fact that we were up 5 points quarter-on-quarter.",50

That's helpful. For my follow-up question, I wanted to dig in into mobile a little bit. I don't want to take away from the results of the rest of the business which, arguably, look quite strong. But at this point, until it picks up, there really isn't much of a mobile business to speak of anymore. I was wondering if you could give us more of a feeling for how mobile presence fits into the long-term goals. Is this -- are you in this for the, I guess, the profit pool that's available or is this a strategic imperative for the rest of your business just to succeed here? I guess what milestones should we be looking for? And how do you see the loss rate in this business trending, I guess, into the second half and into 2015 as, presumably, some of the new products on 4G hopefully start to ramp?",154

So I'll start this, and again Stacy can jump in kind of on the profit side. The answer to your question, Stacy, is a bit of yes to both. Clearly, we don't go into businesses to lose money and we believe that, over time, we could make this a profitable business. We have some ground to make up both in getting our LTE to Cat6 and our products being specifically designed for this segment. We said we moved some of the early products, Clover Trail and Bay Trail, that were really targeted towards clamshells and almost the netbook era down into the space to get there quickly. And as we turn into SoFIA next year, you'll see a family of products in SoFIA, including some from Rockchip. You'll see us really targeting this space and that's how we become profitable in this space. But aside from that, this is, we believe, a strategic area for us. We are seeing -- we've talked about all of our products have become more personal, more mobile, more connected. Then we're seeing modems work their way in to PCs, for example, especially 2-in-1 devices. It's going to probably start with Chromebooks. Chromebooks are best when they're connected. And so, the OE's connected requirements is going to drive modems into their [indiscernible] . But you can go from a PC down through tablets, phones, and into the Internet of Things, in the industrial space where you're looking at a pump that's out in the middle of the desert someplace or wherever. It's going to want a 2G or 3G connection probably to get the data back into the system. So we believe modems and connectivity in this space is critical to almost every segment of our business, but we also believe that we can be in this mobile space and make money. We just got to get our products there and get the right price structures.",322

Let me -- I'll specifically answer the second part of your question. Looking at it from the reciprocal, from the CFO seat, if we don't we don't have the ability to integrate any comps, I think 3, 4 years from now, we are locked out of large segments of the market, so it's a critical capability. That said, we're not just a big loss and our goal and our plans would suggest that we'll have a significant improvement in this segment next year. It won't be profitable, but we should be able to improve it nicely next year, and it's going to trend. That's what we're driving the business to.",112

I guess, I'd say from a market trend standpoint, we would expect that the same market trends that we've seen, which is relatively stronger, Enterprise relatively stronger, mature markets are kind of the more dominant factors in the quarter and then a consumer market that's maybe a bit more seasonal and continue to see some weakness in emerging markets.

And my follow-up is on the buyback and trying to figure out the pace of the $20 billion repurchase. Stacy, you shared with us that roughly $6 billion is in U.S. cash, which is about 1/3 of your total cash balance. If I did flow that through to cash flow, it would imply roughly $2 billion a quarter and U.S. cash flow before $1 billion in dividend and the CapEx commitments. So I'm just -- I'm struggling to see how you can fund this $20 billion buyback without going into a net debt position. Appreciate your perspective on that.",100

But the way I would look at it is we'll do $4 billion in Q3. That, as you mentioned, comes out of U.S. cash. As we get into the back half of the year, I expect that I'm generating cash and a reasonable amount of cash is available to me in the U.S. Just simple math, I -- net of any cash generation, I'll still have a couple billion dollars in the U.S. I'll generate some cash that gives me a reasonable amount of potential to do another leg of this buyback in Q4.

I'd tell you, we're 6 months? We targeted Broadwell M, the Core M because we really feel like it's a product that highlights the real power of 14-nanometer in Broadwell, right? It's the one that's going to really target the fanless, thin and light, the highly mobile systems, which is really going to differentiate, I think, in my mind, 14-nanometer from prior technologies. It will be that technology that brought the fanless PC to your laptop. Every one of these process node that we do takes -- if you take a look at this, you're going all the way out through the mobile products, the desktop products, the server products, the Atom products, it's always 1.5 years of product launch, to be honest with you, every one of these, by the time you get to the E7 version. I mean, look, we're still launching the Haswell server products this quarter. And that's a technology that's more than 2 years old. So I -- that part and the broader availability of more SKUs out into next year, 6 months, yes, it's not a year. And you'll see a series of products through next year. Right now, we are still -- it's always a shift between our customers and OEM partners' availability and readiness to do a new SKU and our readiness of the product. They'll move as we move through the year next year. I think what's key to me is that the process is healthy. We've got the product and a yield capability, right, with a -- to be able to launch, we have a set of criteria that we use on every technology. So to be shipping to customers, it's met that quality requirement, those yield requirements, and that's what we're shipping to customers today and you're going to have products on shelves.",313

Well, I would say that guidance is no longer valid based on what we saw in the first half. So on the PC market, when you -- if you go and look at some of the third parties out there, you got a range of estimates and actually they're fairly divergent at this point. But some of the ones I was looking at earlier today kind of show a PC TAM that's flat, maybe down a little bit once you adjust for things like Chromebooks and 2-in-1s and detachables. I don't think we'd be far off of that from the standpoint of our view of the TAM. And then we'll see, we believe, some unit growth based on the things we talked about earlier, more normal inventory levels and, more importantly, some share gain. And that will equate to some revenue growth for us. We haven't gotten more granular than that and probably we won't get more granular than that at this point.

We're still in discussions with several other potential partners, so I wouldn't necessarily agree that the window is closing even on 14-nanometers. We have already started carrying the learnings that we've had on 14-nanometers from all segments, both from our own efforts into the mobile space, our partnerships with our current foundry partners, the work we've done with third parties in design like Synopsys and Cadence. So we are carrying that off into the 10-nanometer space, and we already have people that are talking to us about 10-nanometer foundry. But I guess -- I wouldn't have said that the 14-nanometer window is closing. I mean, if you still take a look at the 14-nanometer technology relative to what anything else is available out there, we're still the only company on the planet who's shipping a FinFET transistor of any geometry. And we're clearly the only people out shipping 14-nanometer products. So I think our leadership is -- we got some window where people could still jump in and have a leadership product.",183

If you look at domestic cash, and this is not taking into account some of the longer-term investments, it's in the order of $6 billion out of the total. In terms of our priorities from the standpoint of tax reform, we actually like to see a more comprehensive tax reform for corporations that bring down our tax rate to make it more in line with what we see in other industrialized countries. That's a bigger issue for us. We're a big manufacturer, so the manufacturing credits become important. We think those help us create jobs here in the U.S. The cash piece, for us, is less important than it is for maybe others because, remember, we generate cash all over the world, but we also make investments all over the world. We have factories in Ireland, in Israel, in China, in the U.S. And so, we consume cash. So we don't end up with the same kind of trapped to cash problem that companies do that have minimal operations outside the U.S.",181

Our third quarter results were consistent with our expectations and included a number of important milestones. Revenue and earnings per share both set new records with strong performances from the PC and the Data Center Groups. The trends we observed in the PC market last quarter continued with stability in mature markets offset by ongoing declines in emerging markets. 
The PC Client Group launched Core M, a new family of products with full Core performance in both compute and graphics in a fanless design, enabling breakthrough designs and form factors. The first of these systems will be available by the end of this month. 
In the Data Center, we saw double-digit revenue growth across all 4 major market segments. Enterprise grew 11%. Networking grew 16%, and HPC and cloud service providers grew 22% and 34%, respectively. We also launched the new Xeon E5 processor, formally known as Grantley. This product family provides leadership features and performance for compute, storage and network workloads. Formally launched just 5 weeks ago, E5 is already 10% of our DP or 2-socket volume. 
In the Mobile Communications Group, losses declined sequentially, and that's a trend that we need to see continue. Tablet volume was nearly 15 million units, and we remain on track to our 40 million unit goal for 2014. Third parties estimate that we are now the second-largest tablet SoC vendor worldwide and the largest among merchant suppliers. In addition, Samsung chose our Cat6 LTE modem with carrier aggregation, known as the 7260, for its recently announced Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy Note 4. 
The strategic importance of these capabilities continues to grow. Our LTE technology, which we originally developed for phones, is becoming increasingly valuable in tablets and even PCs as wireless wide area network connectivity becomes increasingly common. We estimate, for example, that by 2018, the rate of baseband attached to tablets will roughly double and, in PCs, will rise to more than 15%.
Overall, we made some good progress during this quarter. Yet, we have important work left to do. Within our factory network, 14-nanometer yields improved meaningfully, but we're behind where we expected to be. These challenges highlight just how difficult it has become to ramp advanced process technology.
I'm most pleased that our strategy for growth is beginning to yield results across a remarkably wide range of product. We sold record volumes of PC, server, Internet of Things, phone and tablet products. The diversity and scale of our products uniquely position us across the breadth of devices that compute and connect. Importantly, our results demonstrate that we are building on our success in the PC and Data Center segments to successfully pursue adjacent opportunities. These businesses are the source of tremendous intellectual property, and that IP creates valuable and important synergies that position us to compete in an increasingly diverse computing market. Let me share a few examples.
At IDF, I showed the world's thinnest tablet, a Dell Venue with Intel RealSense technology. It has an industry-first 3D camera that enables features like after-the-fact focusing and a host of capabilities that have the potential to change how people engage with their photography. That technology was first developed for PCs and was adapted for tablets. In this case, we're in a position to differentiate in tablets precisely because we invested in next-generation technologies for PCs. 
Another example of IP synergy is the Atom microarchitecture. We first brought Atom to market as an extension of the PC product family. We've purposely evolved that IP to the point that it now spans from smartphones to tablets and mainstream PCs and from storage, networking and compute devices in the Data Center to the Internet of Things.
Lastly, I'm excited about the moves we're making to engage the ecosystem in new and potentially disruptive ways. We're establishing our position and capabilities in emerging sectors like wearables before they become mainstream. The Data Center team is customizing our Xeon products for specific customers and workloads. Custom SKUs now number roughly 35, and over the last year, volume from custom SKUs has grown at 3x the rate of our off-the-shelf product. 
There were also striking groundbreaking strategic agreement [ph]. Our recently announced collaborations with Rockchip and more recently Spreadtrum will provide new sources of innovation and a new set of partners that will work with us to scale Intel architecture. Our vision is that if it's smart and connected, it's best with Intel. The breadth of our results this quarter, our progress against our strategic goals and the changes we're making in our approach to end markets leave me convinced that our strategy is working. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.",781

The third quarter was the highest revenue in the company's history with overall results demonstrating solid financial growth as we approach the end of this year. 
Focusing on our third quarter results. Revenue came in at $14.6 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Both the PC Client Group and the Data Center Group achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. PC Client Group revenue was up 9% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group platform unit volumes grow 15% year-over-year, and inclusive of tablets, we saw almost 30% unit growth. Of note, our notebook platform units grew over 20% year-over-year as we are enabling innovative 2-in-1 devices and growing our market segment share with Bay Trail at lower price points. Our Data Center Group revenue grew 16% from a year ago with platform volumes up 6% and platform average selling prices up 9%. We are seeing robust growth rates across all the segments of our Data Center business.
Operating income for the third quarter was $4.5 billion, up $1 billion and 30% from a year ago. Operating income in the PC Client Group was $4.1 billion, and in the Data Center Group, operating income was $1.9 billion. The Mobile and Communications Group had $1 billion of loss, which is an $81 million improvement from the second quarter.
The company generated $3.3 billion of net income for the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago. And earnings per share was $0.66, up 14% from a year ago.
Our net inventory levels rose modestly quarter-over-quarter as we are efficiently managing capacity while ramping Broadwell on 14-nanometer. The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy with inventory levels appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycle.
Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin of 65% was up 0.5 points from the second quarter and down 1 point from our guidance. The increase from the second quarter was primarily due to lower platform unit costs on 22-nanometer and higher platform volume, mostly offset by higher production cost on 14-nanometer product.
Spending came in at $4.8 billion, $100 million dollars lower than our outlook. The overall decrease in spending was driven by efficiencies and onetime events like capital asset sales, partially offset by higher profit-dependent expenses.
The business continued to generate significant cash with over $5.7 billion of cash from operations in Q3. We purchased $2.4 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased over $4 billion of stock.  
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $16 billion, down approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $2 billion, and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, it is more than $6 billion. This is down by almost $2 billion from the second quarter.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.7 billion, up 1% from the third quarter. This forecast is in line with the historical average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the fourth quarter to be 64%. The 1-point decrease from the third quarter is driven by higher platform unit costs, higher factory startup costs, primarily offset by lower production cost on 14-nanometer. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing our strategy play out in our financial results. In the third quarter, we grew revenue 8% and grew operating profit 30% versus last year. We also shipped over 100 million units for the first time in our history across a widening range of devices. 
In the Client segment, we are seeing robust growth in the PC segment as a result of innovation and enabling lower price points. We've grown to be the largest merchant supplier of tablet silicon, and we are winning large designs with our LTE communications product. And our Internet of Things business is ramping Atom-based products and growing.
In the Data Center, we continue to innovate our products, bringing increased differentiation and value to our customer. And underlying all of this is our manufacturing leadership. We have led the world to 14-nanometer and plan to do the same with 10-nanometer process technology. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.",728

On the bigger-picture one, your units in the PC Client Group being up 15% year-over-year, can you talk a little bit about what you think is driving that in a PC market that I think most of the third-party data providers says is flat? And do you think that delta can actually stay that large for a bit longer?",73

I'll take -- I'll start it, and then I think Brian will fill in some of the color commentary about what we're seeing in the end markets. So yes, we've seen some of the third-party data. When you adjust for some of the other form factors like Core-based tablets and things, I'd say our view of the end market compared to, say, an IDC, isn't terribly different in terms of the growth rate. We would both say it's relatively flat year-on-year in the third quarter. In terms of our billing results, I think there's a couple of things driving that. First, we saw in Q2 that we gained a relatively significant amount of share once everybody had reported. If I had to branch predict, I'd say we probably continue to gain some share in Q3. As is per usual, we'll wait to see all the third-party results come in to know for sure. But our sense is that we gained some share in the third quarter, so that helps. And then we're also seeing our customers putting in place a normal supply line in anticipation of a consumer-led seasonal fourth quarter. And that's different than what we saw a year ago where people were managing inventory levels very low in anticipation of a very muted fourth quarter. So I think the combination of those 2 things has our billing results ahead of the IDC, but it feels like it's pretty appropriate based on where I sit.",250

Can you talk a little bit about how we should expect that contra revenue impact to trend over time? And I believe in the past, you said that you didn't think you'd get to profitability next year. But any sort of clues that you can provide on how we should expect either the revenue or the profitability to trend as we get into next year.",93

I'll start, and then Stacy can kind of jump in because how you look at kind of how we're adjusting the products and engineering is a little bit ahead of where you see the financials move. And so we'll give you kind of the 2 sides of that equation. So from a product standpoint, you saw throughout this year we did a very good job of -- as we figured out how to get into this market and work with our customers and partners, how to reduce the cost just on the general bomb [ph], picking the right P mix, the right board layouts, reducing our part counts, all of those kinds of just fundamental engineering efforts is what we focused on. As we got to the end of the year, then we brought out the Bay Trail cost-reduced part, which is really focused on -- the first part that was really focused on this segment of the market. We're starting to see systems come on to the shelves as we go through the holiday season with Bay Trail CR, and that part will start to have really a designed-in cost-reduced effort. We said that we'd have SoFIA, the 3G version, out at the end of this year. We're on schedule. We've got SoFIA in the labs running. It's going -- it's starting its validation effort. We said we'd have SoFIA LTE in the first half of next year. That's on schedule. And then we announced several partnerships, 2 main ones, Rockchip and then more recently Spreadtrum, which are focused around the SoFIA architecture, bringing parts for this mobile space, really designed by people who are in that ecosystem are very cost efficient and are connected into both the China market and the worldwide market. You'll see those parts come out as we go through next year. So when we look at the end of next year, we'll look at a model SoFIA has built to have no contra revenue. And so when you go through the next year, again, it will be somewhat mix dependent as parts shift the mix, and Stacy will talk to you a little bit about that. That's why it's a bit hard to predict exactly when. But you'll see us mix the Bay Trail Cost Reduced, Cherry Trail, and then a lot of SoFIA coming in, in both the tablets and phone space. And that really is what drives the contra kind of out of the system.",414

So Ross, let me just -- as Brian said, the way the contra accounting works is the contra dollars that we recognize are associated with the platforms as they actually ship. And so what you're seeing right now is the majority of our shipments are products that are carrying a fairly high contra dollar per unit. As we ramp the Bay Trail CR and then the SoFIA products, you'll start to see the contra dollars per unit come down. I'm not going to provide a specific forecast at this time for 2015. I'll stand behind the prior statements. We plan to make a substantial improvement in the profitability of the segment next year, but don't get too far out ahead of your skis. We're not at the point that we'll be profitable next year. It is still our goal, but it will take us a little time to get there.",151

You talked about the more normal kind of supply chain this year and helping Q2, Q3. You're actually not guiding to a down December, so it seems like you're staying at that elevated rate. I mean, just some thoughts on seasonality. You also have Broadwell who kind of launches in an atypical point of the year. Is there any sort of catch-up before you kind of ramp Broadwell into late first half next year?",81

And it's coming -- the majority of the Broadwell SKUs is coming kind of in the first half of the year, so it's just atypical timing. So just thinking about seasonality. And then I just wanted to kind of clarify your comment. You kind of said the supply chain was building ahead. It doesn't seem like it's pulling back particularly much in Q4. Just thoughts there.",91

Just to clarify on the supply chain and seasonality for Q4, I wouldn't term it as building ahead. What I'd say is a appropriate amount of inventory in anticipation of a seasonal Q4. And if you go back here to Q3 of 2013, if you recall, we were talking about unusually low inventory levels based on our customers -- I think I used the word muted -- having muted expectations about the fourth quarter. Today, I'd say they have kind of normal expectations about the third quarter. And our guidance for Q4 would be consistent with that. We're guiding 1% up if you take the midpoint of our guidance. That's kind of the seasonality we've seen over the last several years, so it's pretty much in line with normal seasonality. In terms of Broadwell and the impact on 2015 seasonality, I'm not providing a forecast yet for 2015. We'll talk more about 2015 when we get to the Investor Meeting, which is just a few weeks away.",169

Just to follow up on the gross margin, given your full year guidance, you were looking at a step-down December. Now it looks like the gross margin sustains quite nicely. Just what changed in that outlook? And do any of those factors carry into the first half next year?",50
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2014",2014-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3011.0,703946.0,31080529.0,Answer,Stacy Smith,,Executives,18,"Yes. So the -- as you rightly pointed out, the gross margin forecast for the year is pretty much on -- we were a little light in Q3. We look a little better in Q4 based on the algebra that I gave you on the last call. In essence, we're seeing more of the 14-nanometer costs coming through in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, and that's why you see that shift between quarters and the year staying on track. And again, I'll sound a little bit like a broken record. In terms of 2015, we're only a few weeks away from the Investor Meeting, and that's a great forum for us to talk about longer-term trends. So we're going to hold off on the 2015 questions until we get to the November Investor Meeting.",136

I think what we said was we believe we can grow this business around 15% year-over-year. And you kind of framed it correctly that we do -- especially in the cloud space, it tends to be lumpy. If you take a look on what we're projecting for the fourth quarter, we're projecting right in line for that 15% for the year. And it's got the normal mix of what we see across the enterprise and the cloud and the HPC and other data centers. So we're not -- we're expecting Q4 to kind of just progress from Q3, and then we're not changing our forward-looking what we believe we can grow this business at.",118

And then I guess part of the reason for the lower gross margin profile in the fourth quarter is the ramp of 14-nanometer across multiple fabs. I think you said on the last call, take a couple of quarters to ramp up to full manufacturing capability after which time you would see ramp cost starting to come down. Is that how you still see it?",66

But it takes a period of time for it to come down. That's the normal trend. We're certainly seeing those elevated costs in Q3. You can see it in the gross margin recon. You'll still see high sell-through costs as those products are selling through in the fourth quarter. In 2015, I'll get a lot more specific on some of the unit cost trends next month at the Investor Meeting.",92

We saw really good demand in the third quarter from consumers driven by the new products that you and Microsoft combined to introduce. They were great new products, and the consumer uptake of them was very good. Do you think that impacts the fourth quarter versus third quarter buying at all? And then I'll kind of make my follow-up as part of this question. Do you see the iPhone 6 cannibalizing any kind of the notebook demand just given the price points are the same? Obviously, the functionality isn't the same. But given that most of the top 10 selling notebooks are right around that same price point as the notebooks, do you think there's any cannibalism going on there as you get to the fourth quarter? Is that part of the guidance?",145

I'd say in general, again, we're predicting -- or we're forecasting a fourth quarter that's seasonal. So what we saw in the third quarter plus, as you said, about 1% growth as we go into the second quarter -- or the fourth quarter, which is pretty typical if you go back over the last 3 years of what we see Q3 to Q4. So we're seeing that same trend in consumer kind of being flat to a normal year's performance hold through the fourth quarter. Your question about iPhone 6. No, we don't really see -- but typically, we see a separation in that space between consumers going out and buying phones versus PCs. And as you say, there's a big difference in the functionality and usage models between those 2. And I think people, when they want the usage model and the functionality of the PC, they look at that cost. And as you said, it's very similar cost. And then look, I think I wouldn't say this is a really good value for the functionality I'm giving it. And so we typically haven't seen a cross between those 2 from a demand standpoint.",211

I don't think we saw extraordinary consumer demand in the third quarter. If you go back to the strength of end markets, I think we're pretty aligned with the third parties. It was pretty flat. From an end market standpoint, it was pretty flat. We didn't see anything unusual there. What we saw was some share gain, which caused us to have a nice bump in billings. And we saw kind of a normal amount of inventory being put in the system relative to last year at the same time where people were managing inventory levels low. So I'd term it more stable PC markets and people betting on a normal consumer fourth quarter.",127

Stacy, when you look at the revenue in the PC Client Group, I think year-to-date, you're up about $1.1 billion. And yet, operating profits are up, I think, by about twice that. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you're doing in OpEx on that business around profitability. And I guess how much more do you have left to drive profitability in the Core PC Client Group?",77

And again, I'll probably hold off on the discussion about '15 until we get to the Investor Meeting. But I think what you what you see going on this year is probably 3 things that are all contributing to the operating profit. First, they've got a great product portfolio. And so when you look at where we're seeing growth, we're seeing nice growth in kind of the Core i5, i7 segments of the market. And then we've brought in some really good technology that's got a good cost structure at the low end of the market that gives them a nice cost structure and allows them to go after unit growth. So I think this really all starts with the product portfolio. Adding to that, I think we have a couple of tailwinds on gross margin in 2014. Our 22-nanometer processors are just spectacular. And we're at the low end of the cycle in terms of how much startup costs flows through, and the PC Client Group picks up the majority of those. And I also think the leadership of that team has done a nice job of prioritizing investments. We've been making investments into new areas where Brian and I thought it was pretty important, and so they've had a bit of a constrained budget. And I think they've done a nice job of bringing out technology that really helps their business while prioritizing within a pretty constrained budget. So I'd say that's what happened in '14. The '15 discussion will be part of the Investor Meeting next month.",271

And this is my follow-up for Brian. Brian, you guys have been talking about a stabilizing PC market for the last couple of quarters. But over the last couple quarters, you've been leaning a little more heavily on developed versus developing and corporate versus consumer. When you look at kind of the Q3 results and especially on the ASP line and your guidance for Q4, is this just seasonal consumer strength? Or do you actually think that both in the developed and developing market, you can now start talking about turning a corner relative to tablet cannibalization and perhaps PC stabilization in emerging market consumer?",109

And so we're not saying that there is a -- in fact, we said that the consumer, we believe, is flat. There's seasonal growth as they move into the fourth quarter. Now we're still seeing that mature versus emerging market trends that we talked about in the previous quarters where the mature markets are a bit stronger, the U.S. especially, Western Europe, though, as well. And the emerging markets -- China, Latin America and some of the others -- are still soft. And so those trends are continuing. And when you look at the consumer as we go into the fourth quarter, we've forecasted a seasonal growth for the consumer side.",130

But I think, coming back to the prior question Brian answered, we've had sustained share gains, I think, over a period of time. So it's probably a slightly larger number and then kind of the normal amount of inventory we've put in the system. You can do that math with the third element being the Core-based tablets. We're saying it's going to be relatively smaller.",89

That's an adjustment you always have to make. I'd also say there's a piece -- we tend to have a difference with the third parties on an ongoing basis. And I think it comes down to the breadth of tracking in the white box [indiscernible] deep in the emerging markets, the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities. Very hard to get your arms around that holistically. And so we tend to see over long periods of time we'll have a slightly higher billing number, then they show it as a market number. And best we can tell, it's just hard to get your arms around the diversity of the market when you get into the white box channel in emerging markets. So that's always going to be a difference between us.",139

So I understand you were saying for your own business, you think consumer is kind of seasonal and I guess flattish for the year in Q4. But obviously, you must -- you and I guess your channel partners must be expecting a much bigger ramp of consumer in Q4 given how much inventory you must have built in the channel in Q3. So I guess how do you get comfort that, that consumer sell-through is going to be there in Q4? And what's going to be the consequence if that consumer sell-through is not there? Is the corporate uptake still there? Is that going to be enough to offset? Or like how do we, I guess, judge the potential scenarios around consumer demand in Q4 and the sensitivity of your guidance around that?",150

Let me take a shot here though. I'd say first the inventory -- this is Stacy, by the way, and Brian will jump in. But I think the inventory levels, what we see is when you look at it in terms of weeks of inventory, it's at appropriate levels of inventory. It's kind of right in the range of what we'd expect. So the -- you termed it as excessive inventory. I think we're not seeing that. As always, if demand doesn't materialize, then customers adjust their buying patterns and bring inventory levels down. But what we see is kind of normal levels of inventory in anticipation of a seasonal Q4. That's what our customers think will happen, and that's, I think, what we think will happen in terms of our seasonal results. You also had a question on consumer versus enterprise and the strength of enterprise. I'll let Brian talk about those market trends.",164

First, I'd just like to go back to the inventory comments as well. We do what I believe is a really good job of watching our whole supply chain from below us, looking at things like the motherboard ordering pattern, the OEMs in Asia and what's happening there to the pulls from our inventory hubs. A lot of our -- more than half of our product ships out of the hubs now, and we actually control the inventory on it. So the OEM pulls it at the last moment of use. So we see the actual usage rates there to what's flying off the shelves at the point of sale. So we're watching all of those. And I think we demonstrated in the past, back in a variety of market moves, that we will react very quickly. So as Stacy said, I -- that the current inventory is very typical for this 1% seasonal growth that we're forecasting for the fourth quarter, and I'm comfortable. And I'm also even more comfortable that we'll be watching it. And if something did happen, we could adjust in either direction. The comment about consumer versus enterprise, as we said, we forecasted a standard seasonal consumer. So we're expecting not a great holiday season, not a bad holiday season, a standard holiday season for the consumer in the PC segment. We continue to see enterprise strength. It's shifting. It was strong in desktops earlier in the year. It's kind of moved to notebooks as we move to the second half of the year. Some of the markets have shifted a little bit. But overall, the enterprise -- all the way from large enterprise to small, medium businesses stayed fairly [ph] strong through this year. Still seeing a mature market versus emerging market trend, mature being stronger than the emerging. But those trends have stayed, and we just forecasted a seasonal consumer. So I'm pretty comfortable with where we're at, and I think we've got the right tools in place to watch this.",339

For my follow-up, let me ask the question a different way then.

That's helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up question, curious if you can comment on operating leverage. If we go back to your initial guidance for the year at flat revenues and now up around 6% at the midpoint of your guide, during that same time, you've grown your OpEx by 5%. And in your prepared remarks, you talked about IP synergy. Curious how we should think about operating leverage going forward.",75

And we will absolutely go into this more in November, but we are still committed -- Brian and I are still committed to bringing our spending as a percent of revenue down. We will be down a little bit this year just by dint of the increase in revenue. On the flip side, this is very much a transitional time for us, and we have been making some incremental investments over the course of the last year in areas where we felt like we needed to and where we would generate a long-term return. So we're glad we're able to bring it down a little bit. Particularly the back half of 2014 is better than the first half. We'll continue to bring it down, but we knew we were doing it during a time where we're making some elevated investments that we felt we needed to make.",157

Let me try and answer your question. There's, I believe, 2 questions kind of built in there. The first was around where are we with certifications on our LTE, where are we relative to our LTE  road map. What I would tell you is our 7260, as you heard, has had several design wins. We've been able to publicly say 2 of them with Samsung. There are others in the works that we're working on right now. Carrier -- and as far as certifications with the carriers, we've begun certifications across the world, and you will see the systems in almost every geography as they come out. We've been shipping with a variety of products throughout this year in a variety of the other markets, especially in Asia. So we feel fairly strong. We also still see us as only -- there are only 2 people out shipping Cat6 LTE modems right now, and we're 1 of those 2. So we feel good about our road map. We have a road map moving forward going beyond Cat6 that we feel is highly competitive and keeps us at or near the leading edge. So from a modem standpoint, we feel very strong right now. You asked, is there other things that we can do to reduce our MCG spending? I think there is. If you take a look at what we're driving on our phone strategy, we're really driving a strategy that rather than go and push on our own into the phone space, we're really going with strong partners that are in that space already and have the linkages and the customer relationships. And really, that Spreadtrum is the most, I'd say, perfect example of that where they're strong in China, they're strong in other parts of the world. They're a great supplier to several of the OEMs. And us bringing our SoFIA platform -- base IA along with our modem technology, and then over time, will likely come into our silicon as well. That gives us and them a competitive advantage and a cost advantage, we believe, and a way to get into those markets in a very cost-effective, efficient way.",363

I think that Brian talking about the first step is great product. Second step is getting the right investment level. And I think one of the things you're seeing from him and the company is a lot of innovation in terms of how we go to market. There's a third piece here, too, which is I think increasingly, we're going to see that the IP that we're creating for the Mobile Group is useful, and in fact, becomes a competitive advantage across the breadth of our product line. And Brian talked in his prepared remarks, if, as we think happens over time, more of the computers of the world -- the notebook computers of the world are connecting via Wireless LAN, and we're one of the only companies that has that IP. There's a lot of company synergy associated with us investing and leading in that technology.",154

You're going to need those modems in IoT. We said that roughly 15% of the PCs in a couple years will need them. And then there's that synergy of we're going to try [ph] and even down in this space, bring some of that innovation in IP like the RealSense cameras and all, all the way through the mobile space as well, which will help us differentiate our products and working with our partners allow them to differentiate as well.",87

That would mean that you need to ship actually, I believe if I've added up right, about 10 million next quarter. Does that mean that the subsidies have peaked in the third quarter? Or do you think you're going to exceed your tablet shipment goal by an equal amount?",81
21127.0,"Intel Corporation, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2014",2014-10-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,Intel Corporation,3011.0,703946.0,31080569.0,Answer,Brian Krzanich,,Executives,58,"So let me answer the question on volume, and I'll let Stacy talk about the subsidies. Your numbers are very close. You're right, we hit about 15 million. We think that 10 million to 12 million for Q4. We're not going to necessarily try and blow the number out, but we're also not going to miss it by 1 million or 2 million. So my guess is somewhere between 40 million and 45 million is where we'll end up. Exactly where that is, we'll make sure we're pass the 40 million but not -- there's no need to go well above that. As we said, that puts us as the largest merchant supplier to the tablet business. And where really, I'm trying to move that space now is both our cost reduction but also differentiating with products like the Dell Venue, which we believe is the thinnest and has a lot of innovation with the first of the RealSense. A lot of other products with our other OEM partners like Lenovo are moving forward. I'll let talk Stacy about what that means for our subsidies or our contra.",188

So the contra answer is a little bit complex, Doug, because keep in mind, it has to do with the volume and the mix of what we're shipping for the earlier answer to the question about the different platforms come with different subsidy dollars per unit. I'd expect net of all of that, we're going to see revenue results in the segment that aren't terribly dissimilar from what we saw in Q3. And then we'll start to see reductions as we move into next year.",86

If I could, for my follow-up, just one on some startup-up accounting. Clearly, it did impact gross margin this quarter and your guidance. Is there any color that you can offer us on sort of what you're outlook is in the way in which you think you're going to ramp 10-nanometer? It appears as though the 14-nanometer, the magnitude of ramp with the Broadwell platform is a little less than you might have expected as we entered the year. Is that something that you think might repeat on future nodes?",92

This is Stacy ""Broken Record"" Smith. I'll talk more about gross margin trends for '15 next month when we get to the Investor Meeting. But you are seeing -- in the fourth quarter, you're seeing the front edge of the startup costs associated with 10-nanometer. And that's kind of right in line with the historical timing of what you'd expect. We'll go through more next month where we talk about kind of how that might look over the next couple of years. But we're seeing at least the front edge at the timing that you'd expect, and it's about 1 point of gross margin next quarter.",109

When you look at the units that you have shipped so far this year and as you look into what you're expecting to ship next year, to what extent are the tablets that you're shipping into, are they Android versus Windows tablets? And has that played out differently than you expected that mix as Microsoft seems to have cut the price of the bundle of Windows and Office?",78

Our mix represents pretty much what you see in the marketplace or if you walk into any store. So there hasn't been really any shift as we move through.",49

And then the second question, if I may. There's a view out there that the PC growth that you've been seeing has been driven by mostly a Windows XP upgrade cycle. Could you update us on your thoughts on that topic? Do you feel better about the idea that it's not just Windows XP but rather innovation driving the demand?",62

I mean, there's no data that's going to prove the point one way or the other. But based on what we see in our surveys, there's a variety of things that are causing people to go and upgrade their PC. Certainly, the Windows refresh is one of them, but it's also form factors, it's the age of the PCs and the price points. I think all of that is playing in. And I think when we look across the breadth of our SKUs and knowing which of those are going into large enterprise, small and medium consumer, we get a sense of we're seeing growth that's more broadly than just something where people are upgrading Windows. I'd say to the second part of your question in terms of where are we, we, I'd say in the back half of the year, believe that the impact that we were seeing with XP is probably less than it was in the front half of the year. But there's likely a pretty long tail that has some positive impact on the market for a while to come when you just look at the age of the installed base and how many of those are now in supported operating systems.",210
