168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3973.0,286478.0,14083555.0,Presenter Speech,Rory Read,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth. Q1 was a solid quarter for AMD. We made good progress improving our execution, becoming more consistent and building trust with our customers and partners. We have taken steps to position the company to seize the opportunities in front of us, both in the high-growth markets and in the product categories, where our innovative technology provides us with leadership opportunities.
Our improved execution resulted in better-than-expected revenue of $1.59 billion for the seasonally down first quarter, a 6% sequential decrease and a 2% decrease year-over-year. First quarter non-GAAP income was $92 million. This is a 64% improvement from the year-ago period, which was driven by gross margin improvements resulting from a richer product mix and operational efficiencies.
A steady supply of 32-nanometer products allowed us to meet our customer commitment in the quarter. Consistent execution that builds trust with our customers remains the fundamental part of our near-term growth strategy. We are also pleased with our 28-nanometer graphics product ramp. We met our new product introduction commitments in the quarter and we are now the only company offering a top-to-bottom family of 28-nanometer discrete desktop GPU offerings. Customer demand for these industry-leading graphic products is strong.
Adoption of our APUs continues to accelerate. APUs account for nearly 100% of our mobile unit shipments in the quarter, helping drive an approximate 30% increase in mobile processor unit shipments and significant mobile revenue growth from a year ago.
We saw a strong success in the critical 400 to 700 mainstream retail notebook price band, which accounts for nearly 50% of all notebooks sold in retail in 2011. For example, the best-selling premium notebook SKU of the first quarter at Best Buy was in fact powered by our AMD AA APU.
Our next-generation Trinity APU for mainstream notebook extends our leadership opportunity in this large and growing price band. Trinity improves on virtually every aspect of our current A-Series APUs while doubling the performance per watt. By integrating a discrete level GPU into the die, Trinity enables outstanding video and gaming experiences with superior battery life. Trinity is a great value, excelling at running the types of software increasingly used by our consumers buying these mainstream notebooks. We are successfully ramping production of Trinity APUs as customers prepared to launch a record number of AMD notebook designs beginning this quarter. 
Our momentum with Brazos continued in the quarter as well, helping drive a double-digit percentage increase in emerging market revenue from the period one year ago. Brazos delivers an unmatched value proposition and experience for consumers in these emerging markets.
The introduction of Brazos 2.0 this quarter builds on the momentum. Thanks to many new features and improved performance and extended battery life, we have made it easy for customers to take advantage of these advancements by simplifying platform transitions and reducing their time to market. Trinity and Brazos 2.0 systems will be available globally this quarter and we expect broad availability for the key back-to-school period.
Our Server business continues to make steady progress. We achieved our third consecutive quarter of server processor unit shipment growth, driven by increased adoption of our Bulldozer-based offerings. For the first time, Bulldozer processors accounted for more than 50% of server revenue and unit shipments in the quarter. We are strengthening our server customer relationships, refining our capabilities and methodically laying the foundation required to build long-term growth and leadership. We are fully committed to build this business step-by-step over the long term. 
We accelerated our disruptive server strategy in the quarter with the acquisition of SeaMicro. This acquisition positioned AMD to take the leadership position in the fast-growing cloud data center market and sets the stage for AMD to provide unmatched low-power, high-bandwidth server solution that expands our market opportunity. This is an exciting area of the business that I look forward to discussing more in future calls.
In Graphics, solid demand for our next-generation AMD Radeon 7000 graphic cards, particularly in the channel, grew sequential GPU revenue increases. We are focused on growing the profitability of our Graphics business by attacking and winning more channel business. We will introduce our first 28-nanometer notebook discrete graphics chips this quarter. And we expect to quickly transition the majority of our product mix to these industry-leading products.
So in summary, we're excited about the opportunities in front of us. And we know we have the right ingredients to win and grow. First, we're refreshing our entire portfolio of APO offerings, strengthening our growth opportunity in high-volume segments and fast-growing markets. Next, we have amended our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to create a win-win business arrangement. We are also seeing continuous improvement in 32-nanometer yields, helping ensure we have the right products to meet customer demands. And then, step-by-step, we're becoming a more consistent execution engine. We're building more trust with our customers and partners and having a greater opportunity to win more of their business.
We're seeing results with our efforts. For example, with the strong adoption of our Trinity APU for ultrathin notebooks. Customers are excited that Trinity fits into virtually any ultrathin design, providing unmatched visual experience, superior battery life at a very attractive mainstream price point. Trinity-based ultrathins provide superior performance and value for all customers, not just a small portion of the market buying expensive, premium notebooks.
We have a number of high-volume, ultrathin design wins across our customer base, setting the stage for continued growth as mainstream notebooks continue their transition to these thinner and lighter designs that will dominate the market in the years to come.
With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas, who will cover our financials for the first quarter.",946
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3973.0,286478.0,14083556.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Seifert,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. Revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $1.59 billion, down 6% sequentially driven by the seasonal decline in the Computing Solutions segment. The Graphics segment revenue was sequentially flat in a typically down quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 46%, flat sequentially and a point higher than expected. The delta to guidance is a result of higher-than-anticipated demand for certain 32-nanometer line of products, particularly in emerging markets.
Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was calculated net of the $703 million one-time charge related to the 28-nanometer product, limited wafer of exclusivity from GLOBALFOUNDRIES, associated with the 2012 amendment to the Wafer Supply Agreement. Operating expenses were $598 million, which includes $6 million in one-time expenses related to the SeaMicro acquisition. R&D was $368 million, 23% of net revenue, and SG&A was $230 million, 15% of net revenue.
Non-GAAP net income was $92 million and non-GAAP operating income was $138 million. Interest expense was $43 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. Tax provision was a net credit of $32 million in the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior quarter. The difference is primarily a one-time tax benefit of $36 million related to the SeaMicro acquisition, which closed at the end of the quarter. Net of this one-time tax benefit, 2012 tax guidance is approximately $12 million.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.12, calculated using 748 million fully diluted shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $250 million, down $45 million from the prior quarter due to lower non-GAAP operating income resulting from lower revenue in the quarter. 
Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 8% sequentially, driven by seasonally lower sales in the client business. Client product revenue declined sequentially due to lower units and ASP, primarily driven by lower 45-nanometer desktop processor unit shipments. 
APUs continue to increase as a percentage of our client products and Llano, our first-generation 32-nanometer APU, power top-selling notebook SKUs in North America, priced about $400. Our server processor revenue declined from the prior quarter, mainly due to ASP decline. And unit shipments increased with continued adoption of Bulldozer-based offering.
Chipset revenue declined in the quarter due to seasonally lower unit shipments. Computing Solutions' operating income was $124 million, down $41 million sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue. Graphics segment revenue was $382 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. GPU revenue was up in a seasonally down quarter due to improved desktop GPU ASPs in the channel, offset by seasonally lower game console royalty revenue. Graphics segment operating income was $34 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher gross margin.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Our performance was strong as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term securities, ended the quarter at $1.71 billion. Cash declined by $201 million compared to the end of the previous quarter, which was primarily the result of cash payments of $281 million related to the SeaMicro acquisition and $150 million related to the 2012 amendments to the Wafer Supply Agreement.
Despite strategic cash outlays in the quarter, we maintained positive free cash flow of $67 million. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $962 million, up $43 million compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 due to the timing of sales. Inventory was $585 million, exiting the quarter, up $109 million from the prior quarter, primarily in preparation for new product launches. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $2.02 billion.
Now turning to the outlook. AMD expects revenue to increase 3% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million in the second quarter as we continue to fine-tune our operational efficiencies, executing to all financial targets. We are pleased we delivered solid results in the quarter with a richer product mix. We expect to build on this financial and operational momentum moving forward and look forward to the upcoming launches of Trinity and Brazos 2.0 later this quarter.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.",673

My first question is on 28-nanometer. Some of the industry participants have talked about capacity issues in 28-nanometer. My question is, are you seeing any impact to your Graphics business from this? And what are you seeing go ahead in 28-nanometer?",45

As you may know, we're the first company that has launched our entire desktop discrete graphics product set on 28-nanometer. And I can tell you that within the first quarter, we were able to deliver on all of our customer commitments in that Graphics segment. What we're doing is we're monitoring this closely. We believe that a focus on execution consistently, day in and day out, will yield better returns and better execution. We think that, from our perspective, that we have the execution in place, the relationships with our key foundry partners to deliver on our 28-nanometer product ramp. Of course, we're going to monitor it. We're going to track it week in and week out to make sure. And we do hear some of the information in the quarter. We believe that we can deliver our base plan and our commitments to the customers. Right now, we're looking to the ability to reach upside. That's what's probably holding us back on the 28-nanometer going forward. But again, we're focused on going after that and we have the execution and plans in place, Sanjay.",198

As you heard from Rory, we met all of our customer commitments in the first quarter. When demand is strong and your product is good, this opens up opportunity for upside. And that is an area where we would like to see more velocity, to be very honest, and that's why we have to monitor the situation very carefully. We meet commitments, we are limited on upside, and that is not a good situation when your product is good and demand is strong.",91

So given that 50% of server revenue came from newly -- recently launched Bulldozer chips, how is it that server ASPs are down? And now that these products are just before the launch of Ivy Bridge products, what trends can we expect on ASPs on your PC client business and as well as on server?",63
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3973.0,286478.0,14083563.0,Answer,Rory Read,,Executives,10,"Yes, from a standpoint of server, again, as we mentioned in the earlier remarks, server has shown 3 consecutive quarters of solid, improving momentum and execution. Now we believe with Bulldozer now reaching over 50% of the revenue and unit shipments, we're positioned to continue to build on that execution and momentum. It is about building a business over a long term. And we believe that step-by-step, we can create that business momentum and continue to build on that server. In terms of the ASP, we see some impact in terms of the mix and certain deals that were there. But we continue to believe that we'll build on that mix and continue to move forward from there. Also, you may reflect on that with the acquisition of SeaMicro, it uniquely positions us to continue to participate and build on the server momentum in the fast-growing mega data center segment around dense computing. And we're very excited to bring on this solution into our portfolio of products. From a client perspective, our ASP models in terms of matching our customer demand are consistent. We like to build on that moving each quarter out. And from the perspective our partners and customers are very excited about the APU solutions, whether it was Brazos and Llano. And now with the launch of Trinity and then Brazos 2.0, with an unprecedented number of design wins, I think we're uniquely positioned to continue to build on that and move further up the price band stock with our APU offerings with the new Trinity offering. Which again, based on what we're seeing, is better at basically every key dimension and 2x the performance per watt.",280

Obviously, Trinity seems to be ramping well. But my perception here is that with Intel having done a lot of the heavy lifting in ultrabooks, some of them may be hesitant to use somebody else on the ultrathin form factor. Is that a concern at all? Or are there other ways that you are going about, making sure that you get a fair share of that market as it ramps to the second half?",93
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2012",2012-04-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3973.0,286478.0,14083566.0,Answer,Rory Read,,Executives,13,"Sure, Uche. Well, it's very nice to speak to you and I'm glad you were able to get back on. Around ultrathin, with the new Trinity launch and the record number of design wins we've been able to capture, I think this is an exciting time for AMD. With the introduction of Trinity and our ability to reach just about any thickness in ultrathin design that our customers have designed, I think, again, we're positioned very well to take advantage of this continued movement to thin and light. Trinity has outstanding battery life. It has the ability for us to introduce it into this very thin, ultrathin form factor. And what's powerful about this, Uche, and how you need to think about it, ultrathins are not just for the few in the premium high-priced segment. We need to look at the ability to bring ultrathins and high mobility to all customers, to bring it into mainstream. What's exciting about the design wins that we're seeing and the continued momentum around ultrathins, around AMD, is around our ability to reach mainstream price points to open this up to everyone. And that's an opportunity where I think we can play off some of this initial energy and buzz that's all kind of crowded at this very high price band. But with a set of AMD offerings with our key partners, I think they're very interested in entering into this mainstream segment. And I think it uniquely positions us in the second half to participate in a very powerful way as we move forward. I like how we're set up in this segment. That's where the volume is. That's where the business is. And that's where our designs are being won. And that's what we believe will be some high-runner, high-volume part wins and we're excited about it.",305

Thomas, first of all, real quick, how should we think about Q2 gross margins given the non-GAAP 46% you achieved in Q1, above what we were all expecting. What does that mean for Q2? And with all these new products you're ramping, will that be -- should we expect that -- the trajectory to start to move higher from here? And related to that also, I know you've made some positive comments about your traction in servers. Can you just update us where the market share situation is in servers being focused, because obviously that has implications for gross margins.",103

Let me start with the gross margin question first. So without any doubt, we have made good progress on the yield side on 32-nanometer. We entered the quarter with a lot of momentum and we saw some benefits in terms of product mix earlier than we expected. We expected some of those benefits in the second quarter and that's allowed us to come, gross-margin wise in the first quarter, a little bit higher than expected. So moving into the second quarter, what are the headwinds and the tailwinds? We expect to continue to build on our yield improvement on 32-nanometer, we expect to build on the momentum we see on the product mix side. And we will see some headwinds from quite a significant number of 28-nanometer products that are going to start to ramp in the second quarter. So if you put all the gives and the takes together, we will see the benefit continue that we see in the first quarter, and we expect gross margin to be slightly up -- flat to slightly up in the second quarter.",182

I mean, from the progress you've seen so far, you gained share in servers the last quarter. The reviews were great on your new Interlagos, it's very encouraging. But has that issue on the market share continued, and if you have any sense as to where you think we will be able to see in 2012 in terms of market share?",68

Server is obviously a key business for us, a business that we want to consistently build over the long term. We're in this space for the long haul. We're going to build this business over a quarter-by-quarter execution focus. We're working to build out our capabilities and our go to market, our support from the ecosystem and the technology that we can bring to market. I think we've made some good initial progress here in terms of momentum that we're creating in server but this is a step-by-step and long-term set of initiatives. We have plenty of work to continue to do around execution, and around server, and we're going to be intensely focused on that. The key to winning in server is to create the solution that allows the customer to get a better experience in terms of price performance, performance per watt, floorspace usage, and we really play very well in terms of virtualization, and I think this positions us well going forward. So again, I think good initial progress, Uche. I think we'll continue to build on that. We clearly want to keep that momentum going and adding server share quarter in and quarter out. But this is a long-term strategy, one that we're in it for the long haul. And we're going to build on that strategy. That's why we went after SeaMicro. And we believe with SeaMicro, it positions us to capture that high-growth dense server play. You could think about that fabric and what that's going to do in that server segment, where we're going to weave 16 and 32 servers in a fabric that creates a dense solution that dramatically lowers power consumption, floorspace, all the components that matter to these big cloud server structures. We believe we've gained share and we believe that with the continued focus, a continued build out of our capability, this quarter, next quarter and well into the future, we can continue to build out that model.",331

We said already at our Analyst Day that we expect the operating expenses to be somewhat back-end loaded. So we expect them to pick up in the second half. It has a lot to do with getting ready for a significant amount of work and launches around 28-nanometer products. Tape outs around the launches getting ready for 2013 is going to happen that year. So flattened -- flatter in the first half, first and second quarter, and you will see a pickup in the second half. But we still expect to stay for the year within the range that we gave.",106

So I think the trend that we see in Q2 will continue for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to make progress on the year front. We continue to expect to make progress on the product mix. And we will see, in the second half, however, also some more headwinds with 28-nanometer products going in production at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. That those have control impact in the second half. Despite of that, I think we're on a good trajectory within the guidance that we gave at Analyst Day, 44% to 48%, and we expect to move to the high end of that range over the course of the year as we said at the Analyst Day.",119

Whether that's in thin client or around gaming or any of the verticals, there's a lot of interest in this capability of the APU combining a compute complex with the Graphics complex that allows the processing and the power of the solution to be brought to bear at a very attractive valuable price-performance scenario.

Thanks, Stacy. Good question. From a hard file perspective, we've not -- as we've talked about before, we -- this is a very, a resilient supply chain in the PC industry. Having been in it for a long time, I've seen many part situations come and go, and this is no different. Once we got past the January time frame, the hard file situation is pretty much gone, past, everybody in the industry. We saw no significant impact in terms of hard file to our business results in 1Q. And with the only issue being some residual higher pricing that's floating around in the market around files, I don't think there's a significant impact into 2Q and 3Q. I think this is fundamentally behind the industry and should be able to move forward. In terms of it having impact, and a lift going forward, I think we've already seen that strong capability in both February and March, we've been able to really catch up on that business and position to move forward from there.",175

So you mentioned lower 45-nanometer desktop sales. I know last quarter -- or 2 quarters ago, you've been impacted as you were moving that capacity over to 32. And then last quarter, you were impacted because you had a process excursion, I would assume, as you were moving it back. Lower sales now, is this because you're still -- there's still an issue with the process or is this just more evidence of OEMs moving off from 45 and under 32? And if, on that line, if you could give us some feeling for how much your 32-nanometer shipments actually increased quarter-over-quarter that'd be really helpful.",114

From a standpoint of desktop, there's no doubt those earlier issues kind of held that back. We are intensely focused on increasing our ability to deliver and really recapture that share in desktop. This is important for our business and important to go forward. I don't really see, from a desktop perspective, any significant issues. We've just got to deliver the 45 processor load and the 32. We've got to ramp that up as now supply positions are dramatically better. In terms of trade off between 32 and 45, 45 still clings well in the market. 32 is beginning to ramp up now that you've got the supply situation behind us. We are focused on this. You could talk to any of our business unit leader, this is an item that we have to continue to focus on and make progress. I'm not seeing anything from an execution standpoint that should hold us back. We need to deliver on this capability and put us in the position to go forward.",171

Are you seeing, any of them, a pause in their purchases and are you instead sending perhaps some of those exiting inventories out to emerging markets and channel customers rather than the OEMs? Can you give us [indiscernible] transition and if there's a lull in the second quarter here because of that?",76

Thanks, Joanne for the question. From the standpoint of emerging market, I do want to reference the emerging market. In the quarter, we've definitely seen continued microprocessor revenue growth, up about 21% year-over-year. And clearly, the Brazos APU has done very well in emerging market and Llano has followed that up. As we begun to launch Trinity, there's been a real interest in Trinity. We shipped Trinity. We're making all of the ramp figures that we've made, commitments to our customer and there's strong interest for both OEMs, in terms of their -- across all OEM in that segment. And then with Brazos 2.0, of course, they're looking for the increased performance, the increased capability that we're introducing into that segment. They like that segment. Brazos has done well. Brazos 2.0, with that additional, has strong interest from the OEMs. So I'm not seeing that, JoAnne, in terms of any pause or concern. Right now, the channel we're focused on, 45-nanometer product and minus one. We're also focused on building up the Llano because 32 is now under control and the execution and the yields are performing very well out of GLOBALFOUNDRIES. And then what we've got to do is now launch this record number of designs with Trinity and then Brazos 2.0 in the quarter. OEM interest has never been stronger and we look to continue to build on that.",234

And as I continue to meet with OEM customers, our large global accounts, there's more and more continued interest around that. You're going to see that continue to go into the second half. And that's very important. As I mentioned earlier, JoAnne, I really think that the current ultrathins that are being kind of grouped in this very high price band in a very crowded way is going to kind of cause a problem. If we think about it and we go where we have gone and attack with our customers, is to say, ""Let's go after mainstream. Let's bring this to everyone."" People are going to want this solution at a great price. We think we can kind of fly right under that pricing umbrella and really attack it with this Trinity launch with some high-volume runners.",151

And we saw this really come fundamentally under control in early February. Any residuals in terms of demand issues from fourth quarter, which were relatively small, kind of moved past that. And we've seen that momentum continue through February and March. Again, there are some residual pricing issues around hard files because they haven't come all the way back down. That always takes a little longer to happen. But I don't see any reason that based on our expectation and guidance for second quarter, there's not anything significantly unusual driven by hard files at all.",123

And we've driven a nearly 30% year-over-year mobile processor, unit shipment increase. I think that's pretty exciting with virtually basically almost 100% of the first quarter mobile shipments now being APUs. We're targeting those price bands and we put those APUs right in those segments that allows us to create that great experience for the customer, that combined power of the GPU -- Graphics complex with the CPU complex on 1 SoC, allows us to create the experience that's tailored to the movement around the cloud, and how application and data are going to move information to these clients. That experience is unique. And by creating a great value proposition, that's how I think we're seeing this 30% year-over-year, basically 30% year-over-year mobile processor shipment increase. I think what we're doing here is positioning right into those price bands to continue this momentum. And now as we launch the next-generations, top to bottom, refreshing this APU with Brazos 2.0 and Trinity, and the amount of design wins that we've created, step-by-step we continue to build on this momentum in the mobile space and bringing APU across the board.",211

And it is a very exciting product. We did some prelaunch work with a number of analysts and press in a controlled environment. They were excited to see this product. And we're excited about this product. I think we're situated very well with our performance per watt, which is basically double the last family. And I think we can cover a wider slot in terms of that entry in mainstream portfolio between Brazos 2.0 and the Trinity family.

I think Win 8 is going to be more of an x86 event, in my opinion, having come from the OEM side of the business. I think it's an important event. I think it will generate interest. It will create demand. There's no doubt, forward and backward compatibility will be very important. And I think over time, lower power in the client space will be important. What we've done with Brazos is demonstrated, what, over 30 million units shipped in that within the first year, Brazos 2 builds on that. And then next year, as you've seen in our roadmap work at Analyst Day, the next generation of that family even takes it further. And I think what we believe is there is the opportunity for us to continue to win in that space with a great price performance, a great performance per watt, forward and backward compatibility, in a segment that's very attractive. For the other players that are now entering it, it's going to take a bit of time to build out that ecosystem. They've got to make sure that they've got enough performance to do the things that have to be done on that device, whatever. There were some other solutions that were introduced in the past that had difficulty as they moved into the segment because maybe they were slightly underpowered. We believe that we can reach the price points, the performance points and the power per watt that we need to do to win in this segment.

I think there's -- this is part of the inflection point that we talked about. Think about what that kind of convergence, right, and the cloud, those 2 Cs, are really going to do in terms of this processor and compute environment. This, where we play strongly, entry and mainstream, is going to be the dominant segment. And as you see us continue to drive low power into every one of our offerings and the capability with an ambidextrous architecture that reduces their time-to-market, gives us higher quality, allows us to do it with more efficiency and gives us flexibility across architecture with more consistent use of IP, I think that AMD is uniquely positioned to capture this. It isn't about following anybody and it isn't about being an alternative. That's not what it's about. It's about seeing where the market is going. And this market is beginning to change. And I think AMD with the technology, the architecture, the kind of skills that we have in the company, we play our cards right, this change in terms of this inflection point introduces an opportunity for us.",198

That is very much organic growth. We said that while we see for a startup some substantial revenue this year in terms of the overall aggregated amounts and revenue we look at, it's very small. So next quarter, it's very much driven by AMD core organic growth. And you have to put this in perspective, over the last 7 years, our seasonality in the second quarter was about minus 4%.",74

We began the year the way we began 2011, with the fastest GPU card on the planet. And we believe that with the work that we're doing now here with 28-nanometer products across the entire discrete Graphics portfolio, we are very well-positioned. Now we're going to introduce the discrete Graphics around 28-nanometer into the notebook space. There is always going to be some slight pressure down as that market continues to move toward APUs.

For instance, you're seeing growth in server but ASPs is declining despite a greater mix of Bulldozer. So I was hoping you could talk about your assumptions behind pricing trends over the course of this year, particularly as Bulldozer ramps and you get more Trinity and the Brazos 2.0.",63

Over the past several years, we saw our share position decline consistently in the server segment. What we've been on is we've got a renewed focus and the commitment to a long-term strategy to build a stead of server offerings. With the SeaMicro acquisition, it positions us in the fastest-growing segment of the server market. With Bulldozer, we began to build out our capability in terms of our go to market, our ecosystem relationship. And you're going to see us focus very, very well in terms of execution on server, because server is different than consumer products. You've got to deliver high quality, you've got to deliver on time, on schedule. That's what CIOs count on and they believe on. We've made good momentum in the first 3 quarters but that's just the beginning of the journey that we're on. This is a long-term game plan. And we're going to use this server experience here, and with the introduction of our next generations around Abu Dhabi and our future roadmap item, you're going to see us continue to move down that path. But again, long-term strategy. In terms of ASPs, this space is, again, there's always about the mix that you have and the certain deals that you win, we want to continue that momentum and then continue to build on that server space to create the base for future growth as we move both in the traditional server space and into the dense space. In terms of the APUs, we talked about it earlier. We're in the key price bands. We play very well in those price bands. We believe with Brazos 2.0 and Trinity, and with the design and interest around those 2 products, we're well positioned to continue the momentum that were created. Up 30% year-over-year on mobile processors unit shipments or just about, 100% are now APUs, we believe that we can continue to capture parts of this growing market moving forward that positions us well in that segment. And then again, the last piece on I'll answer it, Patrick, is around ultrathin. I think the ultrathins is a very interesting space for us. It's something we really need to watch. Ultrathins are for everyone. And ultrathins and thin and light are going to be a core product across the industry. This is nothing new. Thin and light has been going on for the past 15 years. We're taking it to the next level and we're going to bring it to everyone.",432

This isn't a full out attack where it's all about just share. We're in a balanced perspective. Thomas and the financial team have constructed a strategy that allows us to expand earnings and allows us to position future growth. We're on a balanced approach. We're going to make sure that we're gaining and competing well in terms of volume and share, particularly in emerging market, particularly in the key segments and price bands where we know the future glow and the inflection point will be. And we want to continue to build on that. That's how you want to do it. And at the same time, you want to make sure that the margin is there so that you could continue to drive the cash generation and the ability to invest in future opportunities to go forward. We want to -- this is not a one-trick pony. We want to build this on a consistent, sustainable model, quarter in and quarter out, year after year.

That would always be good. But this is a long-term strategy. We've made some initial momentum. We're going to continue to build on that. But no, we're in this long term. We went after SeaMicro. We're building the traditional server space. You're going to see us continue to work in terms of ambidextrous capability. You're going to see us continue to work in terms of building out that roadmap. This is just the beginning of a long journey, and a journey that we believe we're making good initial progress.

There's no doubt, as this inflection point continues to accelerate, and it will over the next 3 or 5 years, that emerging markets are going to be key. Consumerization is going to continue to drive a different mindset around the commercial segments, around the client. You're going to see the next 1 billion or 2 billion customers in the PC segment around these converged devices come from those emerging markets. You're going to see us continue to focus on it. We talked about it in many of our strategy sections around low power and continue to drive down with ambidextrous capability and to attack and to win in the emerging market. We saw 21% year-over-year microprocessor revenue growth in the emerging market. That's a good start but we have to continue to build on that. If you look at the other regions, Europe is obviously a difficult environment in terms of its macroeconomic trends, something that we're watching very closely. I think we're performing reasonably well in that environment. But until some of the sovereign debt issues get solved, I think that’s going to be a wildcard in terms of its velocity and its business expansion. I think North America has performed pretty well over the past several quarters. And all of the data that I read from external sources point to a reasonable consistent GDP growth that should be good for our performance in those mature segments like North America. But again, it's about the emerging market and winning in that over time.",255

By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary. If you've not reviewed those documents, they can be found on AMD's website at quarterlyearnings. amd.com. 
Participants on today's conference call are Rory Read, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas Seifert, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Papermaster, our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on amd.com. There will also be a telephone replay. The number is (888) 266-2081. Outside of the United States, the number is (703) 925-2533. The access code for both is 1563304. The telephone replay will be available for the next 10 days starting later this evening. 
I'd like to highlight a few dates for you. AMD's Financial Analyst Day will be held on February 2; Thomas Seifert will attend the Oppenheimer Semiconductor Summit on the 23rd of February in Vail, Colorado; and our first quarter quiet time will begin at the close of business on Friday, March 16 and will be followed by the announcement of our fourth quarter earnings, expected to be Thursday, April 19. 
AMD's ownership of GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a fully diluted basis decreased to approximately 8.8% as of the conclusion of the fourth quarter. Reconciliation for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed today is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings release, available in the Investor Relations section of amd.com. 
Before we begin today's call, I'd like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's expectations. Investors are cautioned that those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. 
The semiconductor industry is generally volatile, and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. You'll find detailed discussions about such risk factors in AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 2, 2011.

We took steps to optimize our business for today and position the company to seize the opportunities for tomorrow. We made good progress, but no question, we have more work to do. 
First, we demonstrated that our innovation engine remains strong. The tremendous success of our low-power Brazos platform drove a 25% increase in mobile processor shipments and significant notebook share gains for the year. Brazos is, in fact, the most successful platform in our AMD history. 
In Graphics, we exited the year the same way we entered it, with the world's fastest graphics chip. Our GPU IP provides us with superior video, multimedia and graphics capabilities that form the core of our competitive advantage. 
And our Server business has regained momentum as adoption of the new Bulldozer-based CPUs continue to accelerate. As a result, we believe we gained overall microprocessor unit share for the year, and we are positioned well for growth as we continue to strengthen our differentiated product offerings. 
Second, we continued to optimize our financial model, consistently delivering operating income and creating the foundation for sustained success. 2011 revenue was $6.57 billion, flat from 2010. And non-GAAP net income improved to $374 million, or $0.50 per share. Additionally, we significantly improved free cash flow as well, helping to strengthen our balance sheet. 
Third, we took important steps to get fit to fight and write the next chapter for the AMD's history, a chapter that will be built on our rich heritage of innovation and improved execution. We strengthened our leadership team. The addition of industry veterans such as Mark Papermaster, Rajan Naik and Lisa Su will help ensure sustainable, dependable execution becomes the hallmark of the new AMD. 
We implemented a restructuring plan and operational improvements in the fourth quarter. These actions will allow us to fund strategic initiatives designed to accelerate our growth by refining our focus on staking leadership positions in low power, emerging market and the cloud.
2011 progress was tempered by execution challenges that impacted our supply. We took several steps during the course of the year to better manage our foundry partnerships. Over the last 2 quarters, 32-nanometer yields and performance have steadily improved at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. As a result of the focus on improved execution, 32-nanometer unit shipments increased by more than 80% from third quarter to fourth quarter and now represent a full 1/3 of our overall processor mix. Now looking more closely at the fourth quarter. 
Revenue was $1.69 billion, flat sequentially and up 2% from a year ago. Record APU shipments and increased demand for our server chips resulted in strong financial performance in what turned out to be an unusually weak quarter for the overall industry. Revenue was impacted by lower-than-expected GPU demand and a one-time issue that limited supply of the 45-nanometer desktop processors. Working closely with our strategic foundry partner, we believe the 45-nanometer issues have been corrected, and we will see supply rebound in the first quarter. 
Despite these challenges, we continue to improve our ability to meet our customer commitments. We also successfully transitioned the company to a lower-cost operating model while driving continued adoption of the latest innovative products. As a result, our non-GAAP net income improved to $138 million, or $0.19 a share, for the fourth quarter. 
Now let's take a look at our client business. Our strategy to deliver the best experiences possible at mainstream price points continues to pay off, resulting in record APU unit shipments for the quarter. AMD APUs were in 5 of the top 6 best-selling systems in North America retail in the fourth quarter, including 2 of the most popular systems. AMD dominated the busiest shopping week of the year, powering more than 70% of PCs sold in the retail segment on Black Friday. 
We saw a similar success in high-growth markets. For example, in China, we posted our third straight quarter of significant retail notebook share gains, and customer adoption of our APUs continues to increase. Design wins for our next-generation APU platforms are tracking ahead of the record number of design wins we secured in 2011. 
We are seeing particularly strong customer interest in our expanded low-power APUs for 2012. The low-power versions of our next-generation chip, Trinity APU, delivers mainstream performance while using half the power of our traditional notebook processor. This processor fits into an ultrathin notebook design, as thin as 17 millimeters, providing industry-leading visual performance and battery life at very attractive price points. Trinity remains on track to launch for midyear. 
Now looking at our Server business. We had our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, largely due to the ramp of our new Opteron 6200 and 4200 processors. These new Bulldozer-based processors accounted for more than 1/3 of our total server unit shipments in the quarter. Continued adoption in the high-performance computing market was bolstered by the introduction of several HP and Dell servers powered by the Opteron 6200 processor. 
HP introduced 5 new ProLiant servers, including the world's and industry's fastest dual-socket database server ever produced. Dell also introduced 4 new PowerEdge systems, including the world's most efficient blade server. We believe we gained server share in the quarter, and demand for the 6200 Series remains strong. 
Now looking at Graphics. Despite strong game console licensing revenue, lower demand for discrete notebook graphic chips and a seasonally weak desktop add-in board market for the quarter resulted in a overall revenue decline in our fourth quarter. 
We introduced the first member of our next-generation AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series graphics family at the end of the quarter. The Radeon HD 7970 launched to universal industry acclaim as the fastest GPU on the planet. We completely re-architected this graphics engine in the 7970, improving performance per square millimeter by over 150%. 
So in summary, our APU momentum continues to accelerate. Our Server business continues to strengthen, posting 2 straight quarters of double-digit growth. We continue to offer the fastest graphics technology on the planet, and we are seeing consistent improvement in 32-nanometer yields and execution performance. 
In the near term, continuing to improve our execution will provide the greatest opportunity to increase value. This will, in turn, accelerate our growth and ensure we are in the right position to embrace the changes sweeping the industry around consumerization, the cloud and convergence. I believe AMD is uniquely positioned to take advantage of these key business trends. 
AMD begins 2012 with a clear path forward. We know where our opportunities lie and what we need to do to seize them. Every AMD-er is focused on building an AMD that will deliver on its commitments with innovative products that anticipate the needs of our customers and the fast-changing market. I look forward to providing more details of our strategy at our Analyst Day next week.  With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas, who will cover the financials for 2011 and the fourth quarter.",1164
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2012",2012-01-24,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3875.0,324783.0,15707353.0,Presenter Speech,Thomas Seifert,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Rory. 2011 was a year of solid financial execution combined with significant operational and strategic actions designed to position AMD for success in the target markets. We executed well to our 2011 financial model while strengthening our balance sheet. 
We implemented efficiencies across the company's operations and reduced our headcount in the fourth quarter, which we expect will result in savings of over $200 million in operating expenses, most of which the company expects to re-invest. This re-investment will fund initiatives designed to accelerate AMD's strategies for low power, emerging markets and the cloud.2011 highlights include a strengthened balance sheet with debt reduced to $2 billion, down by $200 million in principal values from a year ago; achievement of the following 2011 financial goals: gross margin of 45%, positive non-GAAP operating income and improved non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow to $528 million as compared to $355 million in 2010. 
In addition, AMD achieved several notable accomplishments. We shipped more than 30 million APUs to date and more than 100 million DirectX 11 graphic cores. We achieved several records: an all-time record for client microprocessor annual revenue and mobile microprocessor annual revenue and all-time records for mobile GPU annual revenue and professional graphics annual revenue. 
Let's turn to the fourth quarter results. Revenue was $1.69 billion in the fourth quarter, flat sequentially as revenue growth in the Computing Solutions segment of 2% was offset by 5% revenue decline in the Graphics segment. Gross margin was 46%, up one percentage point quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to seasonal increase in game console revenue and improved GPU product mix. 
Operating expenses were $601 million, less than guided, primarily due to higher-than-expected operational savings associated with the restructuring plan announced on November 3 of last year. We saw an immediate benefit from these actions, reducing costs by $40 million and improving earnings per share by $0.02 in the quarter. 
R&D was $358 million, 21% of net revenue, and SG&A was $243 million, 14% of net revenue. Non-GAAP net income was $138 million, and non-GAAP operating income was $172 million. Interest expense increased by $1 million compared to the prior quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.19, calculated using 740 million fully diluted shares. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $260 million, up $21 million from the prior quarter due to higher non-GAAP operating income, driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses. 
Now switching to the business segments. Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up 2% sequentially, driven by double-digit growth in Server and Chipset revenue. Server revenue experienced growth for the second quarter in a row, driven by a sequential increase in unit shipments, primarily due to the ramp of the Opteron 6200 Series, which now account for more than 1/3 of AMD's server processor shipments and revenue. 
We achieved record quarter client revenue driven by an increase in supply of Llano APUs. And in Q4 of 2011, APUs accounted for nearly 100% of mobile microprocessors shipped and more than 60% of the total client microprocessors shipped. Microprocessor ASP increased sequentially due to an increase in mobile microprocessor ASP and an increase in server units shipped. 
Computing Solution's operating income was $165 million, up $16 million from the previous quarter primarily due to lower operating expenses and an increase in server units shipped. Graphics segment revenue was $382 million, down 5% compared to the prior quarter mainly due to a decline in mobile GPU unit shipments, partially offset by a seasonal increase in game console revenue. Mobile and desktop GPU revenues declined due to seasonality, and GPU ASP increased due to product mix. Graphics segment operating income was $27 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher game console revenue and higher GPU ASP. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance, including long term, at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion, up $57 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2011. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $919 million, up $11 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2011. 
Inventory was $476 million exiting the quarter, down $64 million from the prior quarter due to a decline in GPU inventory driven by a transition to the newly-launched 28-nanometer product late in the quarter. 
Debt at the end of the quarter was $2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $50 million principal value of our 6% notes, bringing the annual total repurchase to $200 million. Non-GAAP free cash flow was $100 million. 
Now turning to the outlook. AMD expects revenue to decrease 8% plus-minus 3% sequentially for the first quarter of 2012.  Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $590 million, and gross margin is expected to be approximately 45% as we approach concluding our negotiations with GLOBALFOUNDRIES on a wafer supply agreement. 
Our continued focus on financial performance and operational efficiencies has paved the way to position AMD as a strong competitor in the computing space. We're excited about our achievements to date as well as our capabilities and our road maps, and we look forward to sharing our exciting plans with you at our Financial Analyst Day on February 2 at our Sunnyvale headquarter.

When you look at the guidance you're giving for the first quarter, can you help us put that into context? Is there an assumption that the hard disk drive issue in Thailand is negatively impacting Q1, and that's reflected? Are there further share gains? And I'd be curious on the positive trend in servers whether or not you'll make it 3 for 3 as far as sequential growth.",77

We've now shipped over 30 million of these APUs to date. And we're seeing a strong uptake in terms of that architecture, what it means to the customer. They are looking for a better experience, and I think that's a key reason why we've seen the momentum in our business and the ability to deliver on that. Our focus on execution around the APUs and around Llano is definitely paying off. And I think as we move forward, we should be able to continue to build on that momentum. Now at the end of 4Q, we did see a little bit of pressure in terms of hard disk, but we actually saw it in the area of the graphics chips. And this, we think, is going to be reflected in a very resilient PC supply chain that we think will recover relatively quickly. Our focus is to continue to focus on the right architectures, the right solutions that make a difference for those customers. We've seen the ability to meet those by improving our execution. I think that's got to remain our #1 focus. And while we saw a little bit of chop there in terms of hard disk impacting the graphics, I think we'll see a little bit more here in the beginning of 1Q, but I think this market should continue to recover. As it relates to server, that's 2 quarters in a row. We're starting to see a steady improvement in this business, and we want to build on that. I think the acceptance of the Opteron 6200 with the new launches around our key partners like HP and Dell are paying dividends. And you're seeing that momentum translate into higher growth, 2 quarters in a row. We're going to work hard to make it 3, and we're going to continue to work on delivering the kind of solution that makes a difference to the customer. Thomas, do you want to add anything?",341

Is that influencing the gross margin coming down a bit? Or is that mainly just the revenue and mix? And then I guess how do those negotiations impact kind of your longer-term view on the gross margin model?",62

So first of all, let me help you build a bridge. We see some tailwind -- headwinds in there, let me start there in the first quarter, just because of product mix and revenue being seasonally down. You know that in the fourth quarter, our game console licensing revenue helped us to exceed expectations. So we'll see some headwinds from product mix in there in the first quarter. And we see some tailwinds because of improving yields on the 32-nanometer side. We think if you take the gives and takes, you're going to come out at 45%, pretty much. The negotiations with GLOBALFOUNDRIES are making very good progress. We're very pleased with the results we have been achieving, and we think we approach the conclusion of those negotiations. And of course, the guidance we've provided today for the current quarter also reflects or is an assessment of where we are in there with the negotiation.",160

I think the partnership that we're trying to build first around focusing, around execution, we've been maniacally focused with our partners at GF, IBM, PDF and AMD all working together to address the execution challenges we had in 3 -- in the third quarter, and we've seen progress. As we move forward off of those successes and that partnership, I think the negotiations have moved forward well. And we're trying to work to put in place the kind of agreements that would allow us to have a strong base for the next 2 years to be able to deliver on our expectations and to move forward with a successful model that allows us to meet those customer demand and deliver on our financial commitments.

We've been intensely focused on addressing this execution challenge, and there's no doubt that this kind of focus is producing benefit. Week in and week out, we've seen steady improvement from where we started the quarter and where we ended 3Q. We've actually increased our Llano 32-nanometer product delivery by 80% from the third quarter, and now Llano makes up almost 60% of the mobile microprocessing revenue. I think this is a good step in the right direction. This gives us the momentum. And we were able to deliver in a more effective way on the customer demands. Is there a strong interest in the product? Absolutely. Do we need to continue to build on the execution progress that we've made? For sure. We're not out of the woods yet, but we're making steady progress. And with that, we've been delivering each and every week better and better and better. That 80% improvement quarter-to-quarter suggests a nice mix in terms of 32-nanometer and positions us again for 1Q. You're going to see us keep that focus, and it's our commitment to continue to improve that to deliver on every customer commitment, because building on that customer commitment, delivering on them, is the bedrock of developing long-term customer trust, which will fuel future growth.",223

I think that shows the beginnings of a strong foundation. We've got to continue to build on that. And with the launches of the HP products, the Dell products, HP has now launched the world's fastest dual-socket database server, and Dell, the -- achieved the world record for power efficiency in the blade server space.  Those are good data points to say there's the interest and the desire. And when I look at on a weekly basis and I look at the pipeline of customer interest and demand, we're building on that week in and week out. Of course, with our relatively modest share position, our objective is to continue to build on this turnaround. We're just at the very beginning of this, and this is a long-term focus for us to build on quarter in and quarter out. Sure, there'll be new products introduced across the year and into next year. And we'll do the same. But it's about building those relationships with the enterprise customers, understanding their needs, making sure that we're delivering those products consistently with the execution.

As you know, we began to account for our investment in GLOBALFOUNDRIES under the method of -- cost method of accounting last -- first quarter last year. And at that time, the investment was determined to have a value of around $460 million. We, as a company, review our investment for impairment indicators regularly. At the end of last quarter, we did this with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. And based on certain indicators, their future growth outlook, they have changed the time line on the new fab in Abu Dhabi. Their business plans have changed, and we reevaluated our investment in the company. It has decreased now down to $277 million, and we impaired for that very reason the investment we have.

Customers want mobility. And the idea of ultrathin is something that we're very focused on. And if you think about it with our APU strategy that I mentioned, with the next-generation product, Trinity APU, we already are well ahead of the pace last year when we set a record-setting year for design wins with the Trinity product in 2012. With that product, we can deliver ultrathin in the range of 17 millimeters. And what's really important and I think we have to all focus on is ultrathin and mobility, the ability for computing to reach customers across the planet. Whether it's in high-growth markets, mature markets, we want to deliver that kind of mobility solution with a great experience, great graphics, low power in a thin mobile solution. And we want to do it at a mainstream price. That opens the door for this computing to a much broader portfolio. And our objective at AMD is to deliver that kind of technology, that kind of experience into the sweet spot of the market.

We're approaching an inflection point. There's no doubt in my mind that we're seeing a breakdown in some of the proprietary control points that have dominated the market for years. And I think in the server space, based on what's happening in the cloud, what's happening around convergence, the types of workloads that are going to be driven through these mega data centers, these cloud data centers, the kinds of solutions that are going to be created going forward are going to be tailored to very unique almost server appliances that allow us in dense kinds of solutions to introduce, I don't know, disruptive, really disruptive server plate that allows us to win. You'll see us continue to focus in the high-performance computing market, because that's always a forerunner of where next technology is going. We've got a strong foothold there. Continue to build on the database work that -- I mean, the traditional data center work that we're doing with the kinds of work around virtualization and around certain workload segments where our type of architecture really plays. And you'll see us get really aggressive around this disruptive play as we move forward. And so another area I'm sure Mark wants to comment on.",224

So our perspective is Win 8 is an interesting and important launch of technology. We think that it's going to drive interest and demand in the overall marketplace. And as I mentioned earlier, with our APU strategy, we are going to be ready to participate in that in the traditional spaces, in the ultrathin spaces and then move forward. I think you'll see architectures begin to dabble in that x86 space. Remember, these are 32-bit architectures at the beginning of these implementations. Windows is performing really efficient with -- efficiently at the 64-bit level. And while these are first forays into that space, we'll see some of that around this trend of convergence. There's no doubt about it. But what we have to do is focus on creating the technical solutions with the APUs that are low power, that are at the right price point, that delivers the full graphics experience, the long battery life, the quick start-ups and the ability to have backward and forward compatibility. That's an advantage, and that allows us to continue to build on that. People talked about ultralow power in the past and other things like that. Those weren't as successful as we'd hope, because they were a little bit underpowered or under-capable. This trend will emerge. We're ready to participate in Win 8, and we're going to -- we're excitingly looking forward to its launch.",234

I remember from last call it went down significantly because of shortage of 45-nanometer parts. I was wondering where we are on that. You mentioned that there were some issues were resolved. But going forward, is that still tied to 32-nanometer yields? Or we can see unconstrained supply of desktop parts going forward?",61

Desktop is an important segment for us. I think we're seeing more consistency in the execution.  As you have heard me mention earlier, we've increased our delivery around 32-nanometer Llano by 80% from the third quarter, up 80% from the third quarter. That means that we're getting more efficient in terms of the yields. We're not consuming the same number of wafers. That allows us to address the desktop space. Without that conversion -- excursion, I think we're in a strong position there. But I believe that in 1Q, that you'll see us continue to rebound around desktop supply.",130

You can never really be 100% sure. When we take a look at what we're hearing from our analysts around IDC, Gartner and Mercury, there's a general consensus that '12 looks a bit stronger than '11, that the second half looks a little bit stronger than the first half. Our focus is around improving our execution. That's the first step that we can create value in the firm, deliver on our customer expectations. We believe we're on the right track with the APU architecture and strategy, and you're going to see us continue to evolve that. And I think what we're focused on is that customer, that execution, that architecture. And what's key for us is to continue to build on the growth and that share focus quarter in and quarter out. We'll be ready for what the market throws at us. We're going to go based on what the general consensus is from the analysts around growth for '12.

And then if I could ask as my follow-up. And I understand and kind of applaud the focus on execution. I guess, though, you can't execute in a vacuum, and you have to think about the environment going on with your competitors. And your competitor is just spending an unprecedented amount of CapEx and planning to bring on an unprecedented amount of leading-edge capacity.

But as you think of the industry trends around consumerization, cloud and convergence, there's no doubt, as we've seen these kinds of inflection points in the industry, there's always a significant downward pressure in terms of the price points. So if you're dragging huge asset base along with you and there comes pressure into the market around those price points, that could put pressure into their -- into a business model. Our focus is to create the kinds of APU processors that give the excellent performance, the excellent experience around our graphics IP, our video IP, our low-power solution and a solution that we believe is very agile, one that we can apply across that, and we can hit price points that are very comfortable for us. We think the emerging market and the entry -- and the high-growth markets around entry and mainstream will be the hottest segment, and I think that's playing to our hand. We're going to emphasize this strategy. We want to embrace this inflection point that's emerging. We want to accelerate it, because shift happens when there's these inflection points.",209

Now with the introduction of the ProLiant solutions from AP -- HP, not AP, HP -- and now with the Dell blade servers, the PowerEdge blade servers that we're introducing, now we're introducing a wider swath of product set. They're across multiple types of node solutions. We're further into the launch now, so you're getting a much wider spread in terms of the yield across the mix. I don't think we saw anything unusual for the first initial quarter, 1.5 quarters of this launch in terms of mix. I think you'll see us build on that as we move forward here in 1Q and 2Q, but nothing unusual in terms of that mix.",149

And then on the notebook side or, more generally, 32- versus 45-nanometer side, so it sounds like a very nice increase in yields on 32-nanometer. And so what I'm curious about is since 32-nanometer increased, shipments increased so much in the fourth quarter but overall computing revenue increased by far less, is that a sign that there was a pretty steep drop in 45-nanometer production? And how does that, then, shape up for the transition from the fourth quarter to the first quarter?",87

And then combine that with the server space, good progress there. The only part of the portfolio that was a little bit choppy was, as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, were around the graphics space. That was a little bit different, and I thought the add-in board market was a little bit affected this December based on that hard disk kind of chop in the channel. We've -- we are not dramatically affected by that because of -- more of our focus is on the execution side. So I feel pretty good about where we are in terms of the transition around 32. I think that we're on track to launch the next APU platform around Trinity, as I mentioned earlier. With the kind of design wins that we're getting there, that positions us well. We've got, still, interesting demand around 45 in terms of some of the product sets in the channel, mainly around desktop, and we'll continue to work that technology through, especially in the high-growth and emerging markets. So I'm not seeing anything, JoAnne, in that mix that's terribly unique. I think we're at a good point in terms of those crossover curves that we run in terms of transition and with the improved execution. And I want to emphasize, we've made real progress, but we're not finished with that. And we need to continue to work every day with those tiger teams we've put in place. We're tracking the test vehicles through the lines to make sure that we're getting that consistent improvement, because that will reduce our consumption of wafers and give us far more flexibility in our supply chain. So while we have improved by 80% from the third quarter, we're not all the way there yet, and we need to keep that maniacal focus on execution this quarter and the rest of 2012. That's the key to building initial value for our shareholders and partners.",351

And of course, all the learnings that have been done on 32-nanometer with the Llano product will be transferred to Trinity.

So I guess stay tuned for that. And then I guess, Rory, I want to follow up on servers a bit, here. Clearly, you're seeing some momentum, a couple of quarters of growth. I guess a couple of parts. First off, where are you seeing an initial design traction? Second, do you expect server ASPs to increase now that you're getting parts out there to your customers? And then lastly, there's been a lot of chatter out there and a lot of activity in nontraditional server design, lots of guys doing designs on ARM and things like that. Can you offer your thoughts on that as well?",110

From a server perspective, as I commented earlier, the initial momentum is driven around our success in the high-performance computing market. We see always a very early uptake in terms of our key partners in those segments. Then you go and focus with the launches around HP and Dell in terms of their server market, more of a traditional space around virtualization and around business workload. We're seeing good pipeline activity there around the launch, and the trend looks solid. ASPs, obviously we'll work always to try and improve our mix. That's in our best interest. The demand is out there. And with our relatively modest share position, there's a lot of opportunity for us to attack. So I think we're off to a good start, but this is just the beginning of a long-term focus on server to build on that. And then, of course, I think in the disruptive play, maybe Mark wants to add a comment on some of the thoughts that we have in that disruptive space.",176

As I commented earlier, Kevin, we finished the year the way we started the year. We finished the year with the fastest GPU product on the planet. And I think it's kind of amazing. The 7970 Radeon HD board is an industry leadership. It really is. And our focus around driving industry leadership at the discrete GPU level is not going to change. And our focus on using that IP and technology in our APUs is spot-on. We want to continue to build on that momentum and drive forward. There's lots of forecasts out there, the trend on discrete over time with APUs and with the way we're going to embed that, the trend has to trend down over a period of time. But this is a good market, a market we continue to protect and attack to win moving forward. I think the kind of chop that we saw at the end of the quarter was really a little bit around the channel space and the kinds of pressure that we saw in the channel around some of the hard disk issues. Well, we have a relatively balanced business across the space, and we've been very able to focus on execution to drive that revenue consistently a quarter. We did see a little bit of that chop. But no doubt, Kevin, we're -- we see this as a very attractive market. We see this as a market that we can use the IP across the space. And again, finish the year the way we started: the world's fastest, the fastest graphics engine on the planet.  On the planet.",272

168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2012",2012-07-19,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3817.0,328573.0,15884362.0,Presenter Speech,Rory Read,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth. Clearly, our performance in the quarter was disappointing and did not meet our commitments. When I joined AMD last year, we laid out a set of priorities to improve our execution and transform the company to sustain our long-term growth potential. This has not changed. In spite of the setback in the quarter, we continue to move forward confidently and we are taking the right steps to strengthen and transform our business. 
For the second quarter, our revenue of $1.41 billion decreased 10% from a year ago and 11% sequentially, missing our expectations. After a reasonable start, we saw business velocity slow in the later part of the quarter driving this revenue miss. This second quarter revenue shortfall was largely driven by 2 key factors: first, weak sales of desktop processors in the channel, primarily in China and Europe; and secondly, a soft consumer PC market that impacted OEM notebook processor sales. We reacted quickly to this revenue softness by focusing on maintaining margin and effectively managing our expense position. As a result, we reduced expenses sequentially and maintained margin at approximately 46%, generating a net income of $37 million in the quarter. 
Looking at the specifics of the desktop business, sales to OEMs increased sequentially based on their continued adoption of APUs. However, our desktop channel revenue declined simply as our Llano product did not experience the same uptake it had with our OEM customers. Looking back, when we were significantly 32-nanometer supply constrained last year, we prioritized shipments of Llano to our OEM customers. As a result, channel partners saw a dramatic change in supply linearity and a misalignment with motherboard availability. This clearly impacted Llano sales and built inventory in the channel. 
Correcting our channel challenges with Llano is largely within our own control. Moving forward, we will focus on accelerating desktop channel sell-through, ensure proper supply linearity and more effectively position Llano's value proposition in this area. It is clear that the overall PC market experienced softness in the second quarter, particularly in the consumer space. This impacted our notebook processor business. As the slowdown accelerated late in the quarter, OEMs responded quickly in an effort to reduce their inventory exposure at retailers and limit their on-hand inventories. We made the decision to protect our notebook margin and not chase lower margin business as the environment weakened at the end of the quarter. 
While our notebook processor business did not meet our revenue expectations, we did see mobile processor revenue and unit shipments increase from the year-ago period. And Trinity notebook shipments more than doubled sequentially and we have no supply constraints. 
We are also seeing good response to the recently launched Trinity systems, including the first Ultrathins from HP and Samsung that hit the mainstream price points. We expect a second wave of Ultrathins will launch in the second half of the year aligned around the Windows 8 introduction. Also, the introduction of Brazos 2.0 helped drive the sixth straight quarter of notebook share gains in the $499 and below retail price band globally. This is a good indicator that our products continue to compete at compelling price points that represent nearly 1/3 of the overall retail notebook market. We expect that the notebook softness that began in the second quarter will continue in the second half of the year; and while overall notebook market will grow, we anticipate it will be at a lower rate due to third quarter softness in anticipation of Windows 8, the macroeconomic conditions and overall inventory build in the PC ecosystem from the first half. Our record number of design wins remains intact and will help fuel our notebook business through this challenging environment. 
Now turning to our server business, revenue increased from the year-ago period but declined sequentially and was below our expectations. With the introduction of our Bulldozer-based Opteron processors at the end of last year, we saw strong initial adoption in the high-performance compute end market. In the second quarter, we experienced a pause in our server business, and our focus has to be on building similar acceptance with mainstream IT buyers. Bulldozer is a solid technology, and as we have discussed previously, our growth opportunities are in the portions of the market where our products deliver clear performance advantages. Based on the competitive landscape, we believe Bulldozer can drive modest share growth in the near term. 
In the server space, we also see market expansion opportunities with the growing adoption of dense server technology. We have a differentiated leadership position in this market as a result of our acquisition of SeaMicro. Our IP foundation allows us to deliver disruptive server products and a technology roadmap that strengthens our long-term competitiveness in this emerging market. 
Our graphics business executed well, and our results were within historical seasonal patterns. We continued expanding our AMD Radeon 7000 desktop and notebook discrete graphics solutions in the quarter, and we recaptured the title of world's fastest graphics chip and launched the first member of our new workstation family based on our latest graphics core. 
It is clear that global economic activity is slowing, and this is impacting the PC market. For the first time since 2001, client PC shipments have declined sequentially for 3 consecutive quarters and have been below historical averages for the last 7 quarters. We expect macro headwinds will continue for the third quarter. We also believe the PC industry may be resetting to a new baseline and that full year industry growth estimates will be reduced. 
For the year, we now expect AMD processor unit shipments to grow in the low single digits. AMD will face these current challenges straight on, focused on delivering improved and consistent results. Profitability remains a key priority as we execute the action plans we have discussed here while managing expenses and driving future growth. 
We have made progress in building a better AMD. In the second quarter alone, we formed the HSA Foundation with other industry leaders. We announced a technology partnership with ARM to drive the adoption of an end-to-end security ecosystem. We also introduced the world's fastest graphics chip. We released the successor to our most successful platform ever with Brazos 2.0 APU and we launched our next-generation Trinity APU for the mainstream and ultrathin notebooks. 
Still, there is much more work to do. We remain steadfast in our efforts to improve our execution and capture the growth opportunities in the changing market landscape around low-power, disruptive server technology and cloud-based computing. As we control our expenses, we will protect our investments and our customer-facing activities and innovations that produce our next generation of relevant competitive products that will drive growth. 
There is no doubt that the second quarter was disappointing. But we have the determination and the commitment to deliver improved results. With that, I will turn it over to Thomas, who will cover the financials for the second quarter.",1156

Revenue for the second quarter of 2012 was $1.41 billion, down 11% sequentially, driven primarily by a 13% decline in the Computing Solutions segment. Graphics segment revenue was seasonally down 4%. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 46%, flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $557 million, 8% less than prior guidance, primarily due to lower bonus and commission expenses, as well as discretionary spending cost controls late in the quarter. R&D was $345 million, 24% of net revenue, and SG&A was $212 million, 15% of net revenue. 
Non-GAAP net income was $46 million and non-GAAP operating income was $86 million. Interest expense was $43 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. Tax provision was a net credit of $6 million in the quarter compared to $32 million in the prior quarter. The difference was primarily a onetime tax benefit of $36 million in the prior quarter related to the SeaMicro acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.06, calculated using 755 million fully diluted shares. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $173 million, down $48 million from the prior quarter due to lower non-GAAP operating income, which resulted from lower revenue in the quarter. 
Computing Solutions segment revenue was $1.05 billion, down 13% sequentially, driven primarily by lower channel sales in China and Europe, as well as the weaker consumer buying environment impacting sales to OEMs. Time product revenue declined 13% sequentially, primarily due to lower ASPs. Units also decreased in the second quarter. Both were primarily driven by lower demand for desktop processors and product mix in channel -- in the channel in China and Europe. Our server processor revenue declined from the prior quarter, mainly due to lower unit shipments and the slight ASP reductions. 
Chipset revenue declined in the quarter, primarily due to lower ASPs. Computing Solution operating income was $82 million, down $42 million sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue. Graphics segment revenue was $367 million, down 4% compared to the prior quarter due to seasonally lower unit shipments in the channel. GPU revenue was also down seasonally. Game console royalty revenue was flat sequentially. Graphics segment operating income was $31 million, down $3 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonal declines in the revenue in the quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term securities, ended the quarter at $1.76 billion. In the quarter, we made a $50 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES related to the 28-nanometer product limited wafer of exclusivity. 
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $744 million, down $218 million compared to the end of the first quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower revenue. Inventory was $833 million exiting the quarter, up $248 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales in the quarter and in preparation for previously anticipated demand. The inventory build consists primarily of our latest generation of products. 
Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $2.02 billion. 
Now turning to the outlook, AMD expects third quarter revenue to decrease 1% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 44%. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $560 million in the third quarter. We are working to match revenue and expenses to manage profitability and ensure we have the appropriate cost structure from which to grow and one that allows us to continue to make the necessary strategic product and roadmap investments. Our goal for the third quarter inventory is to be approximately flat sequentially. However, we'll need to carefully manage and focus on this as we transition throughout the quarter and monitor how our latest generation of products will gain traction in the marketplace as our customers prepare for the Windows 8 launch. 
We're disappointed by the softness in our business late in the second quarter and are now focused on stabilization and recovery. Protecting the value proposition of our new and refreshed product portfolio in the second half of the year is paramount in conjunction with continued profitability. Despite the ongoing challenges our general business faces, the choppy macro environment and some lackluster PC demand, I am confident we will succeed and be ready to capitalize on the Windows 8 launch, better inventory management and realize the ongoing value proposition of our APUs. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Ruth.",721

From a standpoint, this originated back in last year when we had that first Llano supply chain issue. And of course, you know, Hans, that we had to target our supply to our OEMs, and that was the right thing to do. As we introduced Llano late in the year to the channel that those motherboards had been there for some period of time and really damaged linearity, and pricing wasn't at the right levels as we exited the year. As we moved forward into 2012, the uptake on Llano in the channel wasn't as strong as we expected. And what we're doing here moving forward, Hans, is we're focused on improving and focusing on sellout activity throughout the tiers of the channel, improving the communication of our value proposition into this key segment and to make sure that we make -- deliver on this momentum in the desktop channel around linearity with our channel partners.

I don't think there's any doubt about that. In the channel, we talked about in the earlier comments about how we're going to focus to improve that going forward. In the OEM space, in the notebook space, our value proposition, our product set is strong with the APUs. I believe that in that segment, we've got to continue to focus on building that momentum with the key OEMs and to make sure that they see this next generation of APUs make the impact that we believe it will have. We've seen Trinity APUs double sequentially in terms of its volume. We've seen our early releases of our first Ultrathins with HP and Samsung. These are hitting mainstream price points and they're being well-accepted. And then around Brazos 2.0, the next-generation to our most successful platform ever of Brazos, we have now had again for the sixth quarter in a row, the leadership growth in terms of the $499 and below price band across the planet.

We've communicated before that we need to leverage our Opteron Bulldozer solution, which is a solid technology on the key workloads and the key customer segments where we enjoy a performance advantage. This is key. And we'll continue to build that where we can add modest share gains quarter-on-quarter, quarter-after-quarter. And now, we're also pleased with the progress that we're seeing around our SeaMicro acquisition. SeaMicro positions us with strong IP and a strong offering in the new emerging dense server computing area. And I think this is a very important opportunity as I believe this will expand the market as we move forward. Lisa, do you have any comments on how SeaMicro is going so far?",160

For the second quarter, I would say the integration has gone very smoothly, and we've been pleased with the capability and the talents that the team have brought onboard. We continue to have very positive conversations with customers about the technology, and we view this as a long-term growth path, in addition to obviously the near-term work on our Opteron based series, which we believe, as Rory said, has the opportunity to continue to grow.",106

It was within seasonal expectation and history. We saw good performance out of our next-generation 28-nanometer products and we have strong supply there. We did not see issues in terms of the graphics space in terms of that, where the big issue in terms of the quarter, and that is largely in our control, is around the Desktop business in the channel around CPUs and around the APU product. We did not see the same uptick, as I talked about earlier, uptake that we saw with the OEMs. And it's interesting, Uche, in the OEMs, we've done very well with Llano in terms of notebook and in desktop at the OEMs. So I believe that we've not done a good job in terms of linearity and managing our supply to our partners, communicating the strong value proposition deeper into the channel and to ensure that our promotions are focused on sell out to drive this launch. And that's what we're going to focus on in 3Q and 4Q.",175

That's very helpful. Just very quickly, if I were to look at how you -- if we look ahead into Intel introducing Haswell products and one other things we expect from the product is much lower power from their architecture. There are 2 questions I have. One is how do you position Trinity on Kaveri out there? But what's even more worrying for me is how do you think that as Ivy Bridge or even as a Sandy Bridge today rolls into the N minus 1 rolls into the value segment? Are we seeing a significant shift in terms of the competitive positioning of both companies? Or do you think that the way you position yourself you can actually compete in what I think is an interesting change from your competitor in terms of product rollout?",137

This execution in second quarter is disappointing. And we will correct it. But I firmly believe that we're on the right strategy around our APU technology, around cloud computing and enhancing our low-power solutions. This is the right strategy and the right differentiation for AMD. AMD is going to continue to deliver interesting and differentiated products that leverage this cloud environment and lower our power envelope and introduce an interesting value proposition to our customers moving forward.

So definitely, the APUs are our strategy, and we're very pleased with the value proposition that we have there, especially in notebook and especially as you go into the low-power space. So when you look at any of the comparisons on Trinity and the battery life that we have on those APUs, very good improvement over the previous generation. As we go forward, we're going to continue to focus on this strategy and as we go into the next-generation APUs, similar focus on getting longer battery life, thinner, lighter, those areas.

And just one last question. Your engagements with mega data centers in terms of your Server business, has been area where it's a little not clear what the strategy is. Some of the products you've rolled out recently have had fairly good reviews.

We like the mega data center market. It is the fastest-growing market in the server business. As we've discussed before, the server business is the one that takes a little bit longer to actually see product adoption. But we're very focused with both our Opteron product line as well as our SeaMicro products with the fiber-based technology in attacking those mega data centers.

So we guided for 46% to slightly up and we ended up right there, mainly driven by the right product mix, good share of gaming royalty revenue and very good improvements on the productivity side in terms of cost of goods sold, yield and other measures beyond yield. That helped us to end up in a good space despite the challenges we saw on the revenue side. If you look at guidance now for the third quarter, there are certain headwinds and tailwinds you have to keep in mind. I think we are going to continue to see productivity improvements, we also will see tail wind by a higher share of Trinity products getting into the market, and then we will see some headwinds. We will have lesser royalty income in the third quarter from a gaming perspective. We see additional cost in terms of having the full impact of our 28-nanometer portfolio hit us from a ramp-up perspective, and we will see some pressure from a pricing perspective in those parts of the business that Rory has been talking about, where we have to show velocity in order to move the channels. And I think this is getting us in the space that I have guided for.",216

Is this because of a shortfall in Llano sales, primarily Llano-based? And if so, what gives you confidence that the channel is going to continue to be enthusiastic for Llano when they know Trinity desktop is right around the corner? Is that really part of it, that the channel just doesn't like to be second place to the OEMs in terms of getting the new products and really just want to wait for Trinity at this point?",97

The inventory build comes really in 2 parts. We -- to be very honest, we had planned for certain inventory increase anyway in preparation for the second half. So I think about half of their -- the increase is really only attributable to the demand shortfall. And the good news is that the inventory is pretty much all current products and the part where we saw demand shortfall is pretty much driven by Llano. We feel confident and our aim, of course, is as I said before in my script that we try to manage inventory slightly quarter-over-quarter, but we have to carefully manage the transition of the new products and how the demand environment is going to change. And regarding velocity, Lisa?",152

So Llano is a good product. If you look at where we're selling, it's selling into both notebook and desktop OEMs as well as the channel. We got ourselves a bit out of position admittedly and that's a big reason for our shortfall. But when we look forward, it's really the focus on sellout velocity and getting the overall positioning correct with both the CPUs as well as the motherboards. And we think we're doing that. Trinity will also be an excellent product that will go into the channel and I think we will run with both products for some time in the channel.",113

And that's obviously impacted the PC segment. I believe we'll see forecasts from IDC and Gartner continue to be reduced in the second half. Based on that, we have to make sure that we're positioning our products properly and that we execute the plans around inventory burn off, as well as introduction of new products. So I believe that macroeconomics will cause some slowdown and obviously will make us focus on executing that business more assertively. In the desktop channel, I believe that's more around our control. I think we executed not as effectively as we could have and I believe that we did not enjoy that same uptake in that channel space.

I think we have shown a very disciplined approach over the last quarters, how we can manage our operating expenses. And this is, of course, an approach that we continue to exercise as we move forward, especially in light of a weaker demand environment. And the controls and the processes that we have put in place so far have allowed us to react fast and swift to the shortfall in demand in the second quarter. And those principles will guide us how we manage aggressively operating expenses moving forward, always keeping in mind that we protect and safeguard the investments from the roadmap perspective that secure our future. There's no doubt that we protect those investments. And we've been talking a lot in the past on the initiatives we had started that allow us to generate this productivity in order to realize those benefits.

For the third quarter, our free cash flow is going to be driven pretty much by the revenue we have seen in the prior quarter in Q2 plus the linearity we are going to experience through the course of the current quarter. We are not far enough into the quarter to see how that is developing yet. And that's why it's difficult to make a statement in that perspective. Of course, we are running at high chip. You can see that in the second quarter not only from on a cost -- from a cost perspective but also from a free cash flow perspective.

Obviously, the soft PC market that impacted processor sales, that's a market phenomena. We think that affected the market in general. I'd say that's an important factor in terms of the impact and the revenue impact late in the quarter. And then obviously, the weak sales of desktop processor in the channel, which again manifested itself first in China, late in the quarter and then it spread across the globe.

Based on my experience in the marketplace as a leader in the OEM segment, we've looked at that for a long time in my previous experience as well as in this current one. And as I look at the velocity of the business and I look at the market as it's evolving here, I think ARM in the client space will be muted for some period of time. I believe that the performance out of the x86 offerings as well as forward and backward compatibility offer an intriguing value proposition at very attractive price points.

It is not a significant portion, but it is a portion. As we look forward, the Windows introduction of tablet offers interesting opportunities as we move forward.

168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2012",2012-10-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",4432.0,367284.0,17543606.0,Presenter Speech,Rory Read,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth. Our third quarter financial performance fell significantly short of our expectations. We understand the dynamics behind the shortfall, and we are taking decisive actions to address the core issues. To help return the company to profitability, we also announced a restructuring plan designed to strengthen AMD's competitive positioning and reduce our expense structure. I will cover that plan in greater detail shortly, but first I wanted to discuss our third quarter results. 
Broader macroeconomic issues are impacting consumer PC spend. OEMs are also taking a cautious approach to managing inventory in advance of the Windows 8 launch, and tablets continue to grow as a consumer device of choice. As a result, we face a very challenging selling environment, especially in the lower end of the consumer client space. 
Yet, against this backdrop, we saw a continued consumer adoption of our Trinity APU in the quarter. Trinity notebook unit shipments increased more than 70% sequentially and accounted for nearly 1/3 of our total notebook shipments in the third quarter. Although Trinity is targeted at mainstream price points, Ultrathin notebooks featuring the low-power APU are also competing effectively at higher system price points. As a result, we believe we gained share in the $600 to $799 retail notebook price band globally in the third quarter. More than 125 AMD-based systems are expected to launch with Windows 8, including tablets and several new Ultrathins. While we look forward to the introduction of Win 8, the fourth quarter will continue to be challenging, and we do not expect PC market conditions to improve for several quarters. 
Our graphics business performed in line with our expectations. Despite market softness, we continue to see improvement in our desktop discrete channel business, and game console revenue increased. Our industry-leading graphics technologies remain a cornerstone of our end-end product strategy, and we plan to further invest in our graphics business to drive differentiation and future growth across the entire product portfolio. 
Now let's turn to the changes in the market and how they are affecting our business and the steps we are taking to address them. Shortly after joining AMD, I talked about the fundamental changes occurring in the PC industry. These trends are occurring now at an even faster rate than previously anticipated. We underestimated the speed of change in our industry, and we expected to have several years to transform the AMD business. But we must implement our transformation on a more aggressive time line. 
Here is what we will do. First, we are restructuring our business and building a more efficient operating model. This reset will put in place a business model capable of delivering consistent profitability at lower breakeven revenue points.  Second, we must diversify beyond the traditional PC market and become a leader in fast-growing and adjacent markets where we can differentiate and create leadership. 
Our restructuring will simplify our product development cycles without jeopardizing our ability to innovate or deliver products in a timely manner. We will do this primarily by building reusable IP blocks that will help lower development costs and improve our speed of execution. The restructuring plan is expected to lower our expense base by approximately 25%. This will result in an annualized cost savings of approximately $190 million. A large portion of these savings will come from a headcount reduction of approximately 15%. These are difficult but necessary steps to ensure our plan has the right scale and scope to address the market and competitive challenges we now face. 
In addition, we are resetting to a new business model designed to deliver breakeven results with approximately $1.3 billion of quarterly revenue. We expect to hit this level by the third quarter of 2013. 
As we move through 2013, we will see the results of our work with a more efficient business and a portfolio of powerful new products. There is strong customer interest in our next-generation offerings. Design win momentum is solid and we see opportunity to regain share in the 2013. We already have working silicon for many of our new 2013 products in-house, including our next-generation 28-nanometer Kabini APU, which is the successor to our highly successful Brazos platform and our first true SoC design. We are making good progress with the bring up of Kabini, which remains on track to launch in the first half of next year. 
Our long-term strategy will rebalance our business towards faster-growing segments of the market. Today, approximately 85% of our business is focused on the legacy PC portion of the market projected to have slowing growth over the next several years. We intend to drive 40% to 50% of our portfolio to faster-growth markets where our IP is the key differentiator. 
We have strong opportunities in 3 fast-growing areas.
 
First, in server. The dense cloud market is one of the fastest-growing parts of the data center market. Our long-term path to success is in providing customers with disruptive technologies and choice, just as we did when we brought 64-bit computing to the mainstream server market with AMD 64. We will look to leverage AMD's full suite of processor and graphics IP, third-party processor cores and SeaMicro's innovative supercompute fabric to deliver differentiated solutions with industry-leading performance-per-watt. 
Second, our low-power APUs, graphics IP and reusable design blocks give us a distinct advantage to build semi-custom APUs for new embedded markets. We are focused on growing our share in targeted embedded markets. These include communications, industrial and gaming, which will outpace the PC industry growth for the foreseeable future. Our semi-custom APUs already have a number of confidential high-volume design wins in place. We plan for our embedded business to comprise approximately 20% of our quarterly revenue by the fourth quarter of 2013, up from 5% today. 
And finally, as we noted earlier, we will continue to focus on driving down into the Ultraportable and ultra low-power form factors that continue to grow rapidly. APUs are ideally suited for these new products, from Ultrathins and tablets to a new breed of entry-level notebooks that will drive growth in the emerging markets. 
So in summary, we are facing the challenges in the global IT market head on. We are resetting and restructuring our business to reduce our cost base from earlier this year by 25%. We are targeting a $1.3 billion revenue breakeven point by third quarter 2013. We are also delivering powerful new APUs in 2013. And finally, we are aggressively pursuing fast-growing adjacent markets where our IP provides differentiation and the opportunity for AMD to grow share. These include dense serving, new embedded markets and new lower-power form factors. Together, these actions will return AMD to profitable growth. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Devinder, to discuss our financial results for the third quarter. Devinder is an experienced financial executive with more than 28 years of experience at AMD. He has served as the company's Corporate Controller since 2001. Devinder?",1160

Revenue for the third quarter of 2012 was $1.27 billion, down 10% sequentially, driven by an 11% decline in the Computing Solutions segment and a 7% decline in the Graphics segment revenue. Gross margin was 31%, down 15% sequentially, partially due to the $100 billion inventory write-down which adversely impacted gross margin by 8 percentage points. This write-down was the result of lower-than-anticipated future demand for certain products and mainly comprised of the first-generation A-Series APUs codenamed Llano. Third quarter gross margin was also negatively impacted by weaker-than-expected demand in the quarter, and this contributed to lower ASPs for microprocessor products as well as lower utilization of our assembly and test manufacturing facilities. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $516 million, 8% less than prior guidance, primarily due to tight spending controls and lower bonus and commission expenses. R&D was $328 million, 26% of net revenue. SG&A was $188 million, 15% of net revenue. 
Non-GAAP net loss was $150 million, and non-GAAP operating loss was $124 million, both of which include the aforementioned $100 million inventory write-down. 
Interest expense was $44 million, flat compared to the prior quarter. The tax provision for the quarter was 0 compared to a $6 million tax benefit in the prior quarter. 
Non-GAAP loss per share, including the impact of the $100 million inventory write-down, was $0.20, calculated using 745 million basic shares. 
Adjusted EBITDA was negative $35 million, down $208 million from the prior quarter due to an operating loss which resulted from lower revenue in the third quarter as well as the $100 million inventory write-down. 
Computing Solutions segment revenue was $927 million, down 11% sequentially due to lower ASPs driven primarily by weaker-than-expected demand, as well as lower unit shipments. 
Client Product revenue decline 11% sequentially due to lower unit shipments and ASPs in the third quarter, especially for desktop processors. We shipped a record number of Trinity-based products in the third quarter, and Trinity is a growing portion of our client product mix. In addition, we made substantial progress in the desktop channel, reducing Llano inventory in the third quarter. 
Our server processor revenue declined from the prior quarter, mainly due to lower unit shipments and an ongoing mix change away from higher density servers. Chipset revenue declined sequentially, primarily due to lower unit shipments in the quarter.  Computing Solutions segment operating loss was $114 million, down $196 million sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue in the quarter and the previously mentioned $100 million inventory write-down. Graphic segment revenue was $342 million, down 7% compared to the prior quarter due to lower GPU unit shipments to OEMs, partially offset by higher general sales and royalties. Game console royalty revenue was up sequentially. Graphics segment operating income was $18 million, down $13 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a decline in revenue. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term securities ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. Cash declined $279 million compared to the previous quarter, which was primarily the result of operational cash flows. Given the reduced size of our current business and OpEx reductions, we are adjusting our optimal cash balance from $1.5 billion to approximately $1.1 billion. Additional cash outflows that will occur in the fourth quarter of 2012 include a $50 million cash payment to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in the fourth quarter related to the 28-nanometer product limited waiver of exclusivity, as provided in the 2012 amendment to the Wafer Supply Agreement, with the final payment of $175 million related to the waiver to be paid by December 31, 2012. 
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.04 billion. In the third quarter, AMD repaid in full all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the company's 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2012 or approximately $499 million and issued a $500 million aggregate principal amount, 7.5% senior notes due 2022. 
Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $683 million, down $61 million compared to the end of the second quarter of 2012, due to lower revenue. Inventory was $744 million exiting the quarter, down $89 million, primarily as a result of the $100 million inventory write-down. 
Now turning to the outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2012, AMD expects revenue to decrease 9% sequentially, plus or minus 4%. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately flat sequentially. 
As Rory stated in his opening remarks, we are realigning our company with the business realities of today. We are reducing our workforce by approximately 15% in the fourth quarter and we will have a restructuring charge of approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily consisting of severance charges. Cash expenditures related to the fourth quarter restructuring will be paid almost entirely in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. 
We are taking additional actions to reduce our expense base and align our cost structure with lower anticipated revenue. Our skills and capabilities must be realigned with our market opportunities in order to position AMD to execute our strategic priorities while focusing on returning to profitability. We continue to evaluate our cost structure and anticipate restructuring actions in the first half of 2013, which will result in additional restructuring charges. However, we are currently unable to quantify these amounts. 
Finally, as part of our financial reset, the company is targeting to break even at the operating income level at $1.3 billion quarterly revenue and quarterly operating expenses of approximately $450 million by the third quarter of 2013. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?",933

We'll continue to look at that, Ross, as we go through next year and make assessments as we see the year unfold but we clearly wanted to set a breakeven point at a lower level than we've been running and to be able to consider those opportunities as we move forward in those new growth areas, which we're going to target where we see bigger growth.",133

We have taken it down to about $500 million plus. To your specific question about Q3 and Q4 being planned, they have some offsets. In particular, in the engineering earlier related to some 28-nanometer product date bounds [ph] and other R&D expenses, there were some timing between Q3 and Q4 and in particular, given the holiday season that's coming on, we have some marketing campaigns for which we can go spend some money.

And given all the recent cuts there have been at the company, that's really brought things down to some very efficient levels, it would seem. It seems now, you're going to be stuck cutting sort of more of the creative talent. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about doing both at the same time, 2 things that seem kind of contradictory?",99

And we've talked about this before in terms of creating the reusable IP blocks to create the structure in order to streamline our development and also to lower our cost of that development. We believe with the work of many talented engineers across AMD, their focus is to really streamline that activity, lower that cost and deliver our based set of offerings, and then to build off of that with our reusable IP base in order to go attack those markets. They're adjacent, JoAnne, they're not fundamentally different. These are APU graphics-oriented opportunities that allow us to take solutions like Kabini and like our APU base into those segments at a lower cost base and across the portfolio.",136

So you could you perhaps let us know what -- do you have a target for something like 20% of the business? What -- how far along are you to that 20%? How many design wins, what's the state design wins in place now that give you visibility to -- are you halfway there, 1/3 of the way there? How many more design wins do you have to get in place?

That's not true. We are not giving guidance either and that's not a statement on either profitability or gross margin.

So you've got embedded at about 5% today and in the ballpark of $1.3 billion in revenues. You think you'll be the 25% of revenues by Q4 of next year. And in Q3 of next year, you expect to be at same revenue level, about $1.3 billion. I guess that implies 2 things. One, it's a pretty big ramp of embedded over that time frame. Second, it seems like a permanent haircut to your outlook for your own PC graphics revenue. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on, I guess, the long-term outlook for your current business and the trajectory that you think you have on those embedded wins.",119

We talked about 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013. There's no doubt that the PC market trends that are obviously occurring are happening much faster than people had anticipated. And I think it's our judgment to make sure that we put in place the structure a game plan, that breakeven point that reflects our understanding of the market as we see it today. That visibility is difficult at this point and we need to see how Windows 8 rolls out, how we enter into next year. The embedded -- that's in terms of this market step down but we do see the PC market as one that will continue to be under pressure for the foreseeable next several quarters. In terms of the embedded and semi-custom space, this is obviously a key area. It's an area that leverages the graphics and the APUs and allows us to move that technology, which we invested a huge amount of effort on with the talented engineers across AMD, into an adjacent space that has a better competitor profile for us. Lisa, did you want to add anything around the semi-custom or embedded segment?",193

Q1 would typically be seasonally down and Q2, usually not much better. That implies a pretty big healthy ramp seasonally into Q3 of next year to get there. But at the same time, if you're talking about your presence in PCs, your focus PCs declining and moving toward embedded, what is actually driving that big ramp into the back half of next year to get even back to your breakeven revenue?",95

I think you're taking away from the statement on the breakeven plan that we are targeting or guiding you towards the $1.3 billion revenue plan in Q3 2013, that's not true. We are giving guidance for Q4, right, as you heard Rory talk about the challenges in the PC market and some opportunities that we are pursuing but we are not at this time, giving any guidance on revenue either for Q1 or Q2 and definitely not for Q3 of 2013. What we're talking about is an expense structure whereby at the $1.3 billion revenue level, we have an OpEx structure in place at $450 million. One is an OpEx statement and the other one is about a revenue statement in terms of what you can do to math on the gross margin. I don't think the 2 are directly linked but if you go and make some assumptions about the gross margin, you can draw your own conclusions in terms of either what the revenue levels would be or what the profitability levels would be.",181

I mean, Trinity brings some unique capability to the market but with the tough environment and maybe people who had Llano issues last year, they haven't been as fully committed as maybe, I'd like to see. When I talk to IT people at Opteron, there's a lot of excitement around the product but there's also issues of sort of is there enough OEM support. So there's not a clear line of when you're going to implement Opteron, sort of Opteron-based servers even though it's good for a lot of the workload. So my question is how does that gap get closed and is there a risk when you talk about restructuring and financial streams of cutbacks that, that situation of kind of getting that credibility gets tougher?",171

So if you look at the client or PC market, we have had actually very strong product success with Trinity, and we continue to believe that we'll see strong ramps as we go into the holiday season and into 2013. With Windows 8, we'll see over 125 systems that will come out with AMD-based processors. We do have to continue to build our execution credibility, and all of the focus is on executing both our current products as well as our 2013 products. So that is job 1 from the product side. On the Opteron side, similarly, we continue to build stronger relationships with the OEMs as well as the end customer base.

And with the market conditions, from an accounting standpoint, you also look at -- you value the inventory against the future demand and in particular, customer commitments.

But I can tell you from a Q4 standpoint at least and especially given the market conditions, there are some factors that could be positive or negative, right? You have a weak macro environment; we are in a consumer-based holiday season quarter; and then, based on low-end competition from an overall standpoint. And obviously, those are negative factors. The Trinity product, being accretive to the margin, and especially being a higher mix of the product in Q4, is going to be helpful. And then the other thing is the Win 8 launch. But beyond that, given especially the uncertainty, we are focused on our break-even model. That's why I discussed earlier $1.3 billion or the $450 million OpEx number and not looking at it from a gross margin standpoint. I can add that just to explain that further, if you take the $1.3 billion and the $450 million, if revenue is higher, then obviously we could do better than breakeven. If gross margin is higher, we could do better than breakeven, or better than the 35% that was computed earlier. And then if both are higher, we could go ahead and be better than breakeven. But we are prepared, in particular with the trending that's occurring, to assess the situation, work specifically on the cost structure.

We saw the channel stabilize in the third quarter at the 2Q levels, and we also began to work down the inventory that we discussed in that period. We saw an improvement in sales out velocity. That means the rate of sell-through, through the channel. And we're going to continue to work on improving that sell-through rate and reducing that inventory in the coming quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, that was a multi-quarter effort to go forward. But the progress and the stabilization of the channel in 3Q was a good step forward.",96

And these trends are definitely occurring at a faster rate than the industry had anticipated. You're right to note that the macro environment is soft, and it's different across different geographies. And our weakness is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. We also saw OEMs in the market take a rather conservative approach to inventory in the lead-up to Windows 8. This will be an interesting fourth quarter in terms of how Windows 8 moves forward. We think it's an interesting and important event, but this is one we need to see play out. And clearly, tablets have taken an important point in the consumer's mindset both in the experience that a tablets creates, but also becoming an interesting device of choice at that lower end of the consumer client space. I think all 3 of these factors have accelerated this fundamental shift in the PC market, and we expect this shift and these pressures to continue for the next several quarters.",188

I do believe the PC market is a market that will be here for the next decade. I don't think there's any question about that. But the dynamics of it and its growth rate are really fundamentally shifting right now. A lot of the historical forecasts and trend lines have broken over the past 2 quarters, and we need to see this reset stabilize and move forward. I think what's most important is to innovate, to continue to create solutions that match the customers' and the commercial market's needs. All-day battery life, touch, the right kinds of experiences with the graphical capabilities that we deliver are all important in this segment. I think that's key. And at the same time, while this is somewhat unpredictable, let's take our outstanding IP and engineering resources and focus those on areas we know will continue to grow and grow faster than the legacy PC market. That's core to our strategy moving forward, and we need to accelerate that strategy based on these shifting trends.",181

Clearly in this tactical time frame, continue to build on the semi-custom embedded market. There's a good opportunity. It's where our IP and APUs play well. It's near adjacent segments. So it's easy to move there. And I like the competitive market there much better than the PC market, which is dominated by a single player in a big way. I think also as we move forward, there's opportunities in dense serving. That market will continue to evolve as low power and cloud serving becomes even more prevalent. This will be the fastest-growing segment going forward, and I think that SeaMicro acquisition and the work Lisa and her team are doing to build that out will occur over the next 1, 2, 3 years. And at the same time, how do we take our deep engineering capability into the new, low-power, ultra-portable emerging form factors in the traditional client space? This is an opportunity that is already presenting itself with our next-generation APU called Kabini, replacing our highly successful Brazos. And we'll follow that on with a series of other solutions.

And therefore, that will help the cash flow. On the guidance for 2013, we're not prepared to talk about it right now because of a lot of open items that we need to go through, in particular as I talked about the WSA discussions that are going on.

And what we disclosed is the total cost of that will be $1.5 billion. We had paid approximately $1 billion of that. So $0.5 billion remain. But the question is the time period at which we take those wafers, which is the basis of the discussions we continue to have with our partners. So I think you have to look at it in terms of the remaining 2012 take or pay, and there's $0.5 million -- $0.5 billion left, and what time frame is the -- are the wafers going to be taken and what time frame the cash is going to go out, if that's what you're asking.

I think most likely, if you come back in about a quarter in the call that we have for the Q4 result, we could probably give you some visibility into the early part of 2013 and then give you the guidance from that standpoint.",58

Maybe, Rory, one for you. What's going on, on the discrete graphics side? And maybe you have had a strong product with the Kepler architecture for a few quarters. Is that a segment you think would be de-emphasized going forward? Or is that still a priority business for you?",51

But I think Lisa probably is the best person to take that question.",49

The Graphics business is actually a fairly stable portion of our portfolio. We continue to believe it's one of our key differentiators. In the third quarter, we had the macro effects that affected the PC industry that also affected Graphics, but we actually grew quarter-to-quarter in the discrete AIB channels. So I think we believe that our products are quite competitive, and we'll continue to invest in the graphics area to ensure that competitiveness.",85

And then one last one. Rory, in case things stay soft in the PC area next year, are there other -- is there a plan B? Are there other partnership or M&A arrangements that you can pursue or you can think about? Because I think that's really the focus of a lot of these questions on the call, because the PC market is slowing substantially and you have a very large competitor with very significant competitive advantages. So beyond just  breaking even, how do you position AMD and how do you reward shareholders going forward?",97

There's 2 steps that we need to take care. One, restructure and reset AMD, reduce our cost structure and improve our efficiency by lowering our break-even point on lower revenue. And as we've talked about several times in the call, we'll continue to assess that as the market unfolds. And then second, take our IP and our differentiation in Graphics and across our engineering portfolio, and take them to the high-growth segments. We talked about driving over the next several years 40% to 50% of our portfolio on those growth segments. We have planned this strategy. What we've seen now with the trends accelerating, that we need to move in a more aggressive path to tackle that now, both in the high-growth, ultra-low-power new clients, the dense server space and then, of course, in the embedded semi-custom space, all around the capabilities in IP that we have in AMD.",158

First question, I'm trying to understand this reusable IP strategy. When I think about what that means from a P&L point of view, I just think of it as a shift of OpEx into COGS because I just -- if you're going to cut staff, you're going to have compromises in terms of the IP blocks you can develop. And as a result, you're going to have some give-ups in die size, especially as you try to recover for some of the lost performance for those compromises that you're making. Can you help me understand if I'm thinking about that correctly or if I'm missing something?",113

I think what we mean by reusable IPs is really getting to a much more System-On-Chip infrastructure so that we're able to spin products faster as well as customize them for their various markets. So I wouldn't see it as a shift from R&D to COGS, but more as building a foundation so that we can move quickly into new markets as they developed. And that's a very key thing for us. And we still will invest very heavily in our differentiating IP, such as the graphics IP that we talked about as well as our microprocessor IP. So that part doesn't change.",110

And you have differentiating graphics. Yet, when we look at the third-party market research data, you're not getting paid for it, at least when we look at what was done with Llano. I'm trying to understand if there's something we're missing in terms of maybe you are starting to get some of that uplift on Trinity and you'll get more with Kaveri. Or is there perhaps a basis for rethinking your strategy and focusing a set of higher-performance GPUs on smaller die sizes that could get your gross margin back to the mid to upper 40s where it's been your goal?",115

Now we are very clear that the APU strategy is the right strategy for us. Now in terms of ensuring that we get the value for it, it's not just a piece of silicon, but it's also what we can do in the solutions environment. So we have been doing a lot of work to ensure that the applications can take advantage of all of the compute that we have on the silicon. And you can see that with some of the moves that we've made with the Heterogeneous Systems Architecture, creating industry consortium around the heterogeneous compute. And we've had a number of new members. We talked about QUALCOMM and Samsung joining as well as ARM and Imagination. So I think it's evolution over time. But it's clear that the APU strategy is the right strategy, and we need to get more of the applications taking advantage of the APUs over time.",165

Is there channel inventory declines baked in? And where is kind of a bottom for this business as you're down 35% year-over-year?",46

That is also continuing to work off that inventory that I talked about in the previous earnings call. That was down -- a down channel from a sellout perspective, and we're going to continue to work that. I think we're making good progress there. In the overall PC market, there's no doubt that these trends have occurred. They've accelerated. And we believe they will affect the market for the next several quarters for the foreseeable future. We're taking clear and decisive action to restructure our business, lower our cost structure to enable us to hit breakeven at a lower revenue base, which we think is prudent given the market trend.",140
