168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3422.0,747315.0,32752919.0,Presenter Speech,Lisa Su,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. In the fourth quarter, we made good progress diversifying our business into new markets, ramping PC and embedded design wins with key customers and improving our overall balance sheet. This progress was offset by ongoing weakness in our PC business due to higher-than-optimal desktop and AIB inventory levels in the channel and our overconcentration in consumer PCs.
The Computing and Graphics segment revenue decreased 15% sequentially, largely driven by weak channel sales. We took some key actions in the fourth quarter to reposition our product stack and reduce downstream desktop and AIB channel inventory. While these corrective actions are resulting in short-term pressure in the business, they are integral to building a stronger and more profitable business going forward.
We did have some success in the quarter continuing to reshape our OEM business. We drove a richer mix of higher-end products, expanded our presence in the commercial market and increased adoption of our discrete graphics solutions. Mobile APU unit shipments, ASPs and revenue all increased sequentially as our higher-end A8 and A10 APU shipments increased. We also achieved strong double-digit percentage revenue growth for notebook GPUs in the quarter as strategic wins like Apple's iMac with Retina 5K display began to ramp.
We clearly have more work to do to improve the overall revenue and financial performance of this segment. We must apply the same rigor and discipline that led to the improvement in our OEM business to stabilize and then grow our channel. I am confident we are taking the right actions to return this segment to a healthy trajectory starting in the second quarter.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. As expected, semi-custom unit shipments decreased sequentially as we supplied a significant amount of product to Microsoft and Sony in the third quarter as they ramped to support the holiday demand spike. We are pleased with the full year performance of the Semi-Custom business and the strong sell-through reported by our customers. Nearly 30 million Sony and Microsoft consoles have now shipped. Our semi-custom unit shipments more than doubled in 2014, which fueled excellent full year performance for this part of our business.
Embedded processor revenues also increased for the third straight quarter as we continued to successfully execute our strategy to gain share in targeted vertical markets where our high-performance CPU and GPU IP are differentiated. In target markets such as network storage, avionics and medical devices, we had several customers launch new AMD Embedded powered solutions that take advantage of our higher-performance CPU and GPU IP, including Airbus, QNAP and Analogic. 
Our work to lead the industry's transition to 64-bit ARM also gained momentum in the quarter. We have secured multiple design wins for our upcoming Opteron A-series, and the first systems are expected to launch later this year. 
Taking a step back and looking at our annual 2014 performance, it is clear we made progress across a number of strategic fronts. Annual revenue grew for the first time since 2011. Annual EESC segment revenue increased by 50%, growing to a $2.4 billion business with strong momentum and pipeline. We ended the year with more than $1 billion in cash and making significant progress reprofiling our debt. And most importantly, we delivered full year non-GAAP profitability and continued to build a good foundation for future long-term profitable growth as we invest in the innovations to drive future success.
In my 100 days as AMD's CEO, I've had the opportunity to spend significant time with our customers, partners and employees. The consistent theme is that AMD is at our best when we are delivering differentiated technology and innovation to our customers. There are clearly significant opportunities for us to accomplish this, both in our traditional PC business as well as in new growth markets. But we must think differently in 2015 about our market approach and investment priorities.
First, we see a path to reversing the declines in our PC business. The PC market is expected to stabilize with low single-digit percentage decline in 2015. We have rightsized our investments in this business and taken actions to reduce our downstream channel inventory in the fourth quarter. We will continue these corrective actions into the first quarter to aim for a return to growth starting in the second quarter. We are correcting the inventory position quickly, which is contributing to our revenue guidance in the first quarter. We believe this will position us well when we begin to ramp new products later this year.
We plan to introduce a strong 2015 product portfolio, punctuated by the launch of Carrizo in the second quarter. Consumer and commercial design win momentum for Carrizo continued to gain momentum because it will deliver the largest-ever generational leap in performance per watt for our mainstream APUs. Carrizo is a good example of how the innovations we are making at the chip and system level through differentiated design capabilities translate into meaningful improvements to the user experience and battery life. 
Second, we will increase our R&D investments in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom. AMD is the only company in the industry that can offer a full continuum of high-performance standard and custom solutions, spanning both the ARM and x86 ecosystems, and we must leverage this position to drive differentiated and innovative solutions for our customers. Our server partners have increasingly told us they want to see AMD playing a much larger part in this business. Although the server design cycle is longer, this is an important vector for long-term revenue and margin expansion, and we are designing new x86 and ARM-based leadership products for this space, powered by our next-generation ARM and x86 cores.
Our third priority will be to continue diversifying our revenue base and growing in new markets. We saw a good momentum with significant revenue and design win growth in 2014 across all of our new businesses. For instance, embedded and professional graphics revenue both increased by more than 20% in 2014. We have a robust pipeline in these businesses as well as with our semi-custom engagements, and we will continue that focus through 2015.
In summary, I am optimistic about our long-term opportunities but realistic about our short-term challenges. In the near term, we will take significant steps to normalize our business as we sharpen our focus on our key priorities of building great products, deepening our customer relationships and simplifying our business. Longer term, we have a tremendous opportunity to apply our technology and IP to differentiate and innovate with our customers and further strengthen our financial foundation and performance.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter financial performance and first quarter guidance. Devinder?",1130
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q4 2014 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2015",2015-01-20,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3422.0,747315.0,32752920.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2014, we improved our non-GAAP financial performance and met the financial goals we laid out at the beginning of the year despite continued weakness in our Computing and Graphics business. Specifically, we've continued to transform and position ourselves for long-term growth, and we delivered our first full year of non-GAAP profitability since 2011. We grew revenue 4% to $5.5 billion for the year and further diversified our business as we completed the first full year of our semi-custom game console shipments and derived approximately 40% of revenues in 2014 from high-growth adjacent markets.
Specifically in 2014, we also reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 11% from the prior year while investing in our new products in support of our ARM and x86 strategy and growth areas; continued our focus on financial performance and reported non-GAAP net income in every quarter during 2014; delivered positive free cash flow for 2014, excluding the special payment of $200 million made to GLOBALFOUNDRIES early in 2014 related to the 2012 WSA amendment; maintained a strong balance sheet, ending the year with over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; and finally, we made significant progress in reprofiling our term debt, pushing out the majority of term debt maturities to 2019 and beyond while also decreasing our interest expense run rate year-over-year.
Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter where I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. Revenue was $1.24 billion, down 13% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower desktop processor, GPU and semi-custom SoC sales. 
Gross margin was 34%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. As a reminder, third quarter gross margin of 35% included a $27 million or 2 percentage point benefit from revenue related to technology licensing.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $382 million, down $46 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to reduced employee bonuses, restructuring actions and ongoing expense controls.
Operating income was $36 million, and net income was $2 million, with breakeven earnings per share calculated using 781 million diluted shares.
During the fourth quarter, we had a number of accounting items that I'd like to address. As part of our annual review of goodwill and primarily due to the decline in AMD's stock price, we determined that the total noncash $233 million carrying value of goodwill related to our Computing and Graphics business was impaired. 
We also had a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $58 million in the quarter related to our second-generation APU products. We expect to sell this inventory over the next several quarters, and this adjustment aligns the carrying value of the inventory with market pricing. 
Lastly, we had restructuring and other special charges amounting to $71 million, of which $59 million is expected to be paid in cash. This primarily includes the previously disclosed $57 million of restructuring and $10 million related to our former CEO's departure. 
The aforementioned accounting items I excluded from our segment results and I included in the All Other category. They are also excluded from our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share computation.
Net interest expense, taxes and other income was $34 million in the quarter, down from $46 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the benefit of term debt repurchases of $75 million in the fourth quarter, interest rate swap transactions executed in the third quarter and a tax credit of $3 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was $96 million, down $37 million from the prior quarter. And for 2014, adjusted EBITDA was $505 million.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $662 million, down 15% sequentially, primarily due to lower desktop processor and GPU sales. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $56 million compared to a $17 million loss in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower channel sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $577 million, down 11% from the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease in sales of our semi-custom SoCs. And the operating income of this segment was $109 million, essentially flat from the prior quarter, driven by lower semi-custom product sales, offset by higher royalties.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaled $1.04 billion at the end of the quarter, up $102 million from the prior quarter. Inventory was $685 million, down $212 million from the prior quarter, including the impact of the lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. Excluding that adjustment, inventory was down 17% quarter-on-quarter. 
Our total purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 2014 were approximately $1 billion, lower than the previously estimated $1.2 billion, due to lower fourth quarter purchases. The fourth amendment to the WSA is complete with no associated special payments or penalties. We are currently negotiating our 2015 WSA amendment, in line with our business expectations. 
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased an aggregate amount of $75 million of 2020 and 2022 term debt in the open market, paying approximately 96 cents on the dollar and funded these with our asset-backed line of credit, which carries a significantly lower interest rate.
Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $94 million, an improvement of $105 million from the third quarter of 2014.
Before turning to the outlook, let me highlight that as of the first quarter of 2015, in line with many of our technology peers and more reflective of our ongoing operations, we will be excluding approximately $20 million per quarter of employee-related stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial results.
As outlook for the first quarter of 2015, AMD expects revenue to decrease 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 34%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $350 million, excluding approximately $20 million of stock-based compensation as per our revised non-GAAP definition; interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $48 million; and inventories expected to be essentially flat from fourth quarter levels.
As outlook for the full year 2015, we expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis; non-GAAP operating expenses to be between approximately $340 million to $370 million per quarter, in line with expected revenue profile; taxes of approximately $3 million per quarter; cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances to be in the optimal zone of $1 billion; capital expenditures of approximately $100 million; and inventory to be approximately flat year-over-year.
In closing, as we begin a new year, we look forward to overcoming our short-term challenges by stabilizing our Computing and Graphics segment and continuing to improve long-term financial performance by diversifying our business and driving toward profitability while maintaining a healthy balance sheet.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth?",1144

How much of the revenue decline is due to continued channel inventory work-downs in your Computing and Graphics segment versus continued game console seasonality in your Embedded and Semi-Custom segments? What I'm trying to figure out is if both segments are going to be down double digits sequentially or is one going to drive more declines than the other.",80

So thanks for the question. Let me give you some color on that. So if you take typical PC seasonality would be about minus 7% or so, and typical game console seasonality is probably a little bit more than that. What we said in the prepared remarks is that we are taking an opportunity to correct the channel inventory in Computing and Graphics. So overall, down minus 15%, that is more heavily weighted towards Computing and Graphics than towards Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom.",85

So if you look at the overall Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business, it was very good for us in 2014. I'm actually quite pleased with the progress. Certainly, the majority of that was the semi-custom or game console unit shipments, which increased significantly. We did also see, as we said, improvements in the Embedded business, and that grew over 20%. As we go into 2015, it's a little bit early for full year guidance. But I think we would say that we would expect Embedded to continue to grow. I think on Semi-Custom, we believe that units will grow as they typically do in the third year of the console ramp, and exactly what that will amount to will depend on how the market behaves in 2015.",128

Obviously, you have the numbers in terms of our guidance for Q1 2015. But you do want to take into consideration how one change that I highlighted in the prepared remarks in terms of the OpEx guidance that I gave, that on a non-GAAP basis, we are excluding the noncash stock comp expense from the guidance for the OpEx. And that's running about $20 million per quarter for stock comp expenses overall, so about $80 million for the year. But I think the rest of it, from an overall standpoint, we're not giving, other than what I have given for 2015, color on the non-GAAP profitability from where I sit right now with the continued control of expenses and the gross margin, obviously, in Q1 at 34%. I will give color more about 2015 as we get through Q1 and into Q2.

Let me try to answer that and give you color on the various segments. So as I mentioned, in our MNC business, we've really made nice progress overall in terms of improving our mix, improving our design wins, especially going into the second quarter and the second half of the year with our new product launches. I think we feel very good about where we're positioned there. Commercial will definitely be important as well as improving our overall mix. And then relative from Q1 to Q2, I think the largest improvement will be around the channel health. We have had this channel problem for a couple of quarters, and it's important for us to correct that. As we look at the downstream channel, we definitely reduced some inventory in Q4, and we will take significant action to reduce that inventory in Q1. And that will give us an opportunity to return to a more normal desktop channel business, which has been relatively successful for us in the past.",170

Is it from a -- is it more ARM or x86-based and how your design teams are set up to address the challenges, given your history in the server business in the past.",79

So there's no secret that we've lost a lot of market share in the server business. But if you look at fundamentally what's important to those server customers, it is about knowledge of the enterprise. It is about high-performance compute capability, reliability, all the system capability. And those are things that AMD can -- is uniquely very capable of. So when we look at ARM and x86, I would say the majority of the market will still be x86 for quite some time because of all of the legacy applications that exist. ARM offers a new opportunity in some of the dense server markets. And so we continue to look at that as a growth opportunity where new business will grow. So it's really, I would say, separate parts of the market. I think where we add value is that we're able to look at that in totality and optimize the server ecosystem for that.",157

It is about $20 million of noncash stock comp expenses, very much in line with a lot of our technology peers on a kind of more comparative basis. So I think when you look at the OpEx guidance, for example, that we are providing in Q4, that excludes, excludes, the stock comp expense of about $20 million. And that's noncash. It will show up from a segment reporting standpoint in our All Other category, very consistent, like I said, with several of our other technology peers.",92

And you've mentioned for the last couple of quarters this inventory compression. Is there a demand aspect to this as well? Do you think you're losing share in the channel versus just an inventory correction in the channel?,63

We don't talk about sort of the exact split between our channel and our MNC business. It's fair to say our MNC business is larger, though. So what we ship into our OEM customers is larger than the channel business. Relative to the inventory versus demand, I think the desktop channel is an area where if you look at it, it's heavily concentrated in China and has had more impact on some of the dynamics in China, especially as you look at the entry-level part of the business. I will say, though, that as we look at it overall, I think the channel will still be a very good business for us going forward. It's just we need to correct the inventory levels. In the AIB business or the graphics channel, it's a little bit more complicated than that. In the first half of the year, we had -- first half of 2014, we had actually an unusually strong AIB channel because of the Bitcoin effect, and then we needed to correct some of that. There are some competitive dynamics in the graphics AIB channel as well. I think from where I see it going forward, we are very focused on correcting the channel and normalizing that business. I think we have some good products that are coming out for it. So I do see opportunities for a return to a more healthy channel business going forward.",239

I'm just kind of curious, is the goal here to try to operate the business at kind of a non-GAAP breakeven level? And if we do get revenue upside, will you just let that drop through to OpEx? And to kind of ask just a broader question, how do you think about prioritizing spending as you try to maintain non-GAAP breakeven? Is that even the right goal to think about, given that you already have $1 billion of kind of released gross cash on the balance sheet? Are you underinvesting in certain areas right now to try to maintain that non-GAAP breakeven?",126

I think overall, when you look at it from an overall standpoint, we've been very disciplined from an OpEx standpoint. But the question that always comes up internally, and Lisa obviously and Mark Papermaster watch that very carefully in terms of making sure that we continue to invest in the R&D area, especially for the products and the technology and all of the future stuff that we are doing. But John, you are right. We do want to manage from a viewpoint of overall cash and the P&L. That's important. The breakeven P&L has come down significantly as we have managed the OpEx. But the R&D investments, especially with the road map that we are projecting for 2015 and 2016, continue. And you're also right, from an OpEx standpoint getting down to the, call it, $350 million level that we are guiding to for Q1, that would go up within the range of the $340 million, $370 million, depending on the revenue profile. And obviously, my desire is to drop that as much as possible to the bottom line as long as we continue to invest in the R&D areas. But I'll let Lisa comment for the R&D investments.",222

So the way I would answer it is something like this. Certainly, we strive to do better than non-GAAP breakeven on a medium-term basis. However, when I look at the OpEx and what we're trying to drive, it is really important for us to make the right technology investments and invest in the products that are going to fuel long-term growth. So we made some decisions. In the fourth quarter, we announced some restructuring actions. I think those were the right set of actions because they were really around streamlining our business and making sure that we were making some priority calls in places. As I look forward, Q4, Q1, we've talked about lower-than-expected revenue due to some of the channel issues. As we go into Q2 and beyond, we're really focused on growth. And it's really all about the products and customers and getting our products out into the marketplace. So, that's really my focus.",158

Devinder, the $212 million payable to GLOBALFOUNDRIES, that will be paid in Q1. So that will bring cash down to the $800 million or so.

Call it in the first quarter of 2015 is when that cash will be paid. But from a purchases standpoint, the way it works in WSA, the wafers get delivered. And like I said, against the $1.2 billion that we expected when we closed the 2014 WSA, we purchased $1 billion worth of wafers. As we ended 2014, we made a mutual decision to reduce the supply and purchases based on market conditions, and the 2014 WSA is complete. We are in discussions about the 2015 WSA. The supply continues based on the good relationship we have with our partner. There is no issue there, but we are working out the details to fully finalize and sign the 2015 WSA.",166

No, I understand. I understand the question. I think you are saying, ""Okay, you got money due to GLOBALFOUNDRIES."" But I have other accounts payables and accounts receivable due, too. So net-net, the goal is to manage our cash balances in the optimal zone of $1 billion. So from my standpoint, as we end Q1 when we're sitting here in April talking about the Q1 cash balances, I expect to be in the optimal zone of $1 billion. And Vivek, you have seen that over the last many, many quarters, despite some challenges off and on, we've been able to manage the cash pretty well in the optimal zone and well above the target minimum of $600 million.",119

And then maybe for Lisa, as you mentioned that game console units could grow somewhat this year, I'm interested in understanding what happens to your ASPs now that you're in the third year of launch.

And just one last thing, to look at the bigger picture here, Lisa, you're doing a very good job managing costs, and AMD has always had good technology. But I'm trying to understand how you get out of this perennial restructuring mode and start growing again. Because it appears to me that all the benefits of all the pipeline you're building in Semi-Custom continued to be offset by some of the pressures on the traditional PC and the GPU market. Is it that you expect those traditional markets to start recovering? Or do you think we might be underestimating the benefits that you might get on the Semi-Custom side?",111

So Vivek, I mean, if I just take a step back and just talk about what we're trying to do overall in our strategy, we really are a technology company. It's all about our IP and our products and what we put into the marketplace. If you look at our 2 businesses, I think we've shown that we can grow a business. The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom growth, very, very nice growth, very predictable, profitable. I'm confident that's on the right track, in terms of what we're going to do across those market segments. I will say, if anything, we want to make some bolder technology bets in that area to fuel that growth. And then on a Computing and Graphics business, I do believe that we will stabilize this business. I mean, the last couple of years have been difficult, some relative to market conditions, some relative to things that we could have done better. But overall, it's 300 million units. That's a big market. And so most every customer would agree that AMD can add value in that space. And we're focused on making sure that our products really add value to that ecosystem.",197

I think with desktop, it's more end demand relative to China, and perhaps we were a little bit long on inventory earlier in the year. I think in the graphics channel, again, I said it was a bit volatile in the first half of the year.

So we have Seattle actually sampled in a number of different customers and ecosystem partners. I think with the -- the good news is that the ecosystem is designing on AMD silicon. So I think that's good. Relative to the overall ramp, we always thought of this as a slow ramp. And so we'll see production shipments in 2015.

On the OpEx side, obviously, with the decline in the business and, in particular, with the guidance we provided on Q1 here, the OpEx has come down, as you observed. And I would say 2 things. Lisa said in the prepared remarks that we are investing on the R&D side for the Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom business. With the things that we talked about on Embedded, it's growing pretty nicely. The Enterprise side, on the server piece, we need to make the investments for the customers so that we can return a higher market share from an overall standpoint. And then the Semi-Custom side, in addition to the design wins that we have, we have a healthy pipeline, and we want to continue to grow that business. So I think overall, when you look at the OpEx side of the house, it is probably true that on the CG side is where the expenses are coming down more than probably in the Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom. But overall, we are managing the OpEx in line with revenue while protecting the investments on the R&D.",185

So on the channel, I mean, I think in general, it's much better to keep supply sort of in line with demand. And certainly, that will be important for us going forward. Secondly, the sell-through velocity, I think, will be modulated by our products. And as we put new products into the channel over the next couple of quarters, I think that will increase sell-through velocity. I did mention China as one of the areas where we have to just see how that develops and how the DIY market, in particular, develops.

You indicated 30 million shipments this year. And if I go back historically when these gaming consoles are launched, I think the first year sales were roughly between 15 million and 20 million. My question is it seems like these higher sales could be because of expanded availability in different regions. And as you look into next year, what gives you confidence that you could grow this in terms of units or in terms of your revenue into '15? And then I have a follow-up.",91

So Sanjay, let me just clarify. In terms of the unit shipments, those are unit shipments from our customers to end users. And that's -- most of that is publicly available data from what Sony and Microsoft have published. So relative to historical, I think most people will say that, historically, the game console shipments in this generation are higher than in the previous generation. And you can come up with all kinds of reasons for that. Some of that is sort of the price points that they've chosen. I think that certainly helped the holiday season. Some of that is the software titles that are available at a given point in time. I think the main thing is, as we look at any holiday season, we want to make sure that there's not a lot of inventory that's sitting with our customers. And we see that, that's very -- fairly well-balanced. And so that gives us confidence as we go into 2015 and you see new titles that are launched and those come out, that it should be a fairly normal market.",184

It seems like sales declined 30% sequentially and kind of declining at a similar level. I agree, you indicated inventory is a factor here. But key question is that with the -- you're not saying that the demand decline was because of a road map issue or a vacuum in the product stack. Going forward, given that this has declined so much, do you have enough OEM support to carry these desktop SKUs with OEM? Or would OEM ask you to burden a greater portion of the R&D costs associated in carrying these SKUs? Because this has really become a very -- the scale of this business has become really small. And so the question essentially is, what kind of challenges do you see when you have the right product to revive the desktop market?",140

So the way I would say it is something like this. It's clear that our mobile products are very competitive. We've invested heavily in mobile, and you see that with some of the successes that we've had. Relative to desktop, mobile and desktop actually share a lot of technology. So certainly, there's a lot of sharing there in terms of the cores and the IP and the designs. There are things that we will do to improve the competitiveness of our desktop products as we go forward. And so again, I view it as a market that we know well. And within the spend envelope that we've already defined, we will continue to compete in both the desktop and mobile markets.",122

So relative to the channel inventory, it is primarily consumer, and it's primarily the -- as I said, the DIY channel that we're highlighting. Relative to Enterprise, I think our progress in Enterprise is less due to the overall market and more due to just having products that are more capable in the Enterprise. If you think about how our products have evolved from, let's call it, fairly low-end to now, as we get to our higher-end products, they're very competitive.

I think we have a good path. Some of it will depend on what the market does with game consoles, and we'll just have to see how that develops over time. I think on the Computing and Graphics business, we can improve our execution. And there is a lot of focus, at least from my standpoint, to ensure that our 2015 product launches are quite strong.

In terms of the strategy for the PC market, both processors and APUs, can you help me better understand a little bit more of how we should think about growth over the course of this year? When we look at your new products such as Carrizo, even though it's 1 processor node [ph] behind your main competitor, you guys are definitely driving in the value and pulling on the traditional technology levers. But in terms of consumer marketing and even enterprise corporate to a certain degree, your main competitor there is pushing new form factors, fanless designs as well as kind of new user interface technologies, such as 3D cameras, to help kickstart interest there and continue growing, what gives you the confidence or do you have any metrics that can help us match up the new technologies you're driving in the market this year with growth either in the consumer market and/or corporate?",162

So for the Computing and Graphics business, I think the most important thing for us to do is to continue the work that we've done on selling up our stack and improving our mix. And we've demonstrated that in 2014 with our OEM customers. As we go into the new product cycle for both consumer and commercial, there are some key feature sets that we will offer. I think you'll find that although we are in 28-nanometer technology, the performance and the battery life as well as some of the features will be quite differentiated, especially around video and some of these multimedia applications. And then as you look in commercial, I think we're quite underrepresented today. And so it is an opportunity to grow just based on the design wins that we have seen and the form factors that we will be in, in 2015 that we were not in, in 2014. So we certainly have to demonstrate that over the next couple of quarters, but we're doing all the key things to make sure that we get these products further into the market.",186

Under the backdrop of a weaker-than-expected PC market, our first quarter results demonstrate that we continue making progress in some areas of our business but still have work to do to improve our overall financial performance.
First quarter revenue of $1.03 billion decreased 17% sequentially, primarily due to reduced client and graphics product sales and a seasonal decrease in semi-custom System-on-Chip sales. In our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue decreased 20% sequentially in what was a challenging market environment compounded by currency issues. We saw OEM demand in the quarter below seasonal expectations as our customers actively managed inventory levels amid uncertain end user demand. We also reduced downstream channel inventory levels and remain on track to return to normal inventory levels by the end of the second quarter.
As a result of soft PC demand and our work to rebalance our channel inventory, desktop processor and GPU revenue decreased significantly from the year-ago period. On the positive side, we did see progress in several of our strategic initiatives. Mobile APU ASPs and revenue increased from the year-ago period, highlighted by increases in commercial client APU shipments and revenue from the fourth quarter, setting a record for commercial client processor sales.
Our focused customer client strategy is gaining momentum, and our investments are driving awareness and generating pull with commercial and government buyers. We delivered record FirePro server unit shipments in the quarter, driven by enterprise wins and AMD Professional GPUs now being offered in the world's highest volume server, HP's DL380.
We also successfully passed several key milestones in the quarter as we prepared for the introduction of our new 2015 APU and GPU products, including first revenue shipments of our next-generation Carrizo family of notebook APUs in advance of system launches planned for the second quarter.
Carrizo is a standout product that delivers better graphics performance than competitive offerings as well as all-day battery life, driven by the largest generational performance per watt improvement we have ever delivered with our mainstream APUs.
Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue declined 14% sequentially, largely driven by lower game console royalties and a seasonal decrease in semi-custom SoC console sales. Embedded processor sales were roughly flat from the year-ago period, with weaker-than-expected thin client demand offset by continued adoption of our embedded APUs across targeted market segments.
Samsung introduced a new AMD-powered digital sonic solution, and both Fujitsu and GE Intelligent Platforms released new industrial computing boards powered by AMD embedded SoCs in the quarter.
At the corporate level, we continue aligning larger portions of our R&D investments to take advantage of long-term growth of opportunities across our EESC segment. As we prioritize our R&D investments and simplify our business, we made the decision in the first quarter to exit the dense server systems business as we increased investments in our server processor development.
We retained the fabric technology as a part of our overall IP portfolio. We see very strong opportunities for next-generation high-performance x86 and ARM processors for the enterprise, data center and infrastructure markets, and we will continue to invest strongly in these areas.
Looking forward in the year, given the ongoing macroeconomic and currency uncertainties, it is hard to predict when the PC environment will normalize. We expect that the overall PC market will remain a challenge as our OEM customers and channel partners focus on carrying lean inventories based on the uncertain market conditions.
However, we are preparing for a better second half of the year with Windows 10 and our new product offerings as catalysts for the business. Regardless of market conditions, we are taking important steps to improve our CG business by completing our channel inventory rebalancing, introducing strong new APU and graphics products and continuing to grow commercial client sales.
I remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities but realistic that the next several quarters will be challenging due to the market environment. Our strategy to improve our financial performance is to focus on our strengths by continuing the investments in the technology and IP that will drive product innovation and differentiation.
I look forward to talking in more detail about our long-term strategy and growth opportunities at our Financial Analyst Day in May, and I hope many of you on the call would join us for that event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?",753

Q1 was a challenging quarter with disappointing financial results as we faced a weaker-than-expected PC environment. We made good progress on rebalancing the channel inventory and took actions to further streamline our focus on the opportunities for long-term growth.
Let me move to the specifics of the quarter, where I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. Revenue was $1.03 billion, down 17% sequentially, driven primarily by lower sales of our client and graphics processor products and seasonally lower semi-custom sales. The year-over-year decline of 26% was driven primarily by decreased client and graphics sales. Gross margin was 32%, down 2 percentage points from the prior quarter, primarily due to product mix and lower game console royalties in the first quarter.
Operating expenses in the first quarter were $357 million, down $9 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to lower sales and marketing spending in line with the lower revenue in the quarter. Operating loss was $30 million and net loss was $73 million or $0.09 per share, calculated using 777 million shares.
Our first quarter results include restructuring and other special charges amounting to $87 million, of which $75 million are charges related to the exiting of the dense server systems business, and another $12 million was related to facilities activities and severance charges under the fourth quarter 2014 restructuring plan. All but $16 million of these charges are noncash. These charges are excluded from our segment results and are included in the All Other category. They are also excluded from our first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share calculation.
Net interest expense, taxes and other income was $43 million in the quarter, up from $34 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to a nonrecurring tax credit and gain on debt repurchases in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, down from $96 million in the prior quarter, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $379 million.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $532 million, down 20% sequentially, primarily due to decreased desktop and netbook revenue. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $75 million compared to a $56 million loss in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower desktop and notebook processor sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $498 million, down 14% from the prior quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower sales of our semi-custom SoCs. And the operating income of this segment was $45 million, down from $109 million in the prior quarter, driven by lower semi-custom SoC revenue, lower game console royalties and product mix. As planned, R&D investments in the Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom segment increased sequentially as we invest for more growth in this segment.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaled $906 million at the end of the quarter, down $134 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales and debt interest payments in the quarter. Inventory was $688 million, essentially flat from the prior quarter.
We entered into a fifth amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Under the terms of the agreement, we expect to purchase approximately $1 billion of wafers in 2015 on a take-or-pay basis. In the first quarter, we spent $161 million on wafer purchases with GLOBALFOUNDRIES.
Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.27 billion. Separately, we have amended and restated our $500 million asset-backed credit facility with more favorable terms. As we have indicated in the past, this ABL affords us with additional financial flexibility as and when needed. Free cash flow in the first quarter was negative $195 million.
Now turning to the outlook. For the second quarter of 2015, AMD expects revenue to decrease 3% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 32%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $355 million as we continue to invest in new products; interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $45 million; and inventory is expected to be approximately up $100 million from first quarter levels in support of second half semi-custom product revenue and the ramp of new products.
For the full year 2015, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between approximately $340 million and $370 million per quarter, in line with expected revenue profile; taxes of approximately $3 million per quarter; cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances to be within a range of $600 million to $1 billion; capital expenditures of approximately $100 million; and inventory to be approximately flat year-over-year.
In closing, while we are navigating some difficult industry challenges in the PC market and made progress in improving our channel inventory levels in the first quarter, we continue to invest in our product roadmaps and look forward to updating you on our long-term strategy at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day.

The Computing and Graphics revenue declines have accelerated in each of the last 4 quarters and down 38% year-over-year. I understand there's some channel flush going on. But based on the guidance, it looks like it'll be down between 30% and 40% year-over-year. So I guess I'm wondering is -- does that revenue trajectory create a motivation to look more aggressively at M&A or joint venture opportunities? And maybe you could just review the AMD strategy or philosophy around M&A and JV opportunities.",94

So thanks for the question. So let me start with maybe a bit of the backdrop on the Computing and Graphics business and what's been happening in the market. So certainly, the Q1 results are impacted by the fact that the PC market was weaker than we originally expected. We expected, when we started in January, that we would have a weak first quarter due to some of our channel inventory issues. Now the channel business actually performed pretty close to our expectations, with the exception of some of the currency issues in Europe. On the MNC business, we did see some weaker-than-expected results as a result of some of the commercial hangover and the hangover from Q4. Now on the broader question of the Computing and Graphics business, we have significant product technology and IP that serve this market very well. I think it's important for us to focus on the areas where we can differentiate and innovate. Frankly, the portions of the business that are more commodity-like are less attractive to us, and so we have really been focusing on managing the business for improved profitability and improved differentiation. So going forward, we'll continue to do that. You had a question about the second quarter guidance. It is important for us to ensure that we're managing the business in a disciplined way. Given some of the uncertainties in the market, we are being more cautious on the second quarter. We do expect the second half to be better than the first half as we go forward. And then relative to M&A and sort of the questions there, I think we're always looking at opportunities to optimize the business. But the Computing and Graphics business and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business share a lot of synergistic IP, particularly around the processor cores and the graphics IP technology. So we continue to believe that we can differentiate in these areas as we accelerate some of our product investments.",331

On one hand, you're -- it seems like you'd be ramping Carrizo and I would assume you're already starting to ramp your semi-custom chipsets ahead of the console build. But yet, on the other hand, it still seems like you're burning through some channel inventories, so lots of moving pieces. Any help from you guys would be great.",100

So our second quarter guidance, we would expect that the semi-custom units will be up compared to the first quarter. I would say modestly up. Relative to the Computing and Graphics business, I think we will complete the burn-off of our channel inventory in Q2 based on the current pace that we see. And then on the ramp-up of Carrizo, we will start shipping -- we started shipping actually in Q1 a small volume of units. We'll increase that as we go to Q2. What we also are factoring in is with the Windows 10 launch at the end of July, we're watching sort of the impact of that on the back-to-school season and expect that it might have a bit of a delay to the normal back-to-school season inventory buildup.",134

So if I step back and look at it, and if you look at the balance sheet even in Q1 despite the lower revenue from a year ago and also last quarter, we managed the balance sheet across the board pretty well. If you look at the Q1 inventory, we were managed -- we managed to keep it flat despite the lower revenue. The AP is down quarter-on-quarter rather significantly. We managed the cash, I said earlier to the earlier question, between the $600 million to $1 billion, and I feel we can do that in the Q2 time frame. And the other thing is you might have read about the ABL facility that we have to the tune of $500 million. In fact, we just renewed that with a bit more favorable terms just recently and announced that today. So from my standpoint, the takeaway for you should be we managed cash between the $600 million and $1 billion target.",162

So relative Q1 year-over-year, I think that the -- we've mentioned that the semi-custom SoC sales were down a bit as well as embedded was relatively flat. As we go full year, we haven't given full year guidance at the segment level yet. So I think what we've said before, which I still believe is true, is that the semi-custom units will likely be up year-over-year. The ASPs are known.

Then my follow-up question is related to gross margin. I think you're planning to build about $100 million of inventory for semi-custom revenue in the back half.

Or maybe just a broader way of asking the same question, how should we think about the gross margin trajectory for the remainder of the year and what are some of the puts and takes to think about?",89

We're guiding flat to Q1. The market environment, especially on the PC side, is uncertain. Product mix would be the main driver for the gross margin. And obviously, as Lisa remarked earlier, we're very focused on disciplined execution on the business and we'll continue to do that, in particular, correcting the channel inventory situation that we're trying to get done with in the Q2 time frame. Longer term, if you ask me from an overall standpoint, obviously, our goal is to grow on an accretive basis the margin opportunities that embedded and server and pro graphics have brought us [ph], as well as a richer mix of business in the client PC space as we introduce the new products that we've talked about. And the other thing I would encourage you to do is we are going to lay out more details of our longer-term standpoint at our Financial Analyst Day that's coming up on May 6, and that's where we will share more details in terms of the longer-term model.",188

You have a range of $340 million to $370 million, and that's mostly based on the revenue outlook. So given your revenue trajectory, I'm surprised that you're not taking OpEx down more toward the lower end of that range. Can you tell us, I guess, what products you're investing in? And where would revenues actually need to go before you felt the need to take OpEx down to the lower range?",78

So if you go back and look at the OpEx and in particular, we were just talking about the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom area, if you look at the OpEx, first of all, from a Q4 to Q1 standpoint, the OpEx is down. Sales and marketing specifically is down about 9% quarter-on-quarter. R&D is up slightly. And I can tell you that the R&D, without getting to the specifics, has been targeted towards those areas where we feel afford us the best longer-term opportunities from a growth standpoint and the best opportunities from improving the financial performance standpoint. And obviously, we are, in a very targeted manner, investing in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom area which  is where we've had very good traction in 2014. Our design wins continue in 2015 with revenue, as Lisa talked about earlier, in 2016. And in pursuit of those businesses, we'll go ahead and invest in those areas. As far as to your question about modulating the expenses in the areas that are more related, I guess, to the business, CG for example, with the revenues down, I have said many times that we'll modulate our expenses in line with the revenue profile, and even with the sales and marketing decrease quarter-on-quarter, is very much in line with that profile. However, the one thing I think we have to be mindful about is about the R&D investments. We do want to fund for the future in terms of investing in the product roadmap, so that we do not, in the short term, take action that sacrifice the long-term future both of the company and the product roadmap. And that's why I think your observation is right, with the revenue down 3% on a guided basis, expenses are flat but primarily it's targeted towards the R&D areas.",303

For my follow-up, I had a question, I guess, on the trajectory of the console revenue. So I got to say I was a little surprised at the level of guidance and even in the current quarter. Your foundry supplier for consoles had their consumer revenues in Q1 up quite a bit. And we don't seem to be seeing that in your revenue guide. I know last year, we had a bit of a stronger console profile in the first half and then it was kind of flattish, I think a little lower than what the expectations have been in the second half. It sounds like now maybe you're expecting that profile to reverse and you're seeing a stronger console presence in the second half than the first half. Can you just give us some color based on those drivers on how you see that trajectory moving through the year?",154

So we do expect that the -- it's hard to call console seasonality as we're -- each year is somewhat different. So last year, if you remember, the first half was coming off of a very strong holiday season where there was still, let's call it, unsatisfied demand. As we go from sort of the second half '14 into the first half '15, I think the demand is more normalized. There is expectation that the second half of '15 will be stronger in terms of units, and that's what we see from our customers right now. We're very in tune with them in terms of their forecast. And so that's what we see at the moment.",118

Also your competitor has been really back-end-loading sales for the year, particularly due to some channel inventory dynamics where we kind of clear the decks to make room for Win 10 and then we have that initial channel build ramp to support Win 10 when it comes out. So I guess, first of all, do you guys see the same channel inventory effects? And then also, do you see that same back-end-loading of the year as well for PC?",105

So Chris, what I would say is we do see some of the same dynamics, particularly in the near term. As we're going from the first quarter into the second quarter, I do think OEMs are being somewhat cautious on any inventory build now ahead of Win 10. As you go forward into the second half of the year, I think -- first of all, I think we're all optimistic that Win 10 can be a catalyst and a driver for the market. However, to what extent will depend on some of the macro conditions that we talked about. I think the currency issues in Europe have to clean up some. I think the Win 10 launch has to be strong, and then we'll see how the second half shapes up.",132

Your inventory was flat in 1Q. That's probably a quarter where that should've been down. I imagine some of that was maybe to support some upcoming product launches. Then of course, you guided inventories up another $100 million next quarter but you left your 2015 inventory guidance unchanged. So what has to happen there? What are your expectations there to kind of aggressively ramp down inventory into the back half of the year?",75

I think 2 parts to it. If you go back and look at our inventory profile even in 2014, in particular, with the significant revenue we're getting in the semi-custom space, the semi-custom customers that we have, we have to supply the product for them essentially a quarter ahead of when they build their parts. And therefore, the seasonally high sales happen in Q4. We build the product and supply it in Q3. But we have to get the wafer supply and inventory up in Q2 and fundamentally, the increase from Q1 to Q2 is to support the semi-custom ramp as well as what we said earlier about the second half being stronger than the first half. And obviously, we need to be prepared for that. So I think from an overall standpoint despite the challenges we talked about in the PC market managing inventory flat in Q1 was good. And we follow the same profile like we did in 2014, which is our plan. You should see inventory go up during the year to support the ramp of the semi-custom and then supplying the product. And then at the end of the year, being able to manage down to flat inventory year-on-year.",206

So thanks for the question, Vivek. That -- I do believe PC gaming and gaming in general is a growth opportunity in the market and a growth opportunity for AMD. So as I look forward, we're launching Carrizo on the APU side and we're also launching some graphic products in the second half of this year. So I think from the standpoint of being able to capture more of the markets and increase more to the -- where our normal shares are in Graphics, I think that's something that we believe we can make progress towards.",97

So first of all, I didn't give a cash guidance for Q2. But what I said basically is we'll manage within the $600 million to $1 billion balance, the range that we have provided, the target minimum versus the optimal. On the WSA, the $1 billion that we talked about and signed in the WSA that we just confirmed with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, there is a mix of revenue there. Just as a reminder, and I think you know this, but the large portion of the amount that we have is a good mix of product across PC, graphics and semi-custom, as opposed to if you go back 2 years ago. So I would say it's very much in line with our expectations of how the market is going to evolve this year, in particular, in the semi-custom space.",138

On the semi-custom operating income, it seems like it was significantly below the average of last 4, 5 quarters. I was just wondering if you could highlight where the compression came from and if that goes away in the coming quarters?",44
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2015",2015-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3232.0,790055.0,34426366.0,Answer,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,55,"Yes. I think if you look at it from an overall standpoint at the segment level, semi-custom had been following the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. The impact to the operating income in that was really 3 factors. If you look at the game console royalties based on the Q4 to the Q1 transition, lower game console warranties in Q1, the product mix obviously had a play in that. And then the other thing that we referenced earlier and Lisa talked about, higher R&D spending where we are targeting more spending in that area to pursue more opportunities. And all of those 3 factors combined caused a lower operating income percentage for the quarter.",114

So, Sanjay, I think when we look across our portfolio and our priorities, we are very focused on the places where we can differentiate and innovate. So relative to x86 opportunities, clearly, the x86 server market is a very large market and it is one where we have historically been successful. So I do believe that it's an area that we can grow over the medium term.

I think Q2 amount, I won't get in the quarterly profile, but if you listen to the comments we were making in terms of some of the actions we are taking in Q1 and Q2, the first half of the year, relative to the PC market, and then you listened about the semi-custom profile first half to the second half, while the purchases in the first quarter are at the $161 million level, you can expect that it's going to follow the trajectory of the business, second half being stronger than the first half, the semi-custom ramp-up during the second half, a significant portion of the $1 billion is semi-custom products. And that's exactly how it goes throughout the year.",121

And Lisa, I guess, as my follow-up, granted that it's difficult enough to look out 90 days and have an accurate forecast given the volatility in PCs, let alone the full year, but if you just grow seasonally in the back half of the year, your PC business is going to be down at probably greater than 20% year-over-year for the full year. So I'd love to kind of get your sense of what you think the market for PC is doing this year? Is the gap between that and kind of seasonality share loss? Or more importantly, when do you think you're going to be positioned with these new products to actually gain back some share in the market?",123

So John, good question. So for clarification, the comment about the market was really one on -- it's hard to call that the market will be substantially better in the second half than the first half. I think it will be better due to seasonality. Relative to our business, our business, certainly in the first quarter and in the second quarter, is not really relative to seasonality. I would say we had some inventory issues that I want to correct as soon as possible so that we get our new product stream fairly clean into the market. So as we go into the second half of the year, we would like to see some -- a regain of share in both the desktop and the notebook business. I talked about Carrizo being a strong product for us. I talked about some of our graphics launches that we'll talk about later this quarter. So from our standpoint, I would say the first half of the year, we had some, let's call it -- some of our issues that we were correcting in terms of the channel and then a weaker-than-expected market environment. In the second half of the year, I think we would like to see our products take a strong position as well as hopefully the market gets stronger as well.",222

Maybe Lisa, could you help us, if at all, figure out how much of that is due to burning through stuff in the channel versus the market being down versus share loss? Just any kind of ballpark figure would just be really helpful.",117

Matt, let me think about the best way to answer that question. Okay, so let's say it this way. I think -- we gave you a couple of pointers when we talked about the first quarter year-over-year. We actually saw mobile revenue go up relative to first quarter '14. Desktop revenue was down. I think, from that standpoint, there was a good piece of that desktop reduction that was channel inventory correction and then some of that was the desktop market being weak. When we look -- when you talk about market share, you're often talking about unit share. And from the standpoint of unit share, we have selectively decided that there's some pieces of business that we're not going to service because they are very unprofitable. And that is some of the share decline that you've seen. Relatively speaking, we've kept ASPs pretty solid. And we would be looking for, forward looking, to really improve our mix going forward and getting both the revenue as well as the ASP and mix up. So I know that's not exactly answering your question, but what I'm trying to give you the context for is the desktop market probably took a larger hit first half to first half, just given what's happening in the market in desktops as well as our channel inventory problem. I think the notebook business, we've made some progress. I think we have a very strong product coming out in Carrizo, so we would expect to make more progress.",254

As a follow-up, I wanted to jump into a little industry perspective in the server market, a couple of questions there. One, obviously, the decision to exit the SeaMicro business from a platform perspective, maybe you could talk a little bit, Lisa, about what's changed there and led to that decision. And second, it seems a lot of the questions that I hear are focused on the server opportunity as maybe we all think about the server market ready. What's interesting is also how the line between server and enterprise networking is blurring a bit through NFV and SDN. Maybe talk about some of the opportunities in markets where it's not a traditional AMD versus Intel fight but more new markets that are server teams that are opening up as an opportunity for your business.",147
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q1 2015 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2015",2015-04-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3232.0,790055.0,34426378.0,Answer,Lisa Su,,Executives,67,"Absolutely. So let's talk about investments and priorities. I've been on the job about 6 months, and I've really been looking at the overall portfolio, where do we think we could make measurable gains that are sustainable and what the priorities should be. It is clear that we have a lot of technology, but we need to focus our resources on the places that, I would say, are stickier pieces of business. So relative to the SeaMicro business, that was a strategic decision to really exit the systems business. And if you think about SeaMicro, it was really specializing in micro servers, and micro servers have not developed at the pace that we might have thought a couple of years ago. From the way we look at the market, our core competency is really in processors and being able to service that business through either standard or semi-custom products is the way we'll address the server business. Now going forward, I think the longer-term question, when you look at our IP, whether you talk about our processor IP or some of our packaging and system IP know-how, I think traditional servers is one place. Certainly, dense servers, cloud, enterprise are important. And then, as you state, the blur between traditional enterprise and networking is there. So I think we are repositioning our portfolio. Repositioning the portfolio always takes a bit of time, and so we're working through that repositioning. But we will give more color on some of the target markets at the financial Analyst Day. And certainly, Forrest Norrod, who has recently joined us, has a lot of thoughts on where we think we can win in these spaces.",280

So Chris, we did see the effect of currency in Europe. I guess the way I would describe it is Eastern Europe just fairly very low demand, and we did see that very clearly. Western Europe, actually the demand is okay. But what the currency issues have done is they've resulted in our partners and customers carrying fairly lean inventories, just given all of the fluctuation. I think it's hard to say when it's going to stabilize, but we certainly have clear signals as we look at sell-through on a weekly basis and all those things.",97

The WSA, I think, was about $1.1 billion, so it's slightly lower this year than last year at the $1 billion level. And the $1 billion mix of revenue is semi-custom, Graphics and PC.

As we announced last week, second quarter revenue and gross margin decreased more than we initially guided as the consumer PC market became decidedly weaker following our financial analyst day. The softer-than-expected consumer PC demand in advance of the Windows 10 launch caused our OEM notebook sales to slow late in the quarter as our OEM customers and retailers actively worked through their inventory of Windows 8-based systems. This significantly impacted our second quarter PC notebook sales and reduced our gross margin as we ended the quarter with a larger mix of lower gross margin EESC revenue.
Despite our Computing and Graphics revenue shortfall, our other businesses performed largely as expected. We also made some good progress during the quarter as we introduced several key new products, secured multiple embedded design wins across our target markets and continued to see strength in our Semi-Custom business. Computing and Graphics segment revenue decreased 29% sequentially based on soft consumer demand. This also impacted sales of our sixth generation A-series APU, codename Carrizo, as some OEMs chose to align Carrizo launches with the Windows 10 launch. We expect our mobile unit shipments will rebound and ramp in the second half of the year as more than 35 Carrizo platforms come to market globally.
In the channel, we saw a sequential increase in desktop processor revenue due to solid demand for our FX processors and our A-series APUs. We also reduced downstream inventory levels in the quarter, largely completing our multi-quarter channel rebalancing effort. GPU revenue decreased sequentially in line with seasonality. We did see good initial demand for our new 300 Series GPUs and latest flagship Radeon R9 Fury X, which launched late in the quarter and contributed to a sequential improvement in GPU channel revenue and ASP. Fury X is powered by our Fiji GPU, the industry's first graphics chip to feature die-stacked high-bandwidth memory, which can deliver unprecedented performance in an extremely quiet and compact graphics card. We are pleased with the initial ramp up of our Fiji GPUs and we'll expand our industry-leading HBM GPU offerings in the coming quarters as we introduced the Fury, Nano and the high-end dual Fiji GPU card.
We also strengthened our management team, as Jim Anderson joined us to lead our Computing and Graphics business group. Jim began his career as a processor architect and has held several leadership, business management and engineering roles across multiple technology companies. He is the ideal leader to return CG to a positive trajectory as we focus on stabilizing the business and then regaining profitable share. Looking at our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 13% sequentially, driven by strong semi-custom sales. We remain on track to set a record for annual semi-custom unit shipments this year.
As in 2014, we anticipate the third quarter will be our annual peak for semi-custom shipments and revenue based on Sony and Microsoft building inventory in advance of the holiday period. We also began development of a new semi-custom design in the quarter. Like our other semi-custom designs, the details are customer confidential, but we are pleased with our progress continuing to expand our customer base in this important part of our business.
Looking forward, we believe the second quarter will be our revenue trough for the year based on stronger second half demand for game consoles, combined with the ramp of our newest APU and GPU products and OEM demand improving as the market transitions to Windows 10. That said, the PC market remains volatile. We must further align our cost structure with our revenue profile as we focus on our strongest market opportunities and continue investing in the high-performance Computing and Graphics technologies that can enable us to create great products and reestablish AMD as leader across our target markets.
As we discussed in our financial Analyst Day in May, our focus is to expand margins and improve our cash flow generation by gaining profitable share across the gaming, immersive devices and data center markets over the next 3 to 5 years. We are fully committed to pursuing this strategy as we create a more diversified AMD, capable of generating consistent, profitable returns independent of the ebbs and flows of a single market. AMD is at its best when we deliver leading-edge technology based on taking bold, calculated risks that leverage our differentiated IP and design capabilities to create unique products that make our customers incredibly successful. This is where we are focused. Despite the near-term pressures, we have the right strategy to improve AMD's financial results.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?",793
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q2 2015 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2015",2015-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3146.0,834130.0,36027691.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will be referencing non-GAAP figures, except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis. As Lisa discussed, second quarter results reflect the weaker-than-expected consumer PC market, which impacted demand from our OEM customers. Our EESC segment, revenue was up, our channel inventory corrective actions are largely completed and although our channel sales came in as expected, up from the prior quarter, it was not enough to offset the impact on our PC OEM processor business. 
Second quarter revenue was $942 million, down 8% sequentially, primarily driven by lower sales to our PC OEM customers. The year-over-year decline of 35% was largely driven by decreased sales across our Computing and Graphics products. Gross margin was 28%, down 4 percentage points from the prior quarter primarily due to a higher mix of Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom segment revenue and lower-than-anticipated Computing and Graphics segment notebook APU unit volumes. Additionally, our GAAP gross margin was affected by a $33 million technology note transition charge.
Operating expenses in the second quarter were $353 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter. Operating loss was $87 million and net loss was $131 million or $0.17 per share calculated using 778 million shares. Net interest expense, other expense and taxes were $44 million in the quarter, up from $43 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $42 million, down from a positive $13 million in the prior quarter, and on a trailing 4-quarter adjusted base, adjusted EBITDA was $200 million.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $379 million, down 29% sequentially, primarily due to decreased sales of our client notebook processors due to a weak consumer PC market impacting our sales to OEMs. Channel PC processor and graphics sales were in line with the company's expectations. Computing and Graphics operating loss was $147 million compared to a $75 million loss in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower notebook processor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $563 million, up 13% from the prior quarter, driven by higher sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income of this segment was $27 million, down from $45 million in the prior quarter due to the $33 million technology note transition charge.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance total $829 million at the end of the quarter, down $77 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower sales in the quarter. Inventory was $799 million, up from $688 million in the prior quarter, in line with expectations in support of semi-custom holiday season sales in the second half of 2015 and due to lower sales of our client products driven by a weak consumer PC market. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.27 billion, flat from the prior quarter. This includes an additional $42 million draw on our ABL facility, which was utilized to extinguish our 6% convertible senior notes that came due in May 2015. With the final payoff of our 2015 debt tower, there are no term debt maturities due until 2019. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $75 million, an improvement of $120 million from the prior quarter.
Now turning to the outlook. In our financial Analyst Day in May, we provided a view of our business in the second half of the year and an overview of the drivers that we believe will return AMD to profitability in the back half of the year. However, late in the second quarter, our OEM client PC demand was lower, triggered by the impact of the Windows 10 launch and inventory reprofiling by our OEM customers. Due to the shift in the PC market, we are now seeing a more challenging environment than we did in May with OEMs remaining very cautious about the second half, particularly the back-to-school cycle. It is against this backdrop that we provide the following outlook.
For the third quarter of 2015, AMD expects revenue to increase 6% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 29%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $340 million. Interest expense, taxes and other, to be approximately $45 million. Inventory is expected to be approximately $850 million in support of the second half product ramps and semi-custom sales to support the holiday season. And cash is expected to be approximately $700 million. This cash balance includes third quarter interest expense payments on our debt of approximately $70 million.
Due to the recent change in the PC market outlook, our goal of second half profitability has been pushed out. However, we will continue to work towards improving our second half financial performance. We are assessing actions to be taken to reduce our current cost structure with a view to lower operating expenses to better align with our near-term revenue profile. We anticipate restructuring charges associated with those actions.
In conclusion, we look forward to seeing improvements in the back half of the year as we ramp semi-custom wins and our new -- newest APU and GPU products. We remain focused on executing our longer-term product roadmap strategy as laid out at our Financial Analyst Day.

Thank you, David. From a cash standpoint as you probably -- I'll just say, previously, we have a minimum target of about $600 million to a range of $1 billion. We can manage it lower than that from a viewpoint of where our revenue and our profile of the business model is right now. And in Q2, as you saw, we ended at about $830 million of cash. As far as the financing is concerned, our capital markets on an ongoing basis, I monitor the capital markets pretty closely, and if the need arises, obviously, we'll access the capital market. I think from an overall standpoint, if you think about it, with the cash that we have, we also have ABL availability that we put in place in the late part of 2013 and that's not all fully tapped out, so that's how I would leave it from a cash standpoint, David.",153

Thanks for the question. So on the Semi-Custom business, we've certainly been active in our work with various customers across target markets. So last year, we had announced 2 new semi-custom designs that were roughly $1 billion in revenue, lifetime revenue, that would start ramp in the second half of 2016. We started a new design this quarter that we believe expands our base for the Semi-Custom business and we're very pleased with that. And then we still have a fairly active pipeline in semi-custom as well. So we view it as very much an area where there is a strategic interest in integrating our Graphics and CPU IP going forward.",113

We're pleased with the Fury X ramp-up, certainly the fact that it's out of stock is not a bad thing because it gives us good confidence that the customers are appreciating the product. Fury just launched actually this week and we will be launching Nano in the August time frame.

And maybe one for you Lisa. If we look at -- you are actively trying to bring OpEx in line with the revenue profile, and if I look at all the semi-custom wins that you have had so far, they have been at lower gross margin. Is that how we should see some of the newer wins? Will they also be at lower gross margins than corporate average? And if it is lower gross margins, do you think you can cut OpEx fast enough to be sustainably free cash flow positive some time in the near future?",99

So when we think about OpEx, look, we want to make very strategic decisions around OpEx, and we have a long-term roadmap. We have several segments that we're investing in for long-term growth and the Computing and the Graphics IP are critical to make that happen. That said, we do have to align our OpEx with our current revenue projections and I think we have an opportunity to do that going forward. Relative to semi-custom and what that means in terms of gross margin profile, I think the semi-custom business is across a set of target markets, so game consoles is one of those markets, but there are other markets that we have had success in. And when you look across those markets, I think there will be a range of gross margins as well, depending on the IP and the overall product specifications. So the goal is to return profitability. I think there's no question about that and we will take active actions on both the top line and the bottom line to do that, but I wouldn't make any assumptions about sort of the relationship between semi-custom and OpEx.",203

Last night, Intel announced the addition of a new chip on their 14-nanometer roadmap and pushed back 10. It strikes me as 2 things. One, love to get your commentary relative to your foundry partners as to how the Moore's Law progression is going, particularly with Zen coming on 14-nanometer next year.

So I do think the process technology landscape right now is quite interesting. So on your -- in the first part of your question, how do we view FinFET technologies. Actually I think the maturity of FinFET technologies is coming along very nicely. And so we see it as an important part of our roadmap in 2016 across all of our markets. We've actually just taped out our first couple of FinFET designs. Relative to what that means for the competitive landscape going forward, I've been asked that question a couple of times over the last year. And my comments have been, our focus is on design architecture and ensuring that we use all of our design architecture expertise. So Zen is a clean sheet design and from an architectural standpoint, I think it's going to be very competitive. The fact that the gap between foundry technologies and other technologies is shrinking, I think, does change the competitive landscape and will be a good opportunity as we go forward competitively. So we're aggressively going after FinFET, and I think that's going to be an incredibly important node for us.",191

We said previously that the Semi-Custom business usually has its strongest quarter in the third quarter. We think that's going to continue to be the case. The Computing and Graphics business is coming off of a low quarter. So we would expect improvement in both units as well as overall revenue as well.

And I guess as a follow-up, looking a little further out in the semi-custom side of things, just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question on the gross margin side but taking a little bit more of a revenue look at it first. If the new businesses are coming on throughout the 2016 period but the traditional full penetration of the gaming business kind of folds over simultaneously, how do you view the trade-off between those as your -- it results in your ability to grow that segment of your business? And what does that mean to gross margin if some of those smaller aggregate dollar opportunity may have better gross margin than the game console Semi-Custom business that you have today?",123

And then as we layer on top of it some of the new wins, I think that does give us potential to grow in the second half of the year. Obviously, there's a lot to happen between now and then.

First question on HBM is, is it margin accretive or dilutive within your GPU business? And second question is, as you'd integrated HBM, could you talk about the challenges you faced and would you say that you have any technological lead here in integrating HBM and GPUs? Is it basically the 6- to 8-month lead that you have been able to gain or there's more to it than you could see, you could maintain a longer lead here?",89

Relative to HBM, I think we do have a lead. We're the first in the industry to integrate HBM and GPUs. We've targeted at the enthusiast segment because that's the right segment to, I would say, to learn the manufacturing technology. I would say that the manufacturing has come up as expected, and we expect that the overall family of Fiji GPUs, the way we're rolling it out, would be a strong set of products in the second half of the year. Relative to the margins, I won't comment specifically about it, but I will say overall, a key goal for us is to grow graphics market share, and growing graphics market share, having leadership, strong product portfolio at the enthusiast segment helps across the entire portfolio.",134

On the 20-nanometer case, we did speak a little bit about that at our Financial Analyst Day in May. We started several designs in 20-nanometer and after looking at the overall design trade-offs, we felt that FinFET was much more competitive. And so we decided to move a number of designs into FinFET technology. Relative to the second half of the year, I don't think there's anything substantive to talk about. I think the important thing is ensuring that we get our product portfolio into FinFET technology next year, which will improve our overall competitiveness.",96

So we are extremely excited about the virtual reality market. I mean, if you look at the progression of that market and how quickly it has evolved even over the last 12 months, I think it's an area that really uses both CPU and GPU technology. If you look at the headset manufacturers or the ones that will have product out, most of those are stating product shipments sometime in the 2016 time frame, starting early 2016. So today, it's mostly developer systems, but working closely with the developers with our GPU technology, migrating to more commercial systems in 2016, there's a significant need for high-performance graphics.

And then going back to your specific observation on the inventory being up from a Q2 to Q3 standpoint, it is to support the second half product ramp and semi-custom sales in particular.

After that, obviously, the continuing trajectory that we have from the client PC group as well as the Graphics piece getting into the Q4 time frame, and so that's something that I look at from a second half standpoint.

You said Q2 was the trough of the company for the year, which implies, in Q4, semi-custom should be down, which means a pretty big ramp of the computing graphics business into Q4. I mean high double-digits at least, if not more. I guess, what gives you confidence that, that's going to happen? And what are the consequences if that ramp doesn't come to play given that you're building a ton of inventory that's supposed to sell out in Q4?",99

I think if you look at what happened with the actions that we took going back several quarters, one thing we have done, and we feel good about that, is in the PC space, in the channel inventory, in particular. All of the actions, they'll be started in the Q4 time frame, and Q1, Q2, largely completed. And as we said, the channel sales quarter-on-quarter were up and we feel good about that. Those are very directed actions taken in an aggressive manner by us. And in Q2, we did have the impact on the OEM APU sales, in particular with the transition of Windows 10. And as we get to the second half, especially with the new products, we think we can ramp those products and the second -- the Q3 guidance, as Lisa said earlier, takes into account an improvement both on the EESC segment as well as CG segment. Q4, we're not providing guidance, but as we get to the Q4 time frame, we think the PC market continues to stabilize and that helps us from that standpoint, and that's the way we have it baked in. On the inventory question that you have, as I explained earlier to another question, it is up from Q2 to Q3, but we are actively working with our partner, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, to go ahead and reprofile those commitments that we made earlier this year. And I think that should help from an inventory standpoint to go ahead and manage it to where we think it's more comfortable and in line with the revenue outlook.",271

I guess -- I mean you're telling me you feel good about Q4, but I mean let's be honest, you haven't been able to forecast 1.5-month out, let alone 2 quarters.

And even if it does stabilize, I mean your business has been -- let's be honest, it hasn't been stable versus where the market's been either.

So look, that's a fair comment. I'll take that. Now if I tell you what I see going forward, we'll give you the best information we have at this point in time. So the Semi-Custom business, Q3 will be the peak. We need a few more data points to really call Q4 correct. But so far, what we see is a solid market on the semi-custom side. On the Computing and Graphics side, there are -- basically, think about it as 4 pieces to the business. So we have OEM, processors, we have channel processors, we have graphics, our Consumer Graphics, and then we have Professional Graphics. So amongst those 4 segments, from what we see, we are being a bit cautious on Q3, just given we need to see exactly how the OEMs ramp the Windows 10 launch. We think Windows 10 is a good product, but we need to see how that launches. As we go into holiday, we believe we'll make progress in Graphics. We believe we'll make progress in Professional Graphics. I've said that the channel looks like it's healthier for us and we need to see how the OEM demand looks. But those are the ways I think about Computing and Graphics. So clearly, we're not happy with the performance in Q2.

You guided the cash levels in the September quarter around $700 million. I think to an earlier question, you said that you'd still feel comfortable operating below $600 million. I guess what I'm trying to figure out, is $700 million kind of what you envisioned to be the trough because with inventory coming down in Q4 and maybe the presumption of some sequential revenue growth, shouldn't cash grow from September to December?

So the fact is I think if you look at it from a cash standpoint for the rest of the year, in Q3, with the cash guidance of $700 million, the way our debt maturity profile is, the cash interest payments happen in 2 quarters, in Q1 and Q3, to the tune of about $70 million. So that is a disproportionate impact to cash in Q1 and Q3 of our fiscal year, just the way the cash payments go out even though the accounting is done on a pro rata even basis throughout the year. And then you're right, we're managing the inventory and reprofiling some of the commitments that we have, should have, from a cash standpoint, and we're very focused to go ahead and do that, like I said, after we get through the Q3 time frame, in Q4, we don't have the cash interest payments.

And then, I guess, at some point, given the relatively long product life cycle for these products, any opportunities for die shrinks to drive a step function shift lower in cost per chip?",104

So certainly, we would like to drive both gross margins as well as operating margins. So the ASP declines are fairly well understood, those are prenegotiated. Relative to what we're doing to drive overall costs or COGS down, it's the usual things. It's yields, it's test times, it's procurement savings and those kinds of things. I would say it's been largely as expected. These products are now several years into their life cycle. To your follow-up question about die shrinks, I think if you look at the history of game consoles, you will normally see a die shrink, but that will happen out in time and we'll discuss it at that point.",114

And then on the server and data center side, there's been a lot of focus on the Intel-Altera deal and the potential to marry a CPU with a programmable, parallel processing architecture to help with computational acceleration. Given that the GPU is a parallel processing engine, is it fair to assume that you guys already have the capabilities to offer either in a standalone form or an integrated form alongside your x86 or ARM-based server processors a similar type of solution? And is that something that you have on your roadmap?",92

So the idea of marrying a processor with some type of accelerator, whether it's a GPU or an FPGA, I think is definitely important in the data center. We view that we do have the ability to do both, integrated with our APUs as well as in different packages, the -- offering both CPU and GPU together. So I think the idea of using accelerators is definitely important in data centers. We agree with that. Different people will do it different ways. And certainly, our approach will be to get very high-performance CPUs and GPUs that can inter-operate.",99

So I think Seattle is a good offering for 64-bit ARM servers. And if you look at what we've said up until now, we have a number of companies both in the ecosystem as well as users developing software on Seattle and looking at how it operates in the environment. I would say that the overall revenue of Seattle will be modest. As ARM ramps, will take a bit of time.

168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2015",2015-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3619.0,877349.0,37620871.0,Presenter Speech,Lisa Su,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We successfully executed many of our near-term tactical priorities in the third quarter while also taking several key steps as a part of our longer-term strategy to focus AMD on delivering great products, driving deeper customer relationships and simplifying our business.
Highlights include: delivering strong double-digit sequential revenue growth in each of our business segments; expanding our product portfolio with the introduction of several new APUs and GPUs that improve our competitive positioning in key markets; forming the Radeon Technologies Group to bring a vertical focus to our Graphics business and help strengthen our performance in traditional graphics markets while simultaneously establishing leadership initiatives in emerging, immersive computing markets by virtual and augmented reality. And in the third quarter, we also taped out multiple products in FinFET technologies across both of our foundry partners that are on track to enter production next year.
We also took targeted actions in the quarter to streamline portions of our business as a part of aligning our cost structure with our revenue profile, and we took an inventory write-down primarily on some of our previous-generation APUs largely related to weaker-than-expected PC demand. While not ideal, we believe the write-down helps ensure we have the appropriate balance of inventory in place given the market conditions.
Looking at our financial performance, third quarter sales were $1.06 billion. The sequential increase of 13% included revenue growth across both our Computing and Graphics segments as well as our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments. In our Computing and Graphics segment, we delivered our first sequential revenue increase in 2 years. CG revenue increased 12% sequentially, primarily due to improved GPU and desktop APU sales. Channel sales also improved sequentially for the second straight quarter as we saw the benefit from the work we completed earlier in the year to reduce channel inventories.
We continue to have success with HP in the commercial market as they are seeing accelerating demand for their AMD-based systems, including increased adoption with key Fortune 500 accounts. As a result, I am pleased to share that for the first time, AMD was the exclusive launch processor partner for HP's newest EliteBook commercial client systems based on our latest Carrizo PRO APUs, which launched at the end of September.
Overall, PC demand, particularly in the consumer market, continues to be somewhat muted as there remains a high volume of Windows 8-based systems still on shelves. As a result, OEMs have been slower to ramp their Windows 10 platforms than we anticipated. We did see multiple customers introduce new Carrizo-based Windows 10 platforms in the third quarter, and we expect additional platforms will come to market in the fourth quarter.
Shifting now to Graphics. GPU revenue increased sequentially as we grew both OEM and channel sales based on the strength of our latest desktop and notebook offerings. Our strategy to profitably regain share by capturing key hardware and software technology transitions like HBM and DirectX 12 is gaining traction. We expanded our Fury family of HBM-enabled GPUs in the quarter to include the Fury Nano, the world's smallest and most power-efficient enthusiast desktop graphics card. We delivered strong double-digit percentage sequential revenue growth in the high-end enthusiast and performance portions of the GPU market based on the success of our flagship Fury line of energy-efficient products.
On the software side, our GCN, GPU architecture is delivering up to a 30% performance increase on applications written for the next generation of low-level programming APIs like Microsoft's DirectX 12 that are being quickly adopted by developers.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments. Revenue increased 13% sequentially, driven by strong semi-custom sales to support holiday game console demand. We are on track to set an annual record for semi-custom unit shipments in 2015. Demand from Sony and Microsoft indicates that the record-setting sales pace of this generation of game consoles will remain strong. We also remain on track to begin revenue shipments of our additional semi-custom design wins starting in the second half of 2016.
As a part of further diversifying into the medical, communications and non-console gaming markets, we plan to expand our embedded product offering this quarter with the introduction of our newest R-Series SoC, which will deliver significant performance-per-watt improvements compared to our previous generation and offer industry-leading graphics capabilities for embedded designs.
Today, we also announced that we have signed a definitive agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to form a joint venture combining AMD's high-volume assembly and test facilities and experienced workforce with NFME's established OSAT expertise. Today's announcement is another example of how we are executing the strategy we outlined at our Financial Analyst Day in May, to focus the company on improving our long-term financial performance by building great products and simplifying our business model. Forming a back-end manufacturing joint venture is a significant step towards achieving these goals as we align our operating models with other established companies and strengthen our balance sheet.
Looking to the fourth quarter and beyond, our priorities are clear. First, we must make more progress returning our Computing and Graphics business to a healthy trajectory by ramp increase of unit shipments, further penetrating the commercial client market, regaining profitable GPU share and maintaining healthy OEM and channel inventory levels. While we are not anticipating Windows 10 will drive a dramatic near-term PC refresh cycle, the continued adoption of Windows 10, which has already been installed on more than 110 million PCs to date, provides a great opportunity for AMD over the coming year based on a steady consumer and commercial refresh cycle environment.
Second, we must continue delivering strong new products. This includes successfully executing key design milestones through our breakout Zen CPU core. Zen remains on track for availability in 2016 and we believe will return AMD to the mainstream server and high-end client market in a significant way in 2017 and beyond. We are also focused on delivering our next-generation GPUs in 2016 designed to improve performance per watt by 2x compared to our current offerings based on design architectural enhancements as well as advanced FinFET products process technology.
Third, we must further strengthen our balance sheet through continued improvements in our financial performance and strategic actions like our joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu.
One of our most valuable assets is our patent portfolio. We own foundational patents in processing, graphics, semiconductor fabrication and other technologies. This portfolio is not broadly licensed and could provide a significant source of revenue for years to come. We believe we have the right long-term strategy to return AMD to profitability and the correct set of priorities that will help us navigate the near term.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?",1141
168864.0,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2015",2015-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",3619.0,877349.0,37620872.0,Presenter Speech,Devinder Kumar,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll be referencing non-GAAP figures, except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made in the third quarter, with 12% sequential revenue growth in our Computing and Graphics segment and seasonally strong sales in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Additionally, we continued to simplify our business model and sharpen our financial focus, as evidenced by the manufacturing joint venture announcement for our ATMP facilities, which will also bolster our balance sheet and the restructuring actions which will help reduce costs.
First, let me review the third quarter numbers. Third quarter revenue was $1.06 billion, up 13% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally stronger sales of our semi-custom SoCs and improved desktop processor and GPU sales. The year-over-year decline of 26% was driven largely by decreased sales across our computing and graphics products. Gross margin was 23%, down 5 percentage points sequentially. Gross margin was impacted in the quarter by a $65 million inventory write-down comprising primarily older-generation APUs. The impact of the inventory write-down was 6 percentage points.
Before I cover the rest of the financial performance of the quarter, let me briefly recap the restructuring plan we announced at the beginning of October. It is the latest step to simplify our business and better align our resources around our priorities and business outlook. As a result of these actions, we expect to reduce global headcount by approximately 5% by the end of Q1 2016. Total restructuring and other special charges in Q3 2015 were $48 million, comprised of $41 million related to the recent restructuring plan and $7 million of facilities-related charges from our 2014 restructuring plan.
Operating expenses in the third quarter were $336 million, down $17 million from the prior quarter, including $2 million of savings related to our 2015 restructuring plan. In our fiscal third quarter, the operating loss was $97 million and net loss was $136 million or $0.17 per share loss calculated using 785 million shares. The impact of the inventory write-down for the loss per share was $0.08.
Net interest, other expense and taxes were $39 million in the quarter, down from $44 million in the prior quarter due primarily to a decline in other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $55 million compared to negative $42 million in the prior quarter.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $424 million, up 12% sequentially, primarily due to higher sales of GPUs and desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $181 million compared to $147 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by an inventory write-down of older-generation products, partially offset by higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $637 million, up 13% from the prior quarter, driven by seasonally higher sales of our semi-custom SoCs. Operating income of this segment was $84 million, up from $27 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the absence of the $33 million technology node transition charge in Q2 2015 and higher sales.
Let me now cover today's joint venture announcement. We signed a definitive agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to form an industry-leading assembly, test, mark and pack, or ATMP, joint venture to which we will contribute our ATMP facilities in Malaysia and China. The value of the deal is approximately $436 million. And upon the close of the transaction, AMD will retain a 15% ownership in the joint venture. We expect to receive $371 million in cash from our partner, with net proceeds of approximately $320 million after taxes and other expenses at closing, which is expected in the first half of 2016 after all regulatory and other approvals. We expect the transaction to be cost neutral to the P&L with significantly reduced capital expenditures for the company.
In addition, as a result of the plans for our ATMP facilities, the balance sheet reflects held-for-sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities with associated inventory, property, plant and equipment and accounts payable balances being reclassified to other current assets and other current liabilities with an impact of $119 million and $81 million, respectively.
As our business model continues to evolve, and based on recent questions from some investors, I want to take a moment to cover our cash and working capital management needs. As you know, we target managing cash within the range of $600 million to $1 billion and cash may, on occasion, trend to the lower end of that range with the expectation that it returns to the midrange or better thereafter. We are comfortable with this because of the lower quarterly revenue run rate, lower OpEx, focus on reducing inventory and continuing efforts to improve sales and ERP. In addition, there's a disproportionate impact on cash of approximately $70 million during the first and third quarters of each year based on our current debt profile that is also a factor on cash balances.
Additionally, the JV transaction should result in cash generation of approximately $320 million in the first half of 2016, with a significant CapEx reduction to an approximate $60 million annual run rate.
We also believe we have the ability to generate significant revenue by licensing or monetizing -- otherwise monetizing our IP portfolio. Lastly, if needed, we have other options available to bolster cash, namely tapping our asset-backed loan, of which $230 million is drawn as of the end of the quarter, or accessing the capital markets. Over the longer term, we look forward to de-risk our debt maturity profile, reduce interest expense and allocate excess cash over $1 billion to reducing debt.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents balances total $755 million at the end of the quarter, down $74 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a $69 million debt interest payment in the third quarter. Inventory was $761 million, down from $799 million in the prior quarter due to the $65 million inventory write-down. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $2.26 billion, essentially flat from the prior quarter. As of the end of the quarter, total borrowing against our secured revolving line of credit was $230 million, unchanged from the prior quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $84 million compared to a negative $75 million in the prior quarter.
Lastly, as mentioned on our last quarter's earnings conference call, we are actively working with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to re-profile our 2015 wafer commitments in line with product demand in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016. As of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we had purchases amounting to $631 million under the fifth amendment of the WSA. We anticipate concluding our wafer purchase re-profiling discussions with GLOBALFOUNDRIES before the end of the year.
Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter 2015. AMD expects revenue to decrease 10% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, due to a seasonal decline in semi-custom sales. We expect Computing and Graphics segment revenue to increase sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 30%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $350 million, including savings of approximately $7 million from our 2015 restructuring plan. Interest expense, taxes and others to be approximately $45 million. Inventory is expected to be down from Q3. Cash is expected to be approximately flat at $750 million, including cash payments of approximately $19 million related to the 2015 restructuring actions.
In closing, we continue to take steps to further simplify our business model, manage expenses and make the right investments to deliver on our longer-term strategy and improving financial performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over back over to Ruth. Ruth?",1288

The sequential drop is maybe a little bit more than I had thought, and I was just wondering if maybe you could talk us through the moving parts here. Is it all units or is there perhaps a step-function decrease in pricing? Was there some sort of inventory that was built? What -- how do I think about the step down in Q4?",79

This is Lisa. Let me try to give you some color around that. So if you look at the semi-custom business as a whole, it actually was a very strong third quarter and a strong overall year. So we saw units go up. We expect units to be up on a full year basis year-over-year and revenue to be up, modestly up year-over-year as well. When we talk about the Q3 to Q4 guidance, we actually ended up Q3 a bit stronger than our original guidance, and that was because our customers were ramping semi-custom units prior to the holiday ramp. And so September was a very strong month for us. October, November will be strong months as well. Q4 is down seasonally from Q3 just given the shape of the holiday ramp. So in terms of the magnitude of the overall units from a Q3 plus Q4 standpoint, it was -- it's pretty much as we would expect and it's really just the timing between Q3 and Q4. As we said in -- Devinder has mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do expect the Computing and Graphics business to be up quarter-over-quarter. And again, that's due to some of the progress that we're making in that business.",210

Lisa will probably give some details in terms of the various areas. But what I will say about our portfolio, especially the IP portfolio, is that we are able to generate revenue and we plan to monetize that for revenue. And in some sense, if you look at our 10,000 patents, of which half are U.S.-based, based on present transactions, you can imagine the value of the IP portfolio is pretty strong and pretty significant, I guess.

Our previous -- previously, we've been more opportunistic in how we've approached licensing, and we believe that there's an opportunity now to be more strategic and deliberate about what we do. So in terms of your specific question, I think we're open to -- there are several different avenues including licensing technologies, forging partnerships, perhaps sales of certain pieces of the portfolio. So we are considering all of those options.",111

So yes, as I said in the prepared remarks, Zen is on schedule for availability in 2016 and a first full year of revenue ramp in 2017. As you know, these microprocessor projects are multiyear projects, so the architecture, the execution team's very much in place. I think we're pleased with the progress, and we will continue to work hard to meet our objectives in that area. In terms of the long-term road map, we are extremely committed to high-performance x86 CPUs. And there should be no confusion on that point.

I think it's fair to say for all of us that it's been slower to adopt in the server market just due to some of the software and the infrastructure. Relative to Seattle, we will be starting our first modest production shipments in the fourth quarter, this coming quarter this year. And I view it as a longer-term bet. So no question that the server market is attractive, data center is attractive. We're very focused on it from an x86 standpoint, and we'll continue our ARM effort in a complementary way.",126

So you're guiding to $750 million cash. You're going to get some proceeds from the assembly and test sale, I guess, sometime midyear.

But the cash payments, if I summarize the restructuring plan that we announced earlier this month, $26 million of cash payments, $7 million actually occurred in Q3, $19 million to be paid out in Q4. And then as we get to 2016, there's another $15 million, $15 million, 1-5, to be paid out of the restructuring plan. And then we are done, and that's when obviously we get the benefits from the restructuring plan. I mentioned in the remarks that I had that if you look at 2016, there is about $58 million of savings now overall from an OpEx standpoint relative to the actions that we took. As far as the obligation to the Wafer Supply Agreement, yes, you're right. Do not expect the charges that you talked about. And obviously, our booking with the GLOBALFOUNDRIES, the GLOBALFOUNDRIES -- our partner to go ahead and reprofile the timing and the mix of the wafers as we look at the demand profile for Q4 2015 and into 2016. CapEx, I mentioned that with the transaction, not just forcing the balance sheet with cash sometime in Q1 2016, but the CapEx comes down by about $40 million from the current annual run rate of $140 million. So net-net, I think when I look at all the factors at play, all else being equal, I feel good about the actions we have taken from a cash standpoint. And you've seen us manage the cash within the range that we have laid out. And I went through a little bit more detail in this particular earnings call in terms of all the various areas and how we look at cash management as well as working capital management.",307

And then if I could fit in one more, I mean, your Computing and Graphics revenue is up nicely in the September quarter. Looks like your operating loss though grew sequentially.

When you look at the numbers from a segment reporting standpoint, you are right that the operating loss did go up. But within the operating loss in Q3 of 2015, the inventory write-down that I talked about to the tune of $65 million, the larger portion of that is within the Computing and Graphics segment. So it skews the results from an overall operational standpoint. So if you adjust for that, the improvement, even though it was a loss, was there from Q2 to Q3 on the higher revenue.",94

So if I look at that overall Graphics business, we did see growth across both the desktop as well as the notebook portion of the business. Relative to AIB, the third quarter was really the start of the ramp of the Fury series as well as the R9 series. I think it was a transition quarter in terms of transitioning from the older products into the newer products. Relative to inventories, actually I think we're in good shape on inventories. China is a little bit sluggish and we see that across both graphics as well as computing. All other regions are in good shape.",106

What's the best way to say that? I think what I said was overall units were up year-on-year 2015 to 2014 as we project into the fourth quarter. Revenue is up modestly. So the ASP decline is modeled in there. As we go into 2016, again, I expect that units will be up given our current visibility. The ASPs are known, so the main thing will be just looking at -- and you can easily bury a couple of million units this early in the cycle. So I won't say exactly where I expect revenue to be but those are the relative trends. I expect units to be up, ASPs on the same order, and we'd have to see where that actually ends up.",128

When you think about discrete graphics and the gaming portion of it as well as the newer applications, immersive applications around virtual reality and stuff, what -- the conventional wisdom that ASPs are going down is probably modified by the fact that there's -- with 4K, with DX12, with some of these other drivers, virtual reality, that there's more use for graphics horsepower. Going forward, I think we have a lot that we can do in terms of the product portfolio.

I think it's fair to say we are focused on overall gaming. It turns out that we have a very strong position in game consoles. So certainly, that's a great business for us. I think PC gaming, with our focus on both hardware and software optimization, particularly as we've moved from DX11 to DX12, as you talk about some of the online gaming initiatives, I think we're actually very well positioned both with our APUs as well as our discrete GPUs. So in terms of investments, I think you will see us continue to invest and invest heavily in the graphics area. And as I said earlier, I think it's a growth area for us. The fact that we are strong in game console, I think, is a benefit. And we'll continue to leverage how we can bring the game console and the PC gaming architectures closer together over time.",155

And Devinder, I just wanted to follow up on some questions that were asked earlier in the call about the JV and the impacts of that. It looks like there's a significant number of employees that will be going into the JV from AMD outright. Could you potentially quantify the impact on operating expense that you see maybe pre the deal and then post that deal closing and how we should think about the OpEx trajectory going forward?",79

We signed an agreement today and announced to you today. We have work to do to get the regulatory approvals to go ahead and get that deal closed, and at the same time, go ahead and get the deal done. And then you're right about the significant number of employees moving over. It's to the tune of 1,700 employees. And relative to our base of about 9,500, that's close to 20% when you look at it from that standpoint. So I think as we look for the details of how the JV is going to work with moving the employees, I'll be able to give more color, but I'm pleased from the viewpoint of what we have negotiated from a costing standpoint, as I said earlier, kind of cost neutral from our standpoint. And then OpEx, as I said, there should be benefit but too early to kind of quantify that. I think I'll be able to get through that when we close the transaction.",172

I think before when you've taken these inventory reserves, they haven't been included in non-GAAP, if I'm remembering that correctly. And now you are leaving the inventory reserve in non-GAAP. Can you talk about -- is there something different about this reserve than what you've seen before, that there's a different treatment of it?",61

I think if I have to go back to, I think, the 2012 time frame when the PC market shifted pretty significantly and everybody felt the effects of that in the 2012 time frame, we had that impact. So we had the non-GAAP treatment for the inventory write-down at that point, and we are consistent with the way we do it. If you look at it from the viewpoint of how we talk about our numbers, putting it into non-GAAP and then comparing it and then we call it out from an inventory write-down standpoint where we have, even in my script, given the adjusted numbers in terms of what the impact is to EPS as well as the gross margin of the -- on the write-down internally. But I think we are fairly consistent. There may might have been something that you recall, we took on LCM adjustment that might have been included in the -- not included in the non-GAAP numbers. But when you do an inventory write-down from an AMD standpoint, as far as I can recall, we've always left that in the non-GAAP numbers.",192

And then the second question is back to your Graphics business. You've had a nice sequential quarter but I still have your GPU business down quite a lot year-over-year. Now that you have products that are more competitive in the enthusiast segment, can you give us like an upper bound of what you might be able to achieve there?  Are there supply constraints that are keeping this small? And are you going to be able to kind of regain the levels that you were at a year ago in GPU?",93

Now you'll have to watch us over a number of quarters regain that graphics momentum. And when I think about it, relative to the Fury launch, we did have some supply constraints in the third quarter. They were -- they're largely solved in the fourth quarter, so I don't think there'll be any supply constraints. I think it's also fair to say that the graphics portfolio is quite broad. And so you will see us updating the entire portfolio over the coming quarters and both on the OEM side and on the AIB side. So again, it's a strategic effort. It's not a 1- or 2-quarter effort to regain our graphics share.",122

So it's a 2-part question. First question is, is that -- the option of licensing it, is that something have you decided that you will do? Or this is something you could do in future? And part 2 is where the demand for such licensing could come from? Does it necessarily imply that it would allow companies to build competing products in graphics and servers?",74

So in terms of our licensing our patents or our technology, we have done it from time to time, as I said, on a more opportunistic basis. And that's been both licensing technology as well as overall partnerships. As we go forward, we do believe that there's an opportunity to be more strategic in how we approach that, and that includes partnerships in certain markets that we're not directly building products, for example, as well as working together with other companies that are interested in access to some of the markets that we are competing in. So I think both are possible. And it's a strategic effort that we will take on over the next couple of years.",119

So graphics is an area that is extremely competitive. And having all of the graphics resources in a single vertical organization allows us to focus those resources and make good trade-off in terms of what are the key market opportunities. So it is, again, our belief that it's a very important segment for us as well as the computing segment.

And on that topic, is that -- is the vision -- can you help us with the vision from the standpoint of how big this could be? Is this something that's a single-digit revenue line item or low double digits or well into the double digits? How should we think about that?",92

So I mentioned 3 different areas. That was licensing technology, joint development partnerships as well as just a pure patent sale. Relative to how to kind of benchmark it, Devinder said it earlier, it's 10,000 patents. We think it's a very strong portfolio, one of the strongest in the semiconductor industry. Our goal would be to monetize it across those various aspects over the next couple of years. So I don't have the exact number, but it is something that we view as very valuable and complementary to our product development efforts.",124

And then a follow-up, if I may. You mentioned virtual reality, and Mark Papermaster has talked about that as an exciting market opportunity.

I guess the company has done a good job over the last 12 months taking overall OpEx down by about $75 million. And if I look at the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business, revenue's kind of down -- I'm sorry, revenue's about flat year-over-year in the September quarter. But if you look, the op profit is down about by about $20-plus million. I'm just kind of curious, Devinder, did some of the inventory write-down hit that segment? Or just help me understand specifically what's going on with operating profit within the semi-custom business.",102

If you do the year-on-year comparison, and that's a little bit complicated with the last quarter, if you remember, we had the technology node transition charge. And this quarter, we have a small portion of the inventory write-down that hit the segment. When I look at the numbers from that standpoint, it is down but it is down only slightly from a viewpoint of comparing from a year-ago quarter to where it is today. And one of the things that's happening in that business, as you correctly say, is we've had a situation where we launched a couple of products 2 years ago, you ramp the product, we are pursuing other businesses and we're investing in that business. And obviously, that generates some expenses that go into that particular segment.",136

And maybe, John, just to give you a little bit more color on that. So there was a smaller portion of the inventory write-down that was in the EESC segment. But if you're comparing year-on-year, you also have to remember that in EESC is also server and embedded, and those tend to be the highest-margin parts of our portfolio and those are down year-over-year. So although semi-custom game consoles are up, those are down and that's had a little bit of effect on the margin mix in that business.",90

And maybe as my follow-on, turning to computing graphics, even if I exclude the inventory write-down in the September quarter, you're still kind of running at greater than $100 million per quarter operating loss there. Lisa, how do you think about -- and hopefully, this was the first quarter. You pointed out in 2 years you saw sequential growth, so you turned the corner. But importantly, as you think about kind of bringing that business to breakeven, what are the most important levers in your mind over the next kind of 4 to 8 quarters?",98

So look, we called the trough in the second quarter. It was important for us to turn the corner on the business. But as you said, it's a multi-quarter effort to bring the business back to breakeven. We are taking a number of actions in terms of what we're doing there. There is -- there are OpEx actions as part of the restructuring effort that we're talking about. There are gross margin actions, particularly as we see a ramp of our new Carrizo and our new commercial products. You should see some mix improvement in that business as well. And we need to get the revenue up. There's no question that we need to drive top line, margin expansion as well as operating expenses. I do believe that we will make significant progress in 2016, and we see lots of good signs. They just don't show up yet in the financials that you see. So we need to continue to make progress in those areas.",170

On our taxes, if you look at our tax line, it's very minimal. The way our financials are and the way we have settled tax structures in the locations, especially in China and Malaysia, we've not been paying any amount of significant taxes in those areas. They are pretty minimal. So because we pay minimal, once the JV is formed at the time of closure, it will be a JV thing to go ahead and take care of the taxes. But the thing that I can also throw in since you are looking at the accounting and the taxes is we will account for this particular JV once it's formed in an equity accounting method. So it won't affect all the lines in the P&L but it will just show in the bottom line of the JV on an equity basis in which we have 15% ownership of the JV. Lisa?",166
