Wennink,,Executives,1,"Of course, let's first talk about the numbers. Fourth quarter sales came in at EUR 4 billion. That's just above guidance and gross margin within guidance. That translates into a full year sales number of EUR 11.8 billion and EUR 2.6 billion of net income. So it's a good year.
When you look at those numbers, I think you need to look at the bigger picture. I think if you look at 2019, it was a year where the Logic business was strong. Memory was weaker because our Memory customers were digesting an overcapacity situation.
But within that context, the estimate is that our equipment industry, the industry at large, will have a reduction in sales of about 10%, and ASML grew between 8% and 9%. So that's very good. And actually, it's a reflection of, I think, the importance of lithography, the increasing importance of lithography with, of course, EUV now coming on to the scene. And it's our expectation that in 2019 the share of lithography in total wafer CapEx spend has risen to about 27%. So this shows also the importance of EUV. It's also in that context 2019 was a very good year.",197

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Of course, January 2020. So it's a bit early to be quantitative, but let's go through the business. Logic, very clear, also supported by statements from our customers. 5-nanometer transition, 7 to 6. It's all happening. And it's all there to support 5G, big data, artificial intelligence, high-power compute. So Logic is going to be strong.
Memory, interesting year. It's going to be interesting. Like I said, 2019 was a weak year. But when we listen to our Memory customers, they see the first signs of a recovery shown by memory pricing. And that's confirmed by what we see. We just look at the utilization of our machines in the memory space. It's going up. Now if you look at the slope of that trend and you extrapolate that, I think it's fair to assume that somewhere in the second half, we as an equipment industry will see a recovery also from memory customers. Now where and when and to what extent is still, of course, a bit early, but the trend is clear.
Then about Installed Base Management. Installed Base Management will grow also this year as compared to 2019 driven by the fact that our installed base grows. But also, we're seeing the first EUV high-volume manufacturing kicking in. That already started last year, at the end of last year. That will lead to more income because we get paid per wafer. And on top of that, we foresee a pretty strong upgrade business, both in DPV and EUV. So all in all, when we look at the year, we think second half will be slightly higher than the first half but with upside of the Memory recovery. And all in all, I think it's going to be a good year from a top line growth point of view and a profitability point of view, both double digit.",310

Wennink,,Executives,5,"I think the most important to mention on EUV, as you look at 2019, is the fact that we went into high-volume manufacturing, into HVM with EUV, Logic but also Memory. It's also driven by our product introduction strategy, our 3400C is a high-productivity model, which of course helps our customers to drive the cost per wafer down. That's particularly important. So we shipped the 26 systems, totaled EUR 2.8 billion of revenue in EUV.
Now looking at this year, 2020, we're going to ship about 35 systems, but EUV revenue will be about EUR 4.5 billion. So it's a significant increase. And more important also to look forward in 2021 because we see a continuation of the demand for EUV in 2021 driven by Logic and Memory. So that is going to be a matter of how many systems can we make. And this is why we focus very much on cycle time reduction in our factory, which will then support a capacity of 45 to 50 systems in 2021. So we're looking forward also to the year 2021.",180

Clearly, like I said, we will see profitability growth not only this year but also the next couple of years. Of course we will generate cash. And I think all our shareholders will agree with me that the first source of cash should be our business. So we're going to invest in R&D and into the operational infrastructure to make sure that we can meet with the higher sales demand. That's number one.
Secondly, we've always said our return strategy is that we pay an increasing dividend. And the rest of the money will go into share buybacks. So we will propose to the shareholders' meeting to increase the dividend from EUR 2.10 to EUR 2.40, which is about a 14% increase. And we're announcing a share buyback program with a size of EUR 6 billion through 2022.
So all in all, I think, decent returns for all of us.",151

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2020.
Q4 results were basically in line with our guidance. Net sales came in at EUR 4 billion. Net system sales of EUR 3.1 billion was heavily weighted towards Logic at 83%, with the remaining 17% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business as well as the ongoing digestion phase of the Memory business. We reported EUV system sales of EUR 922 million from 8 shipments.
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 906 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 48.1%.
Overall, operating expenses came in above our guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 516 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 148 million. Higher than guided SG&A is due to additional employee benefit costs and costs related to our IT implementation.
Turning to the balance sheet, EUR 186 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q4. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.7 billion. This amount is significantly higher than anticipated with most of the cash coming in, in the December period.
Moving to the order book, Q4 system bookings came in at EUR 2.4 billion, including EUR 1.1 billion for 9 EUV systems. Logic order intake was 79% of the total value, with the remaining 21% from Memory, again, reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for our leading-edge lithography.
Net income in Q4 was EUR 1.134 billion, representing 28.1% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 2.70. For the full year, net sales grew 8% to EUR 11.8 billion. The Installed Base Management sales was EUR 2.8 billion, which was a small increase compared to previous year.
In 2019, we booked EUR 6.2 billion of EUV orders, which is more than 50% of the total bookings value for the year, reflecting customers' strong demand for EUV technology. We continue to invest in the future of ASML and increased R&D spend to EUR 2 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV road map, low and High-NA program. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of 2019 sales was about 17%, SG&A was about 4% of sales.
In addition, ASML invested EUR 886 million in CapEx supporting our long-term growth opportunities primarily around High-NA capacity and infrastructure.
Net income for the full year was EUR 2.6 billion, resulting in 21.9% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 6.16.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2020. We expect Q1 total net sales between EUR 3.1 billion and EUR 3.3 billion. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 950 million driven by strong demand for field upgrades, especially EUV.
Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 46% and 47%. The lower gross margin relative to the strong Q4 number is primarily due to Deep UV mix effect, fewer immersion and more drive systems with some positive EUV mix effect.
The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around EUR 550 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 140 million. Our estimated 2020 annualized effective tax rate is around 13%.
Regarding our capital return, ASML paid total dividends of EUR 1.3 billion that made up of the 2018 dividend and 2019 interim dividend, and purchased EUR 410 million worth of shares in 2019.
Through December 31, 2019, ASML acquired 9 million shares of the 2018-2019 program for a total amount of EUR 1.6 billion. Supported by our long-term business plan, ASML will submit a proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a dividend for 2019 of EUR 2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend of EUR 1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven.
ASML announces a 3-year share buyback program of up to EUR 6 billion to be executed in 2020 through 2022. ASML intends to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 0.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",758
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2020",2020-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3671.0,1893534.0,74151811.0,Presenter Speech,P. Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, resulting in another solid year of growth driven by Logic and EUV. We were able to achieve an 8% top line growth despite an overall industry decline of around 10% due to a weak Memory market. There's always a reflection of our Logic customers drive to continue to innovate and invest in technology for future nodes. For 2020, we currently expect a year of double-digit growth in both sales and profitability primarily driven by EUV and installed base business.
Major innovation drivers such as artificial intelligence, 5G, high-performance compute, autonomous driving and big data are creating new end-user applications, and these applications require more high-performance Logic, fueling increased demand for leading-edge nodes. And this is evident in several customer announcements regarding ramp plans for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes, which will drive another strong Logic year and an increased demand for EUV.
In the Memory market, the customers have indicated they're seeing signs of demand recovery in some market channels, and improvements in Memory chip pricing also support this view.
As customers have lowered litho tool utilization to reduce wafer output throughout the weak Memory demand period, they will first use this underutilization to return to normal supply levels, which will take some time. Subsequently, this will also trigger equipment demand, albeit a bit later than the supply/demand recovery for Memory devices. Taking the slope of the recovery of our litho equipment utilization as a proxy, it seems likely that we will see stronger litho equipment demand for Memory in the second half of the year.
We expect significant growth in our installed base business, service business will continue to scale as our installed base grows, and we'll also see EUV contribute to service revenue as these systems start running wafers and volume manufacturing now. We expect significant demand for upgrades, particularly in EUV, as customers utilize upgrades as a quick way to increase capacity. In EUV, it was a breakthrough year, with the technology now starting in high-volume production and producing consumer products that are already available in the market.
As we continue to execute on our accelerated EUV road map, we were able to ship our first NXE 3400C in 2019, which provides high productivity, translating to increased customer value, delivering higher ASPs and improved gross margins. We shipped 6 3400C systems in Q4 of the 8 EUV systems total we shipped in the quarter, bringing the total to 26 EUV systems and full year sales of around EUR 2.8 billion in 2019.
Increasing customer confidence in the EUV is translating into more layers in Logic production as well as expanding to new markets with the adoption in Memory. For full year 2020, we plan for EUV sales of around EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems. We continue to see demand building for next year's shipments and expect a healthy order flow to continue.
In order to fulfill the expected strong demand increase, we're working on the cycle time reduction to enable a capacity of 45 to 50 systems next year. 2021 is shaping up to be a very busy year.
Regarding our current outlook for the year, we expect 2020 to be another growth year as mentioned before. Although it's too early to provide quantitative expectations, let me make a few qualitative comments.
Major innovation drivers and applications that require high-performance Logic are driving increased demand at the advanced nodes. Logic demand is currently strong, and we expect this demand to remain healthy primarily driven by EUV. And as previously communicated, we expect sales of EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems this year, which translates to EUV sales growth of approximately 60%.
Memory is showing early signs of recovery. And although there's still uncertainty around exact timing of the recovery, it is likely we will see stronger demand in the second half of the year. And taking this into account, we expect a stronger second half with strengthening sales throughout the year.
Summary, 2019 was another great year, with continued positive momentum in EUV as well as short demand across our entire product portfolio. We expect another growth year supported by healthy Logic demand and likely recovery of the Memory market, with increased sales from our installed base business as well as demand for EUV. The positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in 2021 outlook and our 2025 growth scenarios.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",751

So I have little doubt that we'll have the backlog fill this year to support the capacity that we have lined out now for 2021. I think the issue here is really we need to reduce the cycle time, which we have good plans for. I mean we see first progress. I think the focus is on cycle time reduction in this case. MB, multibeam inspection, yes, we will ship in the first half. And I think the customers will probably take throughout this year to evaluate the tool so that we can start shipping next year in higher volume.",126

Just to follow-up on some of the comments you made around Memory. Obviously, there are some indicators, things are improving. I think some of the checks we've been doing through the supply chain are certainly pointing to improved capacity plans particularly potentially from Q2. When do you think you could start seeing that in orders? And I guess in some respects, why haven't we already seen some of it in Q4? And then I'll come back with a follow-up.",85

It's a good question. I wish I had a definite answer because that would make things easier. So I'm basically saying, we have -- when we -- when I said in my prepared remarks that we see the utilization of our tools going up, and we just extrapolate the slope of utilization increase. And I think it would mean at the end of the first half of this year, we will see likely a return to a normal supply/demand balance for our customers. Now they see that also and taking into account the order delivery times, the order lead times, then I would expect orders have to come in somewhere in Q2 in order for us to make sure that in the second half of the year, we could see an increase of our Memory business.
Again, we're in this business for quite a long time, and in my experience, Memory always comes back with a vengeance. They -- when it comes, it always comes quick, so we'll just have to wait. So I think it makes a big difference whether orders come back in Q2 or they come back in Q1 or in early Q3, I mean it makes a big difference for the year. So we just have to wait and see, and I wish I had a final and definite answer.",227

And just one, second follow-up on the Installed Base Management business. Obviously, a very strong run rate in Q1 at EUR 950 million. How do you think about this on a full year basis?

We expect that we will not be able to sustain it at this level for the entire year. I think a good way to go would be to say that we're probably going to see a 20% increase over last year annualized. So that would get you to approximately EUR 3.4 billion for the year. That's where we would see it for the for the full year.",110

Thank you, C.J. So let me first talk about gross margin for EUV and then give you the wider picture on gross margin. So on EUV, what we said, as you know, last year, on the systems side, systems gross margin for EUV, we're looking at about 30%, this year, we're looking at about 40%, 4-0. So that's what we have in the plan, and that's what we're executing for, and that's also in our models for this year.
On the wider picture for gross margin, and I know that many of you are looking at the Capital Markets Day. At the Capital Markets Day, we mentioned 50%. So let me start there, let me start at the 50% and let's look at what the circumstances were at the time, what the circumstances are today, and then we will start talking about how we see this to unfold and what the potential is that we see for this year.
So back in November -- at the Capital Markets Day in November 2018, I think there are 3 things that we should bear in mind. First off, at that stage -- what we modeled at that stage for you, and that had the 50% in there was what we called a mid-market growth scenario. And I think in all likelihood if we look at the circumstances today, if we look at the circumstances of the Memory market today, then I think it will be hard to say that for the full year, we're looking at a mid-market scenario. It's definitely not what we're looking at today, depending on when it's going to come back, and as Peter said, how it's going to come back. You could, on average, see a mid-market scenario. But at this stage, I think it's hard to say that we're looking at a mid-market scenario for that. At this stage, the Memory market in these months is fairly flat. So that's one important circumstance I think to recognize.
The second thing that I think changed from November 2018, and I think Peter already responded to that in the first question, is the multibeam. So the delay in the multibeam, we're -- I think we're going to see commercial application and commercial sales of multibeam only in 2021, we're at a Capital Markets Day, as you know and as we already told you also last year, we were still looking for 2020 as commercial application of multibeam. So that's, in essence, shifted with a little under 1 year. So that's the second circumstance to bear in mind.
The third thing that deviates a little bit from what we told you in the Capital Markets Day in November 2018 is a bit of accounting issue, and that has to do with High-NA. We are preparing for High-NA not just on the R&D side, but we're also preparing for High-NA on the manufacturing side and on the supply chain side. And we are incurring cost there that we cannot capitalize and have to run through cost of sales, which is a bit weird because we're not selling High-NA, but nonetheless, that's what the accounting will dictate you to do. And that represents a little short of 1% alone in gross margin. So those are 3 things to bear in mind that might be different from the perspective and the model that existed in November 2018.
So now let's look at this year, and let's look at the 46% to 47% that we have for Q1, and let's look at the potential for the rest of the year. And I think there's a number of drivers in there that I think could further drive the gross margin up. The first one obviously is related to the situation in the Memory market, and that is pretty important, not just for the top line but it's also very important for gross margin. Because if we see a solid recovery in the second half of the Memory market, that will have a significant impact on the sale of immersion tools, which, as all of you know, comes with pretty high gross margin and also with a good recovery in our voltage contrast business, which, as you know, is also very much tied to the Memory business. And again, that is a very high-margin product that we have. So if we get the recovery in the Memory market, that will also have a significant impact on the gross margin on those 2 elements alone.
The second element that will -- that is expected to further drive up the gross margin throughout the year is the EUV service. EUV service for the full year is still expected to be -- to have negative gross margin. But over the quarter-over-quarter, you will see a sustained improvement in the gross margin that we have on EUV service. For 2 reasons, first off, because, as you know, with a number of customers we have the pay-per-wafer model. And to the extent that EUV continues to go into high-volume manufacturing, obviously we get more revenue. And secondly, the cost that we have per EUV machine goes down because we get more efficient in doing it, and we also get scale effects as a result of that.
So quarter-over-quarter, you will see that the EUV service margin will improve. For the full year, it's still negative, but at least in Q4, maybe even a little before that, we will see that it starts to become positive.
Third improvement that we expect to occur in the course of this year will be the introduction of our new immersion tool, the 250 -- the NXT:2050, which, again, comes with a good improvement of our gross margin. So those are 3 significant drivers that we have, that we believe give us a good shot at achieving a significant improvement of our gross margin particularly in the half and a good shot at the 50%.
And then this 50%, we will be able to then sustain further into 2021, which, as Peter already alluded to, we think is going to be a very busy year. And a very busy year at that stage would also come with a number of scale benefits in our gross margin, better fixed cost coverage. And also in 2021, we would see the introduction of a successor to EUV that would also again, come with gross margin improvement. So then we think that momentum that would be created in the second half around reaching the 50% would then be further sustained and elaborated on into 2021 time frame.",1099

If I may follow up. I think the buyback announcement, as we're moving into high-volume manufacturing EUV, seems to be a bit of an inflection here for ASML begin the cash cow mode. So curious if there are metrics that we should be looking at whether it's free cash flow margins or working on working capital or perhaps CapEx intensity coming down as you've invested in EUV capacity, High-NA, multibeam. So curious if there's kind of a metric we should be looking at to gauge free cash flow in the coming years.",95

And then -- so in the short term, you will see that with the increase in EUV and EUV becoming increasingly important for the company, given the cycle time of EUV is significantly lower than Deep UV, in the short term, you may expect that inventory levels will continue to go up a little bit. That's a dynamic on the one hand. And also in the short term, as you -- as I think we've said before, you might expect that the CapEx level that you've seen for 2019, that will be above the CapEx level that you might expect for this year and for next year. So around EUR 900 million to EUR 1 billion is the CapEx number that we think is likely for this year and for next year. So those are dynamics in, I would say, in the short term.
In the years thereafter, I expect CapEx level to level off and actually go down because then the significant preparation for our future, I think, CapEx-wise, I think will have been done and will be able to go down. Also I would expect that in 1- to 2-year time frame, you might expect inventory levels to go down for a number of reasons. First off, at that stage, we talked about 2021, there is a significant buildup of our capacity for EUV. But once you are there and once you are at those levels, then the further buildup of inventory will no longer have an impact on your inventory levels.
And secondly, as we mentioned before, the way we believe we will be able to get an increase in our capacity from the 35-ish that we have for this year to the 45, 50 that we talked about for 2021 will primarily be the reduction of cycle time. And of course, the reduction of cycle time will then kick in and further reduce working capital requirement.
So in the short term, I think the burden on working capital will still be there. In the longer run, so let's say, 1.5, 2 years, you will see that we will be able to get it under control better.
One final dynamic as far as that is concerned, we talked to you in previous calls on the introduction of down payments for EUV, which we're pushing and where we had the initial accomplishments on that in 2019, and we'll continue to drive that. And that will also be a mitigating factor, if you like, in our working capital burden. So long-winding answer, just to tell you that in spite of all of that and in spite of this preparation for the growth, we're still looking at a pretty healthy free cash flow development, both this year and next year. And then the years thereafter, I think the free cash flow that we generate will further increase substantially. And all of that taken together gives us more than enough comfort to introduce this EUR 6 billion program for the next 3 years.",503

I had two questions. First one, on EUV. So Peter, it looks like your commentary on 2020 EUV of 35 systems at EUR 4.5 billion revenue and next year about 45 to 50 systems capacity is similar to about 3 months ago. I was in the impression that over the last 3 months, at the margin, there was more incremental demand from DRAM for EUV. So I'm just wondering, is it an issue that you're still capacity-constrained and that's why you cannot ship more? Or are you being conservative? And then my second question is, how to think about DUV units this year relative to 2019, would it be similar levels, lower, higher? Any color would be helpful.",124
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2020",2020-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3671.0,1893534.0,74151828.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,21,"Yes. On your first question, I actually -- I tried to answer that in an earlier question that the issue with 2021 is to make sure that we can reduce the cycle time so much that we can create a capacity between 45 and 50 units, which is a capacity issue, not a demand issue. So yes, DRAM will be there. I would just have to make sure that we can squeeze as many EUV systems out of our available square meters so that we can fulfill the customer demand. It's not a demand issue, it's a capacity issue.
So in joined essence, that's why the commentary is similar to what we did last quarter because the capacity lead time, fortunately, is a lot longer than just the customer order lead time.
Now on the DPV units, good question. Very much changes on, and Roger said it, on the recovery of the Memory market, yes? So the Memory is still very much driven by immersion. Of course, we are seeing with the increased number of EUV systems in Logics on cannibalization because of multiple patterning schemes that will actually move on to single patterning EUV schemes.
Now -- so if we would not see a recovery of the Memory business, which I do not expect, because we do expect recovery, clearly, the Deep UV units would be down. But it's really the timing of the Memory recovery that will determine how much of the Deep UV units we are going to see this year. As I said, it is really hinging on the timing of the Memory recovery.",268

I just wanted to ask or clarify on the extra R&D and SG&A for the first quarter that you've guided to versus where the street was? And just wondered if you could help decompose a bit the most important drivers and sort of what underpins them? For example, to what extent is this more about investing in faster cycle times for those 50 or 45 to 50 units in '22 -- '21? To what extent is it about increasing functionality of future EUV versions as we move beyond the 3400C? And to what extent does it hinge on any other key factors?",106

Dassen,,Executives,24,"So on R&D, last quarter, we were at EUR 516 million, this quarter, we're guiding EUR 550 million. And I think that the vast majority of that increase is labor cost increase. As we mentioned before, at this stage, we have about a capacity that we think we need in order to accomplish the R&D objectives that we have, which are all of the things that you just mentioned, but primarily focused on the Low-NA, High-NA road map, multibeam, but also a number of developments in Deep UV, obviously.
So we think we have the capacity that we need in order to get that done. And that's why we said on previous calls, expect the going out rate for the fourth quarter to be the basis. And then obviously, it needs to be, what we call, inflation-adjusted, which is obviously linked to wage increases for that. And that's what you see. So the 6% increase from EUR 516 million to EUR 550 million really is primarily the wage increase on the R&D department.
In terms of SG&A, SG&A, I think is modeled at EUR 140 million which is I think very much in line with what you saw in previous quarters. Q4 had a little bit of a spike. There was some accounting adjustments in there in Q4 that had a little impact. And also we're in the process of implementing a new IT system, which has some impact on the SG&A number. But those are small things. But the guidance of EUR 140 million I think is pretty much in line with what we were in previous quarters, and obviously, there to the wage impact.",277

I think on the wage impact, don't think we give our people 10% wage increase because they will probably raise a lot of questions when people start listening to this call, but it's the combination of the normally inflationary wage increase and the fact that of course we added people in 2019.

Is that more of a NAND Flash comment? Or should we think about that from a DRAM perspective?,77

I think if you split the DRAM and NAND, and I only -- like I said, the proxy that we have is basically looking at some utilization data. I think it is first noticeable in 3D NAND. I also think the slope of the recovery is a bit more aggressive in NAND than in DRAM, but they are both there. Having said that, I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that customers were creating underutilization in order to make sure that they could rebalance the supply and the demand in the Memory space sooner. That underutilization correction was also deeper in 3D NAND. So it was also not a big surprise that, of course, the return slope back up is also a bit steeper. So -- but that's where we are. I think 3D NAND started a bit earlier, it's a bit steeper slope, but both are trending in the upward direction.",153

So I was curious if you could give us that for the March quarter? Because I know that there's 4 shipment systems rather that are included from 2019. And then maybe just any thoughts on the cadence for 2020 just now, given that the 3400C is available for the full year?",84

I think we've indicated in the past that as soon as we really see that EUV is, in essence, going into high-volume manufacturing and also at a point where we can take revenue upon shipment that that would be the time where we're no longer going to give separate guidance on EUV shipments. So that is clearly the case by now. So that's the reason why, starting this year, we no longer do that.
What we do, do, however, is continue to indicate, at least for 2020, for the full year, we giving an indication of the euro value and also the number of units for EUV for the full year. And of course, we will report quarter-by-quarter. We will report to you what the euro number and the unit number of that will be.
As it relates to your second question on how is it distributed over the year, it's not completely evenly distributed. It's a little bit tilted towards the second half, but only -- but modestly so. So it's not as exacerbated, if you like, as we had it in 2019. There's a better balance, but it is still a little bit tilted towards the second half of 2020.",203

I just had two follow-ups on the Logic side, especially on the EUV front -- sorry, on the DUV front. So if I take your growth number for this year, just calculating EUV revenues alone, you're going from EUR 2.8 billion to EUR 4.5 billion. I'm assuming that much of that is going to be Logic shipments. And so if I put that EUR 1.7 billion of additional revenue, which, on the Logic revenue of EUR 6.6 billion last year, that's about 25% of additional growth in Logic for this year. I'm just wondering given that, DUV shipments would probably come down during the year, what kind of a decline in DUV are we looking at? Is it 3 or 4 units, in which case, you will still be growing your Logic revenues at about 20% or higher? Or will the DUV drop a bit more than that and you could be sort of in the 10% to 20% range of growth on your Logic side? 
And a short follow-up is on the EUV capacity. Given that you're seeing so much of demand for EUV right now, and you're saying that in 2020, it's more a capacity issue, otherwise, you probably could ship 50 units. What can you do to add capacity further into 2022 if this kind of strength, and especially if the Memory market -- the DRAM market comes in more strongly for EUV in 2022 and the Logic strength continues? Is there a scope to further reduce cycle time to take your unit shipments above 50? Or can you use some of the bays in your High-NA new facility for Low-NA systems, if that were to be required? Is there a way you can go above 50 units by 2022?",299

If you piece together the data points that we gave you, I think you can find sort of an answer to your first question. So as Peter said in the video, we're looking at a double-digit growth. If you do that math and you have a number that you arrive at. And then we gave you 2 other important components. On the one hand, indeed, as you mentioned, the EUR 4.5 billion for EUV, and also on this call, gave you the 20% increase over the installed base, which would get you to approximately EUR 3.4 billion. So then you can sort of calculate where DUV and apps combined where they would land for the year. I think that's what you're looking. And of course, as Peter said, it will be dependent upon the timing and the extent of the recovery, but we believe that the number that you derive in that way is a safe number to go by with some potential obviously if the Memory recovery is significant and timing.",187

Second question on -- when you look at the EUV capacity that we currently have and like I said, it will be driven by cycle time reduction because the lead time reduction for capacity adds is longer. Yes, for 2020 -- beyond 2021, we are looking to bring the output capability above 50. Now -- which is what we're doing today is really looking at how much should that be. If we have to go over 60, we probably need to extend square meters of production capacity at ASML and at suppliers, which could be, like you said, using production facilities that we're currently building for High-NA, use that for temporary use in a Low-NA. Although, we'd like to prevent that because you have been here, Janardan, I mean these bays are different, the high-NA bays are different than the Low-NA bays. So it would mean some extra cost, but if push comes to shove, you could probably do that. But I think we can -- with our cycle time, probably we can go over 50. But I think it will be very difficult to go over 60. So if we have to go over 60, then we probably need to quickly add some manufacturing capacity at ASML and at the supply chain.",214

Amit, I mean the easy answer is all of the above. Yes, we are seeing increase of lay account. The fact that EUV works also gives the customer the confidence on their road map and when they get confidence on the road map, you see a cadence change, there's a push, maybe a pull-in, yes? But also I think the discussion that we're having with customers and customers are having with us, although without going to very specific customer details, we will never do that, it's very clear that the number of tape-outs and the request from their customers, our customers' customers on different types of end applications is going up. So it is basically the combination of those 3 things, I mean you've mentioned them all. And that's what it is.

In Logic, and it's not so much leading-edge Logic, it's more the mature Logic systems. I think our current assessment of the market is a bit higher than it was at 2018. So if anything at the leading-edge, we're on plan. On the trailing actually, the more mature technology, I do see -- we see an upside, but no downside.",99

Roger, maybe on EUV services gross margins, just trying to understand like how much of a headwind it has been on -- at a group level in 2019. Obviously, you made a comment that it will get to -- it will still be loss-making this year. But basically, we have improvement through the year. So I'm just trying to understand how much of it has been already a headwind in '19? And then how quickly can that business ramp up towards a 40%, 45% services gross margins like you have most likely in DUV? Does it take 2 years, 3 years? Any color on that would be helpful.
And then secondly, on the mix, when you talk about this 45 to 50 capacity for EUV in 2021, can you help us understand like obviously Logic is a -- foundry is a big part of that number. But what are you hearing from Logic and DRAM customers in terms of the unit breakdown of that 45 to 50 unit number?",175

So on the gross margin impact of EUV service, that was around 2% for 2019. So that's the gross margin impact of that in 2019. As I mentioned to you, we do see it's coming to a positive number in the course of this year. I expect it to be at least Q4, maybe even before that that it will turn positive.
Before we have EUV service gross margin at the corporate gross margin level, I think we're probably 2, 3 years away from that. But the aspiration clearly is there to have it at that stage in that time frame.",103

So we're still dominated by Logic. But clearly, the 2021 numbers for DRAM are -- will go up as logical. I mean we have -- in the Logic space, we have several customers, in the DRAM space, we still have one so that's also an issue that will drive the division between Logic and between DRAM.

I had two questions. Firstly, just thinking about the Memory demand as we go through this year and into next year. Obviously, when we look at the last [ 2 ] years, going into 2018, we had a very strong increase. We had a doubling in '17 and then another 50% increase in revenues from Memory customers in '18. Now when you look at the next 2 years, obviously things may be a little different. And I know it's very difficult to give a pinpoint number, but I just wondered what do you have, in your scenarios, internally? Where do you see -- if Memory was to come back in 1Q? Where do you see Memory revenues for this year? And if it were to come back in 3Q, where do you see that coming? Any color that you can give us to help us get a rough sense of where we might end up would be very helpful.
And then secondly, just a question for Roger, just on OpEx. Just wondered if you could confirm whether the OpEx annualizing 1Q number would be a good proxy for the full year or whether there is anything else we need to think about.",207

Well, I think on the question on the Memory demand, I did give you some indication. I can repeat myself. But when I look at -- the best proxy we have is to just look at how our machines are being used. And that's why I said, I do believe that in the first half, and it's a bit difficult to understand the exact timing or to gauge the exact timing. They will be in the first half, I think our customers will come back to this more healthy supply/demand balance, and they will see this coming so they will place orders. So for us, it's going to be -- likely going to be a second half event. But having said that, I mean 2019 was of course a weak Memory market for us, also the first half of 2020 could be not very strong as Roger indicated. But when it come back to the second half, we will have an impact on our business, also on our financial performance.
But when the Memory goes -- comes back, then I think you need to look into 2021. I think I said it earlier, 2020, we do see strong EUV demand. I see no reason why the demand of our customers for leading-edge products in the Memory space, 5 nanometer will kick in then we will go down. But when the Memory recovery starts in the second half of the year, for us, is we'll extend it to 2021. So you would then have had effectively 1.5 years of a Memory downturn, which I think historically is not long and not short either. So it's just -- it all seems to fit, and this is the kind of call that I can give you based on top of what I already said.",302

Most of my questions have been answered, but just actually a clarification, Peter. Firstly, on whenever this Memory recovery occurs, I mean you can see how the customer utilization is doing. Your exposure to NAND is lower than your exposure in DRAM. But do you see that NAND utilization is rising faster than DRAM more or vice versa at this point because that will determine the timing of when your orders come in?
And then secondly, regarding these -- the multibeam tools that you're working on, you think -- at this point, is the view that these will begin shipping in 2021 and that's the -- that there could be even further accretion to the margin in 2021?",122

I think I will do the Memory recovery. Like I said earlier, with the slope of the utilization recovery is a bit faster, a bit steeper for 3D NAND, but it also come from a deeper point. So in that sense -- and yes, we have, as you mentioned, less exposure to the 3D NAND market, but 3D NAND market needs a lot of exposures. So I mean this is what we are accounting, and this is what we are seeing. So I think NAND probably rising a bit faster, I think that could be the conclusion.

I'd just like to understand, as you now contemplate 45 to 50 EUV units in '21, does this, in any meaningful way, accelerate your path to higher gross margins, more -- closer to DUV for your EUV business overall? Or there's nothing changed in terms of your gross margin scenario for this business unit? And then just briefly, your comment regarding the timing of free cash flow generation. It looks like over the next 3 years, you will have an acceleration in free cash flow generation.",91

So let's first talk about the gross margin for EUV. I do believe a further increase in numbers will improve our gross margin for 3 reasons. One is obvious, right? To the extent that, given the capacity that we have, we have a higher output, of course, your fixed cost coverage will improve. And as we mentioned, the increase in capacity will be achieved by reducing cycle time and will not be achieved by further Capex. So that's why more units will result in gross margin improvement. That's one element.
The second element is to the extent that we have more of these tools in the fields, that also means that our service margin will, in all likelihood, improve because the number of -- the more tools we have in one location, the more efficiency we have in having our service crews there. So then the efficiency per tool will further increase.
And thirdly, not necessarily related to the number of units, but since you talked specifically to 2021, as I mentioned, that would also see the introduction of the successor to the 3400C, which, again, we are hopeful will bring such value to our customers that the gross margin will benefit from that. So yes, a number of reasons why I think -- why we believe gross margin for EUV will continue to further improve through 2021 and beyond.
On the free cash flow question, I think that is right as well. So I mentioned to you that in the very short term, the working capital burden that we have from further growing to, let's say, this capacity level that we talked about will be there. Because given the cycle time, it will mean that we have to take significantly more inventory on-board to get it done. But then, at a certain stage, you will see the offsetting factor of the fact that cycle times get reduced.
So I think in this 1-year window, you will see a spike and then a leveling off as a result of the reduction of the cycle time. And as I also mentioned, we do want to get down payments more as the default in our commercial model. And that should also at some stage, lead to an offset in the working capital burden.",382

Most of my questions answered, but I just want to clarify a couple of small points. So first of all, based on the tone of this call, it sounds like 2021 will probably be an accelerated growth year relative to 2020? I want to make sure that that's a reasonable assumption?
And then secondly, I realize you guys can't time the exact recovery of Memory. But from a historical perspective, when you look at when the Memory market recovers, what type of sequential growth you expect in the initial first batch of recovery if I look at Q-over-Q number?",102

Wennink,,Executives,63,"Well, I think the second question is always impossible to answer. I mean it is a -- you could say the Memory business is quite different than it was a couple of years ago. I mean 6 players in 3D NAND, 3 in DRAM, so those patents will also be a function of the composition of that market and the individual position of those companies in that market. So that's really, really difficult to use historical rates as a proxy for what's going to happen now.
I think yes, 2021 could be an accelerated growth year. However, Roger said it, I mean even without the assumption on the recovery of the Memory market and the growth of the Memory market, we'll always see a double-digit growth here this year based on Logic and on the Installed Base Management. On top of that, we could see a recovery of the Memory market. So I think you could see an acceleration this year also. Now that's not for the full year, all right, granted, because we do expect it in the second half. So -- but it will definitely continue. Like I said earlier, once this Memory market recovers, it doesn't recover for 2 quarters. I mean it recovers for a longer period, like it always does on top of the Logic market. So I think we're looking forward to some acceleration.",230

Dassen,,Executives,1,"Well, these are unprecedented times for sure. And in unprecedented times, you need to make your choices and need to set your priorities, and the priorities for ASML are pretty clear.
First priority, obviously, is to keep our people and their families, to keep them safe. That is absolutely the overriding principle.
And second, we want to make sure that we continue to serve our customers and being able to continue to really deliver on our road map. Those are the key priorities that we have set. Obviously, we take a number of measures to make sure that we can make up to those promises and those commitments.
Safety measures. For instance, as it relates to our factory, to the clean rooms, we make sure that they are completely isolated from the rest of the campus. Also within the clean rooms, we have very stringent safety measures applied such that our people are very well protected. We also make sure that in between shifts that isolation takes place. So we have a bunch of measures around the factories.
People outside of the factories, in essence, work from home. The vast majority of the people outside of operations work from home. Of course, we have very, very stringent travel restrictions. Of course, there are the formal travel restrictions, but we also have our own travel restrictions in addition to that. And we leverage many best practices with our peers, with the customers, with the suppliers, just to make sure that whatever best practices are out there to keep our people safe, and nonetheless, be able to deliver on the commitments that we have towards our customers that we leverage those best practices and that we continue to be best-in-class in that regard.",291

Dassen,,Executives,3,"So on the manufacturing capability, I would say the impact so far is limited because we have been able -- in all manufacturing locations that we have, we are able to continue to be fully operational. So that's good news. Of course, there are inefficiencies as a result of, for instance, the quarantine measures that have to be taken. That's for sure. If you just think about installations that you have to do at customer sites, so installations, field upgrades, et cetera. Obviously, all the travel restrictions and all the quarantine rules that are out there, of course, they do create significant hurdles there. But so far, we have been able to, nonetheless, be able to serve our customers. Thanks to, first off, the commitment of our engineers. They go above and beyond what can be expected from them in these circumstances. You have to recognize that, for instance, an engineer traveling to a certain location, upon arrival there has to go in quarantine for a certain period of time. And then sometimes, upon coming back has to go into quarantine as well. So there's a double whammy in terms of quarantine there. And in spite of that, people are just completely dedicated to go.
We also use new technology in order to allow remote access to what's happening in factories. So we use virtual, augmented-reality type technologies to really support the teams that are out there locally in the field with the knowledge that we have more centrally.
So those are the measures that we take on the operational front. So inconveniences, inefficiencies, but at the end of the day, we are still able to keep our operational capability fully intact.
On the supply side, we did have a few suppliers that have been confronted with temporary closures. We have been working around those and I think, we can say that at this stage, all those instances where that has happened, we have been able to find a solution. Solution could obviously be that the closure has been lifted, but solution can also be that we have been looking at workarounds. And the workaround could be, for instance, to find an alternative supplier, workaround could be to find new solutions for ourselves. So through hard work and a lot of creativity from our engineers to find a solution to circumvent that issue.
So at this stage, I think we can say that the issues that did pop around the closure have been resolved. But listen, we need to continue to monitor this, and we do monitor this very, very closely. And as soon as we get any indication that there might be an issue, we immediately start looking into different solutions, which could also include, looking at safety stock and making sure that for certain parts where there might be a heightened risk that we build a safety stock as much as we can.",485

Dassen,,Executives,5,"At this stage, the demand actually looks really good. If you look at our order intake for the quarter, it has been really good, EUR 3.1 billion, including 11 EUV PO. So from that angle, order intake has been very strong, and we have had no pushouts or cancellations in the year. So from that vantage point, if you just look factually what's going on, demand is still very, very strong. And there's a reason for that, obviously, because a lot of the investments that our customers are making through buying our equipment are, of course, strategic in nature, right? So these are strategic investments that they really also need for capacity building on a go-forward basis.
Customers also realize that the lead time for our systems is longer than anything else that they have in the fab. So from that vantage point, it is smart that they -- the last thing they would ever cancel is our equipment. So that's pretty straightforward. And depending on how customers look at -- how they come out of the current situation and depending on what their perspective is on the recovery beyond this point, they might also look at a recovery that could be such that all of a sudden, there is a significant pent-up demand that they need to cater to. And for that, they obviously need the latest and greatest technology from our side. So those are fundamental reasons why customers might think twice before they really push out or cancel our equipment.
I think the longer-term perspective, that obviously is the big issue. And there, I think there is a number of different driving forces that we need to look into. On the one hand, you could say, if the world ends up in a recession somehow, then it's fair to say that some of the end markets that, of course, we have to look into as well, think of smartphones, think of automotive, et cetera. Of course, some of those end markets are correlated to GDP, right? So to the extent that GDP would take a hit, it is fair to assume that also some of those end markets might take a hit.
On the other hand, it's also clear that you might be looking at a number of applications that in today's environment are in higher demand than ever, right? So anything that is related to working at home, obviously, is in high demand. So anything related to notebooks, advanced communication systems, but also data warehouses, I mean, those products are in very, very high demand. So I think we will have to see and so do our customers with whom we are in very, very close contact at this stage and who tell us that at this stage, they're still looking at fab operations that they say are pretty novel. But of course, they are looking as well, what's happening and how will ultimately, this balance between the different factors that I just mentioned, how will that pan out.

Dassen,,Executives,7,"Well, of course, critical for the CFO, right? So -- and I guess for good reasons. Given the uncertainty that we just talked about, uncertainty short term, medium term, I think, it is prudent to look at cash preservation.
Our starting point is very healthy, right? So if you look at our starting point, if you look at the quality of our balance sheet, if you look at the cash that we have at hand, if you look at the flexibility within our business model, the flexibility of our cost structure, I think our starting point is really good. But the way we look at cash preservation is not just for ourselves. We also look at cash preservation in order to make sure that our entire ecosystem, including our supply base that we can support them in the current environment. So that's why cash preservation is very important to us.
So in that regard, we took a number of measures, recently. In the press release that we issued a couple of weeks ago, we indicated that we paused the share buyback in Q1 after having done EUR 507 million of share buyback in Q1. And we also said that we wouldn't execute on share buybacks in the second quarter. So that is a first significant measure in terms of cash preservation.
Secondly, we are looking at head count. We will still grow in head count also for the remainder of this year, but we will only grow in head count where it is related to what we call business critical, right? So only to the extent that it's really business critical. So related to our capability, related to the R&D that we think is essential, only then will we grow in head count.
And thirdly, we are looking at OpEx and CapEx. And also there, we apply a pretty high hurdle in terms of business criticality. And only to the extent that we think it's business critical, then we will continue with certain OpEx and CapEx projects.
Again, there, I think it's key for us that we continue to -- that we continue the development around future technology road maps. So anything related to that, including the High-NA program, the accelerator is pushed down and will continue to be pushed down because we think it is critical that also coming out of the current situation that we are able to provide our customers with the greatest technology and the latest and greatest tools that they will need, in order to then cater to the demand that in that recovery situation will come up.",433

388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2020 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2020",2020-04-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,1551.0,2011617.0,78715294.0,Answer,R.J.M. Dassen,,Executives,9,"Sure. So revenue came in at EUR 2.44 billion. And you should compare that to the EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.3 billion that we originally guided. Two main deltas there, in that regard.
The first delta, so the first gap to the original EUR 3.3 billion to -- EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.3 billion guidance that we gave is related to installed base revenue. Installed base revenue came in at EUR 857 million, which is about EUR 100 million shy of where we guided. So -- and the main reason for that is that we didn't get the machine time of customers that we needed to complete some field upgrades. And also, it took a little bit longer for some customers to have the final acceptance of some field upgrades done.
So as a result of that, we have a little bit of revenue around this EUR 100 million revenue that will shift into the next quarter. So it's not gone for the year, but it's just shifted away from Q1 into the next quarters.
The second delta is related to system sales. And there, we have about a EUR 700 million delta, about EUR 200 million in Deep UV, EUR 500 million in EUV. And again, there, this is not revenue that is lost for the year. We think this is revenue that will shift into Q2 and Q3, in particular.
So let's look at those components. So on Deep UV, the EUR 200 million, there is primarily related to shipments that we have planned to Wuhan and also some other places where as a result of very stringent COVID-19 restrictions, we're looking at significant restrictions in getting equipment shipped or -- and/or installed. So that's the main reason, about EUR 200 million Deep UV revenue that we missed as a result of that at in Q1. And we're working very, very hard now with those customers to get that into the next quarter. So again, this is a mere delay from one quarter into the others.
The EUR 500 million EUV is -- can be decomposed into 2 categories. One category is that we had less shipments in this quarter than we originally envisaged, and that's the result of 2 events. One, as I mentioned, we had a few issues where we had supplier closures, temporary closures. So that led to some supply chain issues around EUV. 
We also had some longer-than-planned cycle time on EUV and on the completion of EUV systems. I will address those a little bit later. But that combination led to this quarter only 4 systems being shipped, which was lower than we originally anticipated. So that's one angle. Again, we're on track to still get to the 35 EUV systems that we planned for the year. So we will make up for that in the remainder of the quarter -- of the year. But for the quarter, obviously, that means that we only had 4 systems shipped.
In addition to that, of those 4 systems, we could only recognize revenue for 2. And the reason for that is that we had customers that, in light of the situation and in light of the travel restrictions, the transportation restrictions, logistics restrictions that they looked at, they said, ""Give us the tool as soon as you can."" And that meant in that instance that 2 customers said, ""Give us those tools before they are really tested within your own factory."" So just ship them to us even though the complete testing program has not yet been executed.
And the result of that is that we can only recognize revenue on those 2 tools at the point in time where the tools are installed at the customer and then the acceptance of the customer happens at the time that the system is fully installed at the customer's fab. So 4 systems shipped, but only on 2 of those, revenue could be recognized. For the other 2, this shifts to the second or the third quarter at the point in time where the final acceptance at the customer site happens. So that's it on the revenue side.
On the gross margin side, we had a gross margin of 45.1%, lower than what we guided, driven by 2 events that I already mentioned. First off, lower Deep UV sales that I mentioned before, which typically is high-margin business and also lower field upgrades that I mentioned. And that combination led to a deterioration of the gross margin percentage.
Net income for the quarter, EUR 391 million. And as I already mentioned, the order intake for the quarter, EUR 3.1 billion, including 11 EUV systems.",779

Dassen,,Executives,11,"So if you look at the way EUV is developing also at the technological front, it's interesting to look at the February SPIE Conference that was out there. I recommend that to all the analysts to look at that. There is a good website with a lot of good material on there. And I think what that echoes is the confidence of the entire ecosystem in EUV. So it's very clear that not just ASML, but the entire ecosystem is completely ready and very, very active in the continued development of EUV. So really good progress on that front within the entire ecosystem.
I mentioned the longer-than-planned cycle time. That is related to the modular vessel, and we talked about the modular vessel and in-line refill, in the past. Those are essential elements in increasing the serviceability and also the availability of the EUV tool, and that was introduced on the 3400C. And as we said, the 3400C that is shipped in this year, all those 3400Cs are in full configuration, including the modular vessel and the in-line refill.
The increased cycle times that we had, so the longer-than-planned cycle times that we had were on that front. So it was, in particular, related to the in-line refill as part of the modular vessel. So that is now being addressed. So we're now addressing and you actually see that week by week, we get to improvements in the cycle time as far as that is concerned. And we are on track to actually get to the target that we've set for ourselves by the end of the year because as we also said last quarter, it is important for us to reduce that cycle time because that is necessary to get our total capability, our total capacity for EUV production by 2021 to the desired level, and that's a level between 45 and 50. So that is the capability and the capacity that we're driving towards to get there. And the improvement of cycle time is a critical element to get there. So nicely on track to get there. So week by week, you see an improvement on that front.
As I mentioned, for the year, with all the caveats and the current uncertainties associated with that, we're still looking at 35 EUV shipments for this year, even though the quarter started mild with only 4 shipments, we're still on track to get there, again with all the caveats that I just mentioned.
On the gross margin front, we're making good progress. And we believe that the -- at least 40% gross margin target that we set for EUV systems that we're able to get there this year. And also, as we've indicated, we want to be a breakeven on EUV gross margin in the course of -- on EUV service gross margin in the course of this year.
And finally, High-NA. As I mentioned, we keep the accelerator pushed down on High-NA, making good progress there also with our partners in order for us to be able to get the first R&D tools for High-NA shipped to customers by the 2021, 2022 time frame.",525

Dassen,,Executives,15,"So as I mentioned, at this stage, revenue looks good, right? At this stage, as I mentioned, we have -- we had a solid order intake. We had no pushouts, no cancellations. So from that vantage point, it is looking good. And if you look at the shipment plans that we have for the quarter, based on the orders that we have and based on the requests that we have from customers at this stage, then Q2 can be a really good quarter. And 2Q, we should be looking at a 50% improvement of revenue over Q1. So 50% higher than Q1. And also at the gross margin level, we should be looking at a significant improvement of gross margin over the gross margin that we recognized in Q1.
So -- but you have to look at that in the context of everything that's going on. And we cannot escape from the uncertainty that has been introduced as a result of the COVID-19 situation that we currently face. And we have said, in spite of the fact that we're looking at the good set of facts, we cannot ignore that environment and that uncertainty. And as a result of that, we have said -- we believe it is prudent to not give formal guidance for the second quarter. So that's why we have said we're not giving guidance for Q2.
The same applies to the full year. So again, for the full year, if we look at the current demand and if we look at the current shipment plans that we have, that should really enable us to achieve the numbers that we've talked about before and also the numbers that we've -- and the goals that we've talked about in the previous quarter. But again, there, in light of all the uncertainties related to COVID-19, we believe, giving any guidance on -- also on the full year is not appropriate.",321

Dassen,,Executives,17,"This is not a boring time, for sure. We're really focused on doing the right things, doing the right things from a safety perspective, taking the right risk mitigation efforts. And -- but keeping the accelerator down in terms of the continued development of our technology road map. So we will be frugal, absolutely. We will be financially very conservative, but we do keep the accelerator down in terms of the development of our longer-term road map. And we think that is critical because as soon as things start to normalize, you will definitely see that customers want to have the latest and greatest. They want to have the greatest technology and tools because they will then look at a new and high -- increased demand for highly advanced nodes, and we need to cater to that demand. So that's why we keep on pushing down the accelerator, including High-NA because from that vantage point, the longer term looks very, very bright. I mean there's no doubt in anyone's mind that semiconductor-based applications will continue to significantly grow in the next couple of years. And we have to provide the solutions to our customers in order to do that.
So from a longer-term perspective, we definitely still like what we're doing. We definitely still like the long-term prospects. And let me just say on behalf of the leadership of ASML, how proud we are of our company and of the people that we have, the creativity, the resilience and the unbelievable commitment that our engineers out there in the field, that everyone in the company is really displaying in this moment in time is deeply impressive.

Wennink,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2020 Results Conference Call. I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. 
And before we start our normal quarterly results review, I would like to first talk about the topic on everybody's mind, which is the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation. Well, these are unprecedented and challenging times and the COVID-19 pandemic affects all of us. Our primary goal at ASML continues to be to ensure, as best as we can that our colleagues and their families stay safe. Our second goal is to ensure that we continue to serve our customers and to secure the delivery of our product road map, including the continuity of our supply. We have been taking and continue to take precautionary measures to limit the risks. Most of our nonmanufacturing employees now work from home and travel is restricted. In China, our colleagues are returning to the office, but also there, we remain vigilant. 
In our own facilities, we have implemented a restricted access to our manufacturing facilities worldwide, and in particular, our clean rooms to ensure our colleagues can work safely. We put in place measures to help ensure isolation between shifts. We've also implemented additional safety and cleaning protocols to minimize contamination risks. We work closely with our customer, suppliers and partners to share information and determine best practices. We see a lot of creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry and overall, as we work to manage through this crisis. 
To date, we have experienced limited impact on ASML's manufacturing capability, although there have been additional challenges with absenteeism, transportation and support logistics that we have had to manage. Some of the quarantine requirements have had an impact on our efficiency, while travel restrictions have posted challenge for installs and major upgrades. We're working with our customers to plan ahead and find creative solutions such as the use of remote monitoring, augmented reality solutions and diagnostic technologies to aid in the service and repair of systems. With regard to our supply chain as some of our suppliers have experienced temporary closures resulting from governmental lockdown and shelter-in-place orders. 
At this stage, we've either been able to work around these temporary disruptions or the closure has been resolved. We are managing risk via alternative sourcing and again, a lot of creativity. We're closely monitoring the status and will use safety stock as much as possible to ensure minimum interruption. At this point in time, we've been able to find solutions for these challenges. Regarding customer demand, we've currently not seen a reduction in demand this year and we have seen a strong order intake. I will talk more on this later. 
On cash management, although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure. We feel it's prudent to preserve cash should the situation continue for an extended period of time, not just for our own operation, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances and Roger will talk more on the detailed actions. You will all understand that in this environment, it's difficult to determine how things will develop, how long it will last, and the impact this will have on the global GDP development that can affect our entire industry. We're taking the necessary steps in terms of safety, risk mitigation and financial measures to best manage through these challenging times. It's very encouraging to see the creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry overall.
Now I would like to turn our normal quarterly results process. Before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter. And Roger will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our -- on our future business outlook. 
Thank you, Roger.",682

I will first review the first quarter financial results and then make some comments on the second quarter of 2020. I would also provide more detail around measures we are taking with regards to cash management. 
Net sales came in at EUR 2.4 billion, below our original guidance of EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.3 billion, which was primarily related to COVID-19 impact. Net system sales of EUR 1.6 billion was again heavily weighted towards Logic at 73% with the remaining 27% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business. We actually shipped 4 EUV systems in Q1, but we're only able to recognize revenue on 2 systems, which I will explain in more detail later. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 857 million. This was around EUR 100 million lower than guided due to lack of access to machine time as well as a delay in acceptance of upgrades. We expect these upgrades to translate to revenue in Q2. 
Let me provide a bit more detail on the items that occurred in the quarter that resulted in a system revenue shift of around EUR 700 million, consisting of a Deep UV-related revenue shift over EUR 200 million and EUV-related revenue shift of over EUR 500 million primarily related to COVID-19 impact. 
First, we experienced some delays in Deep UV shipments to customers in Wuhan, China as well as other customers due to operational and travel restrictions regarding COVID-19. We are working with our customers to prepare for these shipments in the next quarters. Second, we experienced some issues in our supply chain as a result of a temporary disruption from EUV component suppliers that encountered operational restrictions due to COVID-19 regulations. These supply chain issues have been sourced for now. Also we experienced longer than initially planned EUV cycle times for the first NXE:3400C models in final configuration, primarily driven by the complex deployment of inline 10 refill as part of the modular vessel. 
Cycle time related to this aspect is now being reduced every week and we are on track to achieving the aspired cycle time reduction envisaged for the end of this year. As you know, this is an important element in achieving the capability of 45 to 50 EUV tools in 2021 and beyond. As a result of the longer-than-expected cycle times as well as COVID-19-related supply issues, we saw some delays in EUV shipments for the quarter resulting in fewer system shipments than originally planned. Third, due to concerns around the continued ability to ship systems in the current circumstances, some customers have asked us to expedite the delivery of EUV systems in the quarter by shipping the systems before the normal factory acceptance tests. The implication of this is a delay in our revenue recognition as final acceptance will now take place after successful installation at the customer side. We expect the revenue that we were not able to recognize for Q1 as a result of the issues listed above to shift to Q2 and Q3 of this year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 45.1%, also below our original guidance, primarily due to a combination of delayed field upgrades as well as delayed Deep UV systems revenue related to COVID-19 impact. Overall operating expenses came within guidance with R&D expenses at EUR 544 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 130 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 507 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q1. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.1 billion.
Moving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 3.1 billion, including EUR 1.5 billion from 11 EUV systems. Logic order intake was 66% of the total value with the remaining 34% for Memory, again reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for leading-edge lithography for this year and next year, but also indicating a recovery of the demand for Memory. Net income in Q1 was EUR 391 million, representing 16% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 0.93. 
With that, I would like to make some comments on Q2 of 2020. As Peter mentioned, we have not seen a reduction in demand this year and we continued to see a strong order intake, up around 28% from Q4. Based on current plans, without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter with revenue up potentially over 50% from Q1 and a significant improvement of gross margin. We are still planning to execute to current plan. However, due to significant uncertainty in this COVID-19 environment, we decided it is prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2. 
Finally, on cash management. Although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure, we, like many of our peers and customers, are dependent on the short and longer-term implications of the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to these uncertainties, we feel it is prudent to preserve cash should the situation continue for an extended period of time, not just for our own operations, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances. We have decided not to execute any share buybacks in Q2 2020. This decision follows the pause in the execution of the program in the first quarter after having already performed share buybacks under the new program for an amount of approximately EUR 507 million. The previously announced 3-year share buyback program of up to EUR 6 billion to be executed in the 2020-2022 time frame is still in place. 
We have also implemented measures to limit our growth in the workforce. Nonbusiness-critical vacancies have been put on hold. We continue to hire for business-critical positions. This way, our workforce will grow less than originally planned this year. We are also postponing any nonbusiness-critical OpEx and CapEx. However, we will continue to invest in the development of future technology road maps, including High-NA, at an unadjusted pace in order to allow our customers the continuation of their road maps once the situation has been normalized. 
As communicated last quarter, ASML has submitted a proposal at a 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a total dividend for 2019 of EUR 2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend payment of EUR 1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",1134

Many investments of our customers are strategic and support their technology road maps, a lifeline for our leading-edge customers. These strategic investments are, therefore, primarily related to leading-edge equipment, such as EUV and high-end immersion scanners, requiring longer lead times and qualification schedules. 
It was also confirmed recently by leading-edge customers that have also told us that they see an unabated demand for leading-edge devices, at least throughout this year. Keep in mind, the lead time and the qualification of lithography systems are the longest in the fab, and customers will not want to jeopardize any adjustment to their technology and capacity ramps that will negatively affect their ability to keep serving their leading-edge customers. As the current situation is very fluid, we're meeting with our customers on a more frequent basis to understand any changes they may be seeing regarding demand outlook. In general, most customers are still indicating that they are continuing relatively normal fab operations so far. Logic customers are currently continuing to ramp their 7- and 5-nanometer node in support of end market applications like 5G, AI and high performance compute. 
There are also some positive sign being reported on data center demand as well as demand for notebook and communication infrastructure driven by the significant increase in work from home and virtual learning activities. These applications drive the demand for both Logic and Memory. However, it can also be expected that consumer-related electronics, for example, smartphones, may be under stress, in addition to the potential negative impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on GDP. 
We expect installed base business to continue to scale with growing installed base numbers, and we'll also see EUV contribute to service revenue as these systems are running wafers in volume manufacturing. We currently have plans for upgrades of several customers, however, with the realization, there is a supply and a demand risk in the current environment. 
Our bookings show an increase in Memory over the prior quarter driven by Deep UV, while Logic continues to show a transition from Deep UV to EUV ordering as customers' confidence in EUV increases, translating into more layers in Logic production. On EUV, along with the industry, ASML continues to make progress in ramping EUV technology in high-volume manufacturing as was recently showcased at the SPIE Lithology Conference in February. Our customers continue to adopt and ramp EUV in high-volume manufacturing in both Logic and Memory. And one of our Memory customers recently announced that they have successfully shipped 1 million of the industry's first 10-nanometer class DRAM modules based on EUV technology. They also stated EUV will be fully deployed in future generation of DRAM, starting with its fourth-generation 10-nanometer D1A next year. 
We continue to target EUV revenue of around EUR 4.5 billion from 35 systems this year, thereby assuming that we will not face any significant supply/demand risks, as mentioned before. On margins for EUV, we continue to drive profitability in both the systems as well as the service business. And we're still on track to achieve at least 40% system gross margin this year and breakeven with our EUV service business by the end of the year. Increased customer confidence in EUV technology is translating to strong EUV demand in both Logic and Memory. This is reflected in the strong order flow in the first quarter in support of our 2021 output. As mentioned in earlier calls, we're currently working towards a capacity of 45 to 50 systems in 2021, which we feel can be achieved through reductions in cycle time. We continue to make progress on our next-generation EUV technology, High-NA and are on track to ship the initial development systems in 2022. 
Now regarding our outlook on the quarter and on the year, based on the current customer demand plans and without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter, with significant improvement of gross margin, as Roger mentioned. We're currently in execution of this plan. On the full year, customer demand is currently strong as well and the current shipment plans would position us well for another year of growth. However, there is a significant uncertainty about how the current COVID-19 crisis will impact the global GDP development and markets, our manufacturing capability and supply chain. In light of these risks and uncertainties, we decided it's prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2 and for the full year 2020. 
Again, these are unprecedented and challenging times, but we will get through it. The world looks a lot different today than it did 3 months ago. Though it is hard to make predictions and we're certainly not adding opinions, we continue to look at the facts day-by-day and act accordingly. We're taking the necessary steps for the safety of our employees, the community and our customers as well as the necessary risk mitigation and financial steps. 
I would like also to take the opportunity to thank the entire ASML team and their families as well as our many partners who stepped up in these demanding times in support of our company and our stakeholders. I've seen great examples of teamwork and incredible creativity to make sure that we can continue our work, serving our customers by keeping our people and partners safe. Despite the fact that the current environment provides clearly near-term challenges and uncertainties, the positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in our future growth scenarios.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",943

My first question to you, Peter, is that you've seen very great order strength in the first quarter. Is this order strength, essentially, what -- if you remember in January, it said that you were hoping the Memory orders would come in through the year. It was these Memory orders coming in, which caused this order strength? Or was it something else like customers were worried that they could -- they may not get tools from you and so they expedited their orders to -- and brought them forward from later in the year, which is what caused this order strength? And my second question, which is a follow -- not a follow-up, but with regard to your 40% gross margin indication in EUV for the year, is -- I mean given this -- the social distancing, et cetera, associated with -- which you may be implementing even in manufacturing, will that not have an impact on the cycle times and thus the gross margin?",168

Let me answer this first question. I think the order strength, and I think Roger said it, about 2/3 of the order intake was Logic and 1/3 was Memory. So I don't think it is an acceleration of it. It is something that we would -- that we expected. Also driven by, I think, what we observed as a continued increase in utilization in the Memory space of our machines. So that actually fits in quite nicely. I don't think there were pull-ins either. These orders are there to support our outlook for 2021 and this was planned. So basically, you could say it's more a confirmation of the technology road map that our customers have in front of them. So in that sense, good. 
On the gross margin indication of 40%, the cycle time impact, we've been able to manage. I mentioned it. We did see an increase in absenteeism in the factories because of the guidelines that people followed by the government, the health authorities, basically saying, if you have symptoms like some of the COVID-19 symptoms, you should stay at home, which people did, even when they had a cold, which actually meant that we did have, indeed, some shortages in the factory, but we've been able to reorder shift patterns. And also what we're seeing is that people that are eligible to work in the factory, for instance, on R&D environment, they are now also working in the factory to make sure that we can do the output. So I think we can manage and I don't think it will have an impact on the 40% gross margin indication that we gave you.",278

Just following up on one of the comments that Roger made in terms of how you're looking to, I guess, in some respects, support your supplier base. Can you just give us a little bit more detail about what you're considering there? And are there any particular suppliers that you might be worried about where a particular other part of their business might be, I guess, heavily, or that was exposed that we've seen a very sudden downturn? Just a little more color on how you're planning to support your supplier base.",97

Let me answer that. I think we are managing our suppliers almost on a day-to-day basis. And most of what we see in the supply chain currently are delays in delivery of modules that are a result of those, let's say, lockdown situations or shelter-in-place situation where we need to find different solutions leading to a delay of parts. However, as you pointed out, when this situation lasts longer, we also could see that some of our suppliers that are also exposed to other industries that currently are not in the, perhaps, somewhat more enviable position where we are, they might be looking for help from our side. And then that help would largely be requests for prepayments. Now we don't see that yet. But I would expect if this lasts long that this would come and they want some prepayments on orders when our demand profile stays as strong as it is.
Having said that, you have to look at the -- at our integral supply chain, which includes our customers. I mean what is true for our supplier is also true for us. So we are, of course, also in discussion with our customers to say, listen, we need to look at the continuity of the supply chain from an integral point of view. So if we need to prepay suppliers, I need prepayments from our customers, yes? So it is almost, you could say, it's a back-to-back link in terms of potential financing requests. I'm pretty sure that some of them will come, yes, and especially in those areas where, as you pointed out, some of our suppliers are losing significant business in other industries. 
So this is what we are -- we don't see it yet, but I mean have been around long enough and also in some other crises, going back to the Internet bubble burst and then the financial crisis and 9/11, there will -- in the supply chain, some potential issues will pop-up, that will just happen. But again, we need to look at this from an integral point of view, from an integral supply chain point of view and our customers play a significant role there also which, by the way, we are in discussion with them and I think these are good discussions. So I'm pretty positive that we can help those areas in our supply chain, which could become critical going forward.",403

And just one follow-up on the R&D side of the business. As you said as many as can are working from home, but I presume you haven't closed on R&D facilities because, I guess, a lot of the work you do still needs to be, I guess, physical tests, particularly in the case of High-NA and work that's going on there.",64

I think if you really talk about the physical tests, I mean that is done in clean rooms and we build modules. So that's an agreement and we talked about this. I mean we have very strict regulations there now almost for -- I would say, almost for 2 months and they are effective. On the R&D side itself, it is -- when we look at the latest productivity numbers, which we follow on a day-to-day basis, I think 90% of our R&D engineers, they work from home. But with the current possibilities that we have in creating virtual teams and working off-site, I can say that I'm pleasantly surprised with the productivity numbers that I see, whether it's the number of design sign-offs, whether it's the number of software builds, the software calculations. Our IT infrastructure is holding up very well, which we prepared, by the way. So that's going well. 
And when we look at those productivity numbers, they actually are very similar to the productivity numbers that we saw before starting to work at home, which I think is very good, which is also attributed to the flexibility of our people. You see also in the log-on numbers that people make much longer hours. I mean they log-on the same time, but they log-off much later. So there's a lot of working in the evening. And we check very regularly with our managers across the company of how we are doing. And there's a lot of virtual teamwork going on, even leading to virtual drinks in Friday afternoon where they all sit together in front of the camera with a glass of beer.",277

EUV, the last question is, it's really Logic. So very few EUV orders. That will come -- sorry, very few EUV orders for Memory, and that will come. So it is predominantly Logic. And the strong Memory bookings are -- I actually said it earlier. They are also the result of what at least we're seeing in terms of utilization of our systems in the Memory space, both in DRAM and in NAND. The trend, we -- the cautious trend that we saw at the end of Q4 of last year has continued in terms of increased utilization throughout Q1 until -- very recently until last week. So the trends are upward. So that explains why Memory bookings are going up also because customers see this also.",128

I think we mentioned why Q1 was about EUR 100 million below our guidance and we gave you the reason for that. It is the lack of machine time that we had on particular upgrades that we were doing. And as a result of that that will fall into Q2. And other than that, in the installed base business still looks good. So the number that we talked about in the past is a number that has still relevance with all the caveats that we talk about in the entire call around the current uncertainty. Indeed, the EUR 3.4 billion is the number that we talked about on the Q4 call. So that's a good recollection of what we mentioned there.",123

I think when I answer, you have to take into consideration that customers, for instance, do, do relocations. So we might be shipping to a DRAM fab, a leading-edge machine that is replacing a machine that was on a pedestal that now goes to NAND. So there is some relocation there. But I would say that the Memory intake is driven by DRAM. And then with the caveat that we do obviously see some relocation out of DRAM into 3D NAND. But I would say if you would have to answer and say, where is the -- what's the emphasis, the emphasis is on DRAM.",106

Very helpful. My follow-up, can you speak directly to how you're thinking about cycle time improvements on EUV? And as part of that, what will it take to get the ability for you to have double-digit shipments on a quarterly basis, which it looks like you need to do to hit that 35-unit forecast? And I guess as part of that, should we be thinking about the potential for customers to expedite again in the coming quarters and therefore, perhaps maybe revenue on 1 or 2 tools gets delayed into '21?",93

Wennink,,Executives,23,"Well, on the last point, I mean it's April 15, so I don't know what's going to happen in December. So that's not what our customers tell us today. Our customers tell us today that they want the 35 systems. On the cycle time improvement and our ability to ship double-digit numbers, we are planning and without any supply chain or capacity disruptions because of COVID, we will ship double-digit numbers in this quarter in Q2 of 2020. So we have that capability. And when you look at this, and let's say, customers have a number of 36 units that they want, it's not 9999 every quarter. That's not how it works. And it works when do the customers need it because it's their ramp schedule that is going to determine when we ship. 
For instance, in Q1, we only shipped 4 systems, but we planned before the COVID-19 impact, 6 in Q1, not that we couldn't make more, it just -- it also has to do it with when the customers need the machines, yes? So we will do double-digit in this quarter, yes? And actually, it means that we have the capability, which is, of course, very important to get to the 35 numbers. I think the cycle time reductions -- and was one of the earlier comment, we have some absenteeism in the factory. We're dealing with that. I think we will get to the cycle time reductions as planned and we will have the capability to do 35 systems this year.",255

But as we said before and I have said for some time now that when you look at EUV, EUV is cannibalizing, you could say, some multiple patterning layers. So there will be a reduction of Deep UV systems in 2020 and that will be more than compensated by the sales number in EUV. And that's logical. That's what we've always said. EUV is there to cannibalize multiple pattern and layers. Now how much that in the end will be, it's going to be somewhat now lower. It's not going to be significant, but that is the trend. It's a trend going forward. As you can also see from our 2025 Capital Market Day information, where you also see that in 2025, the Deep UV numbers are lower than what they used to be and that's because EUV is going to replace those.",167

So Peter and Roger, from your prepared remarks, I understand like the near-term of COVID-19 played out clearly not so bad for you and your value chain and that you're managing very well logistics disruption and more like the supply side of the story. Now, of course, my next concern is what happens next. And I hear you that we have very little visibility, so it's very -- it's impossible to make like a near-term forecast. But my question would be like a what-if question. So let's assume that in the second half of the year, demand for PCs, servers and smartphones are down 20%, 25% year-on-year. If that happens at a high level, how do you see your clients impacted -- are impacted? And how do you see that's impacting ASML? 
And I have 2 specific like question marks in mind. One is, in that kind of scenario, would your clients push out EUV orders? Or do you think they need to take orders anyway because they need to take your supply of the technology? And then the second one I had in mind was what about a very steep decline risk in DUV because I imagine that if volumes are not where they were expected when rollout plans were made 6 months ago, I would expect a lot of reuse of DUV tools as node migrations continue.",235

Wennink,,Executives,33,"So -- but what I would answer is that if you don't know where you're going, you'd better be flexible, yes? And this is what we're organizing. We're organizing for flexibility in the supply chain. As you know, 80% or 80% plus is in the supply chain. That means that we -- very like with every crisis, we hardly ever saw cancellations. We saw pushouts. So it basically means you would be looking at in the supply chain financing of working capital, which is also particularly important in the context of the answer I gave to a question earlier, what do you want to do in the supply chain, which I think is an integral supply chain problem, which includes our customers. I mean they cannot do without supply in the end either. So it's a working capital issue, which I think is manageable. 
I think from a flexibility point of view, we have a lot of cost flexibility here with our variable cost on labor. It was a lot of variable cost, it's like variable income to our people, which, of course, when the business goes down, that will go down also. I don't think there will be a lot of pushouts for EUV orders. What our customers are telling us now. And when I listen well to them, they are not blind. They see that the impact on GDP will be recessionary. And that will very likely have an impact on consumer spending and on the consumer electronics. What they do notice is that the customers of our customers are not blind either that the demand on the leading-edge Logic, which includes 5- and 7-nanometer is still strong. 
I mean our customers tell us every time, every week that we talk to them, please stay on target with your shipments of your leading-edge machines. Now if data centers would require 25% less service, which, by the way, if you think about it, it's probably that it's -- then something very bad has actually happened because we need more data center capacity and not less, yes? So -- and that's where the high compute goes, yes? So I think push out of EUV orders, it can always happen. I don't think it's going to be significant. We're not planning for an Armageddon scenario where the entire world economy crumbles into an abyss. We were not planning that. I don't think it's going to happen either. I think it's a low likelihood. 
So all in all, I think we're flexible enough. I think EUV, with the -- with key focus on leading-edge solutions that our customers' customers need is going to be relatively safe. And I think reuse of Deep UV tools is -- the story of reuse of Deep UV tools has always been very prominent in every cycle. But you need to realize that when you look at leading edge, it's not only EUV, it's leading-edge Deep UV, but you need Deep UV not so much for the geometrical shrink, you need it for overlay, yes? And that is very important for those new leading-edge devices. So the overlay requirements for an NXT:2050, which will be our leading-edge immersion tool, is significantly different than in 1980, because in 1980 we will not be able to do what the 2050 should be doing to make sure that they can support our leading-edge nodes. So reuse will be limited. It simply has to do with the fact that the requirements that are needed for leading-edge nodes for Deep UV tools are different and they are also more difficult for the older generations to achieve.",604

You talked about improvement in the supply chain. You talked about sequential revenue growth that could exceed 50%, but you're not providing a guide, not even for Q2. What is it out there? And we are halfway through April. What is it out there that makes you uncomfortable given what you see in the next 2 months? I'm not asking about the second half, I'm asking just the Q2. And I have a follow-up.",88

No, I fully understand your question, Mehdi, because we always say, well, we have very long lead times in the supply chain, which is true for the critical suppliers like, for instance, ZEISS. We have, in the end, if you take Tier 2 also thousands of suppliers, which some of them have lead times which are a lot shorter. We've had delays in EUV in Q1 of a couple of weeks because one particular supplier couldn't provide rings, your flow rings, which is not the most advanced part that we need. But if you don't have it, you don't have it. So this is where our concern comes from. It's the tiered supply chain, which is not always that visible to us. 
We have tiered suppliers coming from Malaysia, Mexico, you name it, and they are supplying to our Tier 2 and Tier 1 suppliers. And if that supply basically stops then even a part that has a relatively short lead time doesn't arrive on time, and we get a delay. I think, ultimately, we get those parts, it's just a delay. And if we tell you, if we give you a number and we get a significant delay in some of those short lead-time parts, we cannot ship tools and that can be significant. You may remember that the 3400C now is EUR 130 million tool. That's a big number. And I don't want to give you a range from x billion to y billion. That doesn't make sense, yes? So this is where it comes from, yes? 
And I think it is really based on the experience that we've had in Q1 where we were able to manage it, but we did see some delays. And since we cannot judge what the impact will be of these governmental orders in different parts of the world, we cannot assess what that risk is. But it's there because we've seen it. We've been able to manage it with a lot of creativity. It doesn't give me any assurance or certainty that we will be able to manage it going forward always. So this is where it comes from.",359

Just had a question on the services business. I'm trying to understand it a little better. So I'm guessing you guys are able to do some of this remotely. But can you maybe walk us through how much revenue you guys think will come back? How much revenue you may have lost in Q1? And then how it would work if, like, we get out of the shelter in place, say, earlier? Would that be a lot of pent-up demand where you see a snap-up? Or does the services business kind of actually just get hit and some of the revenues are lost?",109

Dassen,,Executives,43,"I think the revenue, Mitch, that we lost in Q1, as we mentioned, is around EUR 100 million and it's primarily related to certain upgrades. I would say it's not even related to COVID-19 in particular. It was related to the fact that we didn't get sufficient machine time from customers. So that revenue we missed for Q1, we'll get it in Q2. There's hardly any doubt in my mind, we will get that in Q2. And other than that, I don't think there is going -- as far as we can see right now, we don't see any anomalies. So at this stage, still on track for the EUR 3.4 billion in IBM revenue that we talked about in the previous quarter.
As we also mentioned in the video, and as Peter talked about in the introduction, we are deploying new technologies, right? So of course, we're less able than we were in the past to have people go from Veldhoven from Wilton, et cetera, and go to the customer locations for obvious reasons, for the travel restriction and what have you. But by using artificial -- by using virtual reality, augmented reality type technology, we are able to support the huge local support teams that we have with very specialized knowledge that we have at the different hubs. And in that way, so far, we think we're still well positioned to keep up providing the service and the upgrade work that we need to do.",247

Wennink,,Executives,44,"One additional comment here, it's more anecdotal, but actually, we were preparing as a kind of a prototype project somewhere deep in the organization, how could we support remotely through augmented reality and HoloLens, basically people sitting 6,000 kilometers from the actual service action. And then we have now over-the-shoulder 3D augmented reality support that service engineers with 6 months of training that would normally have to do this after a 2- to 3-year training, we're now operating and doing service actions with the support of experts that were sitting 6,000 kilometers away and basically providing them with 3D images, how they should do the service actions and it works. So this is also something that amazed us also. And actually, our service levels, we keep up all our service levels up in terms of maintenance and servicing of our tools, which I think is a really good achievement.",149

Peter, maybe one question from my side, on the services. You mentioned that so far, you've tried to do a lot of remote working and local team assisting to get maintenance and upgrades done. How should we think about the EUV installation part? Do you have teams in place at customer fabs or at customer locations to make sure that EUV installation can still go ahead as per plan, at least during Q2, if travel restrictions are not lifted?",83

Wennink,,Executives,47,"Yes, that's a very good question. Luckily, we have 3 main sites where we do EUV and that's also the sites where we have most of our service engineers. I mean we have to think of 1,000 plus. So there is a lot of experience there. And this is exactly where this remote support comes in. We do send people across the globe, but that's where we have hundreds of people, hundreds of people traveling, it's now probably not more than 50, 60. They have to go into 2 weeks of quarantine. They have to get a special travel visa. So we need to plan and prepare this much more rigorously than we did in the past. And this is where we do send experts. But I think a lot of these service actions that are not of the really topnotch expert level are being trained and being done with the kind of novel remote support technologies that I just mentioned. So it's a combination of both. And I think we'll be able to do all the installations. We have been able to actually do that and we are. So yes, we still do travel. It's not going back to 0, but it's a fraction of what we were able to do, but it works",215

Then, Roger, on the services side, you mentioned EUR 3.4 billion is still in sight for the full year. Can you help us understand like how much of that -- within that will be EUV specifically? And also how much of losses for EUV services can we expect? I know you mentioned breakeven, hopefully, by the end of the year. Because the thing that I'm trying to understand is how much of a drag on services gross margin has EUV been last year or maybe this year, just to help us get to what the number should be going forward.",107

Dassen,,Executives,49,"Let me be very short on that. So for this year, I think quarter-over-quarter, what -- so if you compare the last quarter, so Q4 to today, that would probably account for 0.5% in gross margin. So the improvement in EUV this year is going to account for about 0.5% in gross margin for the year. So that's an answer to that question. In general, if you look at the EUR 3.4 billion, it's about 50-50 in terms of regular service and maintenance, if you like, and upgrades. And the regular service and maintenance, EUV is still a fairly small number, given, of course, the installed base for Deep UV is so much larger. But the impact on the gross margin percentage, about 0.5%.",124

Wennink,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 results conference call. First of all, I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. And before we start our normal quarterly results review, I would like to provide you a brief update on the COVID-19 situation. I think thanks to the commitment, engagement and creativity of our people, we managed the quarter very well and this translated into growth in both revenue and profitability in the quarter. And Roger will, of course, provide some more details on those results.
Although we experienced some challenges early in the quarter around supply delays and increased absenteeism, we did not encounter any new disruptions due to COVID-19. We continue to operate with special measures in place around isolation and contamination protocols to ensure the safety of our employees and to reduce the risk of operational disruption. Even though this created some initial inefficiencies and production delays, operations capabilities are largely back to normal.
Regarding transportation, logistics and customer support, we were able to continue to secure flights to meet customer shipment requirements, and we have managed to support our customers in this challenging environment. We have significantly increased the capability of our teams in the field to more independently support the customer and continue to deploy more novel, remote diagnostics and augmented reality support. Maturity of this remote technology has accelerated throughout this COVID period, and we expect to deploy even more of this in the future.
In summary, we've been able to successfully navigate to the current environment and our operations capabilities are largely back to normal. And -- but as COVID-19 is not yet behind us, we will remain vigilant to ensure the safety of our employees while providing the best possible customer support.
Thanks again to our people and everyone in our supply chain who did an outstanding job servicing our customers during these challenging times. And now I would like to turn to our normal quarterly results process. And before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the second quarter as well as provide our view on the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q2 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook.

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter financial results and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2020.
Net sales came in at EUR 3.3 billion. We executed quite well considering the risks in the COVID-19 environment, translating to strong growth of more than 35% over Q1. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized revenue on 7 systems in the quarter. Taking into account the additional approximately EUR 260 million of revenue from the net 2 systems we didn't recognize in Q2, this would hypothetically have resulted in revenue of around EUR 3.6 billion and a growth of around 50%.
Similar to Q1, some EUV systems were expedited for shipments without factory acceptance testing in Q2. We expect to recognize revenue on these systems at site acceptance in the second half of the year. We shipped 9 EUV systems in the quarter with 4 systems not receiving factory acceptance testing, meaning 5 systems recognized revenue upon shipment. For the 2 systems that shipped in Q1 but did not receive factory acceptance testing before shipment, we were able to complete customer site acceptance tests and recognized revenue this quarter, bringing the total to 7 EUV revenue systems in Q2.
Net system sales of EUR 2.4 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 62% with the remaining 38% for Memory. Although Logic remains very strong, Memory has been growing over the last 3 quarters as a percentage of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 887 million. This brings the total of installed base revenue in the first half to around EUR 1.7 billion.
Gross margin for the quarter was 48.2%, a significant improvement over Q1, primarily due to deep UV mix and an improvement of the EUV installed base gross margin. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 567 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 131 million. The effective tax rate was higher, 18.5% based on a one-off tax assessment recorded in Q2. Net income in Q2 was EUR 751 million, representing 22.6% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 1.79.
Turning to the balance sheet. ASML paid EUR 565 million in dividends or EUR 1.35 per ordinary share in Q2 together with the interim dividend of EUR 1.05 per ordinary share paid in Q4 '19, this resulted in a total dividend for 2019 of EUR 2.40 per ordinary share. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.4 billion, which is EUR 300 million higher than Q1.
Moving to the order book. Q2 system bookings came in at EUR 1.1 billion, including EUR 461 million from 3 EUV systems. Order intake was balanced between market segments with both Logic and Memory at 50%. Logic demand continues to be strong with Memory increasing as a percentage of bookings over the past 3 quarters.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2020. We expect Q3 total net sales of between EUR 3.6 billion and EUR 3.8 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 850 million, which is driven by strong demand for field upgrades and growing service revenue with a more meaningful contribution from EUV service.
Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 47% and 48%, which is a little below Q2, primarily due to deep UV mix with fewer immersion systems. We've previously highlighted a number of levers that could positively impact gross margins in the second half. These levers being a richer mix of deep UV, more immersion less dry, primarily driven by the Memory recovery; second, growing EUV service revenue; and third, improved immersion margins from our 2050 system. These levers remain and provide the opportunity to achieve 50% gross margin in Q4.
The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR 545 million, and SG&A is expected to come in around EUR 140 million. Our estimated 2020 annualized effective tax rate is still expected to be around 14%.
Finally, I would like to talk about capital allocation and working capital. Our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. In the next few years, we expect to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, cash that will not be required to support the future growth of our business will be returned to our shareholders in a combination of growing dividends and share buybacks.
Regarding investments in our business, we plan to have CapEx at levels previously communicated in support of future technology and required expansions. Regarding working capital, we are working our way through a transition period. We come from a period where contracts did not include down payments and actually provided extended payment terms for customers given the maturity curve that our EUV tools were on and are moving into a direction where we ask for down payments of EUV tools, reflecting the long lead times and early supply chain commitments that ASML has to enter into. This means a temporarily higher level of working capital in 2020 with a plan to significantly reduce this level in 2021. All in all, we expect to see a significant increase in the generation of free cash flow in the course of the second half of this year. Once this occurs and the risk profile for our entire ecosystem has returned to acceptable levels, then we will resume the execution of share buyback in line with the plans that we have communicated earlier this year, EUR 6 billion over 3 years.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",946

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a strong quarter with over 35% growth in revenue and improved profitability. In this challenging macroeconomic environment, we saw growth in both Logic and Memory markets, which is a reflection of our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. With significant work-from-home and remote learning activities continuing, segments such as data center and communication infrastructure continue to be strong. Demand for consumer-related electronics, for example, smartphones, maybe under some near-term stress due to the economic impact from COVID. And our customers indicate they see continued strength in end markets, requiring advanced nodes, and this is reflected in our stable demand.
For 2020, our growth expectations that we indicated at the start of the year are largely unchanged despite the disruptions caused by the worldwide COVID-induced crisis. We, therefore, expect a year of double-digit growth in sales and profitability. In Logic, customers continue to ramp advanced technology nodes, 7 and 5-nanometer. In support of the buildup of the digital infrastructure, driving end market applications such as 5G, AI and high-performance compute, requiring leading-edge equipment, which have longer lead times and qualification schedules.
We expect Logic demand to remain healthy, which continues to drive demand for EUV systems as well as our other products. In Memory, customers are continuing to indicate that they are seeing signs of recovery, driven by healthy demand in data centers and expectations of improved demand in consumer electronics. Increasing lithography utilization levels support this view and with this continued trend in mind, it's understandable that we see additional demand in the second half of the year. This is supported in our bookings, with Memory increasing as a percentage of bookings over the past 3 quarters.
Sales to China continued to grow and accounted for 23% of our systems revenue this quarter. This is driven by demand from both Logic and Memory customers in China, and we expect sales growth from the China region this year. Regarding changes to the U.S. export rules that went into effect at the end of June, we expect minimal impact to our business. And regarding the impact of recent U.S. restrictions, it's difficult to determine how near-term dynamics will evolve, but when you look at the end-market demand and the growing digital economy with secular growth drivers, like 5G, AI and high-performance compute, the demand for semiconductors for these products will continue and it will fuel future innovations. Wafers and products to support this technology and innovation will be produced somewhere in the world, and it will certainly require advanced lithography.
On our installed base business, we still expect significant growth this year. First half of the year, we realized revenue of around EUR 1.7 billion, and we expect a similar level of business in the second half of the year. Services business will continue to scale as our installed base grows, and EUV will contribute in a more meaningful way to service revenue as these systems run more wafers in volume manufacturing.
We expect significant demand for upgrades as customers utilize upgrades to increase capacity and improve imaging and overlay performance. On EUV, this technology has now entered the realm of high-volume manufacturing and is an integral part of our core operational activities as evidenced by the large EUV share of our sales in Q2. We've successfully implemented the improvement to the modular vessel we discussed last quarter, and this vessel is designed to deliver higher availability. With 9 shipments this quarter, we have shipped 13 systems in the first half of the year. And as COVID-related transportation and support risks are now lower, we plan to resume the normal qualification process, including factory acceptance testing, meaning we expect to recognize revenue at shipments on all systems in Q3.
We plan to be back on track with our cycle time reduction plan in Q3, and I feel comfortable about our capacity to produce and ship double-digit numbers of EUV systems per quarter. We're therefore still targeting a revenue of around EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems this year.
On EUV margins, after more than a decade of investments in EUV, we're well on track to improve profitability in both systems and service. EUV service margins are expected to break even in the second half of the year, and EUV system gross margin is on track to meet or exceed the 40% target for the year, still planning a capacity of 45 to 50 systems next year. This is planned within our existing factory footprint by reducing cycle time in our factory to around 20 weeks by the end of this year.
We currently have a backlog of 54 systems with 28 system orders for 2021 delivery, covering over half of this capacity, and we expect orders to continue in the second half of the year in support of the 2021 demand. Understandably, customers are currently reviewing how COVID will impact the global economy. And as we proceed through the second half of this year, we will have a better view of how this ultimately translates to the technology ramp plans next year.
In our deep UV business, we shipped the first NXT:1470 to a customer. This is the first dry NXT system. Building on the NXT immersion platform with significant improvements in matched machine overlay and productivity, helping our customers to deal with the increasing cost of complexity when introducing new nodes. The higher output per fab area from an NXT system also maximizes fab capacity and therefore, customer profitability.
Our applications business shipped the first generation multi-beam inspection system, the eScan 1000, targeted for 5-nanometer nodes and beyond. The eScan 1000 demonstrated successful multi-beam operation, simultaneously scanning with 9 beams. The eScan 1000 will increase throughput up to 600% compared to the single e-beam inspection systems targeted for in-line defect inspection applications.
In summary, although the macroeconomic environment provides some challenges, we see stable demand and a strong second half. Our 2020 sales growth expectations are largely unchanged from the beginning of the year. We expect Logic demand to continue to be healthy with an expected Memory recovery in the second half, and we expect a continuation of the significant growth in our installed base business as already seen in the first half of the year. Meaning, we still expect double-digit growth in sales and profitability in 2020. Although we, of course, do not yet know the full impact of COVID on global GDP and how this will translate to end market demand in the coming year, the COVID crisis told us that the expanding digital economy with secular drivers such as 5G, AI and high-performance compute provide significant opportunities over the long term. Our 2025 growth trajectory is, therefore, still very much intact.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",1136

So I'm just going to ask the 2 upfront. The first one is just the commentary about Memory demand being -- coming in stronger and you guys are still seeing high-quality bookings in Logic. So first question is just basically for '21, is there a scenario where you could actually see growth in both DUV and EUV units in kind of a more bullish scenario? Or are you seeing customers kind of opt to just buy more EUV systems?
And then secondly, I just wanted to double-click on kind of the gross margin comments. I thought that was just to be up a little bit more in Q3, so what is kind of the trajectory in both EUV and the corporate margin as we get to Q4 and beyond?",135

Wennink,,Executives,10,"No. I think if you see a continued uptick of the Memory market, which will have a positive effect on the deep UV immersion systems, you could see both of them, yes? So it's really a matter of a strong demand continuing Logic and a continued strengthening of the Memory market. I could see that happening. But in general, of course, the more EUV layers that are chosen by our customers will take away deep UV layers. So you could argue if there is and if it's only a technology transition, you would probably see a cannibalization of deep UV versus EUV. But if you have a capacity ramp, then both in Memory, and you see the capacity ramp in Logic continuing, then you could see both numbers up.",129

Dassen,,Executives,11,"Let me take the question on the -- on gross margin, and maybe the best way to do it is just give you the bridge for -- between the 3 quarters. So moving from Q1 to Q2, the improvement that we saw in gross margin. Two main drivers, I would say, one is the deep UV, the deep UV mix; and secondly, IBM, Installed Base Management margins. So those are the primary drivers to get you from the gross margin we had in Q1 up to the 48.2% that we recognized in Q2.
So then from Q2 to Q3, you see a slight deterioration in the gross margin. And that really is down to the mix in deep UV, where we expect to have less immersion systems in that mix in Q3 in comparison to Q2. And then going from Q3 to Q4, where, again, as we said, we think that the 50% up is achievable in the current plans that we see. Main drivers there, again, immersion, but this time positively, so there would be more immersion in the mix. And secondly, an important driver there, again, would be EUV service gross margin. A result of 2 things, on the one hand, bringing down the cost per EUV machine. And on the other hand, as Peter alluded to it, the fact that these tools are getting into high-volume manufacturing, which means that also the wafer output is increasing as a result of that, the revenue will increase as well. So that, in essence, gives you the bridges over the 3 quarters and the basis for the potential to get to 50% up in Q4.",275

Roger, one for you, if I could, just on your comments on the cash flow and capital allocation. You said for some of the points, I think CapEx, in particular, that you expect it at previously communicated levels, so that's clear. But in terms of working capital, can you help sort of quantify the pressure a bit more for us. Clearly, there was significant working capital outflow during the first half of the year. Is that expected to continue into third quarter, perhaps start to improve by fourth quarter? Just a bit of help around that would be useful. And also, the point you made about once this sort of transition is clear, then you would plan to return to the share buyback. Is that something we could expect by the fourth quarter of this year? Or is it more likely to be into next year? And again, it's sort of is there any metrics you can give us that could help guide there?",168

Happy to do that. So you're right. If you look at the first half, you would look at a negative free cash flow, you would actually see that in the second quarter, it already started to become positive. But if you look at the full half year, it would be a negative free cash flow, not unlike I should add what we saw in last year. And last year, you saw a similar pattern. The expectation is that in the second half, we will -- that will change and there will be a significant in working -- in both the working capital but also in the free cash flow generation. And the main reasons are the reasons that I pointed out in the initial comments, so it's associated with the fact that on the one hand, we are entering into a period where we are actually asking down payments on EUV tools. But that takes time and that takes contractual renegotiations. So that's one element.
And the second element is that based on the old contracts and the old contracts on the base of which we're still executing quite some shipments, those actually provided for extended payment to customers. So that's the situation that we find ourselves in on the, let's say, the accounts receivable side. Secondly, as you will appreciate with the ramp that we're doing and with the increase that we're seeing in EUV, obviously, that also means that from an inventory perspective, that leads to an uptick as well. So those are the 2 main dynamics why it is the way it is. 
So my expectation is, and I won't give specific numbers, but my expectation is that, indeed, you will see a significant recovery of the free cash flow generation in the second half. More or less along the lines of what we saw last year, where you also saw a very significant recovery. Maybe not at that level. Last year, it was pretty spectacular. The way it picked up in the second half given the ramp profile and given the AR profile that I just talked about, I expect a little less in the second half of this year in comparison to last year, but nonetheless, a very significant improvement. And once we see that, and once we see that, that free cash flow generation starts to become healthy again, we also conclude that the main risk our ecosystem are more or less under control. 
At that point in time, yes, we do believe that -- and we can start executing on share buyback again. And that could be this year. That could definitely be in Q4. And our expectations as it relates to the free cash flow generation would be in line with that model. That indeed, in Q4, we can start generating and can start executing on share buyback again.",480

And just a quick follow-up. I mean it's a fairly minor point. Given the COVID-19 issues this year, not only did you stopped the buyback, but of course, you didn't declare an interim dividend either, which you had started with last year. Would the intent be to return to that sort of phasing in '21?",56

Dassen,,Executives,16,"No, no, just to be clear. So the interim dividend that we do is an interim dividend that we would do in the -- at the end of the year. So what we said, we declared an interim dividend in November of last year and we said that, that was the plan that we had. So it's not like -- so we had an interim dividend in November. Then we had the final dividend in April right after the AGM, and that's the pattern that, in essence, we are looking at again. So if everything remains normal, then you would see that pattern repeated in the next year. So November interim dividend and final dividend in April.",117

Wennink,,Executives,19,"Yes, I think that's a very good question. I think when we think about 2021, and we look at the situation today as compared to, let's say, 6 months ago at the beginning of the year, I mean it's -- it may not be a surprise that in the boardrooms of our customers, but also of our peers and ourselves, we -- the level of uncertainty as to the GDP environment and -- has, of course, gone up. So I mean there's a high level of uncertainty on what that could mean because we haven't really got a very good assessment, and as a quantifiable assessment on what 2021 means. And I hope you'll understand.
Now having said that, the -- as I also said in my prepared remarks that the innovation and the road map innovation of our customers are still continuing, which is true for Logic and is true for Memory. And as it relates to EUVs, particularly for DRAM and for the 7 and the 5-nanometer expansions. That will continue, there's no doubt in our minds. Now when we then look at 2021, what can we see at this moment in time? And as you know, I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know how 2021 is going to look from a macroeconomic point of view. But when you take our 2020 guidance, if you want to call it this way, we said Logic as compared to 2019, flat; Memory as compared to 2019, 30% up; installed base, 20% up to a level of EUR 3.4 billion. You take those numbers, you come to a number. Now -- and if you take that as a 2021 targeted number and look at where we are today in the discussions with our customers, on Logic and on DRAM and of course, with all the caveats that I just mentioned on COVID-19, we could still see double-digit sales number growth in 2021.
That's based on what we see today. Now the only -- the biggest difference with now and 6 months ago has to do with what I started off with, where the level of uncertainty is, of course, different today than it was 6 months ago. But this is where we are. And I think we'll probably get some more clarity over the next 2 quarters towards the end of the year, we'll probably get a better view on what this all means and we have the first quarters of the COVID-19 and GDP impact behind us.
Now I hope, Amit, I just gave you a little bit of our guidance, and I also hope that you understand that we, at this moment in time, it's very difficult to be quantitative on 2021.",455

That's helpful. And secondly, as a clarification, if I may, looking at your bookings number, three EUV systems for about EUR 461 million suggests it was a mix of 3400C and potentially 3600D tools and clearly, a higher ASP of around EUV 160 million for 3600D. And as we look towards 2021, are you in a position to at least give us some help in terms of how we should think of the mix of shipments of 3400C and D?

It will be a mix of 3400Cs and 3400Ds. So you have seen this mix also in the ASP of the bookings, I mean, as you pointed out. But this is the trend going forward. I think the first half of 2021 will probably be more skewed towards the Cs, but then it will translate into the Ds. So the second half of the year, you will see Ds. And we're going to ship the first, let's say, plan to ship the first 3600D this year. That's -- there's only one. So that will be a year of ramp of the D version in 2021. And I said -- like I said in my prepared remarks, we are preparing the capacity, as we talked about, to be between 45 and 50 systems. And yes, you will see that transition using that capacity from Cs to Ds throughout the year, like I said, second half will involve the Ds and in the first half of the year, a mix.",169

So that's the kind of improvement that we're eyeing for that.",87

I think the EUV business for next year will be predominantly Logic. But yes, we will ship the first EUV systems to DRAM. It will be a limited number of -- there will be -- the layer application for the first DRAM node for the first EUV application in the DRAM node will be limited, just probably one layer. But it will grow in the nodes thereafter. And the DRAM road map in terms of node introduction has actually accelerated somewhat. So I would expect that the introduction of this one layer node will happen next year. But in '22 and '23, that will accelerate. And I think we have models up to potentially 5 layers in DRAM, but that's not in the node for which we'll use EUV next year. The majority of our shipments in 2021 on EUV will be for Logic.",145

That's the point in time where the lines between, let's say, emerging gross margin and EUV gross margin need to get close or cross.

Peter, maybe a question on the bookings again. Obviously, the bookings number is EUR 1.1 billion for this quarter, much lower than what we have seen over the last few quarters. I know you already have a large order backlog. I think you mentioned about EUR 10 billion in your interview this morning. So I guess, how much of this is a function of your customers basically saying, okay, let's hold on, we already have a lot of orders backlog with you, let's wait for those orders to be fulfilled? And how much is it a function of the fact that they themselves have limited visibility on what the shape of recovery will be on the macro side as we go into the back half of the year? Can you just help us understand like what are you hearing from your customers on that front?",149

I think you just mentioned it. I mean I can repeat your question as an answer in the sense that you just touched on all of it. Yes, we have seen over the last 2 quarters, that's Q1 and Q4 of last year, about EUR 5.6 billion in total over those 2 quarters. That is basically adding up to an order backlog of EUR 10 billion with -- even for 2021, already 28 systems slated for 2021 shipment for EUV, which is more than half of our production capacity. And mind you, we're in the middle of 2020. 
So I think that, of course, gives the customer the confidence that they have secured a significant part of their capacity ramp. If you add to that, that in Q2 of this year, of course, the full extent of the COVID crisis and the uncertainty associated hit the boardrooms of our customers that they also said, listen, yes, there's a higher level of uncertainty, I think that has definitely played in this particular situation. Having said that, I think in the discussion with our customers, we are very confident that we will keep booking EUV systems throughout the remainder of the year. So -- and I would be -- I think by the end of the year when we do our Q4 conference call in 6 months from now, we have a very good view on what 2021 is going to look like and I think we'll probably be fully booked. And what that fully booked means is fully booked on the demand of whatever is going to be. But we're preparing, like I said earlier, for our capacity, 45 to 50 systems, just in case our customers come back and said the demand for 2021 is going to be that high and I want you to make those systems. 
So the preparations for the capacity are ongoing, what the ultimate demand of customers will be is a function of what I just said. And that level of uncertainty has clearly gone up as compared to 6 months ago what it's finally going to be. But all in all, I can only repeat 2021, when you take our, let's say, guidance, you could say, for 2020, you add up those numbers, we see a real opportunity based on what we see today of, again, a double-digit growth in 2021.",398

I think it has to do with the fact that the road maps are accelerating. I mean I can probably go back to 2018 when we -- all right, at these conference calls or during these conference calls that one thing has now changed, and that is that EUV has turned the corner. And I think EUV gives a very clear road map to our customers to start thinking about an economic way to continue with their road map so you can shrink at affordable cost. And that meant that we saw the road maps of our customers accelerate or at least the 2-year cadence in their design road maps are still there. And on top of that, with that new technology, with those new nodes, they could provide their customers, which are much more now in the space of 5G of platform companies, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, the electrification of the automotive industry. 
The customer base has expanded so much to make use of that technology. Now -- and to just -- in the discussions we have with our customers, we really see -- we have these discussions that certain of these nodes, these new nodes, I'd say, the 5 and 7-nanometer nodes might be as big as the 14 and the 20 and the 28-nanometer node. Because of the fact that the customer base has expanded so much and they're going to make use of this more economical transition of these nodes. It basically is going to provide a lot of value. And this is why this length of this cycle, if you want to call it, but it's -- you could say it's just the multiple cycles, closer together with a bigger customer base, that looks like it's one big cycle, but there are more cycles. It's innovation cycles driven by more customers and basically shorter. And that's what's happening today. And I think it's also thanks to EUV, I mean, we can now make this economical.",333

No, no, EUV will work. And the guidance was really driven by the market scenarios. Are we talking about a low market scenario or a high market scenario, this will drive the number. 
Now I can only go back to what I said earlier and what it is going in the end, I'm not going to comment that on -- in a quantitative way. But what I said earlier, if you take our 2020 guidance, we see real opportunity of what we see today, I think it is realistic to soon we see double-digit growth also in our 2021.

I mean we're not -- it is just the timing when customers require those systems. I think quarter-on-quarter, there could be big differences, half-on-half could be big differences. I think really looking year-to-year, that's a longer period, that makes sense. It shouldn't make those periods too short to compare because they are big changes. The big tools, customer shipment patterns vary quarter-to-quarter quite significantly. So that's a bit dangerous to draw any conclusion from that. Operator? Skip?",109

If you look at to the challenges that they had to deal with, I mean, they were committed, engaged, creative, and this is why, I think, the company is in pretty good shape. So first of all, thanks to our people. 
But I think how do we manage? Yes, I think we have to look at the fact where we're still procuring our parts. We're building our systems, we're shipping them, we're upgrading them. They're servicing our customers and Q2 was not without challenges, especially the first half. I think I want to make a distinction between the first half of the quarter and the second half. First half, we had some supply issues because of lockdowns. Absenteeism around the world. But that, actually, the second half of the quarter came back to normal. And that's actually -- we're in pretty good shape. So of course, depending on any unforeseen outbreak of the COVID-19 around the globe, I think we're managing well.",172

388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q2 2020 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2020",2020-07-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,864.0,2082104.0,81697829.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,3,"Yes. Q2 results were pretty good. We had EUR 3.3 billion in sales. Now that could have been EUR 3.6 billion. Because of the COVID situation in Q2, we had some delays in the production in the beginning of the quarter, and that's why we shipped 2 EUV systems without FAT, factory acceptance test. So the revenue will be recognized for those 2 systems later on in this year. 
So if you would have been able to book those 2 systems as revenue, the sales would not have been EUR 3.3 billion but EUR 3.6 billion, which is, I think, the 50% increase that we talked about, about 3 months ago. So that was good. 
Margin, margin over 48%. Also, we indicated in last quarter that would go up quite significantly. And that was a result of, I think, the increase in deep UV profitability, the upgrade business that we have. And of course, we're starting to generate EUV service revenue. So that was good. 
Net income, just over EUR 750 million, somewhat higher tax rate, which was basically as a onetime prior period tax assessment, that lifted it to 18%. For the remainder of the year, I think for the total year, we would guide at around 14%. 
On orders, EUR 1.1 billion of orders. That might look low in comparison to previous 2 quarters. Previous 2 quarters, in aggregate, was about EUR 5.5 billion. But then you need to look at where we are from an order book point of view, our order book is a little shy of EUR 10 billion with 54 EUV systems. So very well-prepared for the growth of the business in the remainder of the year, well into 2021.",286

I think also, Q2 was a good quarter in that sense. I mean, very important, we shipped our first multi-beam tool. That was prepared to be shipped in Q1, but because of COVID lockdowns, we couldn't ship. So we shipped in Q2. Very important, I mean it will give our customers a very significant potential in higher productivity in wafer inspection as well. 
Also very important, we shipped the first  dry deep UV tool on NXT platform. Why is that important? Well, it gives a much higher potential for productivity, which will drive the cost of dry deep UV down. It's the NXT:1470, it's very important. We also added -- there's a little piece to our technology product portfolio through a -- probably I would say a bolt-on acquisition of the shares we signed in agreement to acquire the shares of 
Berliner Glas. That basically a manufacturer of very high-end ceramics and optics and optical modules, very important for the future road map for EUV and for deep UV. 
And we'll probably -- we'd have to go through regulatory approval. But we think we can -- that can be done over the next couple of months. So that will close before the end of the year. 
So all in all, you see some good developments, very good developments in the product portfolio, which is very important for the future of this company.",233

Wennink,,Executives,7,"EUV is really getting into the realm of high-volume manufacturing, HVM. It's just becoming part of our normal operational profile. I think in the second quarter, we made good progress in shipping the modular vessel, which is a new solution to our EUV source with the in-line refill, very good. I think also, I think as from Q3 onwards, on every 3400C, we don't expect that we need to ship systems without factory acceptance tests. 
So we'll go back to normal revenue recognition in Q3. That's the expectation. And I think, all in all, still, we think our EUV sales, as we said before, we are about EUR 4.5 billion, 35 EUV systems. And our capacity was still building out our capacity to 45 to 50 systems next year. 
Now how many will we ship next year is, of course, also dependent on the development -- economic development as a result of the COVID crisis. We don't know what the impact of the recession will exactly be. So we'll probably get a little bit more clarity on that in the second half of this year, what 2021 is going to look like, like with respect to how many EUV systems we're going to ship.",205

Wennink,,Executives,9,"Actually, business looks pretty good. And I think where we are, and when you look at the road map of our customers, our own road map, the secular trend of growth of sales and profitability is clearly there, and that means we will generate significant amounts of cash. 
Now clearly, for us, this is very clear to everybody. Our cash return policy is based on -- let's use the cash first for our business, then we'll pay a growing, but in any case, stable dividend. And then for the remainder, we will do share buybacks. 
Now I think that is still in place. We have a share buyback program of EUR 6 billion over the next 3 years. Now as for the short term, I think for the next couple of quarters, in terms of capital allocation, I think we're focusing on CapEx. So we will have some more CapEx spend in 2020, as we indicated earlier. That's for High-NA and also High-NA investment in Carl Zeiss. That will extend into 2021. And I think because we grow, we will have more working capital. Clearly because there's a growth profile of the company, and we strongly believe in that. 
On top of that, we will see the next couple of quarters that the extended payment terms we have given our customers. Those customers that actually took the tools in their early high-volume manufacturing ramp. We granted them some extended payment terms, which will peak in the course of this year, and then will come down significantly in 2021. 
That will also transition into contracts with our customers, not on extended payment terms, but on prepayments. And also, we're negotiating now with our customers' prepayment schedules that will actually help also our cash profile, particularly starting in 2021. So all in all, it looks pretty good.",305

It doesn't impact our short-term shipment profile. And I think medium to long-term, you just need to take a little step back and look at it from a little bit higher perspective. I mean, you really need to ask the question, will innovation stop because of this? Of course, not. 
I mean the innovation road maps of our customers are there. Our innovation road map is there. Why? Because it needs to fuel this digital infrastructure that we're currently rolling out. It will -- 5G will be there. Artificial intelligence will be there. We need high-power compute. We need memory to support that. That will not go away. And all the devices and the chips will need to be made to support that. 
Now then the question of which company is going to provide those devices and those types of equipment? It is company A or is it company B? It doesn't really matter. The wafers will be needed and we will support the lithography systems to make sure that we can make those wafers.",200

Wennink,,Executives,13,"I think that for Q3, we -- like I said earlier, we're basically back to normal, yes. So that also means that we're pretty much under control. Of course, we cannot predict any local outbreak of COVID-19, which could lead to a local lockdown situation somewhere around the globe, but it feels pretty much under control. 
So this is why we can also guide for Q3. We'll guide between EUR 3.6 billion and EUR 3.8 billion in sales and between 47% and 48% gross margin. And I think for the total year -- I just want to go back to what we said at the beginning of the year. And I think our view as to 2020 really didn't change that much. And I like to reiterate what we said at that time because it's still applicable. And I think the logic business will be approximately the same as in 2019, same level. 
Memory could grow with 30% in 2020 as compared to 2019, and our installed base business with 20%. Now you can add it all up, and you'll clearly know that 2020 will be a growth year and will be a growth year in terms of top line and profitability. So all in all, I think it's -- we're in a healthy situation.",215

That's an interesting question because everything that we -- if we think about the industry and our customers, we need to put this into the current context, and current context is COVID-19 is there. It will clearly have an impact on the global economy. There will be a recessionary environment, which will impact consumer spending because we can all expect that unemployment will go up. 
Now consumer spending and consumer electronics, of course, have a relationship. So that will very likely have a negative effect on the end markets, and I think then also indirectly on us and our customers. That's the -- you could say, the negative side. But the positive side is there'll be a very clear transition from what I would call the physical infrastructure to the digital infrastructure. 
Data traffic is exploding. And there's also what our customers are seeing, significant investments in data centers, in working-from-home infrastructure. That is a very positive. So I think if you put it all together, you get a pretty balanced view. And if you then translate that into the different segments that we are working in, logic, logic driven by the road map. 7-nanometer is rolling out, 5-nanometer is being prepared for ramp next year. And it's all there to support this digital infrastructure. So it's pretty healthy. 
And then memory, and we said it also last quarter, memory is actually coming out of a downturn. And we saw the trend of increasing utilization in -- for our litho tools in the memory space continuing. And that looks healthy, has corroborated and also confirmed by customers who are actually looking at the market and of course, seeing the potential downside in the consumer market, but clearly seeing the upside in the data infrastructure market, yes. I think -- so that looks healthy. It's also evidenced by our shipment profile and by the order book. 
And then when we look at our installed base business. Our installed base -- our installed base units are growing. EUV is generating service revenue. I think that also looks pretty healthy. Upgrades, EUV upgrades to the next-generation of productivity are being planned, are being executed as what our customers need, and they want it. So all in all, if you just look at the balance of it, I think we're -- probably, when you look at the total world economy and a lot of types of industry, we're well-placed. 
And you can always say, we're in a privileged place, and that shows. And it shows in our financial results. It shows in the order backlog. It shows in the confidence of customers to keep executing on the road map because innovation will be the name of the game. And it will put us through this crisis. And like I said earlier, the secular growth trajectory of this company is very much intact.",479

Dassen,,Executives,1,"Q3 was a strong quarter. Starting with the top line, we were able to recognize EUR 4 billion of revenue primarily driven by the fact that we were able to recognize revenue for 14 EUV systems: 10 based on shipments this quarter; 4 based on shipments in Q2 that we deferred revenue for into this quarter. 
Included in that number, EUR 862 million of Installed Base revenue. At the gross margin level, 47.5%, which is smack in the middle of the guidance, which I think is particularly strong in light of the fact that we have so much EUV revenue in there. 
Net income, EUR 1.1 billion. If we look at the order book, EUR 2.9 billion, which is a good number for this quarter. Included in there, EUR 595 million of EUV which represents 4 systems, and this is a net booking because in that 4, we also had a demand decline, which was related to a delay in node transition. 
Important also for this quarter, I think the fact that we were able to, in the first days of Q4, have the shipment of the very first immersion system 2050, which is a system that presents quite some value to the customer based on the fact that it has better overlay control and also has better throughput. 
On the COVID situation, we had no major disruptions neither in our own operations nor in the supply chain. So all in all, a pretty good quarter.",246

Dassen,,Executives,3,"So first off, reiterating the comments that we've made in the past, we really do see quarter-on-quarter improvements in customer confidence in the technology. And that really translates into -- if you look at Logic, it translates into more and more layers in Logic for EUV. 
On the Memory side, particularly on DRAM, obviously, we see that the insertion of EUV into DRAM manufacturing is becoming stronger and -- stronger and stronger. So I think really good progress on that front. 
And also on the capability front, we talked about the improvements in cycle time. So very much on track to reduce cycle time to 20 weeks by the end of this year, and that really gives us the capacity to do 45 to 50 systems. So I think really good progress on that front. 
If you look at shipments, all the way through Q3, we had 23 EUV shipments. If I look at the full year, I think we're going to be a few systems shy of 35, and that is based on customer fab readiness issues that we had and also a delay in node transition, both timing-wise and also in the slope of that node transition. Nonetheless, I do believe that we are approaching the EUR 4.5 billion that we've indicated for EUV revenue this year. 
You also asked about next year. So of course, there are many uncertainties as everyone will appreciate. There are the uncertainties macro-wise based on everything that's going on in the geopolitical environment. Of course, there is the question related to COVID and what kind of economic recovery we're going to see. So there are many uncertainties there. We also talked about the uncertainties related to node transitions, the timing thereof and also the slope of the node introduction. 
So of course, with all that, nonetheless, we do believe -- we do expect for next year to see a 20% improvement in the EUV revenue for '21.",325

And also this was the first quarter where we were able to achieve a break-even situation on EUV service margin. 
On both fronts, both on systems margin and also on service margin, we continue to make progress primarily by driving down the cost and also by improving the value to our customers. As we said before, I think that in a 2- or 3-year time frame, we will see that EUV gross margin is going to approach the DUV margin.",99

Dassen,,Executives,7,"For the next quarter, Q4, we've -- we guide EUR 3.6 billion to EUR 3.8 billion, which is a little bit different in terms of composition. There is a little bit -- a higher portion of Memory sales in that number. 
In terms of gross margin, we guide 50%. So that's a good uptick, I think, from what we've seen in the past quarters. If you then translate that into the full year, that would mean that we actually end up at, at least EUR 13.3 billion for the full year in terms of sales, which is very much in line actually with what we guided at the beginning of the year. Not just in terms of absolute numbers, but also in terms of composition between Logic, Memory and Installed Base revenue, which I think is a pretty good achievement in a year that was so much dominated by all the challenges in the macro environment, particularly, obviously, the COVID situation. So very pleased with the fact that we were able to get to that number.

But I would say, in general, we continue to serve and provide service to our customers to the extent that we can, to the best of our abilities, but obviously, within the boundaries of legal and regulatory requirements. 
We are aware of the U.S. authorities' regulations and also interpretation of regulations, obviously. So we are aware of that as it relates to specific Chinese customers. 
If we translate that to what it means for ASML. In general, for specific Chinese customers, it means that we will be able to ship DUV lithography systems from the Netherlands to such Chinese customers without an export license. But as it relates to parts or systems that are being shipped directly from the U.S. to such customers, we would need to obtain an export license for that.",226

So maybe recapping what we said last time about free cash flow. So as everyone knows, I guess, there is significant investment in CapEx, which is primarily geared towards the High-NA investments that we're making, but also some other capability-related investments that we're making. So that's a significant portion, obviously, within the free cash flow. 
Also in response to the COVID challenge, we made sure that we had extra inventory. So our inventory level is relatively high just to cater to that uncertainty. And then we also, in last quarter, really spoke about the transition period that we kind of find ourselves in where, on the one hand, we're moving more and more in new contracts towards down payments, particularly on EUV systems, whilst on existing contracts, which, to a certain extent, are a couple of years old, we still have situations where, in fact, we didn't have down payments but we actually had extended payments. 
So we're in that transition period. I think we're going to see the first benefits of that transition kicking in, in Q4, and then we'll see a continued improvement in -- on that front in 2021. 
As it relates to capital allocation, I think, first off, dividend-wise, we will provide an interim dividend in November of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share. As it relates to free cash flow, we have a EUR 6 billion program over a 3-year period, which we announced at the beginning of this year. 
You know that we paused executing on that at the end of Q1 in light of the COVID uncertainty, and given where we are now, we will start resuming the execution of that share buy program in Q4.",283

Dassen,,Executives,13,"So for '21, as I mentioned also when we talked about EUV, of course, there are many uncertainties that we have to recognize, and those uncertainties are at the macro front, right? So this is about the geopolitical situation that we talked about a little bit and also, as I mentioned before, the type of recovery that we're seeing at the macroeconomic level coming out of the COVID situation. So of course, we have that uncertainty. 
But that said, our expectation is that we will see a low double-digit growth for 2021, which is primarily based on a 20% improvement that I referenced earlier on, on the EUV sales number. 
How much of a growth that will be obviously depends on many factors. First off, geopolitical and macro, we talked about that. More specifically, if we look at the Memory market, most of our customers believe that the inventory issue, particularly on DRAM, will probably have itself sorted by the end of this year. And based on that, they do expect bit growth to go up next year, and that is pretty consistent also with the order intake that we see and the orders that we have and the arrangements that we have with Memory customers for next year. 
So from that vantage point, we do believe that the uptick in Memory sales that we expect for Q4, we expect that to continue to go into next year. 
On the Logic front, we still expect a healthy Logic market. But of course, it depends on the stuff that we talked about earlier on, the timing and the slope of the node introductions. So that will be an important part in that regard. 
Installed Base, looking strong. And also there, we do expect continued growth, which, to a certain extent, is based on regular service, which again is based on the installed base that we have. How much of a growth will again be dependent on how much we see in field upgrades. 
So all in all, some uncertainty, obviously, as a result of all the things that we just mentioned. But I think we're still looking at a good growth year for us next year. And I think it's important to also recognize that all the uncertainty that we're talking about really is short-term uncertainty. 
The longer-term drivers of our business are clearly still there, right? So if you look at the secular trends in our end markets, so you look at AI, you look at high-performance compute, you look at all the developments around 5G, they're running on all cylinders. Those developments are running on all cylinders, and that really drives the longer-term interest in our product. And they provide still a very solid underpinning for the growth expectations that we have articulated for the 2025 time frame.",469

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the third quarter financial results and then provide guidance on the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Net sales came in above guidance at EUR 4 billion, primarily due to additional EUV system revenue. We shipped 10 EUV systems and recognized revenue from 14 systems this quarter. For the 4 systems that shipped in Q2, but did not receive factory acceptance testing before shipment, we were able to complete customer site acceptance tests and recognized revenue this quarter, bringing the total to 14 EUV revenue systems in Q3.  
EUV system revenue this quarter was 66% of total system revenue, which is the first time EUV was higher than deep UV system revenue. This further confirms EUV has entered the realm of high-volume manufacturing and is an integral part of our core operational activities.  
Net system sales of EUR 3.1 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 79%, with the remaining 21% from Memory. The strength in Logic is driven by the high EUV revenue.  
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 862 million, showing continued strength in our service and field option business from the beginning of the year.  
Gross margin for the quarter was 47.5%, coming in at the midpoint of our guidance, which is a good outcome considering the significant EUV revenue. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 534 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 132 million, which was slightly better than guided. Net income in Q3 was EUR 1.061 billion, representing 26.8% of net sales, resulting in an EPS of EUR 2.54.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.4 billion, which is the same level as last quarter.  
Moving to the order book. Q3 system bookings came in at EUR 2.9 billion, including EUR 595 million for EUV systems. We saw some EUV demand reduction due to a delay in customers' node timing, resulting in a net booking of 4 EUV systems. Order intake was largely driven by Logic with 86% of bookings and Memory the remaining 14%.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect Q4 total net sales of between EUR 3.6 billion and EUR 3.8 billion. We expect our Q4 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 900 million, which is driven by strong demand for field upgrades and growing service revenue with an increasing contribution from EUV service.  
Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be around 50%, which is significantly higher than Q3, driven by higher immersion volume and improved deep UV product mix. The expected R&D expense for Q4 are EUR 550 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at EUR 140 million. Our estimated 2020 annualized effective tax rate is still expected to be around 14%.  
Finally, I would like to talk about capital allocation and working capital. As mentioned last quarter, we are in a transition period with customer contracts as we work to move towards new contracts with improved payment terms. We do see some of these new contracts starting to materialize and expect to improve our free cash flow generation in the coming quarters.  
Interim dividend over 2020 will be EUR 1.20 per ordinary share. The ex-dividend date as well as the fixing date for the euro-U.S. dollar conversion will be November 2, 2020, and the record date will be November 3, 2020. The dividend will be made payable on November 13, 2020.  
Conditions in the COVID environment have improved around our ability to operate and our assessment of our supply chain. Taking this into account, along with our improving free cash flow generation, we will resume executing share buybacks this week, in line with the plans that we have communicated earlier this year for a total of EUR 6 billion over 3 years.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",671

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a very strong quarter with EUR 4 billion in revenue and good profitability, driven by strong growth in Logic. We expect Q4 to be a solid finish to the year in both sales and profitability. And in spite of added macro uncertainty in the first half of the year due to COVID-19, our view on growth this year is largely unchanged from what we believed at the start of the year. This is a clear reflection of our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes.  
In Logic, customers continue to see strong demand for advanced nodes, in support of the buildup of the digital infrastructure, which includes secular growth drivers such as 5G, AI and high-performance compute. And as we're still in the early stages of this digital transformation, we expect Logic demand to remain healthy and continue to drive demand for our products.  
In Memory, customers are continuing to indicate that they're seeing healthy demand in data centers, with improving demand for consumer electronics. With customers’ expectations for higher bit growth next year and taking into account the longer lead times and qualification schedules for advanced litho, we are starting to see a recovery in lithography demand for DRAM, with strong growth expected in Q4 this year. Based on the continuation of this improving end market environment, we expect this Memory recovery to continue into next year.  
Sales to China contributes -- continue to grow and accounted for 21% of our systems revenue this quarter. We expect sales to our domestic Chinese customers to grow to above EUR 1 billion this year, which includes sales to both Logic and Memory customers in China, with the mix skewed towards Logic this year but trending to higher Memory sales next year.  
Regarding U.S. export rules to China, we are aware of the requirements set by the U.S. Commerce Department for specific companies in China and as such, according to the current regulation, ASML can continue to ship deep UV lithography systems from the Netherlands. ASML requires a U.S. export license for systems or parts that are shipped directly from the U.S. to the customers affected by the rules. While it is not our policy to comment on the individual customers, we aim to serve and support all of our customers around the world to the best of our abilities, whilst being, of course, compliant with laws and regulations set by the jurisdictions where we operate.  
On our Installed Base business, we still expect significant growth this year. Through the first 3 quarters, we realized revenue of around EUR 2.6 billion. And as Roger mentioned, we expect another solid quarter in Q4. Service business will continue to scale as our installed base grows with increasing contribution from EUV service revenue, as these systems run more wafers in volume manufacturing. We expect significant demand for upgrades as customers utilize upgrades to increase capacity and improve imaging and overlay performance required on future nodes.  
On EUV, although our customers are still climbing the maturity curve, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in the technology, which is translating into expanding layer counts in Logic, initial deployment of EUV in Memory and increasing service revenue. 
With 10 shipments this quarter, we have shipped 23 EUV systems year-to-date. With completion of customer site acceptance test and revenue recognition of the 4 systems shipped last quarter, we achieved a remarkable EUR 2 billion of EUV system revenue from 14 systems in Q3. We're still planning to manufacture 35 systems this year, but due to the pace of customers' node ramps and their fab readiness, a few systems may end up being shipped early next year. But despite this potential shift of shipments to early next year, we're still targeting EUV revenue to approach EUR 4.5 billion this year.  
We continue to drive profitability of our EUV systems and service business. We are on track to achieve at least 40% system gross margin, and we started to breakeven on service business this quarter. We will continue to drive margin improvement in both systems and service costs via cost reductions and delivering more value. And as we said before, we expect EUV margins to -- we expect EUV to reach margins comparable to deep UV margins over the next 2 to 3 years.  
We are on track with our EUV cycle time reduction plan to get to 20 weeks by the end of the year, enabling a capacity of 45 to 50 systems. With respect to demand for next year, we currently have an EUV systems backlog of EUR 6.2 billion exiting Q3, with around 65% of this backlog planned for shipment next year. While we expect more orders in Q4, we did see some EUV demand reduction for next year due to a delay in customer node timing, which resulted in net bookings of 4 systems in the quarter. Although there is clear uncertainty due to the current macro environment as well as exact timing, slope of ramp and the ultimate size of the customer nodes, we currently expect EUV systems revenue growth of around 20% next year.  
In our deep UV business, we qualified the first NXT:2050i in Q3, which shipped early Q4. This immersion system is based on a new version of the NXT platform where the reticle stage, the wafer stage, the projection lens and the exposure laser all contain performance enhancements. With these innovations, the systems deliver increased customer value via improved performance in overlay and productivity and are, therefore, critical in support of their next node introductions. 
To summarize 2020, in spite of macroeconomic uncertainty in the first half of the year, we see the year playing out quite similar to what we saw at the start of the year. We expect to end another strong year in Logic, Memory growth of over 30% and significant growth of over 20% in our installed base business. With this, we expect double-digit growth in both sales and profitability, leading to estimated revenue of at least EUR 13.3 billion.  
As we look to 2021, it's too early to provide a detailed guidance as we are working with customers to determine demand plans going forward. While there are still significant uncertainties, we expect another year of low double-digit growth, largely driven by our current view of expected EUV systems revenue growth of around 20%. There are a number of elements that will determine the degree of growth and uncertainty, of course.  
First is the macro environment because nobody can predict the global economic impact of COVID and how this will impact the end markets that we serve. On top of this, there is also the geopolitical environment, predominantly the U.S.-China dynamics, that creates additional uncertainty.  
In Memory, demand will depend on bit growth next year. Customers seem to broadly believe the inventory issues will have been normalized by the end of this year and expect stronger bit growth in 2021. We currently see strong litho demand for Memory next year, which is consistent with customers' comments. However, the degree of growth will, of course, depend on continued technology transitions and how much capacity will be added.  
In DRAM specifically, we see support of this expectation through high utilization of our litho systems in the field at the moment. While we expect to see more EUV systems go to DRAM next year in support of 1-alpha node, Memory is still a key driver for our deep UV demand.  
In Logic, we expect demand will remain healthy. However, final demand will depend on timing and the slope of node ramps, driven by the end demand curves. Customers are continuously recalibrating their road maps, leading to changes in their shipment requirements, which will likely have an impact on our demand next year. The other aspect of demand timing is around the slope of the node ramps. And this will be determined by how many wafers will move into each of the foundry nodes and is, as I mentioned before, a function of the health of the end demand next year.  
Lastly, on Installed Base business, we expect continued growth, but the degree of growth will be more dependent on upgrade businesses as service business is pretty predictable and grows with Installed Base.  
In summary, there are a lot of dynamics at play, both at the macro level, geopolitical level as well as market-specific circumstances. However, the ongoing transformation of the digital infrastructure, along with the secular end market drivers, such as 5G, AI and high-power compute, will continue to fuel demand for advanced process nodes, both in Logic and Memory, which drives the demand for our products. Therefore, although we are currently going through a period of near-term uncertainty, the long-term demand drivers only increase our confidence in our future growth outlook towards 2025. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions.",1487

I had 2 of them. First one, Peter, on the 20% EUV growth for next year in terms of revenue, what does it imply for units? Is it around 40? I'm just trying to figure out what the unit number would be for next year for EUV? And then I had a follow-up call?",59

Krish, you need to understand, I mean, we always get this question on the unit numbers, but, at the same time, we always get the question on what -- why is the ASP in that quarter higher, lower. For instance, last quarter, it was like EUR 145 million, which was last quarter, the result of the specific configuration sets and repair, upgrades that were included in the shipments. So this ASP, because what you're asking is the number of units times the ASP, gives you the euro sales number. And this is why we just give you the euro number, yes? And it depends on the configuration and the richness, you could say, of the configuration that actually determines ultimately how many of those units we will ship.  
So we're not guiding any units. We just give you a euro number that we believe is going to be 20% up from this year, which is around EUR 4.5 billion this year. So I think it's going to be at least a 20%, as I think we've looked at the demand picture. I think we derisked it for some of the recalibrations of the nodes and the nodes timing, and we're coming up with that euro number. And I think going forward also, we will do that. Just like we do with deep UV and with the total company sales, we just don't tell you how many units we sell. We just tell you what we think how much euros we will sell.",253

Peter, that makes sense. And then as a follow-up, on the DRAM side, clearly, you're seeing continuing strength from DRAM for deep UV. There were some concerns in the marketplace that the DRAM makers might scale back some of their near-term CapEx because of Huawei going away. Have you guys seen any of this nuance? Or just because of your long lead times, you're kind of agnostic to such noise?",72

I think you know, we had this question on the impact of a potential drop of Huawei as a key customer for our customers. When Huawei doesn't sell those smartphones or the digital infrastructure, somebody else will. So I think that in itself is not going to be a driver. It can only be a short-term disruption in timing. Demand might fall away, it might move to somebody else, but that probably takes some time before it pops up. So I don't think that's a structural issue.  
No, I think we just need to look at what the situation is. We have got a push from our DRAM customers. We corroborate that push with what we see in utilization of our tools. And our -- the utilization of our tools is high. And it's grown, I would say, relatively gradually to this level throughout the year, yes? And I think if you then listen to our customer, they said, well, we think that the inventory situation will normalize towards the end of the year with a utilization position that we're currently seeing that is pretty close to what we think is kind of the maximum capacity, then it's not strange to conclude that they need more capacity next year, especially if you look at the demand coming out of the server business. And also, we have the uptick that we're seeing in consumer electronics. So all in all, that makes us more optimistic, together with our customers, on the DRAM business going forward.",254

That's a good question. Well, as we said, 2020, we always said about EUR 4.5 billion, which we stick to that. And then -- so the guidance of the 20% up from that EUR 4.5 billion, of course, includes all shipments that go from 2020 into 2021. You can draw the conclusion from that, that our forecasted ASP at the beginning of the year, i.e., the configuration richness, yes, that's been a bit better than we anticipated. We've seen that through upgrades, yes? So yes, that moves into next year. And that's why units, I said it on -- as an answer to the question of Krish also, units are not that important because it's -- really it's the ASP that can really vary because of the configuration. So we guide you euros. But yes, it will move into 2021.
Now is there upside, that's your second question. I think what we have -- what we clearly said also in our prepared remarks that we have adjusted our demand picture based on the recalibration that has happened within the customer base on the node timing and on the ramp of that node. That, of course, happens first because we know that. But it's also like you have to look at this almost in a way of communicating vessels. What goes down also goes up at the other side. Now in a communicating vessel, it all happens at the same time, whereas there's a bit of a time lag between when you adjust downwards and when you see that demand later in time coming back up, that is the upside. That is not what we've put into our 20%, yes? 
So you could actually say, we've taken all the information of today, taking into account all the uncertainties that we see, taking into account the node calibrations and this is what we'd actually tell you what we qualitatively see today, that there is upside is also clear. Because like I said, it's a communicating vessel, what comes down comes up somewhere. There's going to be time difference. And that's why we're preparing for a potential upside also in 2021. That's why we still talk about a build capacity that is higher, it's 40 to 45 systems, or is that 45 to 50 systems even, yes? And that's what we're organizing for in the supply chain, yes? So yes, there could be upside for the reasons that I just mentioned, and we're prepared.",412

I mean on the SG&A side, I think it will continue to develop, as we've seen in the past quarter. So no major uptick there. On the R&D side, we are pushing down the accelerator quite a bit in terms of the programs, both on High-NA, also on EUV. I mean we're also obviously looking at and working on the successor of the D tool, which will have some demonstrable progress and value to our customers, which obviously requires quite some R&D work. 
And also on the deep UV road map, there's still quite something to be done. So there, we talked in the past about adjusting the number that you've seen for this year with salary increases. In fact, if we look at the magnitude of the program, it's probably going to be a bit higher. We're in the process of finalizing that right now because we're right now in the finalization of the budget. So more precise guidance, we'll be able to provide you with in 3 months' time. But I think it's fair to assume that the increase in the R&D budget will be a bit higher than just the salary uplift.",197

My question is regarding a couple of things. Firstly, you've already indicated that you've seen some pushouts, and you've reported a net EUV order intake in the recent quarter. I mean there has been a pushout from one of your customers, but then that same customer could place orders at another customer of yours. And so have you seen any movement on that front? Or do you expect to see movement on that front in the next few months? 
And the question there which arises is that can you satisfy short-term demand? Because you've talked about in the past that EUV tools are 12-month lead time. So whether that sticks. 
And my quick follow-up to that question is on the gross margin. You're indicating this 20% revenue growth number into next year for EUV, which is a good number. But clearly, I mean, it implies some amount of unit cuts because of this pushout from one customer. Does this have an implication on gross margin at -- for ASML next year on EUV from the 40%, so this progress from the 40% towards a much better EUV gross margin?",194

So you guys are all squeezing 5 questions into one, which we haven't been a little bit prepared for. So Roger is going to answer that one. 
On your question of the pushout of the net 4 systems, have we then see other customers then stepping in? Well, it's a bit the story of the communicating vessels. And this is what you're asking, in fact, yes, which, by the way, is not retail. When you cannot get it with retail shop A, you move to retail shop B. It's a bit more difficult. Not so much for us because we could probably do that. But it's for the customers. 
If one customer adjusts their node timing, it takes time for others to see what that means and how that needs to be digested. So this is what I said in an earlier answer, yes, I see upside because there's a timing difference, if you think about the communicating vessels between things going down and the other part going up again. So I definitely see that. This is why we're preparing also to be able to ship more because to your point, if you would really only follow the order intake and then add 12-month lead time, it's never going to work. So you have to prepare for more because you would expect that there is a decent chance that you see some upside next year and you want to be ready. So this is where the 12-month lead time is actually -- it's -- the integral lead time is more than 12 months, it's more like 18 months.
But if you then prepare yourself because you do expect this, then you could, of course, accept POs with a delivery time that's way within that 18 months. So yes, we are preparing for more. And time will tell whether customers need it in the time frame 2021. I think they could, but time will tell. There's a real opportunity there.",330

Dassen,,Executives,19,"Sandeep, on the gross margin for EUV and then maybe a little broader than that. So on EUV, you're absolutely right. So the 3600D will see an increase in gross margin. And I think we have said in previous calls that we hope with the 3600D to approach the corporate gross margin. So an improvement over the 40% that we targeted for this year. And as we already said, we're probably going to even slightly exceed that target for this year. So yes, from that vantage point, there will be an improvement in the gross margin for next year. 
The downside on EUV is that in the gross margin for next year, you will also see that we already have some operating expenses for High-NA. That is a little bit accounting. And with the CEO and the CFO of this company both holding degrees in accounting, we say with a bit of pride. But the downside is that, even though we're not selling High-NA next year, we already have some operating expenses in there, which find their way into the cost of sales, and therefore, in the gross margin. And that, we assume, will be about a 1% reduction in comparison to the gross margin that we have this year, just to give you an order of magnitude. 
So a clear plus from the increased gross margin on the D. Also, an increase in the gross margin of EUV service margin that we talked about and then a little bit of a negative there. And then if you look at everything also into the deep UV business, for instance, that then becomes a little bit of the swing factor for next year. The mix in deep UV for next year and also the level of field upgrades. 
All in all, target that we had for -- or that we have for Q4 and also the target that we have a little bit moving forward to 50%, with all the pluses and minuses, we're probably going to be somewhere in that range of the gross margin that we had for this year, for the full year, and then the 50% target that we're envisaging. That's where you're going to find yourself in that mix with all the pluses and minuses that I just discussed.",383

Just another one on EUV, please. Just in terms of some of the distinction over what you're seeing with customer plans for next year, I think we can all appreciate some of the, as you say, node, sort of, migration, recalibration. But in terms of the commitment to the technology, particularly by those who are leading the way in deployment, are you -- where are we in terms of EUV layers layer count looking to the next node sort of in 3-node relative to earlier expectations. 
Peter, you made a comment that customers are more confident in the technology. So are you, even if ultimate capacity may be taking a little longer to ramp in terms of wafers, are you seeing the layer count continuing to creep higher? And so that's Logic, but also similarly, in Memory with DRAM press reporting one of your major customers visited you this week, talking about EUV and commitment there. So similarly around DRAM, where are we in terms of layer count expectations?",175

I think on the layer count, I mean, it's clearly evidence given to us that the customers have embraced the technology, and that the technology gives a lot of advantages in simplification, in lower WIP, lower work in process, faster turnaround times in our R&D. So that's -- when you take it all together, then I think on N5 in Logic, we're over 10 layers; and in N3, we'll be over 20. And we actually see that creeping up. So -- and that has just a fact that it gives so much more advantage to go to single patterning and take away these multi-patterning deep UV strategies, which is also true for DRAM. 
Of course, DRAM is a bit behind in terms of HVM in introduction as compared to Logic. But also there, we see the same trend. And it's the process simplification that's actually driving the additional layers. And in DRAM, although we start with one, yes, we can see -- clearly, we can see strategies going forward 1-alpha and beyond that will add up to 5, 6 layers. And that's -- but it's really dependent also on how much productivity can we get out of the tools. 
You have to realize that customers are currently pushing us extremely hard to get more wafers out. I mean we are introducing EUV tools with more productivity, with more wafers per hour. We have the C version introduced. We're now looking at the D version. And beyond the D version, there's going to be another version with increased productivity. But today, when we have our customers' discussion, it's really a discussion about, could you please speed up the maturity of the tool, get your EUV tools at the same level of productivity and of reliability and uptime as you have your deep UV tools and they know it is going to take time because we need more EUV wafers. We need more. That is the consistent question that we are getting. 
So -- and I think it's driven by the fact that they see the big economic and technical benefits of using EUV. And that will drive the layer count up, both in Logic and DRAM. And like I said, N3 of over 20 layers. So that is only creeping up.",381

I think it's a good question, David. When we talk to our Chinese customers, and you have to understand that when they look at some of the other process tools, there are some alternatives here or there. There's alternatives in Japan, when you talk about ALD or you talk about deposition tools. There's a European company, which is in Singapore, that can be an alternative. So on metrology, there are alternatives, both in the Netherlands and outside the U.S., in Japan and even increasingly in other parts of the world. 
So if you're a Chinese company -- and there's one thing that the alternatives is more difficult on and that's on litho, yes? So you just want to make sure that you get your litho tools. And of course, companies that are on a list where under the current agreements, we cannot ship to, we will not ship to. I mean if there wasn't our agreement, that means our -- we just have to go for -- and we have to look at those lists, and we follow those lists. But currently, the customer that we've been talking about, our Logic customer, and one of the major Logic customers in China, actually allows -- or the rules allow us to ship litho tools. 
And it's for those Chinese customers very important to actually get their litho tools and then find a solution for the other process tools. But litho is critical. It's the most critical tool in your fab. So that's why it's not changed -- that's why it's not strange that they still talk to us and say, ""Hey, just make sure that you ship us the tools that we need,"" because it all starts with -- in terms of CapEx, it all starts with the most expensive tool in the fab and that's litho.",307

So we're going to go all out and trying to completely maximize our output between what we currently think in terms of units and that maximum number, somewhere in between, we're going to make sure that we will be able to react.

Appreciate the demand dynamics is one factor. But if you could help us give us a sense for the overall technological readiness of the ecosystem. 
And secondly, if I may, on a separate note, you have given us some perspective on contribution from China. Could you maybe quantify that and give us a sense for how derisked that number is? Or what's the puts and takes, if there was a potential change in U.S. legislation?",134

On that last part, Amit, I'm not speculating on the behavior decisions of governments because that's basically what it is. You cannot derisk. The only thing that you know, if you look at the current situation, you have to look at the specific situation that this company is in, in the geographical area that we operate in, which is Europe, yes, and the ability of us within the rules and the regulation to ship tools. That's what we're planning for, yes? Now there are a lot of powers at work, which are beyond ASML, and it's very difficult. I'm not going to speculate on what that is, what that upside is, what that down -- what a downside is. I'm trying to just deal with the reality as we see it today. And that's what we do. It's how we derisk or that's what how we look at the Chinese business, yes, which, of course, is just more than -- there are several customers there. We have 4, 5 major customers there. So I'm not going to speculate there because I don't know what governments are going to do. 
On the EUV, the technical readiness of EUV, it's technical-ready. The ecosystem on N5 and N3 is there. It's got to do it. It has to do with how quickly can we bring, for instance, the EUV maturity up to the maturity of our deep UV immersion tools, which in -- some of our customers are reaching 98% to 99% uptime. Well, we are not at 98%, 99% uptime. And it by the way varies. We have tools that are over 90%. We have tools that are under 90%. So it is the stability, which has to do with the maturity of the tools. So this is why our customers, in the discussions that we are having with them, are really saying, ""Okay, first things, focus on the maturity of those tools,"" which we will do, which is normal. I mean this is a new technology and high-volume manufacturing, completely normal. We saw the same thing when we introduced dual stages. We saw the same thing when we introduced immersion. It's very logical. It will take some time before we get all the solutions on lifetime of parts all implemented in the field. That's not an issue, just customers want it faster. 
Why do they want it faster? Because their customers are just pushing them on more EUV wafers. That's what we see today. The only -- the key discussion that we're having with our customers, give us more EUV wafers, yes, and preferably, by improving the maturity of the tools faster, yes? And then on top, if the end market turns out to be okay, give me more capacity. And that's the order. So this is how it actually works. I have no doubts about the technological readiness at all. This was a question that I -- we could go into a lot of detail a couple of years ago, but not today.",504

You're looking at pellicle and actually there, I think you've also recently seen some good breakthroughs in transmission, they are both for ourselves and also for some others. 
Photoresist, which we all know is only -- is always going to be there. It's just that it's -- the massive development there will happen at a point in time where the whole thing is going into HVM. That's what you see. So on the typical elements there, you see that good progress is being made. And I think that's also echoed at the EUV conferences by our customers. And they show these slides where they talk about the progress in the ecosystem. And to Peter's point, if you look at that where they had their assessment 2 years ago, there was actually quite some amber and red on the slides. And if you look at the slides that are present today about the readiness of the ecosystem, the red is gone, and it's all green.",214

I mean we've seen this also when we did dual stages, when we did immersion, when you have a wavelength change, things are very different for our customers in their production process. And that needs to mature also. It's not only our exposure tool. It's everything that goes with it. It's the pellicles where we started with 82% transmission, now we have qualified 88%. And we have, like we said, there are in research institutes, the transmission that is far over 90%. 
The same is true for -- like Roger said, for photoresist. This is very normal. It's very normal. The entire industry, the ecosystem is up, basically climbing a maturity curve.

Dassen,,Executives,40,"So Alex, in terms of the ASP increase for the D, what we've indicated there is somewhere between 10% and 15% is a good estimate of the increase in ASP. You see -- in terms of productivity, you see a 19% increase in the productivity of that tool. And also in overlay, you see an improvement of 1.5 to 1.1. So some pretty good value that is being provided to the customer, which justifies the uptick in ASP that I just talked about. 
On the E, that's quite a while out. So we're not going to -- we're not going to give any indications on the ASP development there. But as I said, there are some pretty significant improvements and value enhancements that are being planned on that tool. But more to talk about that when we're approaching the launch date of that. 
On the D model and the composition of next year in terms of units. As we've indicated, we plan on really introducing the D model for HVM at the midpoint of next year. So that kind of gives you a bit of an indication of how the spread is going to be for next year.",198

Yes, you have these -- you have different types of upgrades. You have an upgrade, like for instance, this is why ASP in Q3 was a bit higher. We've upgrades that are already included in the tool that we ship, so that is one. But you also have upgrades of tools that are in the field. And that depends on what upgrade do you want? Do you want an upgrade from a B to a C, that is a different upgrade than one you have a 3350 going into a 3400C. I mean that's almost like a complete refurb in the field. And that's significantly more expensive. And customers are looking at all of them. So it's -- there also, you have the mix of what kind of upgrade do you want? And you have 3400B upgrades, which actually are in the -- from a productivity point of view, that are in the midpoint between the original B and the current C. So this is also what you can choose. So it's very difficult to give you as a forward-looking outlook on what that is because it very much depends on the customer plans and on the capacity planning in terms of wafers per day. 
So we're just going to give you the total number, yes, and -- when that happens. And these things, these update plans also change. I had a very recent discussion with a very large customer. Well, he really wants to look at an upgrade plan where there was different scenarios. Well, depending on how that scenario pans out, the upgrade revenue is going to be different than a lot of scenarios. So I wouldn't even dare to give you any guidance there because I would be wrong, yes?
So the MBI, the multi-beam tool. Yes, I mean, we're going to ship another 2 beta tools this year. And like I said, it is really -- customers are going to use those tools, because not just the tool, it's also how do you integrate a multi-beam wafer inspection tool into your entire yield management process. And that will happen over the next half year to 3/4 of the year, and that will determine the uptake of that tool and the POs for that tool. 
So what we're seeing is that, at least that's what we believe, and we are now in the first integration phase of the first tool that we shipped last quarter, we just have to see that what we believe the advantages of a tool that is 6x faster, how much of that can translate into real deal value for the customer. That's going to be a bit of a wait and see, but we have people there, and we're optimistic. But ultimately, that optimism needs to be confirmed by the customer that starts putting in the POs. So you have to be a bit patient, Mehdi, on that news. So it's going to be another 1 or 2 quarters before we get some clarity on this.",506

Could you now give us an idea of where we will land in terms of net cash for the year and what will happen with working capital in the fourth quarter, if you could quantify that for us? 
And then just secondly, coming back to your comment, Peter, on the communicating vessels in EUV orders. So given the pushouts by one customer, is there a realistic scenario whereby we get a big jump then in orders as that node progression starts to materialize. You get then a very strong '22. Is that a realistic scenario? Or do you see things more smooth out in the future?",120

Dassen,,Executives,50,"Aleksander, on free cash flow, we're not guiding free cash flow. I can tell you that there will be a very significant free cash flow generation in Q4 for a couple of reasons. One reason is the free cash flow generation this quarter was rather low. As a matter of fact, it was slightly negative. And one main reason there is that many, many tools shipped in the last month of the quarter, as a result of which the cash generation of that will fall into Q4. So there will be significant free cash flow generation in Q4. That's also the reason why we communicated that we will resume the share buyback, why we announced the interim dividend. So we're very confident on the free cash flow generation in Q4, but we're not guiding that.",135

And on your communicating vessels question, well, it actually was my introduction on the communicating vessel. But the question is, could that then give a big jump in orders because there's a time difference. And you basically asked the question, how big could that time difference be? And I know, like I said, we're preparing for more output in '21 because I think it could happen in '21. But you asked the question about what about '22? Well, you could say, well, we're in 2020 and so what do I know about 2022. But in the context of your question, I do believe that, in any case, 2022, we will see the effects of that communicating vessel movement. I think there's also an opportunity that it can be pulled into 2021. That's why we're preparing for more shipments and from a -- let's say, from a manufacturing and a supply chain point of view. 
But more importantly, in 2021, I think we will see then the introduction of the next nodes in Logic and in DRAM. I think 2021, in any case, will be, you could say, the recipient of the node transitions. There will -- 2021 will be a year where you see another node transition happening, which, as we talked about, N3 will have all the 20 EUV layers. So that would then be on top of what I would see as a normal progression of the EUV volumes.",242

Dassen,,Executives,60,"On the first question, Adi, I think it's -- we've given you the top line figure, both for the total business and for EUV. As Peter mentioned, of course, there are many -- there are quite some uncertainties that have been factored into that number and there are quite some swing factors going left and right. I think what we should do is, in 3 months' time, when we have a discussion on the full year's results, but also going to have our first real insight into next year, I think that's what -- what I suggest is that, at that point in time, we're going to talk about what are the main drivers. 
So at that stage, I think it would be good to say, just as we did at the beginning of this year, if we look at the different segments of the market, how do we look at those and what growth drivers do we see there. I think that's the way I would suggest we do that and leave it at the top line indications that we've given for now.",184

And I think I will answer your 2 questions on domestic China. I think it's almost not relevant. It sounds a bit arrogant. But you have to realize that the Chinese customers in Logic and in Memory, they are in ramp. They have customers. All their wafers are sold. They go to their customers that put them into devices. So if for whatever reason that China business does not exist, those customers still need wafers, and then they will buy those wafers somewhere else. 
And I think where we just said, in Memory, for instance, in DRAM, we see the very high utilization towards the max. So where do those wafers come from, they need to come from added capacity somewhere. And I think this is, again, is a question of this communicating vessel. When one set of customers might not, for whatever reason, need those capacity tools, then another one needs it. And I think with deep UV, that time period is much shorter than with EUV. So I think that is -- it will resolve itself relatively quick.
Now on the customer, the number of customers in the leading edge, there's one thing that's absolutely certain. Things are not getting easier. The next nodes will see increased complexity. And I think only the very large customers can deal with that. We've seen over the last 20 years a significant reduction in number of leading-edge customers. And I think it's going to continue with less than a handful, less than a handful. And I'm not going to speculate who those are going to be because I -- they are all dear to my heart. And I think we have to figure it out who has the best designs, the best production technology with the most efficient and the lowest cost. But in the end, it doesn't matter. Because in the end, it's what we always talk about, is the number of wafers and devices and chips that are needed in the digital transformation that need to be made somewhere on the planet. And that means that I do believe that our large customers are going to be larger, and they're going to be dominant in areas of chip production, which are only going to grow. 
It is why I said at the end of my prepared remark, our confidence in our 2025 outlook has only grown. As always, ultimately, you could argue also a bit as a result of what we've seen as a part of the COVID crisis how important this digital infrastructure is. So in that sense, yes, I think it will be fewer and fewer customers, but it will be much bigger than they are today.",451
