Dassen,,Executives,2,"A record year but also a very strong Q4 with total revenue at EUR 4.3 billion. Included in there, EUR 1.1 billion in Installed Base revenue and both higher than guided. Primarily, I would say, as a result of higher sales in DPV, DPV immersion and also as a result of more upgrades. 
If we look at the gross margin, gross margin came in at 52%, also quite a bit better than we guided. Again, same results, if you look at the product mix with more immersion in there and also upgrades, that's really what drove it. 
In terms of net income, EUR 1.4 billion. So overall, really a strong quarter and also the order intake was very, very strong with EUR 4.2 billion of order intake, net bookings included in that net 6 EUV systems representing EUR 1.67 billion.",141

Dassen,,Executives,6,"A dynamic here, in fact, an extraordinary year. An extraordinary year, starting with concluding as we just did, this was a record year for ASML, but a year where we, obviously, had to navigate the challenging circumstances of COVID-19. And I have to say, the way we were able to navigate that with the stellar performance of our people but also the support of all of our partners, suppliers, other partners, customers have been fantastic. And I really would like to take this opportunity to thank our people and our partners for being able to put up this performance. 
We also have to recognize COVID-19 is not yet behind us, but I think the past experience really strengthens us, I think, in our conviction that we're able to navigate these really tough circumstances.",133

Dassen,,Executives,8,"EUV is doing very well, both on the Logic front and on the DRAM front. If we start looking at the numbers for Q4, we shipped 9 systems, only 8 were taken in revenue. The one system that we did not recognize as revenue was because it's a new system configuration at a customer that needs to be qualified at the customer still in early 2021. As soon as that has happened, it will also be recognized in revenue. 
If we look at the full year, all in all, 31 systems taken in revenue, total revenue on the system side of EUR 4.5 billion. So a very significant uptick there of 60% in terms of revenue recognized for EUV. 
If you look at the gross margin, as we have been projecting, more than 40% was the gross margin on EUV for the full year and on the system side. 
And if we look at 2021, I would say that with the introduction of the 3600D, that will be the point in time where we will see EUV systems gross margin at the level of the corporate gross margin. 
And also at the service level, as you know, we broke even on EUV service gross margin this year. And we expect that to gradually go to corporate gross margin, and I would say about 4 years' time, and we'll make a gradual step-up again this year.",235

Dassen,,Executives,10,"EUV demand is developing very, very strongly. We have an order book of EUR 6.2 billion. Now if we look a little bit into this year and the expectations for this year, we expect total EUV system sales this year of EUR 5.8 billion, which is 30% up in comparison to the EUR 4.5 billion that we had for 2020. 
We are making good progress, I would say, in our manufacturing capacity, primarily, as we said before, by driving down the cycle time. I think the one limiting factor that we have this year really is the orders that we placed into the supply chain. We had to adjust that in the -- during the COVID situation, so that will be the limiting factor for this year.",127

Dassen,,Executives,12,"Overall, High-NA is developing very well. But I think it's also important to recognize that we have a significant road map still ahead of us for 0.33. And we're very aggressively working on that road map, really putting performance for our customers to meet their requirements, both on throughput, both on imaging, on overlay requirements. We think that will cater to the demand of our customers for the next couple of years. And then there will be a certain point in time, and we think that probably will be in '25, '26 time frame, where our customers will no longer be able to perform based on -- or to meet the demands of their customers by applying double patterning. Then they will have to go beyond that. They will want to reduce the process complexity, and that will then require the need for them for High-NA. 
In terms of our own time frame, I think this year, we'll see the first integration of modules. Next year, we will see the availability of the first system available for R&D purposes at our sites. Customers will then have access to that tool in 2023. 
2023, we will also see the first initial installations of High-NA tools at customers. And again, then in the '25, '26 time frame, that's where we really see a High-NA going into high-volume manufacturing.",226

Dassen,,Executives,14,"As promised, Q4 was very, very strong from a free cash flow perspective, as I think people have been able to see in the numbers. So really strong performance on that front. And also, for this year, for 2021, we expect a significant generation of free cash flow. Our capital allocation policy hasn't really changed. So in essence, what we say, what we need and the business will need, so whatever we need for R&D, for CapEx, et cetera, we'll use that in the business. And whatever -- what is not necessary for that, we will be able to distribute back to our shareholders by way of increasing dividends over time and share buybacks. 
As far as dividend is concerned, we're looking at a total dividend for 2020 of EUR 2.75. And in terms of share buyback, as you know, we have a 3-year program for share buybacks have in total EUR 6 billion. We were able to execute EUR 1.2 billion last year, and we're looking at executing a significant share buyback in Q1 of 2021.",177

Dassen,,Executives,16,"For the quarter, we're looking at sales between EUR 3.9 billion and EUR 4.1 billion, included in there, EUR 950 million of installed base revenue. We're looking at a gross margin between 50% and 51%. 
For the full year, we're looking at a year of continued growth, both in sales and in gross margin. If I just look at the different businesses that we're in, the different market segments that we're in, we're actually looking -- let's start with Logic. Logic already very strong this year. And still, we believe that Logic, we expect that to grow another 10% in 2021. And that really is because of all the changes that we see, the really continued development in the digital economy that we're witnessing and even more strongly after last year. And you see that everywhere. You see it on the advanced nodes with the secular trends in AI, high-performing compute, 5G. I mean those are the big drivers behind the big demand in advanced nodes, but also in the more mature nodes, where you see, particularly in the Internet of Things and also the application of that, both in the consumer, automotive and industrial markets. 
You see that also the demand for the more mature nodes is at very, very high level. So all in all, very, very positive and therefore, expect another increase of 10% on Logic. 
If we move to Memory, as we projected, you already saw the momentum being turned positively for, particularly, DRAM in 2020. So you did see some growth in DRAM, in particular, last year, and we see that momentum actually sustained into 2021. And that is because of all the demand for data centers but also the application of memory into consumer devices is something that we just continue to see. 
And in that combination of continued bit growth, but also the fact that the utilization of our tools really is at an extremely high level that provides us the comfort that we think Memory is going to increase further, and we believe Memory can grow with 20% for this year in comparison to last year. 
Finally, installed base revenue, again, a significant growth in last year of about 30%, and we expect that to grow another 10% this year. And that's a combination of, on the one hand, the service margin and the service revenue growing. As a result of the fact that the installed base is growing, as a result of the fact that we see more and more EUV tools really going into high-volume manufacturing and really producing a larger and larger number of wafers, so that combination really increases the revenue from service. 
And we also recognize that customers are more and more interested in upgrades in order to increase their capacity but also to increase performance on overlay performance on imaging. So those are things that can be catered to with more and more upgrades, and they will be available also in this year. And we believe that will lead to another growth on that front. 
So if you take it all together, what we're looking at really is another year of double-digit growth as a result of the different dynamics that I just mentioned there. 
We believe there can be actually even more growth than what we just discussed but that would then be under the assumption that we will not be faced with more limitations on the geopolitical front and the export controls front than what we're seeing today. That will be an important dynamic, I think, for all of us to watch for. If we're not confronted with more limitations there, then we believe there is still some more potential on growth than the numbers that I just shared with you. 
So all in all, we're looking with a lot of passion and a lot of comfort, if you like, and a lot of faith into this year and also, quite frankly, beyond this year. We think the growth trends are there, our products are there, the road map that we have caters to demand of our customers. And that gives us a lot of confidence in the performance of ASML in the short and the longer term. 
We really look forward to having conversations with all of you in our Investor Day that we will have later this year.",726

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the first quarter of 2021. Net sales came in above guidance at EUR 4.3 billion, primarily due to additional DPV system revenue and upgrade business opportunities. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized EUR 1.1 billion revenue from 8 systems this quarter. One system was shipped with a new configuration that needs to be qualified at customer site as the revenue will be recognized after site acceptance staffed in early 2021. Net system sales of EUR 3.2 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 72%, with the remaining 28% from Memory. The strength in Logic drives both DPV and EUV revenue, and recovery in Memory business is mainly driven by DRAM.
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.1 billion above guidance, showing continued strength in our service and upgrade business. Gross margin for the quarter was 52% and was above guidance due to the additional DPV immersion and upgrade business. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 556 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 152 million, which was slightly above our guidance. Net income in Q4 was EUR 1.4 billion, representing 31.7% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 3.23.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 7.4 billion, which is significantly higher due to customer down payments and early payments, which materialize in 2020.
Moving to the order book. Q4 net system bookings came in at EUR 4.2 billion, including EUR 1.1 billion for EUV systems, net 6, and very strong DPV demand. Order intake was largely driven by Logic with 78% of bookings. And Memory, the remaining 22%. For the full year, net sales grew 18% to EUR 14 billion. EUV system sales in 2020 was EUR 4.5 billion, which is about a 60% increase from last year.
On EUV margins, we continue to drive profitability in both the systems as well as the service business. We achieved our 40% system gross margin in 2020 and delivered a positive margin on EUV service. We expect the upward trend for both systems and services gross margin to continue in future years.
The Installed Base Management sales was EUR 3.7 billion, which is a 30% increase compared to previous year. In 2020, we had a total of EUR 11.3 billion, reflecting customers' strong demand for EUV and DPV technology. DPV booking value was at a record EUR 7.3 billion, with demand from both advanced as well as mature market technologies. Our R&D spending increased to EUR 2.2 billion in 2020. While we continue to invest in DPV and applications, product innovation, the increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV road map, both low and High-NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of 2020 sales was about 16%, SG&A was about 4% of sales.
Net income for the full year was EUR 3.6 billion, resulting in 25.4% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 8.49. Improvements in working capital contributed to a free cash flow generation of EUR 3.6 billion as we continue to invest CapEx in support of our road map and planned capacity ramp. Excess cash will be returned as per our policy.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2021. We expect Q1 total net sales of between EUR 3.9 billion and EUR 4.1 billion, which is a very strong start of the year and a reflection of the current market demand. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 950 million. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are EUR 620 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at EUR 165 million, reflecting a continued investment in the future growth of the company. The higher R&D is to support road map plans to drive further innovation of our EUV, DPV and apps products. The SG&A increase is driven by higher IT, security costs and general organizational growth.
These quarterly run rates are a good indicator for the expected full year operating expenses. Our estimated 2021 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 15%.
Regarding our capital return, ASML paid total dividends of EUR 1.1 billion in 2020, made up of the 2019 final dividend and 2020 interim dividend. ASML intends to declare a total dividend with respect to 2020 of EUR 2.75 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share paid in November '20, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of EUR 1.55 per ordinary share. This is a 15% increase compared to the 2019 dividend.
The 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 29, 2021, in Veldhoven. Through December 31, 2020, ASML acquired 3.9 million shares under the 2020-2022 program for a total amount of EUR 1.2 billion. Given our strong cash position and positive outlook, we expect to execute a significant share buyback in Q1 2021.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",887

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, resulting in another solid year of growth in both sales and profitability, driven by strong Logic, recovering Memory demand and a significant step-up in our Installed Base revenue. We were able to achieve an 18% top line growth and 37% growth in profitability despite some unique challenges we're having to continue to run our business through the pandemic. I think this is all thanks to our employees and partners who have done a remarkable job executing in this challenging environment. However, we continue to remain vigilant as this COVID-19-induced crisis is not behind us yet. Following a strong 2020, we currently expect another year of good growth in revenue and profitability in 2021.
In Logic, we expect another very healthy year driven by a further broadening of the application space, fueled by the global digital transition. Customers continue to see strong demand for advanced nodes, which includes the secular growth drivers, such as 5G, AI and HPC. And in addition, and also driven by the digital transformation, we are seeing a strengthening demand for the more mature nodes across a wide variety of markets such as consumer, automotive and industrial. While we are still very early on in the year, we think that with these demand drivers on full throttle for advanced as well as mature nodes, we expect Logic revenue to be up at least 10% from an already very high number of EUR 7.4 billion in 2020.
In Memory, customers have indicated that inventory levels continue to come down and expect a further tightening of supply throughout the year. As is the case with Logic, the digital transformation is also fueling memory demand across the broadening application space. Customers continue to see healthy demand in data centers with increasing Memory content in consumer electronics. With customers indicating stronger bit growth this year for DRAM around 20% and for 3D NAND around 30% to 35%. And taking into account lithography 2 utilization already at high levels, we expect a recovery in lithography demand for Memory to continue this -- through this year. Therefore, we expect Memory revenue to be up around 20% this year from EUR 2.9 billion in 2020. Although DRAM primarily uses DPV technology today, we do expect our EUV shipments to DRAM customers to increase in the coming years.
On our Installed Base revenue -- or Installed Base business, service revenue will continue to scale with the growing installed base. We expect an increase in contribution from EUV service revenue as these systems run more and more wafers in volume production. Customers will continue to utilize upgrades to increase capacity and improve imaging and overlay performance required of future nodes. With this continued growth in both service and upgrade business this year, we expect Installed Base revenue to be up around 10% this year from EUR 3.7 billion in 2020.
All in all, we started the year with robust demand across the entire industry and across all geographical regions. This should bode well for a double-digit upside from our 2020 revenue numbers. We feel comfortable with the levels of potential growth expectation for business segment, but clearly see potential upside to these numbers, where we can disregard any further impact of export control regulations resulting from the current geopolitical situation.
I would now like to update you on our products and business starting with EUV. EUV is making strong progress and continues to mature as we execute our road map and grow our Logic and DRAM business. As Roger mentioned, we shipped 9 systems and recognized revenue of 8 systems in Q4, bringing the total to 31 systems in 2020, with a revenue of EUR 4.5 billion for the year. This translates to about 60% growth in EUV systems revenue, reflecting the expanding use of this technology in high-volume manufacturing.
Based on customers' growing EUV demand in advanced nodes, we currently expect a growth of around 30% over last year, translating to around EUR 5.8 billion in EUV system revenue for 2021. We continue to improve the EUV manufacturing cycle time to enable the capacity in our factory to meet the growing EUV demand.
We will continue to drive the EUV 0.33 NA product road map, which is aligned to our customers' note cadence. Our goal is to deliver value to our customers via performance improvements in imaging, overlay and productivity. As customers continue to shrink on future nodes, the performance improvements of our 0.33 NA systems road map will also enable cost-effective double patterning solutions before customers reach a point where it will require High-NA to reduce process complexity. We are aligning with customers on the road map timing of High-NA, insertion and volume production, currently estimated to be in the 2025, 2026 time frame. To meet this time line, we will start integration of the modules this year and plan to have first qualified system in 2022.
We plan initial installation of the first systems at customer site in 2023, and plan to provide a more detailed update on our High-NA program during our Investor Day this year.
In our DPV business, we're focused on meeting our customers' increasing demand for all of our DPV products by maximizing factory capacity, reducing installation cycle time and optimizing performance of our systems in the field. As we mentioned earlier, the application space for Logic is expanding rapidly, which also has an effect on the demand for DPV products across our entire product offering. The demand has actually been stronger than we anticipated some years ago, which means that we have increased our investments in R&D to provide our customers with ever more powerful and productive litho machines to help them deal with the increasing demand and lower cost per chip challenges.
Our DPV R&D plan, therefore, includes a significant program to bring DPV to our -- from our XT platform onto the NXT platform, thereby seriously boosting productivity and lithographic performance such as CD and overlay.
In our application business, we had a record year for YieldStar shipments and shipped the first YieldStar 385 to a customer in Q4. The YieldStar 385 offers the latest overlay of focus metrology with enhanced throughput and accuracy to its customers' future node requirements. We also shipped an additional 2 e-scan 1,000 multi-beam systems in Q4, bringing the total number of shipments in 2020 to 3. And with 9 beams and high-speed stage technology, these ASMLs provide up to 600% higher productivity in single-beam systems.
In summary, 2020 was another great year despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. For 2021, taking into account that we're coming off a higher 2020 revenue base, we still expect a year of double-digit growth. This is driven by strong demand in Logic and continued recovery in Memory with potential upside to these numbers where we can disregard any further impact of export control regulations. The build-out of the digital infrastructure across multiple markets drives demand for both advanced as well as mature process nodes. This is expected to fuel demand across our entire product portfolio. Although there are, of course, still some near-term macro and geopolitical uncertainties, the long-term demand drivers only increase our confidence in our future growth outlook towards 2025.
And with that, we will be happy to take your questions.",1223

I was hoping to get some color on your Memory business and the demand you're seeing there. I think last quarter, you had talked about 30% growth for this year for Memory revenue, but you came in a little bit below that. So I guess, did something change there? And then how do we think about that follow through to that into 2021?",67

No, I don't think anything really materially changed there. In fact, the fact that we kind of missed the 30% was, in essence, the reallocation of a few tools from Memory into Logic. So that really had to deal with where do the tools go by the end of the quarter. So really is a spread over Q4 versus Q1. So not a systemic reason.
The momentum that we saw building up in Memory in the course of last year, we think, is continuing. And that has to do with the things that Peter talked about. We see the bid growth development, the 20% for DRAM, 35% for NAND. And of course, that's driven by demand in data centers. It's driven by what we see in terms of Memory being design and used in consumer electronics. So we see those underpinnings continue.
We also see that the utilization of the lithography tools is at a very, very high level. So the demand momentum that we saw already in the second half of 2020 we believe is sustained into 2021. And that's the reason why we, again, forecast a 20% increase there for 2021.",195

And then as a quick follow-up, in the prepared remarks, you talked about some supply chain limitations potentially on the EUV side that you're seeing.

Wennink,,Executives,10,"I think our capacity, our capability internal in the Netherlands, in Veldhoven, to build 50 systems is there in terms of people and square meters. Now we have to build those systems out of modules, which we don't produce. It's in the supply chain. And it's just a reflection of what happened last year in Q2 and Q3, where as -- clearly, our key foundry customer came back and said, listen, our key customer for N3 is now blacklisted, so we cannot ship, so we need to adjust our 2021 outlook for EUV systems, which was followed by another customer that said, well, we're going to delay the road map, which also means that this will be pushed back once again, which actually led to a situation where we actually reduced the number of planned systems 2021 for EUV, because customers said, these are the 2 reasons. And they were 2 big customers.
So what we did, we went to the supply chain and said, sorry, we need those lenses and lasers. Very expensive pieces of equipment. We need them actually later.
You need to realize that the integral lead time between the installation of an EUV tool and the start-up of module production is 20 months. So when you push back 6, 7, 8 months, yes, then -- and then finally, customers come to the realization that it's not as bad as they thought, and they want those machines. Then we have an issue with getting the modules on time, and that's the only issue. The only issue. It's just a result. It's a function of the fact that our customers changed their mind in Q2 and Q3 and then rechanged their mind back in Q4, and today.
But there's nothing we can do about it, which actually means that we're all prepared to do 50 units next year. That is in 2022, it will just shift to 2022, yes? So it's the -- so it's -- you could say it's supply chain limitations by design because it's -- because the customers told us, we don't need them. And coming back there, oops, we might have been wrong.",359

Congratulations on the very strong results. A quick question on the CapEx spending backdrop and how that feeds into your guidance. Obviously, TSMC is a very large CapEx spender. They've guided over 30% CapEx growth this year. Yet, your guidance, although very strong, it's closer to 12% on revenues. Clearly, you also have other verticals, do you also have other customers in the mix. But I wondered if you could give a little bit more color as to any areas where at the moment, you're being more prudent on your guidance, but where you could be a bit more positive over time and what you need to see to get more constructive?",118

We gave a range, EUR 25 billion to EUR 28 billion. Hey, great. We plan our business based on what they ask us. And as you know, TSMC has been asking us, in 2020, on several occasions, to ship very different numbers for 2021. So this is -- what I'm saying is it's in constant flux. So what they are asking us and telling us that they would like from that point of view, has a range, and we need to be able to respond to that. So I don't think you can draw any direct conclusion from the TSMC CapEx numbers. Directionally, yes, but not in absolute terms.
Now having said that, I also said that I do believe that we see upside to the -- your calculated 12%. And an upside is clearly there, but I think that's upside that comes out of the Logic space in China. And of course, that will happen if the current export control regulations stay as is.
Now you could argue also, why do you -- why are you so conservative? Well, simply because what we've seen over the last 2 months in terms of regulations that we had to deal with and that basically we're issued rather suddenly, there is a level of conservatism at -- and on our side. I said, we're not going to add that upside yet to your 12%. Because we've been -- I wouldn't go per it, but I mean we've been surprised on a regular basis by all these new regulations that do have an impact on our business. So where nothing changes, it stays as is, there is a significant upside to what we told you today, but then everything needs to stay as is. And I think we made that clear in our prepared remarks.",303

Peter, when you look in the longer term, looking at 3-nanometer transition, I understand opportunities in the near term. But I want to hear more about what your thinking has been, migrate to the second generation of entry. And I want to better understand how change of transistor architecture, like Samsung migrating to gate-all-around. And also introduction of High-NA is going to impact your overall system shipment. And I'm -- in context of what happened in -- during 2014 through 2016, when we migrated from planar transistor to FinFET. And there was some slowdown, and I want to see if you see the same kind of pattern happening, and I have a follow-up.",122

I'll follow up on 4 questions. So on the transistor architecture, yes, I think what we know today on the patterning side and especially, I would say, on the geometric side, I don't think it has a major impact. That's not what we expect. So whether it's the FinFET or the gate-all-around, it is in the 3-nanometer realm. And customers need that lithographic capability. And it's an architectural choice, as you pointed out. We don't think it has a major impact on our business.
The longer-term 3-nanometer transition. I think you were probably referring to the transistor architecture change. We'll just have to see how that pans out. An architecture change, even when we had FinFET, you also know that wasn't completely flawless because it is new, yes? And if there is a slowdown, it probably could be a slowdown because the technology is indeed new. And that the ramp is potentially slower. But that's speculation at this moment in time.
From a, let's say, lithographic point of view, there's not much difference. How does that impact High-NA system shipments? Well, High-NA is not slated for the N3 node. It starts to be used at N2 and N2+. I would say N2+ and N1 and beyond.
So in -- for the 3-nanometer node, it doesn't have a major impact.",220

I think what we see -- we see that trend keep going up. It has to do with the fact that there is a significant amount of investment plan in China, Memory and Logic. In our -- what we gave you in terms of growth for 2021, 10% Logic, 20% Memory, 10% Installed Base. Our assumption there is that we -- that the indigenous Chinese business has about the same euro level, yes. But it's a different type of customer, yes? I mean as we told you also 3 months ago that we expect 2021 China business to grow, but largely in Memory. So it's in 3D NAND and in DRAM. Those are the big drivers. And that's in what I would call, what we gave you to calculate and somebody calculated it to a 12% growth number.
On top of that, there is a significant upside in Logic. How big can that be? It's significant. But like I said, we're a conservative company. We've experienced the unpredictability of the legislation over the last couple of months. We don't want to put that into your forecast right now, but when things don't change and they stay as is, there is some significant Logic upside in China.",207

And as we move into the second half of the year, you're going to start shipping the EUV tools, I would assume. The installed base would start to come off warranty on the EUV side as well helping.

So you might recall in the last call, in the Q3 call that we had, we talked about a bandwidth for the year between 48% and 50%. We also reminded people at that stage that in comparison to 2019, we also started the year with a 1% negative as far as that is concerned on High-NA. So that was one of the reasons why before doing your bridge between 2019 and 2020, you first need to dug that 1% out there.
I think bearing that in mind, but also bearing in mind how sales seems to be firming up in this year, my expectation would be that we're going to see gross margin trend towards the upper limit of the bandwidth. So the bandwidth of 48% to 50% that I gave in Q3, my current expectation based on the composition of sales would be that that's going to trend up towards the upper limit of that bandwidth.",160

That's helpful. And then I guess a quick follow-up on a prior question around EUV supply constraints. It looks like implied planned revenue units is 40, your backlog is 42. Curious if you think your supply chain can offer any upside to that 40? And then if not, what does that tell you around EUV tool demand in '22? And do you need to start thinking about having sufficient capacity above 50 units?",74

Good question. I think, of course, we'll push the supply chain. And -- but don't expect miracles there. I mean if you get -- at the end of the year, you get 1 or 2 tools extra, okay, fine. But it's not going to give you 5 or 10 tools extra. It's simply not possible. I mean -- so what actually means is that the demand that we cannot fulfill this year, we will fulfill next year. And your point on the 50 capacity. I think it's efficient. The 50 capacity has to do with the fact that although customers are buying units, they're buying basically wafer capacity. And don't forget, we have a higher productivity tool coming out of the 3600D in the second half of this year, which has a 15% higher productivity.
So with 2022, only being these, you already get a 15% higher wafer capacity out there. So with the 50 that we feel comfortable with. Also, from a supply chain point of view, we'll be able to manage that for next year, yes. And the 15% higher productivity on the tools compared to the C, you actually see that we have quite some -- we have ample opportunity to help our customers build wafer capacity, yes?

I think we're not going to be specific on any customer as you can imagine because of the fact that we only have very few. So the issue is that when we look at 2021, 2 things are impacting our shipment schedule to our leading-edge customers is, one is what you refer to is effectively -- has there been a transition from tools that we originally planned for customer A potentially to customer B and C. I think, yes, that has happened.
But on top of that, I think there is the increased demand for advanced nodes, yes? So it's the combination of the 2 that actually caters for maximizing the shipments out of our shipment capability, and it's the redistribution that has happened.

So now on the -- and I think Roger explained that on the 20% to 30% growth. The only reason why the 30% isn't 30% -- not 30%, but 20% is because some of those shipments that were earmarked Memory actually went to Logic. Why? Because Logic was on fire, and Memory was getting into fire in 2021. So just the choice of a customer that, hey, don't ship me to A, but ship me to B because that's why I have more business. So this was the only reason, which actually means that we are seeing -- Memory is coming in, especially DRAM. I mean we need to distinguish between DRAM and 3D NAND. We don't see as strong a recovery in 3D NAND. You could argue because we're not that sensitive to it. But we simply don't see it. We see it in DRAM stronger. So this is really is a DRAM game in 2021, whereby 20% bid growth which is the expectation of today, simply not -- simply too much to be dealt with in the current installed base. That's why we see the orders coming in.
So yes, EUV will be used in DRAM, especially in 1 alpha. But that is going to be limited, as we also mentioned last time. This is not going to be a node on node, let's say, full transition from DPV to EUV. Don't forget that EUV has a -- doesn't have a maturity level of DPV. So there will be a part of the wafer capacity will be allocated to EUV with a limited number of layers, which will grow over time. We'll see the first application of it end of the year and moving into 2022, yes? So it's going to be a gradual adoption of EUV in DRAM.",369

How do you -- I mean you've had a very strong year last year in DPV and even this year looks very good in that technology. I mean do you expect this -- even as EUV ramps up in Memory, et cetera, in DRAM, whenever it does, however slowly does or however fast, does this level of this baseline effect of DPV remain as part of your revenues? And if we just add on EUV over time as we've seen over the last couple of years?",96

I think the number of EUV layers will be relatively limited as compared to Logic. So DPV will be the bulk of the layers and will stay the bulk of the layers, needing better lithographic performance and productivity. So this is why we have these extensive R&D programs still in DPV. I think DPV, in general, will be a bigger part of our business going forward than we anticipated a few years ago. And it's not only Memory, it's like we said in the prepared remarks, it's very much also the mature markets whereby 90-nanometer, 65, 45, 28 are all growing in terms of wafer capacity, for the simple reason that there are applications or device for applications in that technology realm that are basically supporting in IoT solutions. And that's a trend that we underestimated a couple of years ago. I think this has been a big driver for our DPV business. So it's not only Memory, where it will stay strong, it's very much also the broadening application space in DPV.",174

Peter, a question from you, maybe like long side forward-looking, but also looking back maybe 2, 3 years ago. So TSMC is going to spend between $25 billion and $28 billion in CapEx this year. And they expect to grow revenues in the back of that in mid-teens, which means to me that that's a new normal for CapEx, like it's probably going to be a number that keeps growing from here. And I can't imagine a word in which that many leading-edge Logic chip get into data centers, into pieces, into firms without volumes at DRAM following. And so that feels very, very good in the long run for the industry.
And my question is first slide. In 2025 -- so like 2, 3 years ago, you gave us a 2025 outlook with a fairly wide margin. Did that kind of work in which TSMC spends so much in 2021? Was that part of your range? Or does that exceed what you were looking and then secondly, in -- so -- and then yes, of course, so my question behind that is your 2025 like kind of guide, do you think there is today a chance we go above the higher range of that range?",209

Wennink,,Executives,42,"I'm more positive for all kinds of reasons because, like I said in answer to your previous question, I did not expect DPV to be as strong as it is today. And everything that we know, talking to our customers, will stay strong, yes? I think that is -- I could call it a surprise, but that's something that we didn't understand well. We understand that better today.
There's another thing that we assumed, as you know, when we talk about as a base case or a mid-market scenario, starting from the 16-nanometer node, we say basically every node that's 10% lower wafer capacity. So it's minus 10%, minus 10%, minus 10%, so by the time that you're at 5, you've had almost 4 times minus 10% reduction of that wafer capacity needed for that node. That seems very conservative at this moment in time if we listen to our customers. Because as a customer like TSMC doesn't tell us that they're going to spend 25 billion to 28 billion, if they believe that their wafer capacity that they need for those nodes is going to be minus 10%, minus 10%, minus 10%. So they obviously have now a different view as to the size of that market. And I think we all understand drivers. Perhaps not all. But we have -- but most of them, yes? So I think, all in all, I think there is a different basis for our assessment, I think, of where we can be in 2025, 2026 or 2027, for that matter, yes? And I think it hasn't worsened. I think it has gotten better.",272

And that's the trajectory that we're on. And it's a matter of, on the one hand, to your point, seeing tools getting out of warranty, seeing tools produce more and more wafers. So the throughput is going up. And as a result of that, the number of wafers and therefore the paperware for -- going up for us. On the other hand, us being better able to control the cost.

So you are right. I mean the ASP this quarter, but also in Q3 was a little higher than what you typically have in your models. But it is, as we also explained on Q3, to a very -- it is really driven by configuration. So what options are on the tool already when they leave the factory and specific customer requirements. So that's what drives it. And the composition that we have for the EUV sales, both in Q3 and Q4 were kind of the richer configurations as a result of which you saw the higher number in there.
On go-forward basis for the 3600D, I think we mentioned there that you should look at mid-teens in terms of increase over the ASP for -- in comparison to the C model.
In terms of your question on R&D, you are right. I think R&D as a percentage of sales is comparable to where we were last year, actually, so it's high 15s, approaching 16. It's a little lower actually than what we had in 2019. As Peter and I already mentioned in the -- in earlier comments, there is so much opportunity that we see in the road map, and this is both low-Na, High-NA. But also and Peter made reference to that, a number of developments that we're having in terms of DPV and the throughput, imaging and overlay potential that we still see there. There's a lot of potential that we see. And that's why we keep the -- keep it a little bit higher than the 13% than some of you might have in your mind. That is still clearly the goal for 2025. So we're working our way towards that. But at this stage, we believe the company's value has increased by spending this amount.
So I think the approaching 16% that we saw for this year and maybe also for next year would still be appropriate. But then from that point onwards, gradually model it towards the 13% for 2025. I think that's the way I would do it.",348

But once we do that, and we see a significant increase in DPV demand, which we think will last. Then we give our customers the capability to actually have a very productive tool with a lower cost per wafer competitiveness, yes, which, of course, drives a higher sales price.

You might go back to the conference call script, but we never said that we were going to commit ourselves in the supply chain to 45 to 50 units, we -- actually, we said we were not going to do that. We said, we are taking as a bit of a buffer above what our customers at that time, the end of Q3, said that they would need for 2021, which is a lower number than we're currently planning to ship, yes? So we did take that buffer into consideration. Yes, can we squeeze out another 1 or 2? Probably. But we never indicated or we never meant to indicate that we would cover our customers for our full capacity. That's not what we said. And this is not what we did.
So what we actually -- we're probably ending up somewhere in between, yes? Which is good because if we wouldn't have done that, then there would not be a 30% increase in our DPV -- or sorry, in our EUV planned revenue for this year. We are able to do that because we built this buffer capacity in the supply chain, but not everything.",203

Dassen,,Executives,63,"David, on the free cash flow, as we mentioned on the previous call, this is the year where you see 2 effects in that regard. So on the one hand, you see the effect of extended payments that some customers were entitled to, based on all the contracts. And you see the effect under the newer contracts of down payments that are coming in. And they balance out nicely. Although in Q4, we saw most of the effect of the down payments. And in the earlier quarters, you saw the effect of the standard payments. But for the year, it's nicely equaled out. So that's in fact what you see. So very, very strong free cash flow in Q4, making up for some of the things in the previous quarters.
To your question, is there an anomaly in there? Not really an anomaly, just as we had it in previous year, there was some customers choose a factoring solution for some of the payments and some of the down payments, but that -- on their request, but that's their discretion and their request doesn't impact us whatsoever. But that hasn't really changed, I would say, as a policy from last year. And I think the anomaly, if you like, that I just talked about, I think it's really something that we had in 2020.

I just wanted to go to your gross margin guidance where you said that you are likely to be hitting the high end of your 48% to 50% range. But since you're doing a midpoint of 50.5% in Q1, and you will have the 3600D shipping in the second half of the year, which is a corporate average gross margin, which presumably is close to 50%. I'm just wondering what is holding you back from getting to a north of 50% margin for the full year. Is there something specifically in Q2, which could lower that? And also, I would put it in the mix, presumably your DUV shipments are going to be quite strong this year, which should also have a positive effect on that.",131

Dassen,,Executives,66,"Well, first off, we shouldn't forget that there is a very strong improvement over gross margin if you compare it year-on-year, right? So let's not forget that. As I mentioned to you, of the 48.6%, you should start by deducting 1%, you get to 47.6%. That's really the starting point for the year. So even if I say that we're approaching the 50%, I think that's a very strong improvement over last year.
If you then say what is going to be different in the next quarters? To a very large extent, it's mix, right? So in Q1, we have quite some immersion sales. And as you know, immersion has a very strong gross margin. We have more immersion sales in there, relatively speaking. We have relatively low EUV sales in there. So while you're right that the gross margin per tool in the second half on the 3600D is going to be a bit bigger, I think it's also fair to say that in the second half we'll see more EUV sales relatively speaking than you have in Q1. So in that way, it kind of creates an equilibrium there.
I think it's also fair to say, when I say approaching the upper limit, approaching the 50%. When Peter talks about potential, the potential over the 15.7, I think it is fair to say that the potential that we see there, as Peter mentioned, is in DPV and in Logic. So that would lead to a further uplift of the gross margin. So it's 50% that I was -- I think we're approaching is for the 15.7 indication that we gave or expectation that we articulated in terms of sales. If we're going to see sales uptick, I think there should also be an uptick in the gross margin percentage.",301

The upside that we were referring to is DPV Logic. That is where the very large part is upside in China. Which like I said, if we can ship under the current rules, then that upside would materialize, yes? And which would have the impact on the top line and on the gross margin, as Roger mentioned.

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the first quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2021. 
Net sales came in above guidance at EUR 4.4 billion, primarily due to higher Installed Base business from upgrades. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized EUR 1.1 billion revenue from 7 systems this quarter. Due to the delay in one of our customers' road maps, we jointly decided to buy back 2 of their new systems and shipped these to another customer this year. This was accounted for as a revenue reversal in Q1 of 2021. 
For the systems shipped in Q4 2020 with a new configuration, we were able to complete site acceptance and recognized revenue this quarter. We also shipped 1 system this quarter without factory acceptance testing, so revenue will be recognized in the subsequent quarter after a customer site acceptance. Again, the net result is 7 EUV revenue systems in Q1.
Net system sales of EUR 3.1 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 78%, with the remaining 22% from Memory. The strength in Logic drives both deep UV and EUV revenue. The Memory business is mainly driven by DRAM. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.2 billion above guidance due to increased upgrade business as customers pull forward software upgrades that can quickly increase productivity of systems in this high-semiconductor-demand environment. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 53.9% and was above guidance due primarily to the additional software upgrade business. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 623 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 168 million, which was slightly above our guidance. Net income in Q1 was EUR 1.3 billion, representing 30.5% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 3.21. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.7 billion. Moving to the order book. Q1 net system bookings came in at EUR 4.7 billion, including EUR 2.3 billion for EUV systems and another strong quarter of deep UV demand. Order intake was largely driven by Logic with 76% of bookings, primarily due to EUV order intake, with Memory accounting for the remaining 24%. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2021. We expect Q2 total net sales to be between EUR 4 billion and EUR 4.1 billion. The directionally lower guidance is primarily due to shipments in the quarter, both EUV and deep UV, that will not receive factory acceptance testing due to customers' desire to bring systems into production as quickly as possible. Therefore, we will recognize revenue in subsequent quarters after completion of acceptance testing at customer sites. 
In addition, the Installed Base business is expected to be lower in Q2 versus Q1 as customers pulled forward installation of productivity software upgrades to quickly increase wafer capacity. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 900 million. 
Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be around 49%. The lower gross margin quarter-on-quarter is mainly due to delayed revenue from immersion systems that we plan to ship without factory acceptance testing as well as lower Installed Base Management sales versus Q1. 
Expected R&D expenses for Q2 are EUR 650 million. And SG&A is expected to come in at EUR 175 million, reflecting a continued investment in the future growth of the company. In support of our aggressive product road maps and opportunity to fill in some of our high-value product developments, we plan to increase our R&D investments, primarily in EUV, via increased development capacity. 
Furthermore, this increase will allow us to compensate for remote work impacts. We don't expect this increase to scale at the same level as our revised revenue increase, with R&D expenses for 2021 around 14% to 15% of sales. We expect SG&A to remain around 4% of sales for 2021. Our estimated 2021 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 15%. 
As mentioned last quarter, ASML intends to declare a total dividend with respect to 2020 of EUR 2.75 per ordinary share. This is a 15% increase compared to the 2019 dividend. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share paid in November 2020, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of EUR 1.55 per ordinary share. The 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 29, 2021 in Veldhoven. 
In Q1 2021, ASML purchased 3.5 million shares under the 2020 through 2022 program for a total amount over EUR 1.6 billion. Our expected free cash flow generation enables the opportunity for continuation of significant share buybacks in the coming quarters, and we expect to complete the execution of our current share buyback program early. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",824

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a very strong quarter in both sales and profitability, driven by continued strength in both Logic and Memory, as well as significant demand for upgrades, as customers look to bring additional capacity online as quickly as possible. The additional upgrades consisted primarily of software-based productivity packages. 
We are seeing a significant increase in demand from our customers across all market segments on all nodes, mature and advanced, compared to 3 months ago. And we expect another very strong year with demand across our entire product portfolio. 
The steeper-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors, amplified by the COVID, induced lower investments of the industry in 2020, thus creating significant upside to demand over the past quarter. This more cyclical demand sits on top of the secular growth from the accelerated buildup of the worldwide digital infrastructure and assuring demand not only for advanced and mature logic nodes, but also for memory. 
In Logic, customers continue to see strong demand across the broad application space for both advanced node as well as mature nodes. And last quarter, we expected revenue from Logic in 2021 to be up 10% year-on-year. However, we now expect Logic to be up around 30% this year. 
In Memory, the applications that are driving the strong Logic demand are also fueling demand for Memory. As we mentioned in earlier calls, the Memory recovery started last year and continues to strengthen as customer plans to increase capacity is driving significant demands for our systems in the second half of the year. Compared to last quarter, where we expected revenue from Memory in 2021 to be up 20% year-on-year, we now expect Memory revenue to be up around 50% this year. 
On our Installed Base business, service revenue will continue to scale with the growing installed base and with increasing contribution from EUV services as these systems ramp more and more wafers in volume production. We're also supporting our customers with upgrades to maximize performance of their installed base. 
In order to meet the high demand in the current tight chip supply environment, customers are prioritizing software upgrades to quickly increase capacity, as reflected by our hardware upgrade of Memory in Q1. And some hardware upgrades require extended machine time to be installed. And in the current high-demand environment, customers will be less willing to take systems down, which has a dampening impact on the 2021 growth profile of hardware upgrades. We therefore still expect growth on our Installed Base business of around 10% this year, as mentioned last quarter. 
On EUV, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in this technology, which is translating to expanding layer counts in Logic and increasing deployment of EUV in Memory at multiple customers, evidenced by a number of customer announcements around increases in their CapEx plans, which will include spending on EUV for advanced nodes. 
To support this strong EUV demand, we are working to increase our output capability. At the same time, we are driving our product road map to produce higher productivity machines, which will increase the effective EUV capacity per system and the wafer output capacity of our customers. We plan to transition to the NXE:3600D system in the second half of the year, which will provide customers with a 15% to 20% higher productivity compared to the NXE:3400C systems shipping in the first half of the year. 
Limited by the available modules and parts this year, we're still planning for growth of around 30% in EUV revenue this year. With the expanding adoption of EUV at our customers, we see increased demand building in 2022 and beyond. We are improving our manufacturing cycle time and are planning our supply chain for a capacity of around 55 systems next year. 
And as a reminder, all of our planned shipments in 2022 will be NXE:3600D systems, with the increased productivity capability. Our strength and outlook on the year relative to last quarter is primarily driven by the demand for deep UV systems. 
With increased demand on leading-edge nodes as well as mature nodes running longer and ramping stronger, demand for our immersion and dry systems is stronger than ever. We have put in place plans to increase our deep UV capacity to help meet our customers' increased demands. 
In our application business, as demand for scanners continues to increase, we expect a step-up in demand for our YieldStar metrology systems, particularly in Logic. The newly released YieldStar 385 is beginning to ramp across our customer base as well. And with the recovery in Memory, specifically in 3D NAND, we expect a substantial increase in e-beam inspection revenue this year. 
For the industry at a high level, we see 3 trends driving considerable growth this year and in the years to come. The first trend, in the shorter term, that's more cyclical or, you could say, a catch-up-driven demand from decisions made in 2022 due to the global pandemic. These shortages were initially evident in the automotive market, but more recently, there are also indications of supply tightness impacting other market segments. We expect this to drive considerable demand for lithography systems this year and into next year. 
The second is a secular growth trend, driven by the digital transformation taking place as we become a more connected world across both people and machines. And this transformation was further accelerated over the past year with the increased remote activity and reliance on technology to stay connected. 
These secular trends are driven by expanding end-market applications, such as 5G, AI and high-performance computing. These and other mobile distributed applications drive demand for both advanced logic as well as more mature technology required for the services and applications that drive the growth of the digital infrastructure. And along with increased logic demand comes increased memory demand. This, in turn, drives demand across our entire product portfolio. 
And the third trend, which we're starting to see now and which we will likely continue to see longer-term, is the desire for more technology sovereignty, which includes semiconductor and silicon-based technology, leading to a geographical decoupling, as different governments put initiatives in place to localize supply chains and become more self-sufficient. This, inevitably, will create some level of inefficiency in the semiconductor supply chain and creates additional equipment demand as more fabs are strategically built across the globe. 
If we summarize the growth of the different segments and the trends just discussed, we now expect sales growth towards 30% this year. To achieve this growth, we are ramping up our capacity to support customer demand, resulting in a stronger second half. 
With the higher revenue and increased mix of deep UV and upgrades, we now expect gross margins to be between 51% and 52% this year. With the industry as a whole, the long-term demand drivers only increase our confidence in our future growth outlook towards 2025, and we plan to provide an update on our 2025 scenarios at our Investor Day in September. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",1176

I want to follow-up on the EUV revenue target for this year. I understand that you're keeping it unchanged at 30%. But in case you're able to improve the supply chain and availability of subcomponent, could there be upside to the shipment, even though you may not be able to recognize the revenue? And I have a follow-up.",59

You just used 2 very important words, in case, which is the problem because we said it last quarter, these are very long-lead-time items. I mean, as a lens, as a manufacturing cycle time or, yes, I would say, lead them over 12 months. So if we have an audit, the lens is not going to be there. 
So I think when we look at capacity increase, we really, really need to look at next year. I think it's virtually impossible to get more out of 2021 as we have planned today. So really, it's going to be -- that's why we also mentioned that working with our supply chain and looking at the demand next year, we are now planning, and we haven't received full confirmation yet of the supply chain on it. But our focus is on the 55 systems next year. 
Bearing in mind also that, I think we said it before, customers are buying systems, but effectively, they're buying wafer capacity. And with next year, only 3600Ds, which already provides you with a 50% to 20% productivity increase. Well, if you then multiply, let's take the average of 15% to 20%, 17.5% or, let's say, 18% extra productivity increase for your system, then the 55 systems actually translate into 65 systems, with 3400C productivity. So it's -- this is the way that you need to look at it.",234

Thanks for the detail. And a quick follow-up. As I think about beyond 2021 and your operating margin, could there be a scenario where your key customers would share some of the development costs associated with High-NA, similar to what happened to EUV almost a decade ago, so that, that could also help drive overall operating margin to above 33%?",61
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3656.0,2254702.0,87479443.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,10,"Well, I think -- I don't think it's likely because it's not necessary. I mean when we go back to almost a decade ago, our R&D expense at that time was EUR 600 million per year. And then when you looked at the size of the EUV program at that time and still you need to consider that the entire Low-NA EUV program will have cost more if we don't end it than the High-NA program. 
So if you have a look at it then, the relative effort to bring EUV to life was so large that it would have put a significant financial strain on the P&L of ASML which, of course, we could not afford, which is not the case today. And I think, if you think about operating margins, it is more a matter of maturity of EUV, which will, of course, lead to better-performing tools with higher productivity, with higher value. EUV service revenue, that will grow going forward. And I think those are the most important drivers for operating margin. Roger?",176

I mean the gross margin components, I think, Peter, you just referenced them why -- it's the EUV ASP. And as a result of that, the EUV systems gross margin and the EUV service gross margin, those are the major drivers on the gross margin side. 
And I think, also, in the introduction, we've been pretty clear on what the ambition is for OpEx, right? So 14% to 15% for R&D and 4% for SG&A. And our longer-term ambition, at least, on the R&D side is to try and model that back to around 13% over time.",100

So thanks for the color on how you increase capacity for this year and next year. That's very clear. My question would be more over 2, 3 years. If I recall correctly, like about my visit in winter in Veldhoven, you guys have set out to be able to do 60 EUV tools per year then 20 High-NA EUV tools. And when I took a shot at looking at how much would be needed over the next 3, 4 years, I felt like this was actually a bit limited and that you might actually need more capacity. 
And so I would love to hear your take on that. In the longer term, do you think it will make sense to think about increasing your overall capacity? And if that's the case, what kind of lead times are we talking that for that kind of endeavor? And I have a quick follow-up.",152

It's a very good question, Pierre. And I think it's a long-term strategic question. Let me try to answer it this way. When I talked about the 3 trends that the company will have to face in terms of demand cycles, that's, of course, the shorter term, which, you could say, it's a catch-up of the lower level of investments we saw last year because of the pandemic, which is -- which are catching up this year and I think throughout next year or, I think, as a part of next year. 
Then as the secular growth turn, which we have underestimated, I think you can go back to the Capital Markets Day in 2016 and '18, I don't think we, at that moment in time, anticipated the strength of the deep UV market that we see today. And that's the third trend, which is basically the driver of technological sovereignty by different countries and different governments. 
Those are all -- at this moment in time, those will be the drivers. But it's also difficult to really get a very clear view on this. So what your question is, taking that into consideration, should you guys be looking at increasing your capacity beyond the 60, the magical 60, that we always mentioned? Good question. And I think this is actually the work that we're doing today, yes? 
We're looking at this, and why do we need to do this? So now the lead time -- now if you have to build a complete new factory, let's say you need to build a new optics factory, then the lead time is 2 to 3 years, yes? Because you need to build the factory, you need to procure the machines or then -- by the way, when it comes to optics manufacturing, you have to build those machines yourself because they're not available. So that will be longer. 
But a lot of ways to increase capacity and that's through cycle time reduction, that's through process optimization. And so it's this complexity of measures that we can take to see how we can drive the total capacity up, which, by the way, all have lead times that are beyond the 55 units that we're planning for next year, which doesn't mean that it couldn't be higher in '23 and '24. But that's the work that we need to do today, which, by the way, we are doing, yes?",406

And a quick follow-up is very much related to that. You mentioned like the geopolitical situation. When I look at the overall value chain and how much it depends on what's happening in Veldhoven, on the single site where you assemble your tools, which is almost scary, it's a weak point for the global value chain and probably a place where your clients and governments are getting maybe a bit nervous about that. So do you have conversations with people around you about diversifying your size and creating supply that would not only be -- like, would be less dependent on the Netherlands?",106

I think the -- that's the -- the situation of today is not very different than the situation 5 years ago. You could also -- you can only argue that the realization of people is now different, but has never changed. It's what it is. 
But the same can be said for our own customers that are basically concentrated in one particular area, or some of our peers that -- with some of their production facilities only make a couple of hundred tools per year in 1 or 2 single sites. It is the concentration of the semiconductor industry in different geographical areas that actually now starts to make governments think it has never been an issue, yes? It's only becoming an issue when this -- an almost seamless ecosystem that has been built across many, many borders are now being -- that ecosystem is now being threatened, I would say, almost by blockages of that seamlessness, yes? And then you get an issue, yes? 
So -- but I think it's nothing different. It's always been this way, and especially over the last 5 years, I would say. There's high concentration of leading-edge technology across the value chain. But given the geopolitical situation, people are more aware of, it and they start now thinking of self -- of levels of self-sufficiency that, a couple of years ago, nobody thought of.",231

And further down into the year, we've now said this is how we look at the full year, of course, still expecting that the regulatory situation remains a little bit the way it is today. And therefore, what previously was upside -- and the way we talked about is this upside has now really been included in that number.

Wennink,,Executives,36,"On the sustainability, yes, and especially deep UV and apps. I think, as I said it on the -- as an answer on an earlier question, when we look at how we see the deep UV market and the aftermarket today as compared to 3 years ago, about 2018, I think we have a different view. And that's driven by the fact that, of course, our entire deep UV portfolio, which is immersion and dry, we have -- we cannot fulfill the demand of our customers all the time. 
And that has to do with the fact that our analysis shows that with the combination of, let's say, advanced sensing technology, 5G, the ability to process all the data through high-performance compute. And that, in a distributed fashion, basically leading-edge compute also goes to the edge. I call that distributed systems. And the distributed system is, for instance, a car, but it's also one of our machines in the field. 
And then, increasingly, requires collection of data, transport of data, processing of data, not only to the most advanced high-performance compute but as part of the distributed system. And that system inevitably includes mature technology, which could be image sensors, power ICs, MEMS, analog solutions. It's the whole thing. And that means, if we would have a high line system available today, it will be sold yesterday. 
So it's everywhere. And that has to do with the proliferation of chip technology and the distributed computing and the distributed systems that we are seeing. That is something that will not go away in our minds. This is why I said also in my prepared remarks that we are also planning and looking into what is the level of our deep UV capacity increase that we need, both in mature and in emerging. And it's going to be double-digit increase as from where we are today. 
Now how much can we stretch that? Or how much is needed? That's exactly what we're doing with EUV. We need to line up with the supply chain. And we need to go deeper into what it takes in terms of capacity lead time. Do they need to build square meters? Do they need to hire people? Is it going to be possible through cycle time reductions or through process optimization? 
This is the work that we're doing today. Because remember, 5 months ago, we were looking at a completely different world, yes? So this is a ramp-up, but we do believe that this has a long runway.",422

On the ASP for EUV, it's well-noted, you're absolutely right. So this quarter, in Q1, we're looking at an ASP for EUV of about EUR 160 million. Part of that is configuration. We've talked about that in the past. If you look at the last 3 quarters, we've consistently been looking at an ASP of around EUR 145 million. And this time, it's a little bit up for another reason that I'll come to in a moment. 
So in fact, what you see is that -- in fact, in the last year, we've been positively surprised by the options on the 2, the options that were ordered on the 2. And as a result of that, the configuration was richer than anticipated. And as a result of that, you fairly consistently see now that the ASP ranges above the EUR 130 million that we talked about in the past. 
And it's fairly consistent. We've seen EUR 145 million or up. The reason that is extra of this, this year, there's a few accounting things. We've talked about accounting for VPAs in the past. So there's a few accounting reasons why it's a wide higher, it's a wide EUR 160 million rather than EUR 145 million.
But we're out of the -- just looking at the configuration that we've seen on the tools in the past couple of quarters, the EUR 145 million anchor points, EUR 40 million ASP for EUV is probably the right way to go. And I'd say that, recognizing that this is about the last quarter that we're really looking at a large number of fees in the revenue.",273

Obviously, there were some changes made last year that ended up limiting what potentially should have been higher shipments this year, and some of that probably kicks in next year. But in your discussions with customers, Peter, just -- obviously, there's a very, very strong cyclical tailwind to the industry today that's driving appetite for capacity increase. 
But EUV is on a very, very long time horizon for customers 18 months rather than 6 months planning. How do you feel like their assumptions have changed that's driving that upside? Is it primarily because of their confidence and penetration of EUV in higher layers? Or is there an element of actually just building bigger nodes now that's driving the need for more capacity at this point?",142

Wennink,,Executives,40,"I think, David, it's both. I think we're seeing -- I only -- what I refer to as a comment that was made by the CEO of one of our large customers. That actually manage and know we're going to double the number of EUV layers on our next node. And I think that's a trend that we are seeing, simply because the advantages of EUV are not only, you could say, the pure economic cost per layer because you can eliminate multiple patterning, but it's also the electrical characteristics and the simplicity of the process. Lower risk, that's one of them, yes? So there's many other side effects that actually lead people to go for EUV. 
So yes, it's higher layer counts, that's what we're seeing, which is true for Memory and for Logic. But also, when we talk to customers, we all talk about bigger nodes. It has to do with this secular trend, trend #2 that I talked about. And that number -- and trend #3, the technological sovereignty, will just be a layer on top, which will not go away, which will take time. It takes 2 to 3 years to build a semiconductor factory, and we put it into action. 
So -- but I think this is -- so it is bigger nodes. It is strategic investments. It's High-NA accounts. And this is what I -- as an answer to a previous question, we all need to take this into consideration. Some of it we already saw coming, but what does it mean for our capacity needs beyond 2022, which, by the way, some of that capacity, if that would be needed, would be the result of, like I said, process optimization, cycle time improvement, different work schedules and potentially square meters, that could be. So -- but it's all of the above.",308

And I think we mentioned in the past that the amount of the PO is a little bit dependent on the moment where the order is being placed. So if the order is being placed nicely in line with the lead time, then the down payment is lower than one that's placed a little bit later than that. 
But you also know that the PO in and by itself is a bit of a nonevent for us because we work so closely with the customer that we sort of understand what they're doing, what they want and when they need it. So the PO is a bit of a nonevent for us. But yes, the short answer is absolutely, there will be down payments to place at the moment of the PO.",155

I think, for this year, it's not a surprise. I mean, you just need to go back to our conference calls in the last 2 quarters, where we actually saw a recovery of especially DRAM starting. And I think I gave some color 3 months ago where I basically said, yes, we had a decent shipment core in Q4 of last year, which basically goes into production in Q1. 
But if you look at a bit growth of 20% this year, then our calculations show that we very quickly -- at the next output capacity of our DRAM customers in this year, where -- and we would reach that pretty quick, so we would need more capacity addition. That's exactly what we have seen. So I think it's just the beginning. These things -- so yes, I think, yes, it will move into next year. 
Now you've been around also long. So that -- in the Memory business, yes, there is more tendency to have, from time to time, some overcapacity and some undercapacity. But how long that will last, I don't know. But still, this is some -- [ there was a BM above ] telling me, say, this secular trend, when there's such a high demand in logic, all this stuff doesn't only work with only logic. So it also needs memory, yes? 
So it's going to be quite interesting to see how quickly the Memory capacity will be added throughout this year, early next year, and what the underlying bit growth percentages will be. Now I think, having said that, you notice also Memory is more cyclical than Logic, but nothing that indicated to me, at this moment in time, that we are looking at building an overcapacity. There's nothing I can see at this moment in time. We're just starting.",305

And that's really stretching it, in terms of our production capacity this year. If it would have more capacity, we could probably do more. Okay. Likely, we would be able to do more. So your question really is answered in a sense that I already said in my prepared remarks, we're looking at increasing our deep UV capacity, both dry, mature and immersion. And that's not going to be 5%. 
I mean it's going to be double digit. But that will take some further analysis of what needs to be done. Is it through optimization, yes? Things like process optimization and added workforce or cycle time reduction. Or has it to do with square meter capacity for like factories? That is something that we'll -- as under consideration today, and we're looking into that together with our supply chain. So not so much for us, that is really in the supply chain, yes?
So the reason why I say this is because we believe that we need extra capacity, yes? And it has to do with the underlying trends, the trends that I talked about earlier. So yes, the 40% makes me think to just over $8 billion, yes? Where you have $7.7 billion, so you're a bit more conservative. But this is -- directionally, it is correct, but this is the answer.",226

I'm wondering, given the changes that we've seen from a number of your lead customers or at least the public announcements from your lead customers over the last 3 or 4 months and the fact that you are now having to rethink the need for additional capacity expansion, whether your site or within the supply chain, are they now giving -- and I presume yes, they're wanting it sooner rather than later. 
It always seems to be the way. And yet you've got fairly extensive lead times, particularly so for EUV, perhaps slightly less so for DUV in terms of building out this capacity. Are you getting better visibility today in terms of what those customers are going to need looking out over the next 3, 4, 5 years in order to give you that confidence in making such a decision?",159

It's a good question. I mean, and also, you've been around also. I think all these people have been around for a long time. So that -- yes, when we underinvest, there's also going to be a knee-jerk reaction, like it always happens. So this is more the shorter-term correction of a misplanning, yes? That's happening today. 
That's what I call -- it's the trend #1, yes? But clearly, customers understanding that our capacity lead times and our manufacturing lead times are wrong. So they do share with us a longer-term vision. Now I'm not 5 years out, that's a bit too much to ask. But certainly 2, 3 years out, yes? 
So I think, I would say, for 2022, 2023, we definitely have the discussions about what they need in terms of expansion plans, in terms of that they have plans, in terms of what they see. When we talk about Logic, the anticipated capacity ramp in terms of the tape-outs that they have on the shelves so that they see it coming on and 5 and then 3. 
So it is not just some pie-in-the-sky thinking. It is this real underlying discussion that they have with their customers. And their design requirements that they get from an increasing customer base, which has to do with high-power compute there with AI and with -- with all the applications that we talked about because of the whole digital transition. 
So yes, there's more visibility to the point that the planning visibility is, I would say, deeper. And this is also where we base our request to the supply chain on. It's a vet on that discussion. And which is going to be -- it's a costly discussion because you not add capacity for nothing. So this is -- and it is also true for our customers. It's going to be costly, but they've been very explicit to the outside world and to the media about what their plans are. 
It's thought through based on what they see for their customers and the customers of their customers tell them. So that's why I talk about these 3 trends. And this is -- this, basically, is the base for the visibility, but how much is in the end will be or we will need. There's always a risk of underestimation, but also risk of overestimation. 
And that's what we need to take into consideration when we say what's wise. And then, like I said, this is just something of the last 3 or 4 months where it starts to accelerate. It gives us a bit of time in our supplies, particularly, to figure out what is with them.",447

I'm not going to comment specifically on this quarter, but in general, just listening to the commentary that we made on our expectations for next year, it's pretty clear that, also for the next quarters, we do expect a healthy order intake for EUV, right, because at this stage, EUR 7.4 billion. And if you do the math, what you think system business is going to be next year, if you translate that at the 55 capacity that we've been talking about, it's pretty clear that we're still looking at a significant order intake.

I wonder if you could just talk through the drivers of improvement as we go towards the end of the year. Then you referenced, related to this, that you're seeing higher ASPs related to a particular area the CMO. I was just wondering, to the extent that we see an expected ASPs of a D model could also be a gross margin with -- of EUV.",103

At the beginning, you were a little bit tough to understand, but I think your question really was, how do you expect the gross margin to further develop on EUV. And as we mentioned before, we do expect in the second half with the introduction of the D model, we expect EUV system gross margin to be at the level of the corporate gross margin. So -- and I can confirm that that's exactly what's going on. 
You are right that the -- that we did see a little bit of a reset on the ASP for the C model, right? So we've been talking about 130. But as I mentioned, the configuration quarter after quarter turned out to be richer than we previously anticipated. And I think it's fair to say that the 10% to 15% uptick that we've been talking about on the -- for the D model, in comparison to the C model, still hopes right? So if you take the 145-ish basis for the C model, then I think a low, low TAM increase over that in terms of ASP, I think, is probably what you should be looking at for the ASP calculation. 
And of course, to the extent that, that is better, that, of course, is also helpful a little bit on the gross margin side as well.",226

And as a follow-up to that, if I may. You've talked about building capacity for deep UV. You are stretched at EUR 8 billion. And you talked about double digit, I think, earlier in the call. Is it fair to say that you would expect this EUR 8 billion to be exceeded, or basically even a higher contribution from deep UV? If not in 2022, then certainly beyond 2020?",133

You've listened carefully, Amit, and that is true. Everything you just said, do we expect UV sales to be up year-on-year. I don't know about the year that you are imagining. But the fact that we are looking into increasing our deep UV capacity means that we believe deep UV sales will be up and in what year and is year-on-year. But I think, medium to long-term, we have, indeed, reassessed the need for deep UV capacity going forward. 
And when you talk about capacity increase, you don't do this for 1 year. You do this because you feel medium to long-term that is needed. So yes, and it also means that if we do that, then -- and we say we'll be around EUR 8 billion this year on deep UV. Yes, that we would expect that, that would increase because otherwise, you don't need to build capacity because we could do with what we have today.",159

I just wanted to clarify that. And secondly, very quickly on geopolitics. We've heard a lot of noise. Based on what you have said today, it seems like you expect the whole geopolitical dynamic to be a net positive.

I think Roger said it, is that I think we are now where we are because we're through Q1, we're in Q2 now, we have included that EUR 600 million upside into the number that we gave you. However, we don't control the geopolitical situation and the lawmaking. But given the market situation where we are today, if some of that EUR 600 million would not be there because of geopolitical roadblocks, then the demand, actually, will ship those systems somewhere else. 
And if you then look at how that affects shipments to China versus the longer-term geopolitical impact. It's just a matter of timing, yes? That's -- the first one could be short-term this year, the others are definitely long-term because when you -- they all -- it is all about where do we build a new fab. Well, it takes 2 to 3 years. So when you really look at adding capacity at the time frame, 24, 25. Is that capacity starts coming to the market.

So on the more recurring side, I think what we've said in the past is that the way to model that for EUV is to take the ASP of a tool and take about 6% of that. And that's when the tool is up and running at it's envisaged capacity, then you would have 6% of that ASP as the recurring revenue for service and maintenance for that tool. 
So that excludes upgrades, but just for the regular sort of a maintenance. 6% of the ASP is what you would see there. So again, the assumption, the tool needs to be up and running at the envisaged capacity, and it should be out of warranty. As long as the tool is in warranty, the number is a bit lower. So that's really the way to model it. 
As it comes to upgrades, that's a little bit more difficult to do, right? Because upgrades is lumpy, upgrades is dependent on what the customer wants in terms of productivity gains, what they want to make available to us in terms of the machine time. So that's a little bit harder to predict. But at least, on the regular service and maintenance side, this is the way to model the 6% of the ASP once the tool is up and running and out of warranty.",223

The first quarter result was very good. I mean we had sales of about EUR 4.4 billion, which was above what we guided. Gross margin, also above what we guided, close to 54%, very good. And I think the main reason why it was above guidance is basically because of the market situation. Customers are short of wafers out. You just read the papers, I mean, chip shortages everywhere. So the most effective and efficient way to increase wafers is to upgrade our machines with higher productivity. 
And that's what we call the productivity enhancement package, which is software. So that can be installed pretty quick. And so customers pooled everything that they had in plan for productivity improvements into Q1. So our installed base business, which ended up at EUR 1.2 billion, was also way above guidance. And of course, at software, it's good margin. So it's really the upgrade business to get more wafers out, which had a benefit to us that it was a very good margin product. And on top of that, good order intake, EUR 4.7 billion, and about 50% EUV. So it was a very good quarter.",194

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Well, I think what you see is that EUV has definitely reached HVM, high-volume manufacturing. And that's driven by the fact that customers see the benefits. So they see in Logic, they will apply more layers to EUV than we anticipated. And also EUV is now accepted in Memory. All major memory, especially DRAM makers, have now announced the introduction of EUV.
Now this year, we said it also last quarter, we are limited because we didn't plan for more systems than we ship this year. We -- probably our EUV business will grow about 30%, which was the same as what we said last quarter. But we have to look forward and look to next year. And I think next year, the demand curve that we're currently seeing is continuing sharply because of the high demand. 
So we are currently planning, together with our supply chain, which is probably the most important, for 55 systems next year. And the systems next year will be 3600Ds, which is basically the successor of the 3400, the C version. And the D version will be introduced in the second half this year. So next year, 55 systems will all be 3600Ds. And those are a very important system for our customers because they have 15% to 20% higher productivity wafers per day capability than the current machine.",225

Wennink,,Executives,5,"Yes, it has definitely changed since the beginning of the year. I think that we have seen a significant spurt in terms of customer demand. And I think it's driven by the things that we all know. I mean it's the digital transition. It's the digital transformation. I mean it's evidenced by the rollout of 5G across the globe, in Asia, U.S., and to a lesser extent, in Europe, which actually drives artificial intelligence, high-performance compute. So all these developments and services and products that are driving the need for our systems. 
Now that has been a big change as compared to 3 months ago. Let's take Logic. Now when you look at Logic, 3 months ago, we thought Logic would grow at 10% this year. Now we think it grows with 30% this year. 
In Memory, 3 months ago, we said Memory will probably grow about 20% as compared to 2020. It's not 20%, it's 50%. 
On installed base, a little bit different. I think it is still around 10%. It has to do with the fact that, what I said earlier, the easy upgrades, the software upgrades, are all being pooled in. So we saw there's a big step-up in Q1. So that's installed. You don't need to install the rest of the year. 
And the other installations are hardware. And hardware has a big advantage because it can provide you with a lot of productivity. But one downside, you have to put the tool down. And in a time where you can't make enough wafers, you don't want to put the tool down. So this is why the planned upgrades are the planned upgrades, and we don't see a lot of opportunity above the 10% that we guided before.",292

Wennink,,Executives,7,"Well, if you look at the forecast now for 2021, and you remember what I just said about Logic, 30%; Memory, 50% up, 10% up for installed base. And it's not a surprise that our total sales this year will become very close. Now because there's a lead time and we need to ramp up, it's probably more focused towards the second half of the year. But it looks very healthy, close to 30% growth, and also has a good impact on gross margin because it's not EUV. Like I said, EUV, we said, 30% growth a quarter ago and will be around 30% also today for this year. 
But it means that DPV will grow, and that's higher corporate gross margins. And that also means that it will have an effect on the gross margin of the company this year. I think we'll end up, for the total year, between 51% and 52%. Now being in a situation where we have a good top line, good profitability and the demand of our customers, not only for this year, but also the years to come, is going up in terms of output, we also see a lot of opportunity to pull some of our R&D efforts in and actually create new services and new products that will help our customers to deal with that situation. 
So I think also R&D will grow, but not to the extent that, let's say, in relative extent as the top line. But it will still then end up anywhere between 14% and 15% of sales. Now SG&A around 4%. And that gives you a picture for this year. 
Now on the quarter, we guided the quarter EUR 4 million to EUR 4.1 billion in sales and 49% margin. Well, that seems a bit light when you just listened to 30% growth for the total year and 51% to 52% gross margin. 
There's 2 reasons. Basically, the first reason is the top line. As I said to you before, customers want their wafers out sooner, not later, sooner. And one way to do that is to skip the factory acceptance test here in the Netherlands, basically ship the system without testing, which saves you a couple of weeks of cycle time, ship it directly to the customer and do the acceptance test at the customer. But it means that the tools that are shipped at the end of the quarter will be revenue recognized only at acceptance in Q3. So that's a couple of hundred million that we're missing, missing look -- well, actually book them in Q3. And that, of course, is DPV. That's high margin. 
And on top of that, I told you before, some of the software upgrades for higher productivity will pool into Q1. You won't have them in Q2. So Q2, instead of EUR 1.2 billion of installed base sales, it's probably more like 0.9%, which is high margin. That has a temporary impact on the margin in Q2. So Q2 a bit light. But the total year looks very strong and the second half also.",516

Wennink,,Executives,9,"Well, I think it's very healthy. I think I would like to separate the growth profile into, let's say, 3 trends. One trend is I would call a more cyclical trend. 2020, the COVID year, was really a year where also customers were cautious. I think, looking back, too cautious so that underspent, you could call it, is now translating into the demand for 2021. Of course, that will take some time before we have our output done. So our second half will be a bit higher. And that trend, you could argue, should go away or should taper off in 2022. 
Now there's a second trend. That's a secular trend, the underlying trend. And I talked about it. I think it is the continuous innovation and the driver innovation driven by the rollout of 5G. It's artificial intelligence. It's high-performance compute. That underlying trend, which is the digital transformation, we see it everywhere, leading to distributed computing. That will be there for years to come. And that trend will also lead to higher demand for semiconductors and for our equipment, which is one of the reasons why we're stepping up our capacity. We're stepping up capacity. Like I said, 55 systems in EUV. But also in DPV, we are looking at increasing our build capacity, not only with us, but also in the supply chain. 
And there's the third trend. The third trend is driven by the geopolitical situation, which actually leads to major regions looking for technological sovereignty, basically being able to be self-sufficient when it comes to electronics and semiconductors. And we've seen announcements, governments but also companies focusing on expanding capacity in the U.S. There are significant talks in Europe, in Asia. Well, that will lead to, I think, a higher capital intensity because it's decoupling as a worldwide ecosystem, but also leads to, I think, some capital inefficiency. 
Well, there's a beneficiary of that capital inefficiency, and that's us. So I think those 3 trends paint a very, very positive future for this company. And I'm looking forward to share our positive views and the scenarios that are underlying those views during our Capital Markets Day in September this year, which we all hope will be live and in-person. And I'm looking forward to that event. It's going to be exciting.",386

Wennink,,Executives,1,"Yes. Our Q2 results were very good. And as we indicated last quarter, we ended the second quarter with a sales number of EUR 4 billion, where we have to remind ourselves that, that EUR 4 billion may look a bit low as compared to the first quarter and a bit low as compared to our guidance for the third quarter. And we need to remember that in the second quarter we shipped a number of machines without what we call a factory acceptance test. So basically the revenue falls in the next quarter for revenue recognition purposes. It's about a EUR 300 million shift, yes, from Q2 to Q3, but it was a good quarter.
And gross margin, 50.9%, is above guidance. It was driven largely by we're selling more software upgrades. I mean customers are looking for more productivity, but also there's a onetime release of some deferred revenue, which was an accounting release.
So installed based business, EUR 1.1 billion, also good. EUR 1 billion of net profit.
I mean I think most noticeable, I think, in the second quarter was the order intake, EUR 8.3 billion. I think it's the highest quarterly order intake we've ever seen, with EUR 4.9 billion for EUV, so pretty good.",210

Wennink,,Executives,3,"2021 -- it may not be a surprise. I mean it's going to be a very strong year. And we -- as a quarter ago, we guided about a 30% increase, as compared to last year. And I think now we're at 35%. So everybody is working extremely hard, us and our suppliers, to actually produce a bit more machines because our customers are craving for those machines. So I think it's good.
If we then look at the segments. Logic, no surprise either, driven by everything that we see around us. It's the drive for artificial intelligence, high-power compute drive the desire or the demand for leading-edge chips, but it's not only that. I mean, when we think about the current market situation, you actually see that what we call the distributed systems, which are being supported by 5G, are growing so fast. And you have to think about what's a distributed system. I mean it's a car. It's an industrial machine. It's a home appliance. It's the working-from-home PCs. Those are all distributed systems that actually don't all need 5 nanometer or 7 nanometer. But they need compute power to assist the sensor, a lot of sensing happening in all these distributed systems. And that's matured, so it's not only advanced logic, but now we also see mature logic. And this is the reason why we think Logic will increase with about 35% this year, as compared to our previous estimate last quarter of about 30%.
It's the same for Memory. Memory follows Logic. And for Memory, last quarter, we said we think this year it will grow with about 50%. Now we think it's 60%. It's about EUR 4.7 billion in sales this year, Memory, of which EUR 1 billion is going to be EUV. And that's important because EUV doesn't really add yet to the bit capacity this year, yes. So basically it's technology investments that our customers are doing for ramping next year and the year thereafter. And on installed base, we thought 10% growth last quarter. We now think 15% growth, also driven by the software and productivity upgrades that our customers are looking for. So all in all, 2021 is going to be a very good year, 35% growth.",376

Wennink,,Executives,5,"That's a good question. I think clearly we've seen in 2021 also the -- we could say, the reaction of the industry at large, the electronic industry, to the COVID year. So you saw, you can say, a catch-up effect. I think that will stretch into 2022, yes. Some of the supply chains have been disrupted and it takes a bit longer, but longer term, it's what I said earlier. I said it is really the driver, advanced semiconductors for artificial intelligence; high-power compute; and the demand for matured systems which are driven by what we call the intelligence edge, all these distributed systems that need a level of compute, yes, next to the sensors, yes. And that is a secular trend that will not go away very soon. Actually, we think it will continue throughout the rest of the decade.
And then there's a third trend which is more that, you could say, the trend for technological sovereignty; that the big geographical areas in the world, like the United States and Europe, feel that part of that big growth that's coming should also be local. So -- and it's not a surprise then if you look at those trends and look at our order book. And our order book is currently about EUR 17.5 billion in sales of -- as a very significant part is EUV, yes. That order book is very strong, yes. And that's where it's just a reflection of where we currently are, and it's a look into 2022. I mean we'd even think that -- for instance, our EUV capacity next year, which we think will be around 55 units. When we look at the order book, about 80% is already booked as at the end of Q2 2021. So yes, I think, all in all, significant growth expected in the next couple years.",310

Wennink,,Executives,7,"If you listened to my previous answers: I mean it's going to be growth. And I -- and we strongly believe that, that growth cannot be supported by the capacity that we currently have, so we need to extend capacity. Now how do you extend capacity? There are 3 ways to extend capacity. First is, of course, do things faster, cycle time reduction. That's generally something you can do within 6 [ and ] 12 months. Secondly, you can add to the same square meters. You can add more people and more machines, which basically has an output time of about 12 to 18 months. And when that's not enough, you need to build. You need to build square meters, which is 2 to 3 years. So I think this is what we are discussing together now with our supply chain.
So on deep UV, we will significantly increase our capacity, will be significantly double digit. How much in the end it will be still depends on the final confirmation we get out of the supply chain on those 3 things: cycle time reduction, adding more people and machines and building square meters. We -- I think, in the third quarter or the end -- towards the end of the third quarter, we'll have a pretty good view of what that means.
On EUV, we said the capacity for next year, 2022, is 55 units, but for '23, we are now looking in to bring that capacity over 60 units. When we look at the longer-term demand, we'll be over 60 units. And then you have to also realize, when you think about EUV, that customers buy machines, but in fact they buy wafer capacity. So if -- the new machines, like the 3600D that has a 15% to 20% higher productivity, yes. Also the newer generations add more capacity in terms of wafers out because the machines are so much more productive.",323

Wennink,,Executives,9,"Well, capital allocation. Looking at the forecast, our growth profile, the profitability profile of the company, we'll be generating a sufficient amount of cash. And we will distribute that according to our financial policy. First of all, we will use the cash to grow the business, yes, to support R&D growth; to support the fixed assets, building parts of the factory, building the -- building out factories, buying machines, which is also true for our supply chain. We will fund some of that in the supply chain like we've always done. And when we've done that, we'll give it back to the shareholders. I mean we'll pay an increasing dividend and we will do share buybacks. And on those share buybacks, as you know, we have a program which is EUR 6 billion, which by the way, we bought back EUR 5.2 billion of that EUR 6 billion. So there's a remainder of EUR 800 million. We will basically bring it into a new program. So the EUR 800 million will be brought into a new program of EUR 9 billion, which the term of that program will be focused on executing it by or potentially even before December 31, 2023.",201

So we talk about doubling the sales, which actually means that we need to [ add ] that capacity. We need to help our customers in their expansion plans. When they build fabs, we will ship the equipment. And it's all driven by basically what we're seeing today, which is the digital revolution, yes. It's the further rollout of 5G and 6G. It's the progress we're making on artificial intelligence, self-driving cars. It's the intelligence edge that will actually drive a significant part of that growth. So all in all, we're very positive about the future. And we'd love to tell you a little bit more when we have our Capital Markets Day September 29 of this year, and I'm looking forward to that.",183

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2021.  
Net sales came in within guidance at EUR 4.0 billion. The guided lower revenue was due to a number of systems in the quarter that did not receive factory acceptance testing due to customers' desire to bring systems into production as quickly as possible. Therefore, revenue will be recognized in subsequent quarters after completion of acceptance testing at customer sites.  
We shipped 10 EUV systems and recognized EUR 1.3 billion revenue from 9 systems this quarter. Two EUV systems shipped this quarter without factory acceptance testing, so revenue will be recognized in the subsequent quarter after customer site acceptance. For the system we shipped in Q1 without factory acceptance testing, we were able to complete site acceptance tests and recognized revenue in Q2. Again, the net result is 9 EUV revenue systems in Q2.  
Net system sales of EUR 2.9 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 72%, with the remaining 28% from Memory. The strength in Logic drives both DPV and EUV revenue. The Memory business is mainly driven by DRAM. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.1 billion above guidance due to increased upgrade business as customers continue to pull forward software upgrades that can quickly increase productivity of systems in this high semiconductor demand environment.  
Gross margin for the quarter was 50.9% and was above guidance, primarily due to the additional software upgrade business and one-off revenue accounting releases. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 634 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 172 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance. Net income in Q2 was EUR 1.0 billion, representing 25.8% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 2.52.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 5.4 billion. 
Moving to the order book. Q2 net system bookings came in at a record EUR 8.3 billion, including EUR 4.9 billion for EUV systems. The very strong order intake for both EUV and DPV is a reflection of the global demand environment across all markets. Order intake was largely driven by Logic with 71% of the bookings, and memory accounted for the remaining 29%. The majority of EUV orders continue to come from Logic customers, but we also had our largest EUV order intake for DRAM this quarter coming from multiple customers.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2021. We expect Q3 total net sales to be between EUR 5.2 billion and EUR 5.4 billion. We expect our Q3 installed base management sales to be around EUR 1.0 billion. Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 51% and 52%. Expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR 645 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around $180 million. R&D expenses for 2021 are expected to be around 14% of sales. We expect SG&A to remain around 4% of sales for 2021. Our estimated 2021 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be around 15%.  
In Q2, ASML paid a final dividend of EUR 1.55 per ordinary share or EUR 639 million. Together with the interim dividend paid in 2020, this results in a total dividend for 2020 of EUR 2.75 per ordinary share. This is a 15% increase compared to the 2019 dividend. In Q2 2021, ASML purchased 3.6 million shares on the 2022 program for a total amount of around EUR 2.0 billion.  
As part of ASML's financial policy to return excess cash to its shareholders through growing dividends and share buybacks, ASML announced a new share buyback program, which will start on July 22, 2021 and is to be executed by the 31st of December 2023. As part of this program, ASML intends to repurchase shares up to an amount of EUR 9 billion, of which we expect a total of up to 0.45 million shares will be used to cover employee share plans.  
ASML intends to cancel the remainder of the shares repurchased. The new program will replace the previous EUR 6 billion share buyback program 2020 through  2022, under which ASML has repurchased approximately 11.7 million shares for an approximate amount of EUR 5.2 billion and which will not be completed for the full amount in light of the new share buyback program.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",765

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a good quarter in both sales and profitability. We're seeing continued strong demand from our customers across all market segments, from both advanced and mature nodes, driving demand across our entire product portfolio.  
Compared to last quarter, where we expected an annual sales growth rate towards 30%, we now expect revenue to be at around 35% this year. The higher sales growth comes from our ability to increase output in our factories and in the supply chain as we work to meet the strong customer demand.  
Looking at the different market segments and changes from last quarter, we now expect stronger growth rates across all markets. In Logic, global demand continues to be strong across a broad application space in both advanced and mature nodes. And compared to last quarter, where we expected 2021 Logic revenue to be up 30% year-on-year, we now expect Logic to be up around 35% this year.  
In Memory, customers see tight supply/demand dynamics continuing into next year. And compared to last quarter, where we expected 2021 Memory revenue to be up 50% year-on-year, we now expect Memory revenue to be up around 60% this year.  
In our installed base business, for the second quarter in a row, our upgrade business has been stronger than guided. Customers are looking to upgrades to provide the fastest path to increase their wafer output capability. Compared to last quarter, where we expect the 2021 installed base revenue to be up 10% year-on-year, we now expect installed base revenue to be up around 15% this year.  
As we continue to strengthen our outlook on the year, the majority of the increase is coming from our DPV business. We have increased our planned factory output to meet customer growing demand and now expect higher growth in DPV in 2021. While keeping in mind the minimum stocking levels the increased output was partly due to the usage of service inventory at ASML and its suppliers.  
On EUV, we continue to push our manufacturing capability and have been able to realize a limited increase in output. We now expect EUV revenue growth of around 35% year-on-year, an increase from the 30% as we communicated last quarter. And we also shipped our first 3600D system in Q2, which will deliver a 15% to 20% higher productivity capability than our 3400C systems. The vast majority of the EUV systems in the second half will be 3600D systems contributing to increased weighted capacity in our customers' fabs. 
To summarize this year, taking into account the planned system output improvements in the second half, we now expect sales growth of about 35% and a gross margin between 51% and 52% for the full year. 
Looking beyond 2021, if you read the papers, you can see the 3 trends we highlighted in the last quarter continue to drive semiconductor and equipment demand. Chip shortages are partly due to decisions made during the global pandemic, first reported in the automotive industry, have since moved to other industries. This is causing a more cyclical or catch-up driven demand that we expect will likely continue into next year. 
But more importantly, secular growth from the digital transformation that's underway as the world becomes more connected, not only machine to people or people to machine, but also machine to machine.  The expanding application space with secular drivers such as 5G, AI, high-performance and distributed computing is fueling a rapidly growing demand for semiconductors. And this demand is not only for leading-edge devices required to power these high-performance application, but this also requires a wide array of applications using other technology to support the build-out of the digital infrastructure. 
Computing is also rapidly moving to the edge, where sensing technologies require connected compute technologies that are often mature in nature. Lastly, the push for technological sovereignty, as countries and regions are planning to establish or expand regional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in an attempt to manage geographical semiconductor manufacturing risks. This will likely create some level of inefficiency in the semiconductor supply chain and, thus, additional equipment demand. Although we believe that this potential inefficiency will be managed rationally by a few very large manufacturers, which are crucial in building this additional infrastructure. 
We expect these trends to continue for the next several years, which fuels long-term demand for both Logic and Memory and drives demand for our entire product portfolio. 
For EUV, future demand growth is primarily driven by Logic, with increasing EUV late accounts and stronger wafer demand on advanced nodes. We're also seeing growing demand for EUV and Memory as customers are ramping EUV and volume production with plans to implement EUV on future nodes across 3 DRAM customers. With the strong order intake this quarter, this brings our backlog -- our total backlog to EUR 17.5 billion, which includes EUV of EUR 10.9 billion, which is a reflection of the very healthy market environment we're in today. And it covers approximately 80% of the planned EUV output for 2022. 
For future DPV demand, it is driven by the growing wafer demand in both Memory and Logic. We see both advanced and mature nodes increasing over time. Immersion is required for the more advanced nodes in Memory and Logic, with dry technology required for both advanced and mature technology. We see the DPV demand certainly for dry products being stronger for longer. 
In order to meet our customers' increasing long-term demand, we're working hard with our supply chain to increase our capacity. We continue to drive down manufacturing cycle times, both in our factory and in our supply chain. And jointly with our suppliers, we are looking across the supply chain to determine whether we need to add people, equipment or buildings to increase our output capability for EUV as well as DPV. Each of these activities have different time horizons to materialize. 
For DPV, in response to the market demand, we will need to increase our capacity in 2022 and beyond, and have therefore started to execute plans to significantly increase our capacity primarily with dry systems. This is needed since we will not be able next year to again use the surplus inventories of DPV modules and parts to fuel our sales as we will do in 2021. 
It's a bit too early to provide specific details on our capacity plans for the coming years as we have not yet confirmed the targeted capacity increases with our key suppliers. But we will provide an update as soon as we have finalized these plans. 
For EUV, we're planning our supply chain for a capacity of around 55 systems in 2022 and are looking to further increase the capacity to over 60 EUV systems in 2023. In addition to increasing our system capacity, we're also driving our product road map to deliver higher productivity systems to increase effective wafer capacity. All of our planned shipments in 2022 will be the higher productivity 3600D systems. 
In summary, the chip demand is very strong, and we're working to maximize output to meet customer demand. The secular growth trends as part of the digital transformation to a more connected world is fueling future demand across all market segments at both the advanced and the mature nodes, which only increases our confidence in our long-term growth outlook. We plan to provide you an update on our future scenarios at our Investor Day on September 29, so please book the date. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",1254

Would be interesting to have the color of the two.
And the second question I had, maybe, Peter, when we look at the market dynamic, I mean there is obviously a strong demand and, as a consequence, a significant shortage. And on top of that, you have some local capacity concern that you talked about in your video. So what I'm trying to understand is with these 2 factors that probably one concern is kind of inflation of orders, creating some disconnect between the supply and the demand i.e., the shortage and local domestic capacity, so how do you assess this risk? How do you manage this risk of overcapacity when you think about adding capacity in DPV and EUV?",167
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3798.0,2348747.0,89762372.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,8,"Very good questions. Let me first answer the upside on the dry DPV. Whether it's driven by leading edge or, let's say, trailing or mature, I think on the leading edge, we have a reasonably good view as to what our customers need in terms of new fabs built, ramp-up plans. And of course, we know the layer stacks. We know the layer composition in terms of dry immersion EUV. 
So yes, that's growing, but that's more plannable, I would say. That's -- we have more insights. And it was really surprised us is the very strong demand from, let's say, the non-leading-edge customers, which is across the globe. It's in Europe, it's in the U.S., it's in Asia. And it has to do with microcontrollers, power, analog, image sensors. It's all over the place. 
And I think it's also explainable and it's a bit of a lead-in into your next question that if you see where this is going and where the shortages are in automotive and other industrial areas. Even from time to time, we get questions out of our own supply chain, whether we can help sourcing some of these components, which basically, normally, we can because we have some good contacts with some semiconductor manufacturers. So we actually see this happening everywhere. 
You see lead times in household appliances going up, simply because analog, power, sensors, microcontrollers in household appliances are in shortage. So it's basically, it's the rollout of the -- finally what we are seeing as the Internet of Things and 5G, we have the big pipe. So you can actually use the big pipe to actually transfer that data and transport the data. And that's what we're seeing now. 
So it's -- basically, the big surprise was really in what we would call the mature or the specialty semiconductors, yes, which is just a reflection of the digital transition that we're right in the middle. 
So leading into an answer to your second question, so how do we then assess the risk of this capacity increase that we're planning for? It's basically how do we assess the risk that this rollout of this digitization, the digital infrastructure, is a hoax? It's not happening. It's not there, or it's happening at a speed that we completely misjudged. 
I think given where the shortages are and the time it will take to get rid of those shortages, I think the underlying growth trend, there is a high level of reality in there, in our mind. So we will build that capacity. And I have to add, I think structurally, over the last 15 years, I think we've underestimated the growth of the industry. And I can only -- this may -- might be anecdotal but in 2007, we started to give you, for the first time, a scenario target based on a certain market assumption 5 years out. We got there 1 year early. 
The second time we did that, we got that 2 years early. And the third time we did it, that was the one that we're in today. And we are guiding about EUR 18.9 billion, close to EUR 19 billion, which is, effectively was our mid-market scenario that we gave you for 2025. We again are years early. So we structurally underestimated the growth in this industry. I'm not concerned in building that capacity. We will use it.",567

I was curious on the DUV side, your orders remain really strong. So just curious with the capacity increases you're putting in place, is that catch up with your order book, is that more of a first half 2022 dynamic? Or do you see that as continuing into the second half of 2022?",65

That's a good question. It depends on the speed with which we can get the -- well, it depends on the confirmation we can get from our supply chain, because we did ask them and especially for the mature products and dry products to get a significant increase, which is double-digit increase in our capacity or their capacity, I should say. And that could then easily extend into the second half of next year. 
Like I said earlier, I think this disruption of the supply chain that happened during the global pandemic, I think it's like a traffic jam. You have a traffic jam in 15 minutes, takes an hour to get it resolved. It's basically what's happening also in the industry. It's a global supply chain with many, many key players there. 
When you start to put locks into this global efficient supply chain effectively and you take out those locks, not at all at the same time, and inventories are depleted before everything starts going again, it takes time. And that's what we see. We actually see that in the supply chain and customers of our customers and customers of the customers' customers, they're basically now reassessing their planning. And they're finding out there are shortages all over the place, whereby the key players in that ecosystem are not fully aligned yet on making this seamless again. And that will take time. 
So this will lead into 2022 easily. And I think the first half, if our supply chain, and not only our supply chain, also the supply chain of our peers can follow then, yes, maybe mid next year, we'll see some relief and then you see a tapering off of the order intake. But otherwise, I think we will continue into the second half of next year.",302

That's helpful. And then on the increased EUV revenue outlook for this year, from a revenue perspective, it sounds like you're doing some things to maybe improve the manufacturing or your capabilities and maybe get another tool out the door. But just curious, in addition to that, is that reflective of maybe any sort of expectations around mix, being a little bit stronger to the 3600D or configurations being a little bit richer than expected when we entered this year?",82

I think you got it, Joe. It's a combination of those things. I think what you saw over the quarters -- during the quarter is that indeed, the ASP turned out to be stronger than what you saw last year. And I think that was the result, as you say, of the option that customers asked for. So there were richer configurations than originally envisaged. So there you saw on the 3400C, you saw an ASP of 145. You see this quarter even a bit higher, but there's some 3600D in there albeit very, very small. So that's one element.
And the second element indeed is that we're doing our utmost to further decrease cycle time as a result of that crank out 1 or 2 or more. So that's the 2 reason behind the increase to 35% uptick in comparison to last year, rather than the 30%.",149

I mean, are you  -- I mean you have laid out how much capacity you intend to outlay in EUV. Do you intend to outlay this EUV capacity additions over the next few years at the Capital Markets Day or at this point? 
And my second question is on the margin. Clearly, I mean, the more DUV you ship, it helps your overall gross margin as such, really, and that has helped this year as well.
I mean do you see that trend, that shift because of this higher DUV and the sensors and all these other older tools are likely to change your midterm view on the gross margin because of the higher DUV shipments?",138

Wennink,,Executives,16,"Well, I think the second question, Roger will answer. On the DPV capacity, yes, I think it is our intention. If we have -- if we feel we're comfortable that giving you that number because we get all the confirmations in from the supply chain, I think we would definitely give you more insight into our DPV capacity on specifically dry, perhaps somewhat on immersion and on, I think, more specific on EUV. We will definitely do that by the end of this quarter. 
But we need some -- so for our key suppliers, we want to have that firm commitment. And we're going to not only get a firm commitment from an e-mail from the CEO, but I think we want to get that confirmed by the people who are actually building that capacity in the customer. So it's going to be quite an in-depth audit that you could say, because we will, based on that capacity, if the demand is there, we'll accept orders, and we don't want to disappoint our customers. 
So it's a process that's been ongoing for the last couple of months. But I think it's definitely our intention to give you all the information that we have at that time. And I hope and I expect to be honest that we will be able to do that to give you that number.",228

Sandeep, on the margin side, as you know, and particularly with the introduction of the D model, you do see that the deltas between the different products in terms of gross margin becomes smaller. And therefore, the effect that you were talking about becomes smaller. 
You also know that within DPV, there are differences between the different products in terms of gross margin. As we said on calls before, what is particularly relevant to look at is immersion, because the immersion is still from a gross margin perspective, a good product for us. And that's the one to watch. And if you, for instance, look at the last quarter, last quarter, you saw that 47% of our system sales was immersion. This year, you -- or this quarter, you see that, that's gone down to 34%, which is more realistic based, I would say, also for the quarters to come. 
And of course, that had an impact why the gross margin in Q1 was still very, very strong and why the gross margin in Q2 expectedly was a little bit lower. But I think that's a reset that is important. Immersion percentage for the quarters to come, more or less, mirrors what we had in Q2. And as a result of that, you build up towards the 51% to 52% that we've indicated for, for Q3.",227

Wennink,,Executives,18,"And on the dry margins, because we were all going to ship more dry. Dry margins have generally been somewhat lower than the immersion margins because there's also more competition there, and there's a cost drive in the mature market, which is also different in the advanced market. 
So yes, that's -- these are lower-priced tools as you use as a KrF tool. That's a single digit to a very low double-digit number, but it depends on the configuration with a different margin profile, which is lower than our immersion margins.",91

Is that the technological and time buffer that you think domestic China gets access to these EUV tools? 
And then the second question is specifically just on immersion. Are you seeing momentum, or anticipating momentum to get market share gains further in immersion tools, specifically maybe to your Logic customer base?",110

I think on immersion market share gains, I think our market share still is already pretty high. Let's leave it at that. And EUV, I think, yes, EUV, too, is high. I mean that's a subject that we've discussed many, many times during these calls. I mean, EUV is under export control according to the Boston agreement, there's a multilateral agreement between 42 countries. And that requires an exports control license from the government of the exporting country, which, in this case, is the Netherlands. I think that's still under review. 
So -- and I think -- and this is not the place and the time to speculate on what that would mean going forward if we introduce High-NA. I think there's -- what we, of course, do know there are in-depth discussions between governments of different countries to see what they want to do. And I think it's not our role. I think we're in contact, but of course, it's up to the governments. And we just wait and see what happens. 
Now I've said it before, the end demand of leading-edge semiconductor devices is probably not impacted from -- it will not be impacted by where we ship EUV tools. The end market will be determined by the value that's been created by those products and the ability and the willingness of the world to buy these products, which will drive the demand for high-end semiconductors, and that will drive the demand for EUV. And then we will ship EUV where EUV will -- where EUV machines will be made to make advanced semiconductors, whether it is in Korea or in the U.S. or in Europe or whatever, yes, we're going to ship those tools too.",289

Are your comments really pertaining pretty much to 2022? Or can you put anything in place in that? I'd just like to understand if we're basically maxed out on what you can do in 2021. 
And the second follow-up would be just on the phasing of 72 option revenue. It seems that you imply with your guidance that Q4 will be down year-on-year quarter-on-quarter. I just want to understand if that's due to the pull-in, in that area that you saw in the first and second quarter?",104

The increase of capacity when, I think, there are 3 ways in which you can increase capacity. And the first is basically it's 6 to 9 months. It's just being more efficient, squeezing everything out of your production process is basically what we call the reduction of cycle time. That's what you can do short term. That's what we do today. 
And I think the second one is you just use the same square meters, but you hire people, you buy machines, which is especially true for our supply chain, which generally has a lead time of 12 to 18 months if you can get the machines, which, by the way, I made a comment earlier, we also see that in the machine industry also, there's going to be shortage because of also chip shortages. But that's 12 to 18 months. That brings us into 2022. And it could even be towards the second half of 2022. 
And that's what we're seeing now in the supply chain. I think everybody works on their cycle time reduction, so we are maxed out. And then if you want to add capacity, people and machines. 
And then the third one is, well, you cannot fit it in this square inches or square meters or square footage, then you need to build, which has a retail of 2 to 3 years, which will bring you to 2023, '24. And I think -- so the capacity increase that we're focusing on is within the same square meters, machines, people, cycle time reduction. And that, I think, we're maxed out for this year because it's only going to be cycle time reduction. It has to be more people, more machines, same square meters next year, and that's 2022.",293

Dassen,,Executives,25,"Aleksander, on your second question and your line broke up a little bit, but I understood your question to be the distribution of the installed base revenue over the first half and the second half of the year. And that is a correct observation. So in the first half, we had EUR 2.3 billion revenue for installed base. And with the indication of 50% growth over last year, you would get to EUR 1.9 billion for the second half of the year. 
And you're quite right. As we also indicated, there has been quite some pull in of the -- particularly the software-related upgrades by customers who want a relatively easy way to increase capacity without having to give us too much machine time. So both in Q1 and Q2, we actually got more of these software related upgrades than we anticipated. And yes, there was a bit of pull in there from the second half. So that's the correct observation.",161

So in terms of EUV service gross margin, as you know, we broke even last year on that. This quarter, we guided to 25% gross margin on EUV service. And I think we've said that within about 4 years' time, we believe that we get that gross margin level to approximately corporate gross margin level. That's what the intent is, and that is primarily by driving down costs and by helping customers run the machines more efficiently such that more wafers get produced. And as a result of that, we get more wafers compensated therefore. So that's the model there. 
And 25% from 0 in a couple of quarter's time, of course, is a big uptick. But I think that is the aggressive curve. So the first 25% is, of course, a big development. But then you will see that improvement gradually slow down. 
In terms of systems gross margin. On the D, the D tool gets us to the corporate gross margin. That's the way to look at it. So still below the DPV gross margin, but at the corporate gross margin. With the E tool, we hope to get the gross margin to the DPV level. And at that stage, we have  EUV and DPV be at the same level. That's the intent. That's what we're looking at. And of course, the E will be introduced in a little under 2 years from -- or 2 years from now. And that's the one that should get us to a DPV type of gross margin levels.",258

I think the -- we won't be -- I think the exact number this year is probably 1.2 billion, so it's a bit higher. So of the -- and you are right. I mean, of the 1.2 billion of EUV in our 2021 Memory guidance or DRAM guidance, I mean you'll need to really look at a bit capacity additions from those machines not in 2021. It's going to be later. 
I think on 2022, 2023, when we look at the road maps, the customer road maps, yes, we will see as a higher number of deep -- of EUV shipments for DRAM, and it's driven basically by the capacity build-outs that they are planning. And yes, when cycle times go down, then also order lead times go down, but so it will have more -- as a more significant effect on when they place the orders, not so much when they need the tools because the tools are based on the fab planning. And as you know, these fab plans are sometimes years out. So we have 2, 3 years of planning visibility. 
So that will drive the, let's say, the build capacity, our build capacity and the potential sales and it will have an impact on the orders, on the deals, which will be probably coming in a bit later as you actually seen last quarter, I mean, there's a significant number of EUV tools that came in as PO, because there we have long lead times. And actually that stretches our order coverage in terms of our capacity that we have for next year to the point where 80% of our capacity is now ordered. 
I mean that will have -- that will change going forward with lead times going down but not so much the sales. Sales will be driven by the RAM plans and the capacity plans of our customers. And those are pretty well known because of the big projection that take years.",330

And that's very clear from the customers that indicate that the plan to increase the layer count of the OBV and DRAM manufacturing. 
And just to give you one more data point. So this year, you're looking at approximately 20% of the EUV revenue. So 20% of, let's say, the -- of the EUR 6 billion, EUR 1.2 billion, that's the number, I think it's fair to assume that the same percentage will apply to next year. So that gives you -- and as you know, we're at least expanding capacity for EUV for next year. So that gives you an indication that we do see continued growth in the EUV insertion into DRAM and with the commensurate growth in revenue from that.",135

In particular, for this year, just to try and establish a baseline, can you give us a sense as to how much of the -- of this year's revenue is being driven by both the butter stocks sort of the drawdown of that inventory that you've got? If I'm doing my math right, based on your guidance, we're now talking about a low EUR 8 billion level of DUV revenue this year. So yes, how much of that is coming from the inventory?",97

I think let me put it -- let met answer that in a different way. I think  this is -- you really have to go deep into the supply chain, because it's in our service inventory. It's in the supply chain inventory. So I would have to really go deeper to give you an exact percentage. 
But if we look at the 2022 DUV plants and especially for immersion, not so much for KrF because that's where we can see some improvement in terms of shipment numbers. But I think in terms of immersion 2022, I would currently think that our immersion sales number will be about the same as this year. Whereby this year, we, of course, were helped by this, you could say, onetime depletion of the stocks, is creating them from everywhere that we could. 
So I wouldn't at this moment in time -- because don't forget, I mean, the immersion numbers this year are quite high. I think from an immersion point of view, you have to go back a long time to look at similar shipment numbers. I think it will probably be the same next year. But next year, we will not have the advantage of being able to deplete the stock. So this is the way that I would look at it. 
And on KrF, some dry season there, you could see higher numbers next year because that's where we actually need the capacity. And that was also the answer to one of the earlier questions, where do we see it. I think we basically see this dry demand coming out of, I would say, the specialty markets or the mature markets, which is basically everywhere. So hopefully, that answers your question, Andrew.",291

I mean if I could just follow up with that quickly. I mean you're talking about a ""significant"" double-digit increase in capacity to DUV. Clearly, not all of that is going to come online in '22. That presumably is just the starting point. But if we look out over the next couple of years, I mean, significant, perhaps to state the obvious is not 10%. And I know you want to save something for September. But I mean it feels like you're talking 20% plus or minus you have that kind of a ballpark? Would that be reasonable?",101
388904.0,"ASML Holding N.V., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3798.0,2348747.0,89762407.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,43,"Yes. I mean you know us for a long time, so you can assess what significant means in our terms, and that's not 10%, as you pointed out. But what it is, we'll probably be more specific in September, the end of September. But yes, you also -- when capacity comes online, there's also a lead time between when the capacity comes online, when we get the models, the part, we can make the tools and we can ship it to the customers. 
So part of that capacity that will come online, that significant capacity increase, which will be indeed double digit, that will have an effect in 2023, not in 2022. When it's available January 1, 2022, then you are right. But that's -- I pointed out, I mean, people and machines and potentially using extra square meters, it takes 12 to 18 months before it's there. And then they need to produce, and then we need to produce and then it needs to be installed. 
So I think we will see that capacity increase definitely occurring next year. And how much of that we can use for output, that still remains to be seen. And we're figuring that out together with our suppliers.",205

I think you might be surprised, but yes, I think it doesn't matter that much. Because we assume -- and I think that's a right assumption. If you look at the expansion plans, which are more, well, let's say more concrete in the U.S. But as you know, that, that discussion is also happening in Europe. These expansions will not be made by just a new company coming online. It will be the, I would say, established players, the leaders that have the capability and the competence to build those fabs and to manage them and have to process knowledge to copy exact, if I may use that word, those processes from all the parts of the world into the U.S. and into Europe. 
And those companies, they are going to build those fabs to make sure that they can supply the market with the needs for those products. And it's going to be just a few companies which are going to be rational. I don't think that any administration can go to the CEOs of one of those companies and say because we want that capacity, you have build it. And it's going to be idle. It's going to be completely inefficient. And we're going to do that. So it's going to be rational. And all the information that we have points to those few companies that have the capability to build those fabs. So I think for my little point of view, yes there will be some inefficiency. Because you are building  a new fab, a new operations in a place where you cannot piggyback on your local ecosystem if you do it in this different part of the world. So yes, there will be -- so there's a ramp-up time for those fabs would be somewhat inefficient. But it's not going to be double-digit percentages. I don't believe that at all. The rationale behavior of our key customers is -- will simply prevent that. 
Now how long will it take? I don't think we will see anything coming out of those fabs before 2024-2025. So I'd say it's a couple of years out. I mean, building those fab will take 2 to 3 years. And then they need to ramp. As you know, these will be big fabs. And they don't ramp all at once. They ramp in phases. So it's going to be 2024 onwards, '25, '26, and so it's not going to be short term. But again, yes, I think the drive for this technological sovereignty is really based on the assumption that also this industry will -- or the industry of our customers, the semiconductor industry, might very well double in terms of sales over the next 10 years, which means that just from a geographical risk point of view and from a manufacturing risk point of view, the desire to just spread the manufacturing capability across the globe, driven by a few manufacturers, a few large manufacturers that have the competence to do that, that seems very logical.  And I think -- so I think it will happen. 
It will not create massive inefficiency, some inefficiency, which of course will help us a bit. But it will be driven by, I think, rationality and it will be driven by government subsidies. That's true. So that's -- when you're a taxpayer in those jurisdiction, it's your world.",564

My question to you, Peter, is very simple. Over the years, the semiconductor industry has never managed to effectively exert pricing power with that customer base for all the reasons that we can imagine. 
But now that -- I'm not saying you should abuse that pricing power, but now that you're in a slightly different position, you're talking about the doubling of market demand over the next 10 years, et cetera, and given the investments that you have to make and particularly shareholders are also worried that, hey, is this the right time to add that much capacity, would it be feasible for ASML to ask your customers to effectively pay in advance for those DUV tools so that you completely derisk your model and completely eliminate the risk for double ordering or triple ordering?",148

Wennink,,Executives,48,"Well, it's always a good question to ask as an entrepreneur to derisk completely their business model. But to be very honest, I mean, that never happens. And I don't think it's the way also we need to deal with our customers, which is only a handful, and there's a handful of equipment players. 
And on deep UV, yes, I think we will charge our customers the value of those machines. And to give you an example, we will put deep UV KrF on NXT platform, which will significantly increase the productivity for our customers, which also, I think we are entitled to part of that value and which I think they will pay us. 
So I think the way that we look at increasing prices is really to provide our customers more value, not to say, well, we're in a squeeze situation, which could be last for -- it's a couple of years, but then we're back to normal again. And then customers will push back in this traditional customer supply relationship. That's not the way this industry works. And I don't think this industry should work this way. We have to provide value, and we have many opportunities to create value for our customers and thereby asking a higher price, but the customer will get the value. That's how we work. 
I think on the risk of the capacity increases, I said it before: I think where we've structurally underestimated the growth of this industry and with everything that we're seeing today, I think there are good reasons to believe that the underlying demand of what we see, and especially in dry deep UV and the application space that deep UV is servicing, there is a very good reason to add extra capacity because we need that capacity. 
And we will sell those too. We will make more money, and I think we'll satisfy our shareholders, and I think the risk is limited. And short term, we always have small cycles. But longer term, I don't see the risk.",341

It also might have been a bit convoluted answer, but what I was trying to do because basically giving you 2, I would say, messages. We have in 2021, which is this year, we have, you could say, a spurt sales because of the fact that we're depleting everything we can find in terms of inventory. And some would argue that some of our minimum stocking levels for service might be at a real minimum, because we're using everything to make our machines. So that is this onetime step-up, which gives you an immersion number that is high. I think that will be probably the number that we're also looking for, for next year where we don't have that ability to have this onetime step-up. So we're effectively increasing capacity and getting to that same level. 
But that's basically how I think we should look at next year because that is what, I think, from a capacity point of view, with what we are seeing, we can do in terms of cycle time reduction in terms of putting some extra people to work we can do, so effectively, in the increasing capacity but ending up at about the same number.",201

If I recall correctly, we had 50% there, but we did have 2 arrows in front of it, leaving it entirely to your imagination how far you wanted to stretch that. 
So I think '22, based on the number of the dynamics that I mentioned, certainly from a gross margin perspective, has promise in there for sure. But it's way too early to give any definitive guidance on that. But you would have seen -- if you look at the trajectory over the year, you would see that we're now guiding 50%, the 50% -- 152 percentage for next quarter. That's a good basis. That has already quite a bit of D in there. Of course, next year, everything would be D. Next year, you would benefit from the 2050 a bit more than you would this year. So there's a bit of potential there, but it's still a bit too early to give any guidance on what it's going to look like next year.",180

Dassen,,Executives,3,"So for the fourth quarter our guidance for revenue is €4.9 to €5.2 billion with a gross margin of 51% to 52%. Included in the sales number €1.1 billion of Installed Base revenue. That number was impacted by a number of issues that we experienced. And they are issues that are related to the continued growth of ASML and the fact that we're really continuing to build capacity for us. 
On the one hand, we did see in the supply chain that there was some materials shortage. It’s not unique to ASML obviously. We read it in the newspapers in many industries every single day. But obviously particularly when we're pushing the supply chain to gear up capacity, you know this phenomenon could obviously pop up.
Second issue is the fact that we're also building capacity in Veldhoven. One important element in there is our new logistics center. And we took that into commission a couple of months ago. We did have some start-up issues there. I think it's fair to say that those two issues have been largely addressed for the output for this year. But they did have the impact that some assembly of machines actually started with a few weeks’ delay. So that means the starts are delayed and, of course, that the shipment is deferred a bit.
In addition to that, in the current environment where customers are really pushing for tools as quickly as they can get them, some customers really push for early shipments. We've seen that phenomenon before, you might remember that, and that means that customers actually get the tool without the tool first being tested for factory acceptance test. And that means that we can only recognize the revenue upon the installation of the tool at the customer.
So those two phenomenons combined, so the late starts and then the early shipments that customers asked for, meant that we're actually going to see some revenue deferred into 2022. That said, I think, all in all, we're still looking at growth for ASML for the year approaching 35%. And we're looking at a gross margin for the total year of about 52%.",360

Do you expect that to continue next year? And what's your initial view for 2022?,24

Dassen,,Executives,5,"Yes, we're not going to give quantitative guidance on 2022 yet, it's a bit too early to do that. But I think it is fair to say that many of the drivers that we've talked about in the past are very clearly still there, right? So at a macro level, I would say the chips shortage phenomenon is still there. And of course, that requires continued addition of capacity. So that's one driver. 
And then, of course, there is the secular trend of growth, which is really driven by the digital transformation. If you then peel the onion a little bit and look at the different categories, the different components of revenue for ASML. Starting with the Logic business. This whole notion of the digital transformation, of course, has a big impact on the most advanced nodes as we've seen in the past year, but also expect that to continue in the years to come.
But then also, I think that this whole notion of distributed computing means that it's not just on the advanced node, but it's also on the mature nodes, where there is an increased demand for capacity. And that combination really means that on both fronts, the demand both for mature and for advanced continues to be very, very strong for us.
On the Memory side, just looking at the end markets, again, very, very strong demand there, particularly, I would say, on the smartphones and the server end markets, I think the demand is very strong. Maybe a few question marks on PCs. But all in all, strong demand there. And that translates into hybrid growth.
I would say, for DRAM, most of our customers seem to be looking at mid- to high teens in terms of bit growth. While on NAND, typically, they're looking at about 30% of bit growth. So strong bit growth there driven by the dynamics in the end markets. And then if you look at the very, very high utilization of the little tools, of course, inevitably, that means that additional capacity will have to be built. So that's Logic and Memory.
Then if we look at the installed base business, of course, the installed base business with the increased number numbers that we have in the installed base, of course, the service business continues to grow, particularly driven by the EUV business. We've talked about those dynamics before. So clearly, a growth dynamic there on the installed base side as it relates to service business.
I would say on the upgrade business. Also for next year, we are offering significant upgrade packages to customers that would help them further increase the output of the installed base. Clearly, they need to give us time, right? So some of these upgrades, as you know, require some downtime of the system.
So that will be the determining factor, I think, for how fast the installed base business next year is going to grow how much machine time do we actually get from customers to do this. But all in all, I think also there, the dynamics are positive. So if you add it all up, I think we should be looking at another healthy growth year for ASML next year.",538

Can you give us an update on your capacity plans for next year?",26

So first off, reminding what did we say on capacity, that was really towards 2025. So that's the number that we gave at the Investor Day. And there, we said that we're looking at about 1.5x capacity for DPV (sic) [ DUV ] and more than 2 actually for EUV. And that's based on units.
If you were to translate that into wafer capacity, just recognizing the fact that the tools that we're shipping in the years to come and also the tools that we're shipping in 2025, of course, of higher productivity, higher throughput than the tools that we would ship, let's say, last year.
So taking that into consideration, then for DPV, we're actually looking at doubling the capacity of wafer output. For EUV, I would even say it's more than 3x that we're looking at in terms of capacity. So very strong there. If you translate that 2025 expectation into next year, I would say on EUV, I think we've been pretty clear, right? So on EUV, we're looking at a capacity of 55 units. And again, bear in mind, that's 55 units of the 3600D, which, as you know, has a 15% higher productivity approximately in comparison to its predecessor.
On the DPV side, it's -- there's a number of elements that need to be taken into consideration when we look at '22. On the one hand, we do get some tailwind from the phenomenon that I described earlier on when I gave the guidance for Q4, which is that we see a few systems slipping into 2022 as a result of the late start and the fact that the customers were pushing for early shipments. So that's one dynamic.
On the flip side, we've also said that in 2021, we really used all the buffers in terms of parts and materials that we had. And of course, they need to be replenished. So the replenishment of the buffers of the safety stock, if you like, that needs to happen in 2020 and 2022.
But yes, we are very much working with the supply chain and determining what the overall growth and the overall mix of the growth will be for next year. And then that combination, the combination of those 3 phenomenons will ultimately determine what the capacity for next year on DPV is going to be.",393

Dassen,,Executives,9,"Definitely. So free cash flow, very strong once again. So I think that's really -- we've really seen a significant improvement there in comparison to, let's say, a year ago because of all the phenomenons that we went through in the past couple of quarters. So very strong free cash flow.
The way we use that free cash flow, as you know, first off, we use whatever we need in the business, right? So whatever we need to further grow the business in terms of R&D, in terms of CapEx, et cetera, of course, that will be used. What we don't need to advance the business and to make the business grow, that will be paid back to shareholders in a combination of growing dividends and share buyback.
On the dividend side, we will pay in November an interim dividend for 2021 of EUR 1.80 per ordinary share. And in terms of share buyback, I think it's important to note that last quarter, we executed share buybacks under the -- still under the old program and the new program combined for about EUR 2.4 billion.",185

I think important what we did in the Investor Day is to really give a holistic perspective over what we can expect from a technology perspective, from a market perspective, et cetera. And I think it's fair to say that we believe we have a very strong road map there. That really allows us to continue to grow. We presented a potential -- growth potential towards EUR 24 billion to EUR 30 billion by 2025. That was the -- those were the scenarios that we presented there, with a gross margin for that for the year, somewhere between 54% and 56%.
But also beyond 2025, we continue to see strong growth potential for ASML. And we present it based on external sources and some of our own analysis, we presented a CAGR, both for the system sales and for the installed based sales. We presented a CAGR for the 2020 through 2030, a period of around 11%. So I would say, on the financial side, very good growth potential for ASML.
We also talked extensively about ESG. And we talked about the role that ASML can play in significantly bringing down the emissions by -- and carbon emissions by 2030 by 15% for the entire industry. And in terms of the ESG ambitions that we held out there, I think there is a number that we presented there.
First, we very much talked about what we can do to contribute and to support our customers in driving down energy consumption and waste in their manufacturing of microchips. We also talked about our role in allowing our customers to produce microchips that every 2 years become 3x more energy efficient. We also talked about our ambition to -- by 2030 get to 0 waste. And also by 2040 to get to net 0 value chain emissions by 2040. So those are the ambitions that we have on the ESG front.
So if you look at all of that, I would say it's fair to say that we're looking at a very strong road map, a road map that allows us to grow significantly throughout this decade and also a road map that -- and the contribution that on the ESG front, I think, is really going to contribute to the goals of all of our stakeholders.",386

Dassen,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the third quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the fourth quarter of 2021. We had a record quarter on a number of fronts, including total revenue, EUV system revenue and net income. Net sales came in within guidance at EUR 5.2 billion. We shipped 13 EUV systems and recognized EUR 2.2 billion revenue from 15 systems this quarter.  
Net system sales of EUR 4.1 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 61%, with the remaining 39% from Memory. The continued strength in Logic drives both DPV and EUV revenue. The memory business is mainly driven by DRAM. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.1 billion, above guidance due to increased upgrades and service business.  
Gross margin for the quarter was 51.7% and was within guidance. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 609 million, which was below our guidance due to several one-off effects in the quarter. SG&A expenses of EUR 183 million was basically at guidance. Net income in Q3 was EUR 1.7 billion, representing 33.2% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 4.27.  
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.5 billion. Moving to the order book. Q3 net system bookings came in at EUR 6.2 billion, including EUR 2.9 billion for EUV systems. Order intake was largely driven by Logic with 84% of the bookings, both from DPV and EUV, with Memory accounting for the remaining 16%.  
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect Q4 total net sales to be between EUR 4.9 billion and EUR 5.2 billion. There are some items to note that are expected to delay revenue from Q4 2021 into Q1 2022. In the process of increasing capacity, we experienced some issues regarding material shortage in our supply chain. In addition, we experienced issues in the start-up of our new logistics center.  
These 2 issues have largely been addressed for this year's output, but resulted in a late start on the assembly of a number of systems. In this high demand environment, our customers are requesting fast shipments or no factory acceptance test in order to bring systems into production as quickly as possible. While the impact on the third quarter was relatively small, the late starts combined with the fast shipments are expected to have an impact on the revenue to be recognized in the fourth quarter, which is included in our guidance.  
We're still on track to achieve revenue growth approaching 35% for the full year. We expect our Q4 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 1.1 billion. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be between 51% and 52%, with an expected gross margin of around 52% for the full year. The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around EUR 670 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 195 million. Our estimated 2021 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be around 15%.  
The interim dividend for 2021 will be EUR 1.80 per ordinary share. The ex-dividend date as well as the fixing date for the euro-U.S. dollar conversion will be November 2, 2021, and the record date will be November 3, 2021. The dividend will be made payable on November 12, 2021. In Q3, 2021 ASML purchased 3.6 million shares for a total amount of around EUR 2.4 billion under the current and previous program.  
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",614

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had a record quarter on both sales and profitability. We're seeing continued strong demand from our customers across all market segments from both advanced and mature nodes, driving demand across our entire product portfolio. We had a total backlog of EUR 19.6 billion, including EUV of EUR 11.6 billion, which is a reflection of the very healthy market environment we're in today and fully covers the planned EUV output for 2022 and the beginning of 2023.  
While it is a bit too early to provide specific guidance for 2022, we expect the end market trends we have highlighted throughout 2021 to continue into next year. These end market trends are driving strong demand across all market segments and across our entire technology portfolio. Therefore, we continue to increase our capacity for all of our products to meet customer capacity and technology requirements.  
In Logic, strong end-market demand continues as part of the ongoing digital transformation. The [ browsing ] application space with distributed computing across the IoT landscape, not only drives the demand for leading-edge nodes but also creates significant demand for mature nodes as an integral part of the growing digital infrastructure. We expect continued growth in our Logic business as customer demand remains strong for both advanced and mature nodes.  
In Memory, we also expect to see continued growth of our business next year. Strong end market demand for servers and smartphones is the primary driver for Memory demand next year with some uncertainty on the demand picture for PCs. Little tool utilization levels remain very high and customers see demand bit growth in 2022 in the mid- to high-teens percentage for DRAM and around 30% for NAND. To meet demand for this expected bit growth, customers will need to add capacity as well as continue to make node migrations. As customers migrate to more advanced nodes, we also expect to see an increase in EUV demand for memory.  
For our installed base business, we see an opportunity for service growth next year as we continue to expand our installed base of our entire product portfolio as well as the increased contribution of EUV service as this technology ramps in volume production. Driven by the expected continued shortage of semiconductor components, we also see an opportunity to grow our upgrade revenue further. This will depend, however, on our customers' willingness to take systems down to perform these upgrades amidst the strong demand cycle.  
To meet the strong demand across our entire product portfolio, we, first of all, are driving down our manufacturing cycle times and working with our supply chain to increase our output capability for EUV as well as DPV. As communicated during our Investor Day, we expect to increase unit output for DPV by approximately 1.5x and EUV over 2x by 2025, primarily through manufacturing capacity additions in our supply chain. At the same time, we are shipping higher productivity machines, which when taken into account with our higher unit output capacity plan, we expect an increase in effective wafer capacity for DPV of approximately 2x and for EUV over 3x by 2025.  
The actions in our supply chain to increase output at different time horizons are to materialize, but we expect to see an impact of these actions starting this year and extending into next year. For EUV, we're still planning for a capacity of around 55 systems next year. These will all be 3200D systems, which deliver a 15% to 20% higher productivity over the [ 3300C ] systems.  
For DPV, as mentioned last quarter, we are utilizing our safety stock this year to significantly increase DPV output. So we'll not have this buffer inventory going into next year, and will, therefore, need to rely on building additional capacity, as just mentioned. We are actively working with our supply chain partners to increase our capacity next year, and the final output and mix will depend on our supply chain progress although we currently believe we should be able to reach our 2021 shipment output.  
In summary, chip demand is very strong, and we are working to maximize output to meet customer demand. The secular growth trends as part of the digital transformation to a more connected world are fueling future demand across all market segments at both the advanced and the mature nodes, and we expect another year of healthy growth in 2022.  
Looking beyond next year, I'd like to provide a quick summary of our Investor Day that we held last month where we provided a longer-term view of our business and growth opportunities. The global mega-trends in the electronics industry supported by a highly profitable and innovative ecosystem are expected to continue to fuel growth across the semiconductor markets. Growth in semiconductor end-markets and increasing lithography intensity are driving demand for our products and services.  
ASML's comprehensive product portfolio is aligned to our customers' road maps, delivering cost-effective solutions in support of all applications from leading edge to mature nodes. And based on different market scenarios, we have an opportunity to reach an annual revenue in 2025 between approximately EUR 24 billion in a low market scenario and EUR 30 billion in high market scenario with a gross margin in 2025 between approximately 54% and 56%. We see significant growth opportunities beyond 2025.  
Using third-party research and applying our own market and customer intelligence, we expect our systems and installed base business to provide a comfortable annual revenue growth rate of around 11% for the period 2020, 2030. We are continuously improving our performance on our ESG sustainability KPIs and are upgrading our ESG sustainability strategy to accelerate progress.  
Our industry can contribute significantly to cut global emissions by 15% in 2030. Our ESG sustainability strategy is focused on developing lithography technology to continue to produce microchips that are 3x more energy efficient every 2 years, helping our customers and suppliers to minimize materials and energy required to produce advanced microchips and driving the road map towards zero waste by 2030 and net zero value chain emissions by 2040.  
Our continued investments in technology leadership have created significant shareholder value. As outlined in our capital allocation strategy, we [indiscernible] expect to continue to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders through a combination of growing dividends and share buybacks.  
And in summary, we have increased and -- we have increased and strong confidence in our long-term growth opportunities, while we deliver significant value to all our stakeholders.  
With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",1094

Wennink,,Executives,10,"Yes, Mehdi, good question. But I think -- like I said in my introductory comments, in a low market we will be at the EUR 24 billion and in high market would be at EUR 30 billion. So that is basically what we are looking at. And to take a backlog any moment in time is really a function of our shipment pattern because we are shipping out of that backlog, but also the lumpiness with which our customers are going to give us orders. So I wouldn't read too much into the EUR 19.6 billion other than that's a big number. And that big number is actually because there is a shortage and especially in leading-edge equipment and other types of equipment. 
So yes, customers are ordering. 2022 for EUV is covered. I mean, we are booking into 2023. So I think that -- it is more a function of the lumpiness of the order intake for our customers that have expansion plans, which between now and 2025 can be quite significant, also taking into account the announcement of the new fabs, the drive of technological sovereignty, the geopolitical situation.  
So there's many, many elements there that will drive our order intake. So I would not think of this as a peak. I would just look at this as a point towards a significantly higher sales number by 2025.",230

And let's be honest, I mean, we have over EUR 6 billion of bookings worldwide. Our sales in Q3 were EUR 4 billion, so I think the booking number is pretty good. So yes, I think for 2022 on the Memory, I said it in my introductory comments, we feel good about 2022 because our customers feel good about 2022. 
And yes, there's been some concern about DRAM weakness. Our customers feel that is not structural. There's all kind of reasons why in certain segments, there is a temporary weakness, but they definitely see the need to add capacity, but also to do the node migrations. And that means that we see continued growth next year. So we're positive. Don't ask us to have a crystal ball on Memory and DRAM pricing, but what we do is that we listen very carefully to our customers and our customers' expansion plans and their optimism and their confidence that they need to expand. And so this is why we are optimistic also for growth next year.",202

And then, Peter, as you know, this industry either gives you high-class problems or low-class problems. And right now, there's a lot of high-class problems out there. I'm kind of curious -- can you help me better understand around your capacity expansion. To what extent is it just the need to add fixed cost that you might have to carry through the inevitable cyclical correction when it comes? And to what extent is this variable cost? And I'd be curious, both on kind of the 2022 kind of capacity you're thinking about, but also importantly, the 2025 target as you talk about DPV and EUV production being up 1.5x and more than 2x.",116

I also said in my statement that these capacity additions are largely focused on adding capacity in the supply chain. Now we are adding people. That's also clear. I think we hired this year with some attrition, but we probably hired between 6,000 and 7,000 people. So we're probably going to add about 4,500 to 5,000 people. That's, of course, fixed cost. But that's in R&D. That's not only in manufacturing capacity. It's in service, which, of course, is -- has to do with the higher business level. 
So I think it is larger -- for us, it's largely people. It's some CapEx, but not out of the ordinary. It's what we have planned, started to plan this even last year and the year before. So I don't think that's the major issue. It's really in the supply chain if you -- and you talked about the inevitable correction. Yes. I mean, we have corrections. We have always seen corrections in our industry. I'm not going to say that they're not there. But we have to look at some of the trends that we're also seeing. 
And when we look at the announcement of the build-out of new capacity. It is also very much driven by, I would say, the geopolitical situation and governments looking at technological sovereignty giving quite significant incentives. Just refer to the to the U.S. chip sector, EUR 52 billion, of which EUR 40 billion is for basically to support expansion of capacity. That's going to happen over the next couple of years. It will take 2 to 3 years. 
So [indiscernible]  any fluctuations in the end demand, that's going to happen. So I think and that's what we believe that adding that capacity is absolutely necessary because we do believe we see higher levels of equipment demand over the next couple of years. So when this inevitable correction will come, I don't think it's likely to come anywhere soon.",325

That's a good comment, C.J. I mean if you think about how we add capacity, it's basically 3 ways. One is to work on cycle time and on efficiencies in your production manufacturing space. That's what we're all doing, us and our suppliers are doing that. And I think that gives us a result that we can actually ship more now. And I would say, the first half of next year. 
The second is you have to buy equipment and you have to hire people. It has a longer lead time. It has a lead of about 12 to 18 months before you really get output. And then there's the third layer, which basically if you cannot put more people and more machines into the square footage that you have, you need to build, which is actually 2 to 3 years, yes? And I think this is where we are today. I think given what I said on the answer to the previous question, what I expect is that we will see billing activity starting in the supply chain because I think we need to add more capacity over the next 2 to 3 years because the numbers that you quoted were for 2025, yes?
So it's going to be a gradual increase. One, by cycle-time reduction and all the efficiencies that is at the end of the supply chain. Two, more equipment, production equipment and people, which will have its effect in 2022, 2023. And then I think you will see indeed square footage being added in '23, '24. And that's how we get to that 1.5x and 2x in terms of unit capacity increase. 
But then, of course, in the same time frame, we will ship more productive tools. So that, of course, will help to alleviate some of the wafer capacity shortages that we currently see. I hope that's clear.",314

No, that's very helpful. I guess as my follow-on question and to follow on to John's earlier question around DRAM, you highlighted very high utilization on the installed base and then a focus not only on node migration, but also the need to add capacity yet at the same time, your memory backlog and orders declined sequentially. 
It certainly sounds like that's a place where you could start to see positive momentum and drive even further growth into 2022. So I guess, how are you thinking about DRAM and the kind of timing of a potential inflection there for you guys?",102

I think again, like I said, we listen carefully to our customers. And we actually feel a significant level of confidence currently at our customers, all DRAM customers to be able to -- that they must add capacity. I mean they are talking about high- to mid-teens bit growth, but high teens close to 20% bit growth would mean that we just look at the utilization at this moment in time, which is very high. 
We cannot support high-teens bit growth with the current installed capacity, so then they need to add capacity, yes? And I think it's -- when you think about DRAM and you think about the underlying -- because DRAM is a derivative, Memory is derivate of the Logic growth. And when you see the very strong demand for Logic, both at the leading edge and at the mature side, has -- there is an effect on Memory. There is an effect on performance memory and on storage memory. 
So looking at where we are today, the high utilization rates, let's assume if there is high-teens bit growth, we need to have capacity. So I fully understand the, let's say, positive momentum that our customers are seeing and the demand that they put on us for next year shipments.",213

So I think that was the basis for the statement that Peter made that our expectation is that next year we should see shipments at the level of this year in terms of -- for DPV. 
In terms of Installed Base, you've seen in the Capital Markets Day that we're looking at a 12% CAGR until 2025 installed base. So I think that is a pretty good proxy to look at the CAGR from this year into next year.",140

Yes, I think in that build-up of capacity that over time, which definitely the next year, will, of course, become more visible throughout the year. So it will be more visible in the second half of the year. That's also clear. And also because what Roger said earlier, I mean, we've actually depleted our safety and buffer stocks in 2021 to be able to supply our customers with everything that they wanted. 
But you can only do that once, and then you -- actually, if you want to actually have the same shipment pattern in '22 or at the same shipment output level as in '22 as in '21, you need to actually build that capacity, and that's what we're doing. So I think you will see that. And as I answered to a previous question, when we think about 1.5x DPV capacity, it will grow over time. So there will be more people hired in our supply chain. They will buy more machines, which they are actually doing. So this will come online as we go. 
So yes, the assumption in our capacity capability in the second half of 2020 was higher than in the first half, that is a realistic one.",211

I think clearly, also the -- on the immersion side, that was a positive in the gross margin if you compare Q3 to Q2. 
As we said before, in this quarter, you saw a meaningful number of 2050s in there, and we said that 2050 was accretive to gross margins. So that's definitely a help.  Also more 3600s in there, although a little bit of that was offset by a slightly lower ASP than what you've seen in the past quarters on the 3400s.

You highlighted EUR 300 million additional revenue that is not on your guidance versus what you were saying 3 months ago. So if you could tell us what is exactly driving this? Is it the additional demand for upgrades that you mentioned as a driver going forward? Is that already materializing in 2021?",73

Dassen,,Executives,34,"Yes, it is a combination of both the service revenue being high and us increasingly, we talked about that extensively in the Capital Markets Day, finding models with the customer to bring more value to the customer. And in that way, boosting, if you like, the service revenue. So that's one dimension. 
But secondly, also upgrade potential. I mean everyone is screaming for capacity in that environment, if customers find a way to give us some machine time or reversely, we find a way to do the upgrades without taking too much machine time, and that's what we're putting a lot of emphasis on to really make the upgrades as demanding, as little machine time as possible, then there is a lot of demand in this environment to -- for upgrades. 
So it's that combination that really has driven upgrades, as a matter of fact, throughout the entire year at this very high level. You might remember in Q1, we talked about a very high level of upgrades, and we said -- we talked about pull-ins and just signaling that we thought that, that would be at the detriment of upgrades that would happen in the remainder of the year. And that didn't happen. Also in the remainder of the year, upgrades were at a very, very high level because, again, we found ways with the customer to do it in a way that was not very intrusive, and therefore, giving value to the customer with the upgrades without ruining their process for too long.",255

D.J., that's a good question. When we talk about these things, I always try to look at reality and the facts. And the fact of the matter is that all our customers -- our DRAM customers are engaged with us on EUV, which actually, for some of the customers that they also talk about 3D DRAM, and I'll talk about that a little bit later. I'll refer to that a little bit later. 
Actually see ramping up EUV in '23, '24, which is dimensional scaling. On top of that, we have very significant discussions with DRAM customers on High-NA, which is the next level of dimensional scaling, and which actually, they're asking for introduction at the same timing as we have Logic [ INA ]. 
So that dimensional scaling is what they're doing. And so I can only refer to what a CTO of one of our largest DRAM customers said, the DRAM is talked about as a concept. That's actually what he said, it is written. And it's a concept. It's not enough to say, yes, I see it enough to make it reality. That's how they think about this today. It's been in research for a long time. You might remember cross-point DRAM, that's a 3D structure. It's been around, and it's been part of research and their thought process for a long while, but it's not there. 
So what is there is dimensional scaling, where they engage with us quite significantly on High-NA, which is the second half of this decade. That's reality. Now having said, you referred to some of our peers and I've also seen the Capital Markets presentations. It's my personal question is that it's a bit overhyped by our semiconductor equipment peers, which if I were them, I would probably do the same thing but it does not jive with what our customers are telling us.",314

There's been a lot of questions and debate with the investor community as to the 2-nanometer node and why they would be a flat UV layer [ count ]. I think we all well understand the drop at 1.5 due to High-NA, but maybe less so the 2-nanometer flat UV layer count. And some are worried that this is due to gate-all-around. So can you just clarify that here, you're talking about node shrink with no UV layer count increase? Or is it, in fact, no shrink or no shrink from 3 to 2, just a sort of marketing name for gate-all-around.",117

I think, D.J., if you talk about gate-all-around, first off, I think it's important to note that fundamentally, gate-all-around or FinFET doesn't drive a difference in litho intensity. So there is no fundamental shift in litho intensity if you move from one architecture, if you like, to the other. 
But it is the case that customers look at a new node and say, is this a node where I'm going to combine device architecture innovation with significant shrink. And there, you see -- and if you just look at the history, if you look at, for instance, FinFET, you saw that some customers decided to -- when they introduced the new device architecture to be very conservative on shrink, some others didn't. And actually combines device architecture with shrink. So we've been conservative in our projection there. 
So we know there is one large customer at this node that you're referring to is indeed going to gate-all-around. You also know that another customer is actually doing that at a node before that. And therefore, the assumption that, that might -- at that particular note, leads to a conservative estimate in terms of layer count. That's the background of that slide in that number.",204

That's a good question, Stephane. I mean we are engaged -- we are encountering just like any other industrial company and even non-industrial companies, they are encountering issues with respect to component shortages, which is what we're also -- not we personally, but -- or our asset company, but in our supply chain and our supply chain does encounter these shortages. 
And of course, we need all the modules from our suppliers to make an EUV tool. So yes, this is a concern for, I think, everybody. Now the way that we deal with it is you have to think about this is that if we identify, and that's what we do together with our supply chain, we identify shortages of certain components. We actually are very active in, let's say, exchanging those shortages and the need for those components with our customers. 
So although these components are not supplied by the customers of our suppliers, but we are the customer. We are still -- you could say the in-between to make sure that we can highlight to our customers, the chip manufacturers, that they need to produce these chips. Because if we cannot get the modules, then we cannot make the machines, so that the capacity shortage, that's obviously, will stay as is. 
I mean we need to add capacity and maybe ship machines to be able to deal with the current shortage. So when we have those discussions with our chip making customers. I mean we get a longer response, as you can imagine, because basically, we want to ship our machines to their installed base. So there is this loop that we are closing. And I think that is happening as we speak. 
Now is there some delay? Yes, of course, there is a delay because there's communication between our suppliers, ASML and the chip making companies, and to see how we can close the loop. That leads to a delay, and this is a delay that we're seeing. But I think in the end, we get it resolved, at least we get it resolved. So that's why we are still confident, that's what 2022, we will be able to actually ship 55 units. 
Now are there going to be some fast shipments by the end of the year, depending on these let's say, communication delays to get things resolved? Maybe. That's too early to tell. But I think the 55 shipments with our capability to be the intermediate between our supply chain and the chip makers, I think that's something that we feel comfortable with.",430

And looking still at 2022 about the gross margin evolution. What are the elements that we have to take into account when we try to model 2022 gross margin evolution, notably on the EUV services side, which has been at much lower profitability than the group?",47

I think the key things to look at is one, you mentioned is EUV gross margin. I think we've said that you should expect that, that continues to grow until we reach around 50% in the '24, '25 time frame, that's the number that we've given. We've also told you that we're approaching 30% this year. So that's kind of the buildup that you see there. So that's one element to consider there. 
I think the second element is the fact that next year is going to be 3600Ds only, right? So you won't have Cs you would only have Ds in next year. And the third element is that you're going to see a little bit of impact on the 2050, right? So the 2050 immersion tool, of course, will be more prevalent in next year than this year. So those, I would say, are probably the main element to look into for the gross margin in '22.",160

So I have a pretty specific question. I hope it's the right forum to ask it. When we look like in Logic and foundry, I mean foundry, when your clients have moved to EUV, we've clearly seen that they've made a very, very full reuse of all the DUV tools because EUV layers were basically added to the DUV layers of the previous node. 
And the question I have is for your large IDM clients, Logic clients, these guys have pushed DUV one step further than others with the 10-nanometer node. And then as they move towards the node that they rename for, they're going to introduce EUV potentially in a more aggressive way, replacing things they've done with DUV in the previous node with EUV, which kind of would mean that maybe they would be buying more EUV tools in this transition, but also [indiscernible] excess DUV tools in the process. 
And so I was just wondering if that's the case, if you have visibility on that and if it could impact at some point for a short period of time, the EUV demand.",190

I think you are right that the number of EUV tools has gone up because EUV layers have gone up. We don't see any access in DPV for a few reasons. One, the product that is currently being produced with those DPV layers is still in very high demand. And number two, if you're an IDM, you also like to move into the foundry space, you'd better make sure you have those tools. Because foundry is not only about 7-nanometer. It's about 0.18 micron or even above that, two 7 nanometers. So it's the whole thing. 
So I would definitely not get rid of that excess DPV. I would start using it. So we haven't seen that, and it makes sense that we haven't seen it. Is that clear, Pierre?",132

How are you -- I mean, given that you have that visibility in terms of the wafers flowing through your equipment as much, have you seen additional wafers flowing today versus, say, Q4 last year through your equipment to say that there is much more capacity today versus in Q4 last year? 
And why are we still -- there are such big supply chain bottlenecks, including for yourselves and for many others in the -- and particularly related to the semiconductor industry.  And I have one quick follow-up [indiscernible].",137

I mean you've been around a long time and you asked the million-dollar question. So -- and the real answer is we don't know. We have some indications and some ideas. And yes, you are absolutely right, the wafer out capacity today is a big -- is a lot larger than it was in Q4 2020. That's true. And still, we see these shortages. Now I spoke to a very large customer and basically asked the same question. 
And I actually said, Peter, we don't know either.  Because somehow we haven't been able to connect all the dots that actually are the underlying drivers for this demand.  There's some rumors out there that the brokers and the distributors are playing as a devious role here because they stock up all the inventory and drive up to the prices. But I don't believe that, that much, again there will be some of it. 
But even for the very large customers, like the smartphone makers that are direct customers to the semiconductor makers, have nothing to do with the distributors, yet they are in shortage also. So I think it is the underestimation of the very fast application of everything has to do with mobility, sensor technology, io2 type applications that we completely underestimated that tens of thousands of companies are making use of the capabilities of the cloud, of the high-performance computing in the data centers, of 5G and they are creating solutions, services, product that actually need, in the end, the compute power of the data centers, but also, let's say, the 90 and the 0.18-micron technology that's 20 years or 30 years old. 
This is what's happening today. And we haven't connected the dots. And that's happening today because that's why you see it everywhere. Take a car, if you look at the number of sensors that are currently in an advanced driver-assisted system in a car, it just exploded. And they also -- and they need -- and other device they need -- and then in power [indiscernible] , they need a microcontroller. And that's just a car. I mean, it's everywhere. And this is where I think we are struggling to really understand the issues. 
I know one thing that the demand for mature, for DPV dry has by far exceeded our expectations where we are today. And yes, some of it will be panic ordering by the customers of our customers. But it's too big to just be panic ordering. So there is this underlying trend that we really don't understand fully. An as a person, I have the idea, it's the combination of the cloud, the high-power compute capabilities in the data centers, the fact that we're rolling out 5G and the fact that we have this distributed computing field that is growing almost exponentially in terms of services and products. 
And the latter, we don't fully understand. And unfortunately, our customers don't understand it either, as I was told. So I'm sorry, I'm just going to add to the cloud of fog that we're currently seeing, but I cannot give you as a very clear answer.",524

It's external numbers in terms of were external source to see the semiconductor market goes. So you might look at it and say, we think it could grow faster based on the developments that we just talked about, but that was the starting point. And then we also said that we had a number of estimates in there that some refer to as conservative, right? 
We talked about litho intensity being at the same level of 2025. Some say that's conservative. That's the assumption that we've applied. We've looked at a market share that doesn't move from 2025. Again, some people would say with further advancement of EUV, High-NA, et cetera, your market share should continue to grow in terms of the total share in the pie. 
So I think we've given the assumptions, some refer to those assumptions as conservative, but that's the background, and that's the basis for the model.",174

Yes, that's a good question. I think generally, I would say, our local Chinese customers follow their capacity expansion road map quite accurately. So what we're seeing today is actually a result of what they told us also last year. Now having said that, they're also reacting, of course, to the local chip shortage. So whenever they have an opportunity to put more machines into their factory, they will do that. So I think for the large capacity expansion plans, they just follow plan. 
For the shorter term, anything that we can pull in that they ask for a pull-in. But that is, I think, more driven by the current demand in the market than by any strategic reasoning. The strategic reason is more the total capacity that they want to build over next couple of years. And that actually has been pretty stable or pretty accurate also in terms of execution.",153
