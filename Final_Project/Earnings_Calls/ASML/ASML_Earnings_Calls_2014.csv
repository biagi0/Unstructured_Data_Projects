Before we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to introduce and welcome Wolfgang to his first ASML quarterly results conference call. Wolfgang joined ASML in December of last year from Western Digital, headquartered in Irvine, California, where he spent 18 years in various operations and financial roles, ending his time there as CFO. I'll save further introductory remarks for later, as many of you will get to meet Wolfgang for our upcoming post-results roadshows later this weekend next.
Now, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on our fourth quarter results and provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our Q4 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some further comments on our future business outlook and update you on our emerging and EUV product programs.

It's a pleasure for me to be here today and talk to you about our results and our guidance. 
Q4 revenue came in very much as guided. Revenue was driven again by foundry shipments, plus an uptick in IDM shipments, which together produced 65% of total quarterly system sales.
Sequentially, memory system sales were up strongly as well, contributing the remaining 35%, driven by NAND. 
During the quarter, we recognized revenue for our first NXE:3300 EUV system. Overall, last quarter of unit shipment were more balanced between ArF immersion and KrF than the prior quarter, indicating the addition of wafer capacity. As a result, the ASP of EUR 25.7 million for all systems sold in Q4 was lower than Q3 at EUR 28.2 million.
Service and field option sales again grew significantly to EUR 407 million from EUR 359 million in Q3. This includes Cymer service sales, as well as higher application sales. 
Q4 net bookings and booked ASPs remained at Q3 levels of EUR 1.45 billion for 52 systems booked with ASPs at EUR 28 million. These bookings exclude EUV. 
Memory bookings were present at almost 60% of total bookings value. Our system order backlog at the end of Q4 grew further to almost EUR 2 billion, excluding EUV. The key of change in our backlog profile appears at year end, driven by the increased memory bookings, leaving memory backlog at 55% of total versus 35% in the prior quarter.
For Q1, we expect total sales to be about EUR 1.4 billion with a gross margin of around 42%. Q1's margin is slightly negatively impacted by the product mix relative to Q4 2013, which is expected to reverse again in the coming quarters.
As discussed last quarter, we expect that Q1 will include revenue recognition for 1 EUV system, which currently is dilutive to overall gross margin. Excluding EUV, Q1 gross margin would be around 44%.
In 2014, we expect to deliver the remaining 8 EUV systems on order. In Q1, we expect to ship 1 EUV system. As with all new technology introductions, revenue recognition of EUV system is currently taking place after installation and customer acceptance. This revenue recognition method will continue until we demonstrate predicable installation timing.
Upon tool acceptance, about EUR 60 million will be recognized per system with about EUR 10 million per system being deferred until each system receives light source upgrade. We currently expect to recognize revenue for 1 system in Q1, 1 system in Q2, and 6 systems in the second half of the calendar year 2014.
As mentioned, we again saw a meaningful increase in our service and field option sales revenue to EUR 407 million in Q4. This was driven by a significant quarterly increase in performance-enhancing field option sales. We expect that quarterly service and field options revenues throughout 2014 will leverage about EUR 350 million per quarter.
Combined R&D for the first quarter will be about EUR 280 million. Other income with contributions from participants of the Customer Co-Investment Program will be about EUR 20 million. 
Throughout 2014, we will walk quarterly R&D down with a targeted quarterly combined R&D spend of about EUR 250 million exiting 2014.
Combined SG&A is expected at about EUR 85 million for Q1. 
We will again propose to increase our dividend by 15% to EUR 0.61 per ordinary share. During 2013, we bought back 4.6 million shares for a total of EUR 300 million, representing 30% of the EUR 1 billion buyback program announced last year for 2013 and 2014 combined.
ASML has now returned more than EUR 4.5 billion in dividends and share buybacks since 2006.
As our current business status, memory customers have somewhat aggressively moved to the lithography systems order front with bookings in Q4 of EUR 850 million, a significant increase over Q3, which was higher than Q2, leaving us with the memory backlog of almost EUR 1.1 billion. This backlog appears to be supported by tight mobile DRAM capacity and a steady growth path and stable market outlook in NAND Flash.
Foundry customers are evaluating 20-nanometer demand and are preparing for 16 and 14-nanometer node capacity additions later this year, and the MPU sector continues to add 14-nanometer capacity.
Our current business visibility along with a high level of business certainty provided by our current backlog and understanding of near-term demand, allows us to reiterate our revenue guidance of around EUR 3 billion for the first half of 2014, excluding EUV. This creates a solid basis for the remainder of the year.
Now with that, I would like to hand it back over to Peter.",775

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, we've seen a significant shift in our backlog in favor of the memory sector, which will help drive our first half revenues. 
This year, we will see the continued node transitions in NAND Flash and DRAM, as well as the addition of NAND Flash capacity, including an initial phase of 3D NAND manufacturing capacity build. Based upon customer interactions and research data, we expect low to mid 40% bid demand growth for NAND, and between 20% and 30% demand growth in DRAM, driven largely by the mobile application space.
First half, we'll see the foundry logic sector taking some time to absorb the rapid 20-nanometer capacity build that we witnessed in the second half 2013, before we expected 16- to 14-nanometer node ramp will start in the second half of this year. Like Wolfgang said, the 14-nanometer microprocessor manufacturing ramp started late 2013 and will continue throughout 2014.
The industry has entered a very interesting time as the challenges of device designed and performance have in turn, created significant manufacturing and cost challenges in pursuit of continued cost-effective strength.
In past conference calls, we have discussed our company strategy to address these issues, which is based upon execution around a very significant R&D investment for technology leadership. I think it's important to repeat 4 key areas of our strategy in the context of today's environment. 
First of all, it's the continued significant performance improvement of our current, dry and immersion scanner architectures, which enabled the most cost-effective leading-edge imaging solutions, which will help our customers to address the imaging complexity involved in multipass patterning strategies at the current and the future of those nodes. 
Secondly, the buildup of our application products or our Holistic Litho portfolio, enabling and differentiating further our dry and immersion products in support of sub-20-nanometer process control challenges, many of them related to the aforementioned multipass patterning strategies.
Thirdly, the introduction of EUV, the next-generation litho technology, the delivery of which will enable the continuation of Moore's Law, by providing large cost reductions, device power savings and further device performance improvements. 
And fourth, the creation of a strong and highly competent R&D infrastructure to react to any relevant request from the industry, such as the potential 450 millimeter wafer size insertion.
The execution of this strategy enables us to support any short and long-term lithography need of the industry. This becomes particularly evident when we look at the challenges of our customers to address the 10-nanometer logic node transition. In order to control risk, customers may decide to initially focus on the use of our most advanced NXT:1970 immersion scanner, enabling execution of their complexed multi-patterning strategies supported by the complete suite of Holistic Litho products for maximum process optimization, thereby making this technology the current process of record.
As mentioned previously, the progress we have made in the development of leading edge immersion technology has culminated into our new NXT:1970 immersion system. This machine combines world leading performance of 250 wafers per hour with overlay achievements of less than 2 nanometer, which, when matched with a suite of application products, enables aggressive multi-patterning strategies, which our leading-edge logic device customers can safely choose to plan their sub-20-nanometer designs.
The NXT:1970 has seen widespread and quick adoption in recognition of its value, and we shipped 5 tools in the 3-month period post-introduction and have built a 14-system backlog with a value just over EUR 700 million. The value of this system to our customers is translated into a very strong average selling prices, currently and slightly above EUR 50 million while maintaining very healthy margins.
The adoption of our application products, again key to the performance at the 20-nanometer and below, is expected to grow again in 2014, likely to a level between EUR 500 million and EUR 600 million. While it is clear that the performance of our newest immersion systems help our logic customers, we also see significant demand for these systems from our memory customers. The complexity of 3D NAND also requires best available overlay and focus capability, and will furthermore require a significant number of immersion systems, which we are seeing now as 3D NAND chip manufacturing volume start to grow.
We are very satisfied with the acceptance of our NXT:1970 as the most advanced lithography solution in the industry and as a viable choice for the 10- nanometer logic node. However, we realized, together with our customers, that the continuation of further shrink, therefore, Moore's Law, ultimately and inevitably depends on the introduction of EUV. We are therefore working very closely with selected customers on the industrialization of our EUV technology, which we will very likely adopt when their economic targets for initial insertion of these more cost-effective solutions are actually met, thereby optimally addressing the economic and cost challenges of this node.
Regarding EUV, we're happy to report good progress. First 3 of 11 NXE:3300B scanners have been shipped. In the last 2 weeks, the fourth -- a fourth system has been signed off and is in the process of shipping, while 7 additional systems are in state of integration. 
In the fourth quarter, progress has been shown. First, source code to all systems, enabling the increase of output power by 40%, showing up to 50 wafer per hour capability in our factory. 
Second, source of time and cost of ownership improvements through institute cleaning technology of the EUV mirror in the stores. Third, defect management through the development and use of chemicals on the photo maps. 
Despite our continued good progress, we have currently not yet reached a stage of industrialization, whereby our customers can confidently assign their critical layers for their most advanced future nodes to EUV. However, the progress that we see gives us full confidence that we will reach that stage before our customers put these nodes into full volume production. We therefore remain fully engaged in EUV insertion planning discussions with our customers, some of which at this point, have already qualified EUV for imaging at the 10-nanometer foundry logic node. Going forward, with the benefits of EUV clearly understood, insertion decisions will be based on the economics of EUV, driven by productivity, stability and cost of ownership improvements, in turn driving layer-by-layer insertion when these improvements become available.
With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",1060

Could you make a comment on?",49

I think TSMC didn't say that much different than what I just said. It is clear that TSMC has found out with the introduction of our deep UV systems that the safest route for a 10-nanometer node is using the maximum capability of our NXT:1970 with the full suite of the Holistic Lithography products, which actually gives them a kind of a safe route into 10-nanometer. Having said that, it is a route with a very high intensity of litho tools, making this not a very cheap node. This is also why we, at the same time, work very closely with TSMC on the introduction of EUV. We actually have seen some very encouraging results, and that working on that particular no node will lead to a situation where when we meet the economic targets that TSMC has set for the introduction of EUV, they will immediately insert it, and this is where we are. And I think this is also what TSMC or Mark [ph] said at the call. He said the process of record is deep UV because we know what to do, but we need EUV because it is more cost effective when our economic targets are met and those are not targets, which are the 125 wafers per hour. Those are significantly lower targets because also TSMC needs to learn. And that is where we are. So it's a 2-track road, whereby deep UV is currently the safe route, not the cheapest route because the future is with EUV.",254

Wennink,,Executives,10,"You're absolutely correct. I think, we are not saying that much different than what we said 3 months ago. And what we are confirming is that the 70 wafers per hour, that is what we see happening this year and 125 next year, but I think that the difference between now and between the third quarter conference call is that we've made good progress on some important elements that drive the reliability and the stability of all the tools, which has to do with -- like I said in the introductory comments, have to do with the cleanliness of the EUV mirror and also which has to do with the development of pellicles for the photomask. So those are infrastructural issues and our industrialization issues that actually provide and approve of a good progress that we have made since the third quarter.",143

Last call, we were thinking that there'll be sort of 12 to 14 tools shipped this year. It sounds like there's going to be a few less than that. Yet, you also sound like you're a little more constructive on there being a round of follow-on orders for EUV. So can you help me bridge those 2?",77
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2013 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2014",2014-01-22,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3662.0,570197.0,25928851.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,13,"Yes. Let's first focus on the 11 orders that we have on the book and 3300 systems because I think that is what we said also in the introductory statements of Wolfgang and myself. The 11 tools on the 3300, the 3300 will be followed by the 3350. The 3300 are 11 tools, one of which will go to Research Institute and we will see -- not in the sales level but will be in the R&D line. So that's 10 systems left, 3 of those systems were shipped in the fourth quarter, one of them led to revenue recognition, so it leaves us with 9 systems. Now the way that we currently look at the shipment schedule, and as Wolfgang said, installation and customer acceptance happen after the shipment, we currently see or plan that 1 of those 9 systems will potentially move into 2015. So that's why we are left with 8 systems. So 8 systems we will recognize out of the 3300. Now having said that, we also started the integration of the first of 3350 systems. Now based on -- so we are preparing for 3350 shipments without having specific orders because we are confident that we will reach levels of productivity and reliability that will make customers take those systems. So depending on the progress that we are making over the next few quarters, it could very well be that we would target a shipment or a few shipments of 3350 also towards the end of the year. That would not lead to revenue recognition because that probably is going to be in 2015, but we are preparing to next to the 3300 be able to start shipping 3350s. And then revenue, we will probably see in Q1 of 2015. Does that explain a bit what you're asking, Tim?",304

We are happy to invest that money right now in order to solidify the roadmap and make sure that we deliver the value, but we also have a clear path to work it again down to the 250 level by the end of the calendar year, which by the way still means that we are investing about EUR 1 billion run rate into this business from an R&D perspective.

Wennink,,Executives,19,"Well, this is not a theoretical throughput. It's actually driven by the fact that we have the source power to go up to 50 wafers per hour. As a -- just as a side comment, we would like to now talk about wafers per hour because our customers are now talking about economic metrics and are driven by productivity and stability, and just the driver of the productivity is the source power. So 50 wafers per hour equates to roughly 70 Watts. That is what we have shown here for an extended period of time. That equates to up to 50 wafers per hour. So this is why we said it. And going forward, we would like to talk about wafers per hour because that's the metric that our customers are using.",132

Now in terms of the learning curve with EUV, given that there is some slight delays again with the progress, basically the learning curve could take longer. Do you agree with the fact that if it's not used very much at 10 nanometer, I'm saying if, if it's only introduced at a later stage at 10 nanometer, then it will take longer to learn how to reach higher margins with EUV, so basically for potential peak earnings in 2019 for 7 nanometer?",83

Wennink,,Executives,23,"I've always said and it's true that the cost reductions is a matter of the learning curve. So whether the learning curve starts in year 1 or in year 2, we actually need about 24 months after volume, that way [ph] reduction that has not changed. I think from a learning curve perspective, there's not much difference. So we need the first 2 years after volume introduction to actually get the margins up to the corporate average, which is still the plan. So I don't see any -- not much difference there. And the learning curve is not only for costs, I think a big part of the learning curve is with the customers. Actually, if we would ship an EUV tool that could do 100 wafers per hour today, where the infrastructure of the customer side is they would probably have to throw away 80% of those wafers, because they're all infrastructure and their process are not able to deal with that productivity.

Wennink,,Executives,26,"That's a very good question. In fact, we have set, we want 70 wafers per hour this year, which is still our target and we're going for it and also 125 in 2015. Having said that, at -- for the insertion at the 10-nanometer node, the first phase of it -- customers actually settle for a lot less than 70 wafers per hour. Customers would settle for 30 or 40 wafers at 80% availability, much larger than 80 wafers at 40% availability. So it is what I said earlier in the -- as an answer to the previous question, it's not only us that needs to go through this learning curve. Too many wafer cycles were in a process that is not stable. In the customer factory, it's not good either. So customers had 30 to 40 wafers but give me a reasonable stability, yes? So this is what we are focusing on. So the productivity in the first phase, which will be 6 to 12 months, is not that important. Now once you start ramping -- and don't forget the ramp of 10 nanometer is 2016, 2017, yes? Then they need that 70 or that's 100 wafers per hour. So you need that initial learning period, not only for us but also for the customer. So you will very likely see insertion point, whether productivity is not used at 70 wafer, it is used at a lower level, but they want stability. Is that clear, John?",248

Memory, we talked about in the introductory comments. Microprocessors is now starting to ramp new nodes at the end of last year and is fully ramping in this year. And logic is as strong in 2014 as it was in 2013. So qualitatively, I'm very confident and with the quantitative guidance of the EUR 3 billion, excluding EUV -- if include the EUV, it's between EUR 3.1 billion and EUR 3.2 billion.

Wennink,,Executives,40,"There were technical criteria and the most important one was that the customer ran wafers what we call OPC wafers with the -- let's say with the target features of the mask being printed on the wafer, giving the imaging results confirming the 10-nanometer device requirements. And that's what actually happens. What -- it was actually asked for is that I want a machine that an integrated machine with an EUV source and an EUV 3300 scanner with the maximum optical capability that will give us a 10-nanometer feature on the wafer using a 10-nanometer OPC wafer. And that's what it is. And then they run a patch of those wafers, and that need to be batches where everything was fine and which was fine and was passed. That's why we say the qualification also in the introductory comments on the imaging results were 10-nanometer as actually being done. We are qualified from an imaging point of view on 10. And that's when the customers say I have a tool, with which I can make my 10-nanometer device. And then I will insert that tool when the economics, i.e., the stability of the tool, availability of the tool are actually met. And that will I think happen both over the next foreseeable future. Because we worked hard on it, and we are very close with our customers. We've made good progress and we know what to do. So I think the acceptance of that first tool showing those OPC wafers is also -- was a big thing.",257

It's the 16-nanometer DRAM node, which is the node where we have to -- where we actually have to use EUVs. So with our DRAM customers, this is the node that we're talking about the EUV -- about the EUV insertion.

And the application products are software and hardware related. It's YieldStar combined with the software control products, which carry good gross margins. So the 1970 is not only a tool that has the highest average selling prices, but very healthy margins. The only indication I can give use as you can understand, I'm not going to give in the public for all the margin profile on the tools specific, which of course a lot of customers would have like and especially the purchasing departments, but it's really you have to look at the margin development of the company. I think Wolfgang made it clear in the press conference this morning, when you look at the fourth quarter gross margin and you take the EUV impact out and the let's say non-cash accounting adjustments for Cymer, then you will see that actually the fourth quarter was above our last peak gross margin profile. So if you do the math then Wolfgang help you or one of the IR guys can help you go through those numbers. But that gives you an indication of what it means for the company.",222

I think they are going to use the tool as much as they can. And I think they will be looking at insertion points, where the economics are met for the layers that they are targeting at. Now, per customer that is different, that it can vary from 2 to 4, a 4 maximum, 2 I think is the most reasonable assumption. And we have the 70 wafers per hour capability, but it means that if they do their learning, they will probably start at a lower level because they have to go through their own process and own learning also. So what we are really looking at is, I would say 2 on average, could be 3. It's been not all the same, maximum of 4, but that's I would say max. So if you want to go average, 2.",172

Wennink,,Executives,52,"Well, if you say in the absence of EUV, I don't think that first that is not realistic scenario, because in 2016 there will be EUV. But if you say suppose there's not going to be EUV, then there's -- it's very hard to imagine that there are going to be any other tricks up their sleeves to go from 10 to 7. If they do, it's going to be extremely difficult from a cost point of view to keep using deep UV. So I think that -- what you're basically then saying is that Moore's Law will slow down. Now -- so what we are seeing today, I think is more realistic. Yes, it's EUR 50 million-plus price, but it does provide the value to do 10-nanometer shrink. So obviously -- and the customers make those calculations better than we do, that they know what their litho spend is going to be, they know what their production spend is going to be, and they must be convinced that the value that they get out of the shrink to 10-nanometer is significantly higher than that added cost, otherwise they would not do it. So it's obvious that there is a cost increase. And this is the reason why they are working so closely together with us on EUV. Because ultimately you could say that 1970 multi-pass patterning, Great Bridge solution for the 10-nanometer node, there is a kind of a process of record. But once we made the EUV targets, yes, the economic insertion targets, they will go EUV.",259

Wennink,,Executives,60,"Yes, I think memory in the bookings is indeed high, but I think it is understandable. If we look at especially the DRAM situation, where when we look at the installed capacity and the reduction of that capacity due to -- when I talk about the wafer out capacity in the DRAM industry, it has come down with DRAM prices going up. And the reason why its total capacity went down is because there were conversions from DRAM into NAND in 2012 to early 2013. And also the complexity of the DRAM chips has gone up with additional ArF immersion layers, which also means that your wafers outgo actually down. No new DRAM fab is build. DRAM prices going up to very healthy levels. It's not a surprise that this comes back. And at the background, NAND being pretty stable, they are all going to the next node. So when you look at the value, it's a bit deceiving because it's 3 to 4 years ago, while if you look at the units that's have been booked and the average selling price is different between 2010 and 2013, '14 is quite different also. So from a unit point of view, it's not a crazy number, but that's for memory. For foundry, foundry was a bit lower in the fourth quarter. And if you look at the backlog, the end-user is only about 13%. So it means foundry still has to come and this is exactly what is the case. We had one foundry investing pretty significantly in 2013, ramping before the others, which the others are -- now will follow, simply haven't met than all translated it into the paper that is called an order, but those will come.

That's a good question. The answer is yes. Since the customers need more litho capability, that's a more litho throughput capability at multi-pass patterning, they are, of course, looking at -- to upgrade their existing install base of some of their -- in our install base to 1970 performance because they will need a lot of those leading-edge tools and it will be highly interesting if you can have tools of previous generation and upgrade it to 1970. Yes, that can be done. And it's also in the plan that we have with customers, almost with every customer, there is a section that deals with upgrades of a number of the existing tools. Those upgrades are upgrades. They generally cost anywhere between EUR 10 million and EUR 15 million because when you go to the NXTC [ph], you need basically a complete new wafer stage. So there are -- plus we need to make adjustments to the optical system. It's all quite expensive with good margins. But that is in every plan with the customer. Otherwise, you could say this is an answer of the customer to make the 10-nanometer deep EUV multi-pass patterning strategies somewhat affordable. And that's where we're looking into this together with our customers. But yes, that can be done.",215

This is still true, as we said last quarter and gross margin profile, it depends on the composition of what they want. If they want more hardware than software, then it's, of course, lower, but when it's more software related, well, it's not a surprise that software products have a very high gross margin in the range of 80%. So that margin profile is good. And we actually need that because also the R&D cost, like Wolfgang pointed out for -- specially for the applications group, is also going up. So the margin profile is significantly above the corporate average.",105

Obviously, 3 very clear [ph] times in terms of rising Holistic Litho proportion. And then secondly, of course, I wondered whether you can just go through how we should think about the potential gross margin benefits, now that you've sort of had a few months to digest Cymer? So point number one, the integration benefits and gross margin from Cymer. And then secondly, how some of the accounting terms of the customer investment plans from Intel would affect gross margin as well?

Wennink,,Executives,92,"Yes, the gross margin, like I said on the 1970 if you were not going to be specific on the gross margin of that product for obvious reasons. Clearly, the gross margin profile is improving. And like I said, it gives you -- if you go on a proxy, you can look at the fourth quarter results, look at the breakdown of the sales numbers, the number of immersion systems. We sold another 4 NXT:1970s in Q4. And if you take out the one-time impact of the Cymer purchase price accounting and eliminate for the EUV sales number, then you have a gross margin number that is between 46% and 47%. So now that -- and clearly the impact -- the improvement of the gross margin has to do with the richer mix of high-quality scanners. So that gives you an indication.

Wennink,,Executives,94,"Yes, but that has nothing to do with the Intel or the [indiscernible] Customer Co-Investment Program although a part of the program credits will be allocated to gross margin relative to the number of shipments that we make in this particular case to the biggest partner in that program. But the upside in gross margin is really driven by 2 things. It's the application products. So it's more -- we're providing more and more litho solutions with very advanced nodes. And that drives the gross margin up because of the product profile. And secondly, yes, I mean, going forward in EUV, there is a gross margin impact when we are at a full integration with Cymer on the EUV source and we're driving costs down because basically, our critical integration, you will keep that margin, you would otherwise pay to your supplier. You would keep that, of course, in your own profit or loss account. So there is margin upside, different by vertical integration in the EUV, but I like I said, that also has to do with volume that we need to make in EUV. And I think the margin profile has benefited from the litho -- from the Holistic Litho product portfolio.",204

Q1 revenue was in line with our guidance of EUR 1.4 billion and was largely driven by sales to our memory customers, which represented about 2/3 of our systems revenue. Also, as anticipated, we recognized revenue for one EUV system during the quarter.
ASPs of all tools sold remained constant at about EUR 26 million in the quarter. Service and field option sales accounted for EUR 367 million of revenue.
Gross margin came in above guidance at 43.6%, helped by a favorable product mix and the contribution of Holistic Lithography option products.
With R&D and SG&A in line with our expectations, gross margin enabled our quarterly earnings to exceed Street expectations.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with approximately EUR 3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, roughly flat with the prior quarter. 
During Q1, we bought back 2.3 million shares for a total of about EUR 147 million. This leaves us approximately EUR 553 million available for repurchases for the remainder of this calendar year. This represents about 55% of the EUR 1 billion 2013, '14 buyback program announced last year. 
As a reminder, we will propose to increase our dividend by 15% to EUR 0.61 per ordinary share at our AGM on April 23 next week. This dividend will be payable on May 13 to shareholders of record as of April 29.
Our system order backlog at the end of Q1 remained constant quarter-over-quarter at just under EUR 2 billion, excluding EUVs. The number of NXT:1970 immersion tools has increased from 14 at the end of December to 24 exiting March. Our system backlog is almost evenly balanced amongst memory, IDM and foundry customers.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for Q2 and Q3.
Let me start with a view of the markets we serve. We're experiencing solid demand in memory with some uncertainty on the ramp of 3D versus planar NAND, which is changing our product mix slightly.
IDM is experiencing strong year-over-year growth as expected. And in Foundry, we see strong demand for the 28-nanometer node but expect some adjustments to shipments for the continued ramp to volume production for both 20-nanometer planar transistor and 16/14-nanometer FinFET nodes. These adjustments are impacting our revenue forecast for Q2 and Q3. 
Our long-term view on semiconductor demand remains unchanged. Consequently, we expect sales of around EUR 3 billion for the next 2 quarters, including EUV. 
For Q2, we expect total sales to be about EUR 1.6 billion, with the gross margin around 44% to 45%. For Q3, we expect sales of about EUR 1.4 billion. We expect to recognize 1 EUV system in Q2 and 2 EUV systems in Q3. We do not have sufficient visibility and certainty to guide for the full year revenue at this point in time. 
As a reminder, as with all new technology introductions, revenue recognition of EUV systems is currently taking place after installation and customer acceptance. This revenue recognition method will continue until predictable installation and customer acceptance timing is established. On tool acceptance and installation, about EUR 60 million of system will be recognized, with about EUR 10 million of systems being deferred under until each system receives litho upgrade.
The previously referred to quarter's service and field option revenue of EUR 367 million is at the level that we expect will be roughly consistent on average throughout the remainder of 2014.
R&D expenses for the second quarter will be about EUR 270 million. Other income with contributions from participants of the Customer Co-Investment Program will be at about EUR 20 million. SG&A is expected at about EUR 85 million in Q2.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",629

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. Wolfgang pointed out that we're seeing a shift of shipment focus in the coming quarters. Such shifts are natural and common in our industry and other results of the specific dynamics in these industry segments. So let's take a brief moment and zoom out to reflect on what we believe are currently the 3 most significant trends. 
First of all, we have seen the introduction of the 3D gate architecture in logic, specifically used for the 14- and 16-nanometer FinFET devices. 
As related to logic specifically, it is important to realize that we are seeing the development of 4 process nodes in 4 to 5 years, starting with 28-nanometer, went to 20-, 16- to 14- and 10-nanometer nodes, thereby clearly accelerating the shrink roadmap. 
These aggressive shrinks are driven by the mobile device makers that have become early technology adopters in their search for performance improvements for smartphones and tablets.
However, many of those architecture transitions have just left the stage of development and are being moved into the stage of early, often risk-based production. 
Device architecture limitations, complexity and learning curves are challenges that customers need to overcome, and it will be a matter of time before they are fully resolved. And we're currently at a phase where reassessment of the timing of the production ramps with these most advanced nodes needs to be made against the background of this fastest initial ramp for leading-edge logic production that we have ever seen. In that context, it is logical that we're seeing some adjustments of the rollout of the 20-, 16- and 14-nanometer capacity ramps.
Secondly, we have witnessed the introduction of the 3D NAND architecture, which are focused on increasing bit density through vertical transistor stacking as a successor to the current 2D floating gate architecture. As is the case in logic, these technology transitions are complex. And it's therefore not surprising that the exact timing of these transitions in terms of capacity buildup cannot be accurately predicted.
Since the equipment tool set needed for these technologies is somewhat different, we are facing some uncertainties as to the composition of what is needed. However, given that NAND memory demand expectations are still about 40% bit growth to support SSD and smartphone demand, we remain confident that this bit demand will be met by continued node shrinks as well as capacity additions.
You have -- bit demand is expected to be in the mid-20% range, driven by demand in smartphone and service, with supply coming only from technology node transitions. In fact, litho process intensity rises with each node transition. And with the move to mobile DRAM as now, for the first time, a majority of DRAM is destined for mobile devices and not for PCs.
As the last but certainly not the least important point, we want to make clear that we strongly believe that the scaling and related technology challenges, as explained in previous 2 trends, created increasing need for the next-generation lithography solution in order to continue in our cost-effective scaling, and that solution is EUV. 
Although the initial introduction of EUV has been challenging and will require a significant development and infrastructural cost, we believe that the advantages of EUV will provide a level of process simplification that is so attractive to our customers that they are focusing on qualifying EUV for their next-generation devices.
And as an example for the current 10-nanometer process development purposes, they are asking us to deliver currently 100 wafers per day initially. And as they move towards product qualification, the wafer-per-day requirement moves to towards 500 wafers per day on average. And today, we are supplying the wafers per day and the availability required for the current process development phase.
It's our belief that with our current continued good progress on EUV, we will reach a stage of industrialization whereby our customers can confidently assign their critical areas with the most advanced future nodes to EUV. And we have full confidence that we will reach that stage before our customers put these nodes into volume production. 
We therefore remain fully engaged in EUV insertion planning discussions with our customers and our planning system starts for volume production at our customers within this year.
Going forward, with the benefits of EUV clearly understood, the insertion decisions across all sectors will be based on the economics of EUV, which will be driven by productivity, stability, cost of ownership improvements, in turn driving layer-by-layer insertion when these improvements become available.
So with respect to the key areas of execution of our product strategy, we can report the following. Targeted improvements in all key performance metrics of our immersion platform have been met. They are enabling today's most complex single and multipass patterning with 2 of our key immersion products. First of all, it's the TWINSCAN NXT:1970C, which continues to ramp with 24 systems in our backlog with an average selling price of well over EUR 50 million, which underscores a high level of customer acceptance and the rapid adoption over all applications. 
Secondly, for optimum cost of ownership across our emerging product line, we have brought our NXT:1960B, now called the NXT:1965C, onto this current NXT:1960C common platform. 
With throughput improvement and upgradability through the NXT:1970 or its successor, we maximize its value of ownership, and we help manage the capital efficiency in our customers' fabs.
Furthermore, adoption of our YieldStar metrology systems in our Holistic Lithography suite of products has brought on significantly within the logic customer base and is now also expanding to memory manufacturers as well. 
Coming back to EUV, we shipped our fourth NXE:3300B to the fourth customer in Q1. And as mentioned, our focus at the customer interface is on wafers per day, which is a function of throughput and availability. The targeted 100 wafer per day is met at the first customer and is targeted soon at customer #2. And 2 additional systems, #3 and 4, are now under installation, and we'll start process development also soon.
With this, we believe that this execution of our product strategy enables us to support any short- and long-term lithography need of the industry.
And with that -- this, I will be happy to take your questions.",1040

You're seeing a development. It -- I'd like to reconcile this with maybe a bit -- with slowing down in the computing cycle at the moment because like the hine [ph] of the smartphone is slowing down in terms of growth, the same for PCs, we've seen that for a while actually. So is it more like, maybe like one of the guys is trying to move to 20 nanometers, and then some of the other guys, we see that they are [indiscernible] 20, are trying to move to 16 and 14 FinFET? And basically, it's a bit like less investment at the end of the day because like one of them is winner and the others don't spend, and then maybe we see what the winners are going to be. So maybe overall, in terms of super cycle or cycle for spending for logic, it's not as good as maybe people would have been anticipated 12 months or 24 months ago.",179

You are asking a couple of questions in one question, so let me try to answer this briefly. I think if the core of your question is that you're concerned or asking me the question if we are concerned about the speed of the, let's say, technology roadmap and the execution of it, whether that is a concern to us, I would say no. When we -- you mentioned the 20-, 16-, 14-nanometer node, that node, we strongly believe, still needs about 300,000 wafer starts. The first part of that node -- and let me say, this 20-nanometer node is a bit of a strange node -- has 2 phases. It has the first phase, which is really the 20-nanometer node phase, and now you have the 16-, 14-nanometer FinFET. Now on the first part, the 20-nanometer, we have installed about 70,000 wafer starts as of now, which, by the way, happened in about 4 quarters. If you compare it to the 20-nanometer node, that took about 7 quarters to get to 70,000. So we are actually looking at the fastest ramp-up of a new node we've ever seen. On top of that, people are developing 14- and 16-nanometer FinFET solutions. They're doing that at the same time. What we are, in fact, seeing is that I don't think there is any delay in the shrink roadmaps at all. It's just a matter that people are trying to do it faster, and that's driven by performance improvements in the end devices and by cost. So this is what we are seeing today. And when we talk about timing adjustment of that capacity ramp, I think it's logical. If you see those being delayed a bit, a few quarters are simply because with -- our customers are trying to do too much at the same time. And I don't think it is specific to one customer. I think it is the need of the mobile industry that is driving the need for more advanced logic solutions, and our customers are just trying to cope with this. And we're dealing with that particular demand. So nothing has changed. I think it is a few quarters' delay, which actually is pretty good, technology roadmaps are completely intact. And I think it actually helps us because if we would have executed at the same speed and slope of the 20-nanometer ramp for also the second stage, which is 14, 16, then we might have a very meager 2015 because everything would have been shipped in 1 year, which, of course, is not possible. But I think it is understandable where we are today.",440

As you know, our EUV systems don't contribute to gross margin at this point. And we also -- on our investor day, we showed like the last quarter's 43.6%, our impact negatively actually by shipping the one system by about 2%. So as you ship more, you start off with more pressure on the system. On the other hand side, we have actually Holistic Lithography solutions outgrowing the rest of our revenue categories. And as you know, it's largely software-driven where we are having like 80% gross margin, and you've also seen that we have a pretty strong backlog on the 1970C, which jumped up to 24 systems. There is a bit more uncertainty in the gross margin because the mix changes here can impact the gross margin. That's also, by the way, a reason why we have started to give a range in the gross margin guidance. But we would think that there could be offsets in Q3 to the second system because our 1970s and Holistic Lithography is just -- is contributing strongly.",180

But also, if you go to, for instance, floating gate NAND, leading edge needs absolutely the full suite of Holistic Lithography products.

Wennink,,Executives,22,"Yes, I think when you look at where we are today, we initially provide a capability of about 100 wafers per day with a decent availability, and a decent availability is about over 50%. That's what we're doing today, but as you -- as I said earlier, at around 100 wafers per day. This is -- these 100 wafers per day is the result of the first upgrade cycle. To get to 500 wafers per day, we need several upgrade cycles, which are planned throughout the year. I think that will determine -- I don't think we will need to show over a lengthy period of time 500 wafers per day. It is the result after every upgrade cycle that is going to increase the confidence of our customers. For instance, the upgrade cycle that we did just after SPIE for the tools in the field actually gave us the projected results. So if we can keep executing on what we're doing today, that means that every -- after every upgrade cycle throughout this year, the confidence level of customers will go up. And that means that we're currently planning to be at that 500 wafers per day around the end of the year, beginning of next year. But I would think -- my personal expectation that we should have the confidence level higher before we reach that point. So somewhere this year, I think customers and ASML need to sit around the table to talk about the follow-up of the industrialization of EUV.",254

Well, the overall market CapEx is flat. I mean, Peter already talked in one answer to the first question, I believe, but I mean, we are having a strong year. We are at -- we're guiding to EUR 4.4 billion for the first 9 months. And then depending on how the fourth quarter looks like, we have a significantly stronger year than the EUR 5.2 billion. So in general, our revenue is up significantly, and the industry's CapEx is flat, that we would be kind of independent of that. On the backlog question, yes, the backlog is always dependent on what projects are going on and which customers are placing it. And in general, our backlog is pretty much flat quarter-over-quarter at about EUR 2 billion. The very good quality of backlog, it was very, very focused on memory as we ended the quarter. And you have indeed seen in our revenue, there was about 2/3 of the system's revenue was memory. And you see that balancing out a bit more now, and the backlog that we have now is actually almost equally split between the 3 major segments.",196

Wennink,,Executives,26,"And as you know, we talked about that a lot, that the orders in the order backlog, when you look at who do we ship to and what projects do we ship to, those are projects where we are very well positioned. So customers actually indicate to us much more when they need the machine. So our shipment planning with our customers, in that sense, is more important than the orders. Once we know that we are designed into that particular project, that new fab, that we know that we will get the orders. And then it just depends, like Wolfgang pointed out, on the timing of that 1 or 2, 3 customers putting the orders in for that one particular project. It doesn't say anything about their, let's say, desire to receive those tools, those -- you could say that the orders -- we said this, I think, before on the earlier calls, at the end of an administrative process. It's not so much an indication of the willingness of a customer to put capital forward to make sure that it can fuel the next generation of device shrinks because that's what they're doing. When you talk about DRAM, there is no new capacity being built. The 25% bit growth is simply technology transition that will happen. NAND at the same thing, that we have a few big NAND projects, one particular one that is taking new machines. They need to support 40% bit growth, which will be about 100,000 wafer starts. That needs to happen. So the order patterns could be disconnected from what we call the shipment planning and the shipment patterns.",275

Wennink,,Executives,29,"On the upside, I would say, like I said in -- as an answer to an earlier question, we have not detailed a monthly or weekly insight into development process and the development progress that certain of our customers have and especially when you talk about leading-edge logic. Now if they have some breakthroughs, they will put things in because they know -- on an earlier question, I think it was John, saying, what's the time that they need? They need about 9 months to -- or just 6 months of our production time and then about 1 quarter of installation and ramp-up. So if they have breakthroughs, they will come earlier. That is upside. Like I said earlier, we need 300,000 wafer starts with this node, which is the -- it's the 2-phase node, the 20-nanometer and then the 14-, 16-nanometer FinFET. So that 300,000 will happen, just a matter of when. And that's why I said that, no, the latest we are seeing are fully for 2 quarters. And so that's upside. Downside, well, I need to think a bit harder. The logic would basically scrubbed, you could say. DRAM is obvious. DRAM market is healthy. There's no overcapacity there. There's no square meters being added. There's a lot of technology. We have the NAND situation, the 3D NAND, which, by the way, could be upside. It's not downside because if 3D NAND is introduced a bit later, then the 40% bit growth needs to be fueled by capacity additions and would be planar. Now planar also uses leading-edge immersion tools, but they are much more loaded with the Holistic Lithography option. So the average selling price would be a lot higher. So I think that's basically how we look at it. I think we have scrubbed in our internal analysis the logic segment for the, let me say, later ramp-up of the 14- and 16-nanometer node. And the others, I don't see a lot of downside. And that's why Wolfgang said, 2014 looks like it will be very solid year.",343

I was just wondering whether there's been a change in tone from your customers around EUV development process over the last quarter or so. Peter, you've highlighted the accelerating shrink and the pressure on the industry and some of the difficulties that some of them are having. But is that causing a change in turn from them where, say, before they may have said, ""Well, we think we can do a bit more with multipass patterning."" Now they're acknowledging that EUV is perhaps even more critical than they had previously thought? And how would you therefore characterize the timing of any decision on their part? What is their -- sort of the current level of flexibility they've got in terms of the timing for insertion at 10-nanometer? It's sort of it -- with the tool development track, it keeps slipping out a little bit or they are giving themselves more flexibility to get there? What's the latest on that front?",165

Wennink,,Executives,34,"I think it is the latter, what you said. I think they are creating more flexibility for themselves to do EUV introduction. And that will be driven by, let's say, a certain level of wafer-per-day productivity, which is driven by power and availability of the tool. That will be the point where -- that will be their main focus. But you are correct. I think if you -- which, by the way, the issue that we're currently seeing with our potential delays, I would say, in shipment pattern for leading-edge logic is driven by the fact that -- I need to remind you all that by the fact that this roadmap capacity ramp was the most aggressive that we've ever seen. So we're seeing just an adjustment of the timing of this ramp, which brings it back to, I would say, more normal patterns. So this is the main reason why we have to adjust, let's say, the initial planning that we have. But on EUV, you're absolutely correct. I mean, what we notice and what we hear from all the customers is that the challenges with multipass patterning are indeed very, very high and that one of the main reasons while they won't introduce EUV is not so much because of cost. The cost impact will be limited. We talked in logic, for instance, about a few layers, 1 or 2 layers. But it is more about the process simplification. It makes the process more simple. And that's the main focus that our customers are currently having, and that, of course, helps. So when we reach those, let's say, 500 wafer-per-day targets, and we're getting close to it, then I'm pretty convinced that those customers will make those choices because the benefits are clear.",295

And just a very quick follow-up if I may. You have shifted the focus of the EUV metrics from power and wafers per hour to wafers per day over the last quarter or so. The prior targets that you'd set, say, 70 wafers per hour during the back half of this year, 125 wafers per hour next year in terms of the peak throughput, are those still sort of intact and analogous to the wafer-per-day targets that you're now referring to?

I don't think there's going to be any delay. It is not a follow-on. I think what we're currently seeing is that the 16- -- the, sorry, 10-nanometer is needed in the course of 2016, '17. So we are still more than 2 years we have left for the 14- and 16-nanometer rollout, which I think is sufficient time. And as a matter of fact, it looks like the normal Moore's Law heartbeat. So I don't think it has any impact. But what we are seeing as the -- that's the intensity with which customers do R&D on 10-nanometer, that is going up, and that's why there is so much interest for, now, EUV.

And then maybe a brief follow-up on NAND. So I think you previously said, 3D versus 2D, that the bay doesn't really impact the sort of lithography content per wafer. But I think you earlier said that you're now getting a bit more comfortable with sort of 2 different scenarios. And I'm just wondering, so which -- if you could maybe be a bit more specific, what you think now if you include the higher software and Holistic Litho content of one versus the other? What do you think roughly is the litho value in total terms, difference between 3D and 2D?",103

Wennink,,Executives,41,"Yes, I think that the litho difference is -- it is a bit difficult to quantify for the following reason. When you say we do at 3D, you could probably go for the NXT:1965, which is a -- let's say, a somewhat lower-priced tool, which is more cost-effective, but it has a lower throughput. So when you say you go to 2D, you need the 1970C with all the Holistic Litho options on there, but it is a higher throughput, so you need fewer of it. I would think as a gut feel that it doesn't make a huge difference. Plus, it is important because it means that the composition of what we need to deliver is, of course, different. It also means, from a production planning point of view, it's a bit different. And from an ASP point of view, it is also different. 2D requires higher ASP tools but also less bit because the 1970C is a higher productivity tool. It's about 10% to 15% more productive. And that gives you an indication of the number of tools, given the fact that the wafers' output requirement is probably the same that the number of tools on 2D might be less than on 3D.",205

Wennink,,Executives,46,"Yes, I think it's a very good question, Mehdi. I think in general, the economics are not favorable for our customers while you go to 20, 16 and 14. I think the cost per wafer from a lithography point of view will go up. There's no discussion there. And in a sense, you could say that is a bit different from the previous nodes where we were still able to follow, let's say, the cost-per-wafer reduction roadmap that they had. Now you need to realize that, I would say, the 20-, 16-, 14-nanometer node is kind of a bridge node from a lithography point of view. I mean, we are about 2 years late with EUV. So clearly, this wafer -- the cost-per-wafer economics are being impacted by the fact that we have to do so much pass patterning. Not only I think from a CapEx point of view but probably also from a yield point of view, and that's why the focus of customers is on the introduction of EUV, in any case, at 10. And that is the game-changer again. Or you could say that's the change to bring us back on the cost-per-function or cost-per-wafer roadmap as we originally planned. And of course, we're trying to help the customers with this economic issue on the cost per wafer by increasing the throughput. The NXT:1970C has a record throughput with the capability to give our customers maximum, let's say, control over their process in Holistic Lithography product portfolio. So yield management plus productivity is something that we have added to our product portfolio to compensate for what is obvious, an increase in the cost per wafer, which can only come down after we have introduced EUV.",288

I think the number of exposures, it depends a bit on the architectures of our customers. But in general, you could say that in a critical layer on 10-nanometer, that it is normally a 2D layer that has to turn into a 3D layer, so -- which means one, let's say, EUV layer would then be replaced by 2 or 3 immersion layers. And with every layer needs multipass, so it could vary from 7 to 9 immersion passes for that 1 layer, which you then -- of course, if you had a full, you can do 2 things. If you have this multipass 3D immersion design for the critical layer, which would -- like I said, 7 to 9 passes, if you would replace that with EUV, then you could -- and you would not change your architecture, just use the 3D architecture, but you -- then just replace multiple immersion passes with one EUV pass, you can bring it down to 2 or 3 EUV passes. That's one solution. You could also say, ""Now I'm going to have a different design,"" which actually takes benefit of the full EUV capability, which actually brings the exposure down to one pass, which is the only EUV pass. So you can see how the economics then quickly turn in favor of EUV. But clearly, that's why customers are very interested in us showing the capability of 70 and 125 wafers per hour, that once you're at that productivity level, then clearly the economics of EUV kick in. And also gives them a lot of simplicity back because if you can imagine, a 3D multipass deep UV immersion layer is highly complex.",281

Now so we have MOPA PrePulse now on the 3300, which are the tools that are being shipped to the customer, connected to the scanner, whereby we have done the first round of upgrades, bringing us the level of power and availability that at least gives our customers the requirements for the current R&D development.

And could this actually feature in Q4? Or do we -- should we just be thinking about overall heart [ph] on our full year revenues with this -- expectations with this particular figure?",121

You said maybe customers could have a breakthrough to get upside. But it sounds like you have high conditions that demand does pick up within the next few quarters. So I'm just wondering how severe the technology challenges that you're seeing are in that 16-, 14-nanometer FinFET node?",78

Wennink,,Executives,90,"I mean, we don't see that to the level that would make us expert on the subject. Those are the customers. But we see the behavior where, of course, customers say, ""Hey, this could be a few quarters later."" So this is what we are reporting to you, that we actually see that as a result. But I think in general, what we are seeing is a innovating desire and push from our customers to keep shrinking. And that means that if you look at what they tell us and we look at certain assumptions on the growth of the end market, the 300,000 wafer starts for this node, which is this 2-phase node, 20-nanometer and then, let's say, the FinFET node, is a very realistic number. And whether that happens, let's say, in 20 months or in 26 months, it doesn't really matter. I mean, so this is where our confidence comes from, that we believe in the discussion we have with our customers. And they are going to solve any issue that they currently have, which I believe is largely driven by the fact that they are speeding up the shrink roadmap to such a point where they're putting so much strain on their own resources and that it is inevitable that from time to time, you will see some of those pushouts, which basically brings this node ramp back to what it should be. So we have seen -- I repeat it again, the beginning of this node was the fastest ramp we've ever seen. It just goes back to our normal heartbeat.",266

But it's -- but the general comment I would like to make, I mean, we've been talking a lot about what people call pushouts. I would call it going back to the regular Moore's Law heartbeat, the regular ramp, because this 2-phase 20-nanometer FinFET ramp was the fastest we've ever seen. Now if you see an adjustment of that timing, which is good because if it would not be an adjustment, everything would have been pushed and pulled into 2014, yes, which actually would mean that, that node would have been the fastest ramp, and the 300,000 wafer start would have been installed, let's say, first half of 2015, yes? Now if we now go back to a more normal pattern of ramp, then 2015, we just see the result of the rollout of the FinFET solutions, together with the mobile rollout of, I think, the capacity additions that we need to see in NAND and the further technology transitions in DRAM. So I think what you're seeing today levels out, yes? The -- let's say, the capacity ramp over the years 2014 and not, as the expectation was, the emphasis on 2014 only. I think that is a qualitative answer, but I cannot help you more than with this.",244

Our Q2 revenue was in line with our guidance of EUR 1.6 billion and was largely driven, again, by sales to our memory customers, which represented about 1/2 of our systems revenue. As anticipated, we recognized revenue for one EUV system during the quarter. The ASPs of all tools sold increased dramatically from EUR 26 million last quarter to EUR 40 million this quarter, reflecting strong demand for our most advanced immersion tools combined with leading-edge Holistic Lithography solutions in both the memory and the logic markets. Service and field option sales grew by about 10% quarter-over-quarter to EUR 401 million.
Gross margin came in above guidance at 45.7%, positively impacted by a favorable customer sector and product mix and the higher contribution of service and field option products. With R&D in line with our estimates and SG&A slightly better than our estimates, gross margin was the main driver that enabled our quarterly earnings to exceed street expectation.
Regarding our balance sheet, we ended Q2 with approximately EUR 2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During Q2, we bought back 2.6 million shares for a total of EUR 164 million. From the beginning of 2013 through the end of Q2, we have purchased 9.5 million shares for a total of EUR 611 million, leaving approximately EUR 390 million under our current buyback program to be executed in the second half of 2014. On May 13, we paid our shareholders a record dividend of EUR 0.61 per ordinary share for a total of EUR 268 million.
Turning to our order book. System bookings in Q2 were roughly equivalent to bookings in Q1, leaving our order backlog at the end of Q2 at approximately EUR 1.8 billion, excluding EUV. With that, I would like to discuss our expectations for Q3 and for our Q4.
Let me start with a view of the markets we serve. Both year-to-date revenue and last quarter's bookings demonstrate continued strength in memory. We expect memory strength to continue throughout the second half of the year, driven by planar NAND and DRAM.
In IDM, we expect strong year-over-year revenue growth. 2014 year-to-date IDM revenue already exceeds the prior year's total revenue, and we have solid backlog for the second half of the year.
In foundry, we are experiencing upside demand for 28-nanometer capacity but a slower-than-anticipated ramp of the 16- and 14-nanometer nodes. We saw growing foundry sales in Q2 versus Q1, and our Q1 ending backlog is moderately higher than the quarter before. However, although the industry's view of an eventual 300,000 wafer starts per month, in total, for 20-, 16- and 14-nanometer combined node capacity remains intact, we see widely different behaviors of our foundry customers as they are evaluating the timing of the capacity ramp. Some are currently adding leading-edge lithography equipment in support of capacity installations. Some are digesting already delivered equipment, while others appear to be reconsidering advanced node ramp plans. In addition, we have some customers with EUV orders in place, requesting that we upgrade their NXE:3300 to production-specified NXE:3350 before shipment, which will require a rescheduling of deliveries in June 2015. As a result of an overall weakening of near-term foundry demand for the 16- and 14-nanometer FinFET node ramps and with the upgrade plan and associated reschedule of delivery of 3 NXE:3300, we maintain our prior Q3 guidance of about EUR 1.4 billion and now see a total year revenue of about EUR 5.6 billion, including 5 EUV systems.
Our long-term view on semiconductor demand remains unchanged. We expect gross margin for Q3 to be around 42%, including 2 EUV systems. We are seeing a bit of near-term variability in gross margin, not only due to the recognizable between product mix, but also the likely impact between sector mix as the more highly configured foundry immersion tools, for example, carry a higher value than the more lightly configured memory tools. Over the longer term, however, we remain confident that the gross margin trend will continue upward. Strength in service and field options revenues will help support this trend. R&D expenses for the third quarter will be about EUR 260 million. Other income, with contributions from participants of the Customer Co-Investment Program, will be about EUR 20 million. For SG&A, we expect approximately EUR 80 million for the third quarter.
With that, I would like to return it back to Peter.",738

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. I'd like to take a brief moment to review the status of the 3 trends that we also discussed in the last quarter.
Wolfgang has highlighted the current landscape and near-term uncertainty in finding of leading-edge capacity additions in the foundry space. Such uncertainties are not uncommon at the beginning of new, complex and challenging node transitions, especially since these transitions, over the last 4 years, have been the most aggressive in history. These uncertainties might be exaggerated by the current competitive environment and by a consolidating foundry customer base at advanced nodes, which brings a specific and relatively new dynamic to this industry segment. We have witnessed the move to the 20-nanometer planar nodes from the 28-, 32-nanometer nodes and are now witnessing the broad-based introduction of the 3D gate architecture at foundries specifically used for the 14- and 16-nanometer FinFET device. As mentioned, we are currently in the phase, where the timing and rate of the production ramps for these most advanced nodes is being assessed. And by the way, both of these -- both of the transitions require about a 60% increase in lithography tool investment.
Secondly, we have seen the introduction and initial ramp of vertical NAND, which requires about 10% more lithography investment per wafer start. With vertical NAND, bit density is achieved through vertical transition stacking as the successor to the current planar floating-gate architecture. As is the case in logic, these technology transitions are complex and is, therefore, not surprising that a pause of vertical NAND capacity buildup is occurring until the time that these technologies can be developed to a point where they are cost-competitive with current and future planar nodes. In fact, given near-term vertical NAND manufacturing and cost challenges, we see that our customers are considering an extension of their planar NAND roadmaps, actively pursuing possibilities of further shrinks. In the meantime, we remain confident that bit demand growth in 2014 of about 40% in the NAND segments will be met by continued node shrinks and wafer capacity additions. For DRAM, DRAM bit supply is expected to meet demand in the mid-20% range, driven by technology node transitions only, where lithography process intensity rises, again, about 10% with each node's transition and with the move to mobile DRAM.
And lastly, I want to repeat that we strongly believe that the scaling and the related near-term technology challenges in logic and memory, explained in the previous trend discussion, create an increasing need for EUV in order to continue the cost-effective scaling that has driven this industry for the last 50 years. Our lithography cost modeling continues to show that EUV can drive down critical layer imaging cost to reduce spend on patterning-related deposition and edge and its associated cost for [indiscernible] space while reducing cycle time and, very likely, improving yields that come along with process simplicity. Today, our NXE:3300 EUV systems are supplying customers with a 200 wafer per day processing capability, which is being used in the current process development phase for 7- and 10-nanometer logic. Given recent source progress, we feel very confident that we will be able to meet the 500 average wafer per day requirement by the end of this year as our customers move towards production qualification. This, in turn, forms the basis for our belief that we will be able to support our customers with an average of 1,500 wafers per day for high-volume production in 2016. Naturally, we remain fully engaged in EUV insertion planning discussions with our customers. And given the progress of the EUV exposure systems, our customers' interactions show that they are increasingly turning their focus also to the state of maturity of the EUV infrastructure. Discussions with photoresist manufacturers, mass blank producers, mass defect inspection suppliers, indicate that near-term capability or solutions do exist but that further development in these areas is needed for future industrialization.
We believe that the long-term need for EUV remains unabated, but we also keep focusing on our overall product strategy to the broadest industry needs, covering the most competitive dry and immersion solutions. We continue to improve immersion systems performance to meet the needs of today's most complex single and multi-pass patterning. That means, firstly, that TWINSCAN NXT:1970C continues to ramp with 22 systems in our backlog, underscoring a high level of customer acceptance and rapid adoption of all applications; and secondly, TWINSCAN productivity continues to set new records with our NXT:1950 immersion system, having processed more than 5,200 wafers in a single day, while another NXT:1960 has imaged more than 1.5 million wafers in a 1-year period. We've also started to ship our next-generation integrated metrology system, the YieldStar 250D with Holistic Lithography feedback loops, having demonstrated significant improvement in inter-field critical dimension uniformity, focus uniformity and on-product overlay in support of 14-nanometer logic and 20-nanometer DRAM.

What kind of baseline units should we -- are you thinking about for 2015 EUV and kind of what are the assumptions that are going into that?",67
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2014 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2014",2014-07-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3724.0,658480.0,29298812.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,8,"Yes. That's a good question. Let me first remind you that the next 2 years are depending on, let's say, the EUV insertion for 10-nanometer and for the usage in DRAM. What we have looked at -- and this is how we have built our internal capacity, is that we put into our models that next year, we could see 12 to 15 tools if 2 customers insert EUV in production in logic and one DRAM player mix that makes that same move. So that will give us 12 to 15 units. This is still the plan of record, which is how we are steering our supply chain and how we have built our capacity. Now if you have a question and, say, ""What if that doesn't happen? And if customers would basically decide to postpone insertion in both logic and in DRAM for 1 year later, for instance, then what would that be?"" We and our customers actually believe that we will see EUV shipments next year because of learning. EUV will be absolutely necessary at 7-nanometer, and if you would not do any learning in the 10-nanometer -- 9 frame, then it will be a steep hill to climb, a very steep hill. So we estimate, and also based on discussions with customers, that if the customers would not choose to insert EUV in production in logic and in DRAM but only for learning, we would look at about half the volume that I just mentioned, the 12 to 15. So it's half of that number, but that also means that for 7-nanometers, it's absolutely necessary, everything that we see and we hear today. And that means that we continue to plan 40 to 60 units per year once we have full insertion on 7-nanometer and DRAM. But not only on 7-nanometer, but also, we have to think about microprocessors at that time. So 40 to 60 units will then still stay. But the question is, ""Are they going for production insertion on 10 and on DRAM,"" or ""Are they going for shipments to actually make sure that they can put EUV into learning in production?"" Is that a clear answer, John?",364

That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, Peter, clearly, it didn't show up in either the June quarter ASP trends or gross margin trends, but one of the things coming out of SEMICON West last week was maybe the fact that Nikon might have some evals [ph] tools shipping on immersion in the back half of the year. I'm just wondering if you could spend a couple of seconds just kind of elaborating on what you think the competitive landscape on immersion looks like over the next kind of 12 to 18 months or -- and if what you're doing on Holistic Lithography is a big enough mote that even if Nikon becomes more active, you still feel comfortable about your position?",125

And in combination with Holistic Lithography, it is very clear that is a proposal that we can offer our customers in logic and in advanced memory production that nobody can match. So we feel very comfortable about the next 12 to 18 months. You mentioned SEMICON last week. SEMICON, last week, is, of course, clearly a forum where people present themselves and they have to -- and they do product introductions, and there are strong marketing-type statements. That's also how you need to actually look at it. I would look at the order flow, and I would look at who buys what. And you will see, going forward, that the choice for leading-edge immersion will definitely be falling on ASML.",156

I mean, for 2015, it's -- I think it's too early to give you a detailed guidance for 2015. It is clear, like we said in the introductory statement, that this capacity buildup of 14- and 16-nanometer FinFET is slower than we anticipated because it's more complex. And also, the foundry space is pretty heterogeneous. It is not that all foundry players are on the same level in terms of their decision making on what they want to do with their installed capacity or how they want to build out that capacity. As we said, we have customers that are actually digesting a strong capacity buildup of the last couple of quarters, customers that are building up that particular capacity, and customers that are clearly reevaluating with what speed they should go. Now looking at those reasons, it will be very difficult if it is difficult to assess and to gauge how the, let's say, technical complexities will be overcome and who will then move first also in the context of a, let's say, customer competitive environment for our foundries, which has also changed. You can understand it's a bit difficult to answer your question that this will snap back at that moment in time. 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer FinFET capacity, we believe, together with 20-nanometer planar, will need about 300,000 wafer starts. Now to actually assess when that will happen is a bit difficult, but it will happen over time.",241

Maybe just a quick question then about the laser source. We've heard from Gigaphoton, which is a competitor of Cymer, that they have a laser source for EUV, which is now working at 92 watts, or at least, that's what they claim. Maybe can you tell us where or how strong your EUV source is performing at the moment?",63

Wennink,,Executives,15,"Yes, that's a good comment. Basically, that comment on watt was where we were a couple of years ago. So the focus on watts -- if you don't have watts, you don't have lights, you don't have EUV. It's that simple. I would like you -- perhaps, also the listeners, to turn to Slide 21 on the -- in the presentation package, basically shows that power is only one of the elements that drives good wafers per day, and that's often what customers currently want. Your -- that particular 92 watts, we're, of course, very much aware of because, I mean, we have lost contact with them, and that has been shown for a very, very short period of time. You control seconds or, let's say, parts of a second. So that is just the capability, which is very, very, I would say, rudimentary, and that's where we were a couple of years ago. Now if you want a good wafers per day, look at Slide 21. Good wafers per day are driven by source power, by source availability and by the scanner, and it all needs to work together. Now the source power -- and you're talking about the source power, has 3 main components that drive good wafers per day, which is the laser power, and we talked about that; the conversion efficiency, how much EUV light can you get out of that laser and out of the EUV plasma; and the dose margin. Now those are 3 elements and only -- and that -- only that will determine -- 3 major elements that will determine the source power. They have source -- the source availability is driven by -- which, currently, is the most important part. It is driven by automation, collective protection, droplet generator reliability, the drive laser reliability. And it needs to work together with the scanner, where you can have the optical transmission improved; optimize the overhead, which is the waiting time; resist sensitivity; and then all together brings you good wafers per day. So when you talk about power, laser source, there is much, much more that ultimately determines what customers want. And that's -- you have to look at that particular comment from a bigger photon in that context.",377

Now you're saying that there's very little volume being added during the back half of this year, which makes sense, certainly, given the lead times and the struggles from the one customer who has tried to ramp it, but it also sounds like that customer is -- maybe worked through some of the key process issues, so -- yet, it sounds like you're sort of down-ticking on the overall 3D NAND ramp even looking out past the second half of this year. So maybe, can you go into a little more detail about that? I'm trying to fit those 2 comments.",111

Wennink,,Executives,18,"Well, of course, we're never going to talk about one specific customer. I think 3D NAND is relevant in the context of the NAND market in total. Now you just mentioned there are issues in terms of the complexity of the new production methodology and the architecture, which is normal when you are at the beginning of a new technology. But you have to look at what -- how many bits do we need next year. So if we need, next year, about mid-40% bits, that needs to be provided by the industry, and that means if it is -- if the ramp of 3D NAND is slower, it has to be taken up by something else, which is 2D planar. And when we listen to customers, in general, then several of our customers have actually announced 1 or even 2 generations of 2D planar devices for the next years. So it actually means that if you talk about 45% or, let's say, mid-40% bit growth next year, which is about 100,000 wafer starts capacity that needs to be added, whereby limited part will be through 3D NAND, a lot needs to go to 2D. And that actually coincides very well with the statements that many of our customers make, that they are planning 1 or 2 generations of 2D planar for the next few years.",226

And then, Peter, if I look at your performance relative to your peers, if you strip out service and EUV, it looks like you're going to be about flat year-over-year this year. On a wafer fab equipment market that's growing somewhat, it's debatable how much it's growing, but it's probably growing 10%, maybe 15%, this year. So it sort of implies that the intensity of litho of your core x EUV is actually going to decline this year. Is that just timing? And should that snap back next years? I mean, certainly, even if you strip out EUV, you'd think that, that snaps back next year, but I'm wondering why it's down this year.",115

Yes, a little bit of that is timing. If you remember, there were quite significant shipments at the end of 2013 to facilitate the initial capacity build-out of 20-nanometers. We have both always said that our revenues are not to be correlated with CapEx spending or other spending. Sometimes, it's higher. Sometimes, it's lower. And Peter said already, for '15, we do not have the visibility to guide specific numbers, but there are, certainly, certain trends there that make us feel confident. Talk about the EUV systems, 3350s carry a higher ASP than the 3300s. And depending on the volume shipped, the upgrade of the 3300s to 3350s are not for free either. Peter also mentioned logic. While we can't talk about the exact timing of the rollout of 16 and 14, in particular, we are certain, based on the discussion with our customers, that we'll get to the 300,000 wafer starts. And we estimate, by the end of this year, it's going to be about 120,000-ish that has been delivered. So that leads to quite a bit for '15 and the early part of '16, possibly. DRAM and NAND look promising. NAND is a pretty steady machine at 40% or so, bit growth and that with -- was 100k wafer start capacity expansion. So we're quite positive, overall. DRAM, we're planning in the mid-20s, but there's a lot of debate whether that could be a little bit higher as we also shift a little bit from PC DRAM to more mobile DRAM, which is more litho intensive. So overall, there's a good -- a couple of good catalysts in there but sufficient uncertainty that we can't give you an exact number there.",287

We are preparing, based on the discussions we've had with customers on the potential insertion of EUV next year on 10-nanometer and DRAM, that 2 of those customers in logic, one customer in DRAM. And it will be a limited number of layers, 1 or 2 layers will give us 12 to 15 units that they need -- that our simulation tells us. So we are preparing for this, which actually means that if they need it, they will have, somewhere in the second half of the year, to take that decision and tell us when they want those tools. So if it were more than 15 units, we're in trouble. We don't think that, based on the simulation and our discussions, that will be a lot more than those 3 customers, 1 DRAM, 1 or 2 logic, that will require a significant number of tools.

So we need to prepare either-or, and that means that we have some flexible arrangements made in the supply chain and also in our own work in our process to make sure that we have sufficient proper tooling for -- in the case that they need more immersion tools.",130

Wennink,,Executives,34,"I think when you look at the infrastructure, everything is in principle there because we are processing EUV wafers. So we have EUV masks. We do defect inspection. There is photoresist. So it's, in principle, all there. But when you go into industrialization and, yes -- and you need, for instance, a higher volume of photoresist, just to name one, that also means that quality control on bigger volumes of -- gallons of -- hundreds of gallons of that photoresist needs to actually happen, and that needs to be organized; same for mask blanks, where mask inspection can be done currently without the specific mask inspection tool that is warranted when we go into more EUV layers at N7. But for the meantime, we have solutions how we can do that. So -- but it's really the ramp to, what we call, industrialization, where you know that you need between 500 and 1,000 wafers per day, second half 2015, on a regular basis with the mass infrastructure there, the mass blanks there, the defect detection there, the photoresist there, which is currently more in a research state. So it's not one particular thing. It is the combination of all these things that need to be tackled one by one. There is not one sticking out that we feel is a major issue.",222

When we -- when customers shrink and the resolution is getting smaller and smaller and -- especially in the immersion space, but it will also be true in the EUV era. But you are seeing that from a mechanical point of view and from a machine control point of view. There are limits to how far we can push it. So when you talk about 6, 7, 8 passes, potentially 9 passes, on a critical layer on the N10, that means that we are -- there are boundaries to which you can control the machine. So you need that software. And actually, that software, the 250D, the YieldStar 250D, is particularly important for us because it is the focus on overlay focus and that uniformity throughout the wafer that is bringing our customers the possibilities to control yield because as you can imagine, if you have to do 9 passes for one particular layer that -- you need to be very, very close to your targets because every task gives you a small variation, and times 9, it goes very, very fast. So that's why the importance of metrology and the improved performance of the 250D in terms of uniformity and overlay becomes a very important element and an integral part of the whole lithography solution. So that's not going down. It will go up in terms of significance. And with EUV, with resolutions going down, it's going to be the same. The smaller the resolution, the more metrology we actually need.",253

I mean, our gross margin is, obviously, impacted by numerous things. Overall, the trend of our gross margin of our business is up. To give you a flavor, if you would add the first 2 quarters and add the guidance for the third quarter, we're somewhere between 43.5% and 44%. The last full year was 41.5%. So our margin trend is up, and that's aided by the most advanced immersion tools. The product mix is also aided by service and Holistic Lithography. Margins are negatively impacted for now. Based on EUV tools that we're shipping, you're absolutely right. Q3, when we recognize tools -- 2 tools versus one in prior quarters, that has an impact somewhere around 2% or so. So that's one impact. The other one is the mix of products but also the mix of type of customers that we ship to because memory tool is differently configured than the logic tool, for instance. And if you look at last quarter, Q2, it was an exceptional quarter. So the ASP went up from EUR 26 million to EUR 40 million. We're not forecasting quite that high of an ASP in Q3. So we have a bit of an impact there. Another impact is if your overall revenue goes down quarter-over-quarter, we have some fixed costs in the business. So the coverage goes down a little bit, and there's a little bit of cost of under-absorption. So those are some of the impacts. As it relates to the 3300s, they will become 3350s. I think I mentioned in the prior question, we will charge for that upgrade, and that will not make the situation worse. It will make it a little bit better.",291

And I guess -- forgive my multipart question. But first, in terms of the delay, can you talk about what's driving it in terms of complexity versus demand visibility versus maybe some of the volatility related around the strategic alliance between GF and Samsung? And then as part of that, can you share what kind of capacity will have been added exiting calendar '14 as part of the 300,000 wafer starts that you've highlighted as the likely outcome? And then finally, with this push on 20 and below, what does that mean for backfill for, perhaps, increased demand for 28-nanometer equipment?",118

The expected -- I think Wolfgang added. I think with our current shipment pattern, we believe that we'll be around 120,000 wafer starts on the 20/16/14-nanometer node, so out of the 300,000. So we're less than halfway. And the reason -- to do on -- dig deeper, what is the main reason, whether it's the complexity, it's more difficult, whether it's the end demand, whether it's the competitive situation and choices that, perhaps, the company needs to make, it's very difficult for us to figure that out, what it is. We know that definitely, it's difficult. We know also that there is a competitive situation that, of course, we're not part of because it's something that's between our customers and their customers. How it is played, we don't know. So to answer your question, I cannot give you that color. It could be all of it. It could be 1 or 2 -- made of -- 1 or 2 of those reasons driving it, we don't know. Whether it's the -- your last part of the question was whether the delay in the sub-20 is going to have an impact on 28, I think it's disconnected. You're asking basically whether customers are reverting back to 28 instead of sub-20. I don't think that's the case. We are seeing that the 28-nanometer node is a strong node. We've always said it so that it will be about a 300,000 wafer start node. We are currently focusing -- I think we have installed 270,000 to 280,000. So we still can see some capacity additions in that space. We also see second-tier foundries now adding 28-nanometer capacity in other places than the traditional wheels would be. So yes, I think 28-nanometer is going to be a strong node, but I think it's independent of the sub-20-nanometer delay.",305

And if I could just ask a follow-up, in terms of gross margin trajectory into 2015 and trying to not put in an assumption around unit volumes, but I would assume clearly up, how should we think about, I guess, the moving parts there in terms of EUV and then, I guess, the final 10% coming in at a higher-margin Holistic Lithography increasing? It moved to your higher ASP tool set on the immersion side. Can you provide some granularity on how we should think about the trajectory into 2015?",92

I'll take a crack at it. I mean, again, like we said, our long-term views on margins are up. If we are somewhere in the 43-ish range, 44-ish range this year -- and that came from 41.5. We have said before that in a 3-, 4-year time frame, once EUV is mature, we'll be in a situation where we could be closer to 50%. And what are the drivers for that? First of all, of course, EUV provides no gross margin at all right now. We said the 3350, which we are starting to ship next year, will get somewhere close to 20% or so. And then it will take us, based on our experience curve, like 2 years or so, to get it somewhere in the 40% range. So that's, obviously, a big contributor to this. Holistic Lithography is -- we always said it's like 75% of the software business, and then 25% of the YieldStar is a hardware business, but blended margin in -- for those solutions, based on the value they provide, is somewhere in the 75% to 85% range, and that part of the business is growing faster than the overall revenue. That contributes as well. So where is '15 going to be? If we can't tell the revenue, it's going to be really hard to tell the margin. But over the next 3 or 4 years, I think we'll be progressing on that trajectory.",240

Just in terms of to the progress that you've made in the quarter, moving from 100 wafers per day, the last time we spoke on this call, to 200 wafers per day at the moment, can you give a bit more detail around the factors that have driven that? I mean, you've highlighted Slide 21 in the deck in terms of source power, system availability and the scanner, but just in terms of what's got you to add initial doubling in productivity in the quarter and then in terms of how -- what we should be looking for in terms of the further upgrade packages coming later this year.",119

I think when you look at the 200 wafers per day that we have achieved in the second quarter, it was the result of, let's say, a planned upgrade, yes. And the upgrade was done by the end of Q1, really resulting into -- in what we talked about today, which is the doubling of the productivity. So you could say that the upgrade package that we executed delivered according to plan, which is always good, and it was basically a combination of automation, those -- yes, I would say, the source availability, the stability of the source power, the combination of the 2. When you go to the 500 wafers per day, so going to Slide 21, you could say it's the left upper hand and right upper hand of the circle, that was basically where the improvements were. That will continue in the second half of the year, but the focus will be on the so-called availability packages, which will be on the right-hand side. So it's source availability, but also the optimization of the overhead because once you have now a system that works together, the source works together with the scanner, you need to optimize the so-called waiting times. There are waiting times when the scanner is not completely ready to receive the EUV, like those are all software issues. And then automation, that overhead automation, is also part of the availability program. Next to that, we have -- for the 3350, we have some better optical transmission, which will help next year to move it beyond 500. So I would say it's the right-hand side of that circle. It's the automation. It's the drive laser reliability, the overhead optimization that will be the main contributor for the availability packages that we're going to roll out in the second half of the year, bringing us to this 500 wafers per day.",316

I think it is basically driven by our ability to show the 500 wafers per day, the upgrades on the productivity. I think from a -- let's say, a lithography point of view, a resolution point of view, from a EUV performance point of view, there is no doubt that they need this. It is about how certain can we plan the availability of the EUV machine to start production. And from that point of view, you could say -- when you look at the cost focus that DRAM has versus logic, you could say that cost focus would be a bit higher in DRAM because the prices are lower, but it this driven by availability.

Last 4 years, we grew it by 15% every single year. And then the balance between the cash that we have in the bank and the minimum cash balance we'll spend on investments and our own shares over '13, '14, that's likely going to be EUR 1 billion.

You'll get a little bit of an idea that memory continues to be strong, 36%. And then IDM, I talked about this in my prepared remarks, we see a strong year there. And you see the backlog there, 24% of our backlog. And then foundry is 40% of the backlog, and we'll take orders that support our outlook.

Then -- and a follow-up. If I look at your revenues, you had an excellent growth in IDM revenues, significantly on memory. But foundry is down for 2 years in a row, and it's actually down pretty significantly. You have to go back to 2010 to get to these levels. I'm trying to reconcile the fact at 20-nanometer, the last couple of years have been a lot of 20-nanometer shipment, and your capital intensity of 20-nanometer is going up significantly, yet your performance in foundry seems to be trailing your competitors in -- or not competitors, your peers in other segments, like deposition edge.

Given the fact that our tools are EUR 50 million each, there's a difference of EUR 100 million. It's 2 tools. I think we've seen very strong logic demand of foundry demand the last 3 years. We've seen the most aggressive node-to-node transition from 28- to 20- to 14-, 16- and now at 10-nanometer R&D. It's -- we are seeing -- for all the reasons that we talked about in this call, we are seeing a slowdown. I think everybody will see this.

Our Q3 revenue was slightly lower than anticipated at EUR 1.32 billion due to the shift of a couple of systems into Q4. Q3 sales were largely driven by foundry customers, representing 50% of our system revenues versus the prior quarter, which was driven by system sales to memory customers. As anticipated, we recognized revenue for 2 EUV systems during the quarter. 
Our ASP came in at EUR 29.5 million versus EUR 40.1 million last quarter, which was driven by high KrF and i-Line content in our product mix. Service and field option sales grew again by about 10% over last quarter to EUR 438 million, which was driven by a number of high-value system performance-enhancing options. 
Gross margin came in solidly at 43.7% compared to our guidance of approximately 42%. Product mix, record options and service sales as well as cost control enabled this overachievement. 
R&D expenses were in line with our guidance, and SG&A expenses were slightly below our expectations. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3, we maintained approximately EUR 2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During Q3, we bought back 2.3 million shares for a total of EUR 165 million. Since the beginning of our program in 2013, we have now purchased 11.8 million shares through the end of Q3 for a total of EUR 776 million, leaving us EUR 224 million buyback authority under our current program ending in December of 2014. 
Regarding the order book. System bookings were strong at EUR 1.4 billion. 75% of bookings came from the memory sector, increasing our overall backlog by approximately 40% to EUR 2.4 billion, excluding EUV. Our systems backlog is now skewed in favor of the memory sector. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for Q4 and share our initial views on the start of 2015. The strong memory bookings during our last quarter demonstrate a continued strength in this area, with DRAM taking a prominent position as this sector plans for capacity expansions in 2015 to offset capacity consumed by growing process complexity that comes with node shrinks. NAND customers are expected to continue to execute their planar shrink road maps and capacity additions to meet expected steady bit growth demand in 2015. There are no clear capacity add plans for 3D NAND. 
With Q3 shipment strength, foundry continues the buildup of 20-, 16- and 14-nanometer capacity through the end of this year. The timing and volume of the continued buildup of this node in 2015 appears now to be dependent on key business allocations by our customers' customers. Our estimates show that by the end of this calendar year, about 175,000 wafer starts per month of 20-, 16- and 14-nanometer capacity will have cumulatively shipped. Please remember that it takes approximately 6 months for this capacity to turn into a real wafer output. The final capacity for the 20-, 16-  and 14-nanometer node will ultimately depend on end demand and the timing of the introduction of 10 nanometers. 
In addition to the expansion of 20-, 16- and 14-nanometer capacity in 2015, we expect some additional shipment for the 28-nanometer node, as demand appears to continue to be growing for these processors. We also expect some early pilot system shipments for 10 nanometers in 2015. 
For Q4 of this year, we expect total revenues of around EUR 1.3 billion, which will make our full year revenue at least EUR 5.6 billion. During Q4, we expect revenue recognition for 1 EUV system. Strength in service and field options revenues will continue, and we expect revenues in the low EUR 500 million -- EUR 400 million range for the next few quarters. We expect gross margins for Q4 to be around 43%. This was -- would result in full year gross margin of around 44%, a significant increase versus the prior year. 
R&D expenses for the fourth quarter will again be about EUR 260 million, while our target of EUR 250 million per quarter in 2015 remains intact. 
SG&A is expected at about EUR 80 million in Q4. We expect other income of approximately EUR 20 million, largely consisting of contributions from our Customer Co-Investment Program. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",718

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Wolfgang. I'd like to take a brief moment to review current sector trends further in relation to what we saw last quarter. 
Wolfgang has highlighted the current landscape and our near-term view of 2015. In summary, we expect the memory business to do well, especially in the first half of 2015. 
With respect to our logic business. We have to deal with the level of unclarity around the geographical spread and the timing of leading-edge capacity additions. In our view, this is caused by the current competitive environment in the space and by a more diverse foundry customer base at the advanced nodes, which brings a specific and relatively new dynamic to this industry segment. 
With significant large pieces of such leading-edge business apparently yet to be awarded to our customers, these uncertainties should come as no surprise. 
On the other hand, the 28-nanometer node capacity appears to be tighter than expected, as demand continues to grow for this node. We still see capacity growing in this area as a broader base of foundry players is making their 28-nanometer process technology available. 
On top of this strength, the fast pace of development of new processes continues. At least 1 customer is accelerating their 10-nanometer process development in an attempt to gain competitive advantage, and this is a positive for ASML. As movements to and capacity builds off, these advanced nodes are more lithography-intensive. 
As mentioned, the memory sector appears to remain quite healthy, with bit demand trending at around 25% in DRAM and 40% in NAND into 2015. Technology node transitions continue to address most, if not all, of the bit supply in DRAM. However, lack of capacity additions in recent years, in light of more complex processes and larger die, have reduced the installed wafer out capacity below a critical limit. And in that light, it makes sense that some capacity additions are warranted and are expected to happen in 2015, which is evidenced by the announcement of new fabs in the DRAM space. The first of these fabs taking delivery of new capacity tools in the first half of 2015. 
Now we see our NAND customers extending their planar NAND shrink road maps in light of apparent challenges in bringing the new 3D NAND architectures to market in high volume. We, therefore, do not expect any significant wafer capacity expansions in 3D NAND, however, we do expect continued planar NAND shrinks, plus an addition of about 100,000 wafer starts per month to grow bit supply to the expected 40% demand. 
As mentioned last quarter and the quarters before, I want to repeat that we strongly believe that the scaling and related near-term technology challenges in logic and memory create an increasing need for EUV in order to continue the cost-effective scaling that has driven this industry for the last 50 years. Our lithography cost modeling continues to show that EUV can drive down imaging cost of critical layers and then will, very likely, also improve yields as a result of greater process simplicity. Additionally, cost reductions are also driven by reducing the number of other process steps, positively affecting its associated cost for cleanroom space, while reducing rework and cycle time. 
And as to our EUV progress. We reported last quarter that we were able to supply customers with a 200-wafer per day EUV capability. Now with all systems in the field upgraded to the latest source configuration, we are moving that to 500-plus wafers per day capability, which has been demonstrated at 2 customer sites, and we are executing on our programs to reproduce this at the additional sites over several day runs to meet our targets by the end of 2014. 
Current demonstrated performance, along with significant progress on multiple fronts of our wafer per day program further boosts our confidence in meeting our 1,500 wafers per day target for EUV production in 2016. And given this EUV progress, we continue working with 1 customer towards a mid-node insertion at 10-nanometer logic node in late 2016, which will require shipments of our productions specified NXE:3350 starting mid-2015. 
In addition, we are discussing shipment planning of NXE:3350s with other key customers. These will be used for initial learning in a manufacturing environment, which will allow additional time and EUV system availability to support further buildout of the EUV infrastructure, also requiring shipments starting in the second half of 2015. 
Given these combined scenarios, we expect to ship around 6 NXE:3350 systems in 2015, on top of the NXE -- 3 NXE:3300 systems which, as we discussed last quarter, will be upgraded to an NXE:3350-like configuration. Timing of revenue recognition of these systems will be determined based upon final terms and conditions of the commercial agreements that we are currently discussing with our customers. 
On top of our significant focus on EUV, our overall product strategy is matched to the broadest industry needs by delivering the most competitive dry and immersion solutions possible to meet the needs of today's most complex single and multipass patterning. First, we have now shipped 42 of the TWINSCAN NXT:1970, which marks our fastest ramp of any new product ever and indicates high customer recognition of the value offered by these scanners. Additionally, and in support of our continued focus on bringing even more value to our customers, a TWINSCAN system operating at a memory customer imaged more than 1.5 million wafers in a 1-year period, becoming the second system to do so. And secondly, with 11 YieldStar 250D systems shipped in the third quarter, we're now supplying a CD and overlay metrology solutions to all key logic and memory customers. Our independent metrology solution, which substantially shortens metrology cycle times and enhances manufacturing yields through feedback loops, was released this quarter to high-volume manufacturing at a large foundry. 
So in summary, memory sector remains healthy, and node shrink unlimited capacity additions are planned to grow bit output to the required demand levels in 2015. Logic demand continues to grow with the 28-nanometer node, while increased competition at the 20-, 16- and 14-nanometer node is creating some uncertainty about the timing and geographical allocation of the capacity ramp for this node as we enter into 2015. 
EUV performance improvements are moving EUV closer to production insertion, with manufacturing learning being the logical next step for our most advanced customers. 
And finally, our continued focus on the broad spectrum of lithography solutions required by the industry for both wet and dry solutions is creating ever more value in imaging and process control solutions. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",1101

Will this recognition occur when you -- when the customer starts shipping actual production wafers in 2016 or you could even have recognition in 2015 itself?",87

Wennink,,Executives,8,"Thank you, Sandeep, for asking 2 questions. With respect to the shipments in 2015, these are the shipments that we talked about. So you asked a question about the orders for production systems that we could receive in 2015. I would say, yes, we are planning to receive orders in 2015 for shipment in 2016. So like we said in the introductory statements, with 1 customer, we are planning a mid-node insertion on the 10-nanometer logic node. And that is an insertion in late 2016, but the first shipments to support that would then start in the second half or, let's say, mid-2015, which will be NXT:3350s. So yes, we do expect for the moment -- orders from that moment onward. 
On the revenue recognition, while we are discussing the terms and conditions with our customers today, you need to realize one thing, that we think it's very important that our customers do recognize the value of those machines. And those machines, on average, are about EUR 90 million, or it is around the EUR 90 million mark. It is important that our customers, when we sign the POs, actually have that value in mind. Now also, clearly, we are discussing with the customer's terms and conditions, and some of those conditions have, of course, given the EUV history, certain performance criteria in there, likely. Now depending on the level of those performance criteria, we might recognize revenue later than we ship the machine. That is currently under negotiation, and depending on the final outcome of those terms and conditions and on the performance criteria that will be part of those terms and conditions, we will recognize that revenue, which could be in 2016 and, depending on some of those terms and conditions, could also be 2015. But it's a bit speculative as we have not yet finalized those commercial negotiations. That will, I believe, happen for the first customers soon and soon, I would say, over the next couple of months. So I have to keep you a bit in the dark on a deal-specific answer on this, as we have not finalized the discussions yet.",357

And is there a risk that re-use from 20 down to FinFET is contributing to some of the uncertainty that you're seeing right now?",99

Wennink,,Executives,11,"John, [indiscernible] answer. We do think the ramp-up is a 2015 event. It's not a 2016 event. When we look at the discussion that we have with customers and the planned shipments also for the first half of 2015, that number is actually up from the second half of 2014. So if you would compare first 6 months 2015, second half 2014, that number is up in the first half of 2015 for our logic customers. That will not go into 28-nanometer only, and it's too early for a 10-nanometer insertion. That will probably be the second half of 2015. So as far as we're concerned and what we are seeing, customers are planning to ramp 16- and 14-nanometer FinFETs in 2015, not in 2016.",125

And then for my follow-up. Just getting back to the EUV. You guys have made some fairly steady progress throughout the year. I'm wondering if you can give us your assessment of the EUV ecosystem outside of ASML and how you feel like that's progressing. What's the weak link? What do you worry about as far as things you can't control? And at some point, do you think about using some of your own money to help accelerate investment in other areas? Or do you think your customers can bring other suppliers along?",97

That's a long second follow-up because there's a lot of elements to it, but I'll try to cover everything. With respect to the ecosystem, the EUV ecosystem, as it relates to the 10-nanometer learning manufacturing and the mid-node insertion, I think everything is there. So it's -- 10-nanometer is not the issue. If you would say now you have to introduce today EUV for 7-nanometer, then, there are certain areas where we still need to make progress. And those are specifically in the mask area, in the mask inspection area, mask blanks, [indiscernible] mask. And also we would like to have a photoresist that is -- that has a higher level of stability that can be used in a mask manufacturing environment. Now having said that, I think in the discussion that we have with our customers, they all believe that those are elements of the ecosystem that we can control, and that will be available when we move into 7-nanometer mass production. With respect to your question, do they need to put money in that ecosystem? Well, it's not for me to comment on what customers should or shouldn't do in that sense, but I'm pretty sure that when they look at the advantage of EUV, customers and suppliers of the missing links are going to sit together and they will find solutions. I'm pretty sure, and have enough confidence in the discussion with our customers and with our colleagues in the industry that, that will happen. As to our own money, we do put some of our own money into play but that is when it comes very close to what we ship and what we make. For instance, the development of a pellicle, which is kind of a protection membrane in front of the photomask, that is something that we have developed. And because you could argue, it's so much integral to our system and it's inside our system, that's what we did, but we do not intend to be a pellicle manufacturer. So somewhere down the line, we'll probably hand this over to a company that is more, I would say, adept to this mass production of this pellicle. But yes, we are putting some of our R&D money to work to make that happen. Now I hope I covered everything that you asked in your question.",392

But do you think that, that -- a, do you think that, that 300k has changed? And b, it seems like the 175,000 is a little bit ahead of where you had said last time. I was thinking more like 125,000. So I don't know if something changed, where you got some orders now that you chewed further into that 300k. Can you sort of go into detail on that?",114

One word of warning is that these node transitions, currently, are a bit more complex than they were in the past. In the past, everybody went within a very short time period from one node to the other. So it has become more difficult for us to see when, we ship a tool, whether the tool is being used in the ramp of, let's say, the 20-nanometer node or a 16-nanometer FinFET node or because of the 28-nanometer demand, which is higher than we thought -- being used for 28-nanometer. That is, as you could say, it's more crossover flow now than we have ever seen before. And that's a bit of a -- that's a, I would say, a caveat when we talk about how many wafer starts are in a particular node. When we said 300,000 wafer starts and 175,000, what we are -- I must admit that today, because of the caveat that I just talked about, it is a bit unclear to what level that will indeed grow. Some of our people here look at the available fab space for logic customers, and they say, ""Well, if you look at the available fab space for logic customers, somebody needs to come out, and they need to, in any case, announce an additional line to get to 300,000 wafer starts because there's not enough space available."" And that can be also explained by the fact that some of our customers that originally planned a fab to be a logic fab, turned it into a DRAM fab. So there are always moving elements there that make it a bit difficult to say it's going to be 300,000 wafer starts, because all these elements, which is the crossover from node to node, which is changes in customer allocations of that particular segment in which they want to produce chips from, like, logic to DRAM, make it difficult for us to say, ""It's going to be that particular number."" Like I also said, fab space is also a bit of a question, and you have to put it all together. Now looking at it from a holistic point of view, we don't have sincere doubts that 300,000 wafer starts can be reached, but if you ask me when, and especially in the context of what we have already shipped, so how much are we going to ship over the next 12 months? That's very difficult to answer. So no major doubts about the 300k, but timing will be more difficult because of the issues that I just talked about.",430

I think as we said in the call, sorry, in the introductory statements of this call, that the place where we see some new capacity additions needed is in DRAM. NAND follows a pretty predictable path of about 100,000 wafer starts additions last year, which was about what we did this year, which was about what we did in 2013. But where we see some, let's say, some acceleration of capacity is in the DRAM space. So if you want to put a qualitative answer to your question, I think it's a bit more skewed towards DRAM in terms of the bookings than to NAND. But it's not entirely clear, as you say, because customers switch from one to the other, but that's what my answer would be.",129

That's 500 good wafers per day. That's what customers tell us, is I mean, if we can get 500 good wafers per day, we will start. Yes, and that means the -- clearly, when they move into 10-nanometer in 2016, '17, that 500 wafers per day should be, of course, more. Like we said, we have a target of 15 -- 1,500. So customers should have the confidence that we can grow to 1,500 wafers per day. But the -- I would say, the hurdle is the 500 good wafers per day, that's what they will start off with, and then we will have enough confidence, together with our customers, to get to 1,500 wafers per day. And another milestone is, then, if they are confident that 500 wafers per day is sufficient to start the next milestone, is to get the orders in.",149

It's a good question. What we have seen, it's -- again, it's a qualitative answer, what we have seen is those customers that are most advanced in the 10-nanometer development have put more pressure on us to get EUV working. I deduce from that, that -- that is, that 10-nanometer is very difficult to do without EUV. Now could there be upside to that number? We gave you a number, so I'm not going to change that number, but the upside would come from the realization of customers that when they move on with their development, that they'll run into this -- into the same physics issues as our leading-edge customer has actually ran into. And I think that could create an upside. Whether that's an upside in terms of orders or shipments early 2016 or late 2015, I don't know. But what we have learned, and let me say one thing, when we talk about customers, we don't talk about one voice. I mean, what we get back from customers is that the R&D people at the customer side are more and more inclined to look for EUV to solve their complexity issues. The operations people say that is fine if you let them give me a solution that is reliable, that I can use even if it's with low productivity, but that I can design in my production process. So those are the type of discussions that we don't only have with our customers, but our customers also have internally, and that could drive upside. But I'm not going -- not willing and not changing the numbers that we gave you today, but I just gave you a qualitative background.",283

It's a node that definitely grows significantly over 300,000 wafer starts per month the way that we see it.

So there will be days when there's maintenance on the machine, there's overhead time on the machine. So in order to do 500 wafers per day reliably, you need to be over 500 wafers per day, capability per day. So that's why Martin van den Brink said, ""Under the right conditions and if we execute on our upgrade programs and our availability programs, then there will be days when we are closer to 1,000 wafers per day than to 500 wafers per day.

And then, just secondly, sorry for the 2, but they're actually short ones. On -- I think I'm right in saying that you said that you expected planar NAND to come through early part of next year.

With respect to your last question, this is what our expectation is. What we see is that we do not expect the 3D NAND capacity to ramp significantly next year. I mean, there is installed capacity that, of course, needs to be fully utilized. I think that will probably happen next year, but we don't plan that. So if there would be a need for -- so a lot of additional 3D NAND capacity, that will be an upside for us. That's not what we're currently planning. And with respect to planar, yes, we see the capacity additions that currently are being asked, largely going into areas where there is a 2D planar production, and that's where it goes. With respect to EUV insertion. A 19-nanometer DRAM -- you didn't ask 19, you asked 16, but 19-nanometer DRAM, we still think that customers can get around that with, let's say, complex immersion.

And the follow-up would be on memory. On DRAM, I'm just wondering, from your perspective, how much is the current strength driven by mobile versus PC?

With respect to the rev rec, it's speculative because we are negotiating those terms and conditions, so it could be all of the above, you could say, or everything that you -- all mentioned. But that is a speculative answer, which I don't want to give, really, because it is about what will we be able to negotiate with our customers. And I'd like to repeat what I said, first, it's very important that the customers recognize the value of the machine and that they are also trying to manage their risks in terms of the introduction, in terms of the tool performance, that there are conditions attached which will have certain performance criteria is logical, yes? Now how that will, in the end, look and how severe those will be, we'll just have to see. For us, the most important part is that we have a PO within around 90 million or we're going to be 90-plus million PO value that will be recognized, matter of time, and it is about the introduction of EUV into manufacturing, getting up the learning curve. That's the most important of all because EUV is not about 2015 revenue recognition. It is about '16, '17, '18, '19 and the next decade, which will drive the top line of this company. So it is all about that, not so much about the rev rec of the first few tools. The NAND and the mobile answer. Yes, I think we sometimes discuss this with customers, whether it's mobile-driven or PC-driven. But in this particular case, we simply don't have enough evidence and not enough intelligence to give you an answer, and I don't want to speculate here also.

I can appreciate the uncertainty around the foundry side, given indecision in parts of the food chain, but it does seem, certainly from an industry perspective and from what you're saying, of course, that spending will need to happen from 1 of the 2 parties involved. So if we combine that with backlog at levels not seen since early 2011, it seems to me that you should have at least a good baseline from which to work for next year. So shouldn't this support year-on-year growth on an underlying basis in the first half of next year, even before we consider EUV? Is this a reasonable starting spot?

It's Wolfgang, Andrew. Indeed, there is not enough clarity, visibility and certainty to give you a number, but probably I can summarize a bit from a qualitative perspective. It is a strong start, but that's clear. It's driven by DRAM, but it's also driven by the expansion on capacity on 20, 16, 14. But if you go by the different segments, DRAM and NAND, there's really no significant change. We had a good quarter this year, and our big growth assumptions are pretty stable, around 40% in NAND and about 25% in DRAM. So it shouldn't look all that different on logic, foundry, our non-EUV. You heard about the 3 components. I mean, there's still significant buildout on 20, 16, 14. And then, what people sometimes underestimate is that we have still shipments on 28, and then Peter told you this, there are several customers with significant shipments. Plus, customers are pushing very hard, or at least one customer, to get 10-nanometer in as early as possible, with potential shipments, pilot shipment towards the end of the year as well. So we wouldn't be surprised if that logic, foundry is up year-over-year. Now EUV, we have discussed a lot. That's the big wild card. We know what we think we will ship, but we don't know what we will recognize. In terms of IDM, we have also said that before, that on the current volume node, we had a strong year this year and we'll have a little bit of a weaker year next year. But then, we are ramping into the next node, so that should be flattish. And then, what we sometimes forget in these discussions, field options and services have been improving over the years. So the timing is a wild card. The where and when is a wild card, but in general, we feel pretty good about the year ahead of us.",323

And if I understand correctly, you need to increase a bit your maximum throughput per day and make sure that you can sustain that kind of level for several days. Could you take us through what's going to be -- what could be challenging in achieving that? So what are, like, the technical difficulties that you are going to face by having this endurance test during -- longer? And maybe take us through how you're going to manage that. Is that something you're doing internally in your own labs? Or is that something your key clients are working on at the moment? And how much control do you have on timing for that? And maybe what would be, like, the news flow we should expect from here on that front?",154
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2014 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2014",2014-10-15,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3530.0,703833.0,31074463.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,44,"Yes. Let me answer the last question first. How do we manage this? We manage this not only internally but in very close cooperation with our customers. I mean, EUV is as important to us as it is to our customers or it is as important to our customers as it is to us. So at every site, where customers are getting really serious about EUV, putting into manufacturing environment, we have almost a 1-team approach. So we have to do this because it is complex, it's new. Somebody asked a question about the ecosystem. We need to understand all those elements also, how it relates or if it relates to our lithography performance. So this is how we manage it. It's not in isolation. It's very much with our customers. And so news flow. News flow will also come out of customers. News flow will be, going forward, news flow about performances at customer sites. There will be news flow about orders. That's what you need to look at, and that's what you can expect. Now in terms of what do we look at in terms of making progress and what are the areas, I would refer you to Slide 21 of our presentation. Slide 21 says, in fact, when you want to improve wafers per day and how do we get to more than 500 wafers per day, has 3 elements: it's the element of source power; it's the element of the system availability, which is the source system availability; and the scanner. And the latter is more the integration of the source with the scanner. Now source power has 4 elements that are specifically focused on in terms of development programs and things that we did together with our customers, which is what we call the conversion efficiency, how much EUV light can you get out of the plasma, get out of the tin and out of the CO2 laser. The drive laser power, which I just talked about, the CO2 laser power. It's the dose margin, how much EUV dose do you get stable out of the EUV plasma? It's the laser to droplet control. And when we go to system availability, it's the automation, which is basically metrology and the feedback systems; the lifetime of the collector, which actually, we have made a lot of progress on; the reliability of the droplet generator, which is you could say the tin machine gun, yes; and the drive laser reliability. Those are, again, 4 programs that each have a defined and a very specific set of engineers that are looking at this and that integrate this into the system in the field. And then, of course, you have the scanner, which you could say is the least of our problems. But there is a lot of integration and overhead elimination in terms of time between the source and the scanner. Now it's a long list, but it is, in fact, it's those 12 issues that are shown on Slide 21, all of them contributing to more than 500 wafers per day, more than 1,000 wafers per day and more than 1,500 wafers per day. It is how you need to look at it. And you could argue, it's -- they're all part of a chain and they all need to be improved. One has a bigger impact than the other, but it is -- if you want to get to ultimate 1,500 wafers per day or even 2,000 wafers per day, going forward, then those are the 12 elements that we constantly need to monitor, manage and make real progress on.",604

A year ago, I think you indicated that quarterly, R&D would drop to around EUR 250 million a quarter by the end of this year. Looks like you're guiding it to EUR 260 million, but I think you mentioned earlier on the call that you still hope to hit EUR 250 million in 2015. So I wanted to clarify that, that is the case, and then see if you can tell us when you expect to hit that EUR 250 million a quarter number.",91

Certainly, EUR 250 million is the target for 2015. I got to tell you also that a large chunk of our R&D is flexible, so it depends really on projects and programs that we're also doing with the outside world. So it could be -- 1 quarter could be a little bit higher, 1 could be a little bit lower. But that is still the target. As it relates to Q4, we've kept it a bit higher because with all the progress that we're having, we didn't want to limit any of the projects that are ongoing right now. But the target is consistent with what we have said before.",111

And then, just as a follow-up, on the DRAM side, can you just clarify where you're seeing -- which node, I guess, you're seeing the capacity expansion happen? And can you tell us if it's -- I guess, I'm wondering about the litho intensity, whether it's more space or double patterning-based or litho-edged patterning?",56

Wennink,,Executives,49,"In DRAM, it's the -- the complexity needs double-patterning solutions. And it's sub-20 nanometers, so we're moving into the 19-nanometer node for the leading edge. But also in DRAM, you see customers having different road maps. You have the most aggressive customers are moving into the 19-nanometer DRAM node, but there are still customers that are in the low 20s. So this is the area. But you are right, those 19-nanometer devices, they need to hold some double-patterning layers, and that is what drives up the litho intensity, and it also creates a situation whereby the wafer out capacity, of course, goes down because you have more layers and you have more multipass patterning. So by definition, if you don't build a new fab, you have fewer wafers out in that industry, which is the reason, I think, one of the main reasons why customers are adding some extra capacity to keep the wafer out capacity basically stable.",158

My first question is really in terms of the improvement and progress that we have seen, particularly with respect to EUV over the last 6 to 12 months. To what -- I understand, you're closely working in cooperation with your key R&D suppliers. Going forward, do you see a need to increase your intensity levels of cooperation or -- with any of the particular suppliers, any particular pain areas that you see at this point of time within your supply chain, not necessarily making a move like Cymer? But are there any areas, still, where you could potentially increase the level of cooperation to accelerate the progress on EUV? That would be my first question.",119

It's almost a rhetorical question. Yes, of course, we need to increase the level of cooperation with our suppliers because there's always room for an improvement in that area. But I would say -- generally, I would say the level of cooperation and the depth of the cooperation with our key suppliers is such that we don't need to go that much further. It is more about the clarity, sometimes, of roles and responsibilities on -- in terms of the resolution of some technical issues, but that's normal. We don't need to do anything else. I think we are where we are. We need to intensify the efficiency but not so much more suppliers or a deeper level of cooperation. What we have should be good enough. We just need to move on to industrialization, which means that we need to move out of development stage with our suppliers into a predictable industrial production environment. And that will probably, based on our experience, gives us some additional challenges because when you go into a volume industrial production, then you run into new issues. But that doesn't need any deeper cooperation, it just needs a better and an efficient, more efficient cooperation once we move into volume.",207

And just as a quick follow-up, given the new scenario you've outlined for EUV for 2015, does that, in any way, alter your build plan for EUV for 2015? Because I understand, earlier, you had a scenario of even as high as 12 to 15 tools. Based on what you see today with the level of uncertainty that you see on the foundry side, does that, in any way, change your build plans?

I mean, in terms of EUV gross margin, we are, in general terms, still on the track. But once we are in volume production, somewhere in -- 2 years or so after we introduce the 3350 and ship the 3350, we should get somewhere around the 40% mark. And next year is going to be better. It depends a little bit on the terms and conditions as well. It's going to be much better than what we had in the current year. And we have always said we're shooting for the 20% range. So we'll, hopefully, be somewhere in that range. And the second part of your question was regarding the tax rate. We've always said you should model around 10% for your longer-term model. The last 2 years were driven by onetime events, and it was up 1%. In the year we're currently in, we're expecting somewhere around 6% or so because some of the Cymer-related effects carry into 2014 as well. So 6% this year, and then I would put 10% in the model from '15 on.",180
