Wennink,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. Our fourth quarter results are very much in line with expectations that we set at the end of the third quarter, and our fourth quarter sales results came in just above our guidance. This quarter's sales, again, remained largely skewed towards the Foundry, IDM sectors, which was 87% of total, and that included noncritical KrF systems which supported capacity additions. The combined memory represented the balance of 13%.
By the way, we are now reporting memory sales bookings and backlog as one total value due to a decrease in transparency around system allocations between DRAM and NAND. The ASP of all systems recognized in Q4 was EUR 22.5 million, a decrease of about 10% from the previous quarter, affected by an increased percentage of used systems. Service and field option sales hit a record level of EUR 257 million this quarter, which I will come back to in a moment.
Fourth quarter net bookings came in at EUR 667 million for 32 systems, excluding EUV, with booked ASPs of EUR 20.9 million versus EUR 25 million in the third quarter. The quarter’s bookings ASP was impacted by a higher percentage of KrF used systems, clearly not indicative for future bookings, which will reflect the secular trend of higher-value technology buys.
Our order backlog at the end of Q4 was EUR 1.2 billion, including 46 systems, with excluding EUV. And the backlog profile at quarter’s end remained very similar to that at the end of the prior quarter, with a slight further movement in favor of Foundry and IDM.
Regarding our fourth quarter and total 2012 income tax charge, I’d like to point out that we released almost EUR 120 million of our accrued tax liability during the fourth quarter as a result of the favorable conclusion of tax audits in various tax jurisdictions outside the Netherlands, and this resulted in a nearly complete offset of the total income tax due on ASML earnings for the year 2012.
Regarding share buybacks, we completed our EUR 1.1 billion program during Q4 with the repurchase of approximately 4 million shares, reducing our total share count to about 407 million as of the end of the year. As a result, ASML has now returned more than EUR 4 billion in cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends since 2006.
Furthermore, due to ASML's strong financial position and operating cash flow prospects, we intend to continue our policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. However, for regulatory reasons, ASML will not announce any new share buyback program before Cymer’s extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which will be held on February 5, 2013.
ASML intends to again increase the dividend by 15% compared to last year. Therefore, we will submit a proposal to the 2013 annual general meeting of shareholders to declare a dividend in respect to 2012 of EUR 0.53 per ordinary share compared to a dividend of EUR 0.46 per ordinary share paid in respect of 2011.
As to the outlook, we currently anticipate the sales levels for 2013 to come in at an approximately similar level as in 2012. However, second half 2013 sales will be higher than first half sales largely due to the timing of next note [ph] investments of our Foundry customers.
Therefore, we anticipate Q1 total sales coming in at about EUR 850 million, with a gross margin of about 38%. The gross margin in the first quarter is temporarily affected by the underabsorption of our fixed production cost due to the lower sales level in the first quarter. And on top of this, the underabsorption is fueled by the EUV production infrastructure, which will only start seeing cost coverage once we start shipping EUV, which will be in Q2.
The impact of underabsorption accounts for approximately 2.5 percentage points of gross margin. We expect our gross margin to recuperate in the coming quarters when sales volumes increase and EUV shipments starts ramping.
R&D for the quarter will be about EUR 185 million with other income, which consists of contributions from participants of the customer Co-Investment Program, of EUR 16 million. We intend to spend a total of between EUR 750 million and EUR 800 million on R&D in 2013, with our Co-Investment partners contributing EUR 200 million in cash, thereby fully matching our incremental R&D spend on a cash basis.
However, as explained in previous quarters, as a result of the required accounting treatment for the Co-Investment contribution, the effect on our statement of operations will vary based upon the business volume of one of the key Co-Investment partners. The contribution of this partner will be included in the gross margin, whereas the contribution of the other 2 participants will be accounted for as other income under the operating income line.
Actuals of the Co-Investment contribution to R&D will be reported at the end of each quarter. And SG&A will continue at a slightly elevated level of EUR 63 million as we anticipate about EUR 6 million in additional expenses related to the pending Cymer acquisition.
Now going into 2013, we see sustained demand for the logic sector for continued 28 nanometer node RAMs. We also recognized the strategic importance of the transition of Logic device makers to the little-intensive 20 nanometer and below nodes and the associated requirements for a minimum critical capacity which should be installed by year end 2013.
This, along with our EUV system delivery plans up to 11 NXE:3300 systems, allow us to confidently plan our 2013 business as being very similar to 2012. This includes a very low level of demand from both memory sectors, With -- however, with the possibility of upside in NAND systems, that demand could occur later this year, and that is not yet reflected in our current assessment of the 2013 potential sales levels.
Lastly, I would also like to highlight the high level of service and field option sales as we saw in the fourth quarter, enabled in large part by the continued adoption across the install base of our performance and other field options, including throughput and all of our [ph] upgrades. This level of service sales will continue through 2013, supported in large part by our holistic lithography products, with some customers beginning to implement our integrated metrology and feedback loop solutions, providing a much needed higher level of process control at the 20 nanometer node and below.
And with that, I would like to turn it back over to you, Eric.",1091

So let me talk a bit about EUV, but first about Cymer. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire the light source supplier Cymer in a cash and stock deal. We are currently awaiting several international regulatory authority approvals, while the clearance has been granted by CFIUS, The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the German Antitrust Authority.
In addition, a vote on approval of the deal by the Cymer shareholders will take place on February 5. We expect that this acquisition will therefore be completed in the first half of this year after having obtained the necessary approval in the U.S., the antitrust authorities, and in the different remaining foreign jurisdictions.
In the meantime, we are continuing our long-term close recognition with Cymer and, of course, are working on EUV. Both on the source and on the scanner, we moved ahead significantly in Q4 towards our 2014 production ramp goal.
Firstly, progress has been made towards confirming what we call the source proof of performance, as we were able to double the source power in tests and simulation up to 60 watt with no indication of any performance degradation. We, of course, need to reach our long set target of 105 watt, which is equivalent to about 69 wafer per hour, but we are very encouraged, of course, by the data produced this quarter on 60 watt.
Secondly, we have operated the first integrated EUV source with a stable exposure power up to 40 watt with good dose control, enabling full field exposure over an extended period of time. Again, a fairly good piece of information here.
Thirdly, we have completed the integration of our first scanner machine, the NXE:3300, and have now met a number of significant overlay and imaging performance milestones. We have achieved imaging down to 14 nanometer, and mix and match immersion to EUV overlay results of below 5 nanometer.
These 3 areas of progress underpin our confidence to reach the 105 watt, or the 69 wafer per hour, target for 2014 production ramp. And these areas of progress support the preparation for shipment of our 11 production NXE:3300s. These 11 production units, I will remind you, are not specified to reach immediately the 69 wafer per hour target specification at shipment, but we’ll ship when assembly can be completed.
Regarding the production planning phase, our goal is to ship about 8 to 12 system in total in 2014. We have already booked 4 of these NXE:3300 production system and intend to book several more in the next few months as the requirements for our customers for EUV are becoming clearer with each performance progress step being made.
DRAM manufacturers, for instance currently suggest a potential need for imaging for up to 4 layers, which is a bit better than we believed before, to be dedicated to EUV at high 1x nodes, and the Logic device makers may require between 5 up to 17 EUV exposures at the nodes sub-14 nanometer.
So parallel to EUV, which remains the only cost-effective imaging solution for customers to do the next generation IC scaling anyway, we are developing 450 millimeter wafer form factor exposure tools. As Peter mentioned, our customer Co-Investment Program is indeed enabling this, enabling this huge investment in normal business, investment in EUV, investment in 450 development.
The 450 millimeter system’s timing is targeted for 2016 pre-production, with production systems targeted for 2018 if, of course, customers confirm the ramp interest in an agreed-upon timeframe.
So with this update on the technology and the product, with Peter, we would be pleased to take your questions.",607

And one question, Eric. How do you see the in-store capacity for the 28 nanometer node, and going forward, how do you see the size potentially in terms of wafer stock amount for the 20 nanometer node?",43
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3805.0,403196.0,19018483.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,8,"Okay, this is a very good question. So we estimate that we’ll see a shipment that we are supposed to do up to Q3 of 2013. The total customers will reach about 320,000-ish wafer install base of the 28 nanometer to 32 nanometer node, which 320,000, 340,000 wafer per month-type capacity is a good node, on the high side but not exceptional. What surprised us and the reason why we’ve been bullish this year, and this is the first year in 8 years or so, 9 years we’ve guided the full-year, is indeed, to your question, we are now seeing the buildup of capacity for 20 nanometer, 22 nanometer in the same environment in the Foundry, Logic environment. And this is starting earlier than we would have expected in the first place. We can discuss later about the drivers of that. We expect the numbers of wafers to be installed, with the current forecast that we have, to be in the area of about only 60k wafers -- well, I would say it’s 40k to 60k wafers will be installed by the first quarter of 2014. This is very important. First, 40k to 60k is not a very large number. But it requires a lot of lithography machine because each wafer of 20 nanometer, 22 nanometer requires double numbers of lithography machine and significant amount more of holistic lithography products, which is a good margin product, to make the same numbers of wafers. So you have a factor 2 here, which is, again, why we’ve said with some confidence that although we do not see a good business in the PC arena, we do not see a pickup of the memory business at this time. That doesn’t mean it won’t happen. But today, we don’t see it. There is no signal. But the only thing we see is 20 nanometer, 22 nanometer, and this is good. And the multiplier intensity force us to guide that, in fact, the second half of the year will be so good that it compensates for the beginning half, which is slow.",347

We could always do a bit more. But we don’t think it would be necessary to overheat on that one. And then we will go towards a capacity of about 60, 66 in the 2016, 2017 range.",62

The first question I would have is on the visibility that you have on the order, because to have a rebound in sales starting in Q2, if I understand well, and an acceleration in H2 because of the 20 nanometer, 14 nanometer transition, given your lead time, is it fair to assume that the orders should rebound as early as in Q1?",65

Wennink,,Executives,13,"Absolutely, the orders will pick up in Q1. In our opinion -- this is Peter -- we don’t think the orders will pick up as much as they should. In other terms, the customers who we know of course will be somehow putting the orders within lead time. This project that we’re talking about is such a huge strategic project that we are building on commitment and on request to view buildup is a more of the administrative process that will go with it. So indeed, there is going to be a pickup in Q1. And we expect this to continue. But again, as I -- you will not be able to easily use a standard lead time of 6 to 9 months to guide to know what the revenue is going to be -- the POs will be coming, in fact, late to the ramp, and because the ramp is so obviously discussed, committed, planned, agreed, that PO has become a bit irrelevant on these 1 or 2 fundamental projects.",171

So just a quick one on EUV again, coming back to the 8 to 12 tools for next year.

They absolutely have to have at least one layer on EUV just as a feasibility statement. So DRAM is always hot. However, Logic has overpassed, I would say, DRAM in the sense that, first, they also have now a need which they have realized, which is a minimum of, as we said, 5 layers to 7. They all know -- so see that they have an economic issue. So there is now another incentive to go from 5, 7 to 17, and they have also a huge business attraction, meaning Logic is in fact doing good at this moment. And they see themselves going in another node after the famous, what we call 20 nanometer, but which will be called 14-20. That node will then be followed quickly by a node which will be called something like 10-11 or something. And that is the EUV node, and there is going to be -- or at this moment, the customers believe that there is an economic wave that will drive this. So Logic are becoming hugely interested, putting most of our attention now on Logic. But DRAM will get in, and if DRAM's business becomes more attractive, then the PC business, basically, gets back and puts some attraction there. We could see DRAM trying to still be 3, 6 months ahead of Logic because they do have a need, indeed.",256

So in fact, we did miss the targets of the summer. If you remember, I said in the summer we will have some factual data that puts us in the comfort zone. We didn't, and we didn't not because we hit a science problem, we didn’t because we hit an engineering problem. The different setups did not work, so it took a bit of time to put them to work. So what should have happened in the summer has happened in the winter, and we now have 2 -- 3 fundamental set of data. The first set of data, which we expected anyway, not a big surprise, is the 3300 machine works, and it works very well. So in fact, if today you wanted to be in production with an EUV machine without a source, we would put you into production now. And so if any of you is interested, by the way, we’ll take some orders. The second bit is the -- what the piece of data that was successful this last 3 months -- in fact, that excites the engineers more than me as a businessman, and you will understand why, is now they are getting stability of exposure at 40 wafer per hour.

We had difficulty during the day. Each of the wafers had irregularities, et cetera. So we have done a significant amount of engineering. The third aspect, now, that’s what excites me as a businessman and not so much the engineers, but this is a difference between a good engineer and a bad engineer, I guess, is we have some 60 watt capability data. What is a capability data? It says that, theoretically, we needed to be sure that we would not discover a problem by putting more power in the system. More power means more heat, more stress, more et cetera. By doing this, you kind off shoot a bit in the dark, which is why EUV is in fact dangerous, because you will learn something and what you learn may take time to repair. And the way that we’ve moved to 60 watts, we’ve been able to justify and comfort our simulation systems. And our simulation system models now are comforted up to 60 watts. And in fact, it can be easily now projected to what we handled in 5 watts. Even if we cannot prove it yet, the models are proven, checked at 60 watts. So first, 60 watts is nearer to 105 watts and, secondly, it is very good theoretically. It has proven the model. So therefore, we absolutely strengthen our point that 2014 production should now be -- much higher probability than ever, indeed enough that the customers are in fact continuing to discuss with us this order placing for 2014, which are meant to be between 8 and 12 in total, which, by the way, is a good number. We don’t need more. Customers don’t need more anyway. That would be the normal ramp of that technology.",298

I mean, just one follow-on to that. I mean, you were talking about the 60 watt to being -- having been shown in your labs. Is there a substantial technical difference between a 60-watt laser and a 105-watt laser, I mean, based on gas or what power has to be -- I mean power, clearly, is different.

Wennink,,Executives,43,"No, it fully depends on the timing of when the shipments happen. So basically it's -- because that particular customer is also a very large -- is a larger shareholder than the others, and that means that the accounting requirements state that you have to allocate that contribution to the business that we have with them. So if we start shipping tools, that mean that those tools will get a, let’s say, a lift-up of the contribution that was intended to be the coverage for the R&D cost. And so per system, you will have an extra margin. And then that is the way it is going to be accounted for. So it means that, depending on the business volume that we have with that customer, we are going to now recognize the -- accounting-wise, we are going to recognize the contribution of the customer. Cash-wise, it's not going to be an issue. Cash-wise, it's going to be matched. So you will have, you could say, for some time, you could have a deferred accrual account, a deferred revenue account on the balance sheet, which will then be released to income in the next quarter when the shipments happen.",199

The first one will be regarding EUV shipments for this year. I think the plan since last year was to ship 11 machines. This year, if I read the statement this morning, it sounds a bit shaky, like it’s going to be 11 at best. Does it mean that there is some risk of delay into 2014? And also, if you could confirm that some of those shipments, although revenues will then be recognized this year. That’s my first question. I’ve got a follow-up.",85

So I will address the shipment part. So the machine itself, as I said, has been purchase ordered on an as-is basis. So we will ship when they are ready, finished, assembled, as I said in the speech. The machines themselves, the scanners, the certainty of being available for next year is very high. I mean, we don’t see a problem achieving that. The matching the scanner to the proper source could be still the risk of execution. Whether we ship all of them or we miss 2 or 3 or 4 depends, in fact, what we’re going to choose to do with the sources. We can ship them here and test them and qualify them, but then that takes more time to ship later to the customer. We can decide to, what we said, drop ship the machine to the customer, meaning you ship the machine, the scanner, on one hand and the laser on the other. But then you have to recognize -- well, in fact, I'm starting to answer your question, the machine when they are tested at the customer. So that may take more time. So we are a bit less in control of what we want it to be in the first place as to the logistic of this. And then Peter will have to put the economic view to this, which is a recognition of revenue to the logistic nightmare that I just discussed.",255

Wennink,,Executives,49,"Yes, and it's what -- I accept. Shipment for us is defined as the shipment of the -- you could say the metal. That could be in 2 ways. It could be like Eric said, being the integrated metal from Veldhoven, from the Netherlands, or because we are late. Customers could say, ""Please save time. Don't ship everything to Veldhoven, integrate it there, test it and then take it apart and ship it to us. So please ship the scanner separate from the EUV source,"" which we will call a drop shipment of the source, which then means that the integration and showing that it works can only happen at the customer side, which then also means that the revenue recognition takes place at that moment in time. And since we aren't completely sure as to what customers want and what particular configuration of the source that they want, there is a risk from a revenue recognition point of view. Some of those shipments may end up in the first quarter of 2014, and that might happen. So there is a bit of caution there. So you notice that. And as a matter of fact, in our guidance, we took account of that. So we took a conservative number for the EUV shipments to be recognized in 2013 because it will always be a possibility that, while we have shipped it, that we’re still in a process of putting it all together and qualifying at the customer side, which might then happen in Q1 instead of Q4.",257

That is very clear. And I have another question for Eric, if I may, about the EUV and the 40 nanometer, especially because, Eric, you say that 40 nanometer and below, they could be like 5 to 17 EUV layers per chip.

Is it going to be gross for us when we ship EUV because the immersion will still remain important? The answer is yes. I think we said 2 or 3 quarters ago that when EUV is introduced within these normal activities, they will be EUV, they will be immersion, they will be dry. And in this environment, we think we are going to have to go to another plateau of sales. And I said, by the way, I would give you the new plateau when we are solid on EUV, we know for sure what we ship. But yes, it would be bigger than the plateau that we have already touched, which is the 5.5-ish. We think we’ll get to another level of sales because, yes, immersion will remain.",137

I was interested in if you could provide a bit more detail around the visibility being provided by some of the Foundry customers at the moment. You’ve clearly indicated that your expectation for revenue there to ramp in the back half of the year given the 20 nanometer build-out. I think looking at the way the foundries are communicating at the moment, one thing particularly vocal, the other slightly less, so given a customer shift. But how much of your expectation for that second half ramp are being driven by that one who is being more vocal relative to the other one, or are you assuming within your guidance that there is a strong ramp across those 2 leaders?",122

You talk about the first 6 months of 2009, and then you could argue that the effective tax rate had no relevance at all, which at the levels that we are talking about in Q1 is not the case. I think the fact that we have currently a resolution on the tax issues that are outstanding, in particularly Asia, means that we can now confidently recognize taxes in that area on a lower level, which means that going forward for 2013, we guided you at around 12% tax. You could take 2 percentage points off, so around 10%. 9% to 10% would be a good number for the total year.",130

Maybe that’s what I can tell you. We are -- know it’s difficult to -- maybe also remember we do not represent 100% of the CapEx.

But I would not say -- I’ll also be realistic. We just finished -- the work [ph] finished to -- not even finished. The work is in process of finishing 28 nanometer. It would be a bit aggressive for me to say that we now will ship hundreds of millions of 20 nanometer today. That would not be natural.

I was intrigued by one of the slides you showed on your presentation which talked about the integrated metrology that they used. Could you talk a little bit about what they’re doing to -- if you could quantify, that would be great, to the ASPs of the immersion systems as we go from 28 nanometer to 20 nanometer? And from a process flow standpoint, it is -- what exactly is that metrology doing? Is it replacing an optical 3-D metrology that your company would have bought from another equipment supplier, or is it in addition to other equipment that the chip companies are going to be buying for metrology?",110

No, we would not say that it directly replaces metrology. Metrology, the segment which already -- as it is known in the industries, diagnostic metrology segment, it's -- every day or so you take a wafer, you make it extremely deep, and that is as so you understand what the recipe’s impact are. You change the recipe, so it’s an involved diagnostic, long lead time, deep in both process capability. We don’t have that. What we insert are machines which are able, on the fly, to correct a process failure by resetting the numbers of knobs into a scanner. We call it metrology because, indeed, you have to measure and correct. But the real term should have been a closed-loop system. Before, they didn’t need to use closed-loop because the machines did not need to be corrected. But now, the processes are so tight, the window of processes are tight, that they need to be expounded and they need to be controlled. And therefore, there is a new activity that is called closed-loop. And we are happy to be a big player into this. And it is true that we’ve done, in the past year or so, a very small amount of business in that segment. In total, I would say up to EUR 200 million or so in total business of this type of activity, EUR 200 million to EUR 220 million. Now it’s real. So in other terms, there is going to be a significant impact as we go. And when the business goes from 20 nanometer, it’s already big, and that 14 nanometer is going to be even worse -- or better for us. So we will go north of EUR 400 million in due time. So this is real additional business which indeed has an impact in Logic. So Peter?",324

Wennink,,Executives,67,"Yes, and I think in -- when you talk about the ASPs, there are not so much margin because there are higher-margin products. When you look at the particular slide that you are referring to where you see these 2 machines, the scanner on one side and the -- what we call the Yieldstar metrology to the other side, you have to remember that is not one single tool that we are selling. It is hardware plus a lot of software. And so it’s a combination of products that we are selling. But if you would have a fully loaded 28 nanometer machine compared to a fully loaded 20 nanometer machine, which would include this Yieldstar and the feedback loops that arrogate, you would look at, depending on the customer and the application, a difference in list price of between EUR 7 million and EUR 10 million between the 2. Yes, of course, then it depends on the customer contract that you have, the volumes that they’re taking, what discounts that they’re getting. But that is the kind of the difference that you need to think of.",187

On the holistic lithography and the upgrades and the revenue contribution, I think you said that you expect to stay at this EUR 257 million level in terms of service and field options. But wouldn’t it make sense that, that would increase as you get this 20 nanometer ramp coming in to the back half of the year? In other words why would you expect that line of revenue to be flat? Or does it just come into the system sales revenue?",93

Yes, so I mean this indeed in the fourth quarter show some incidental extra revenue, but when it would be -- when you take the average from 2011 and 2012, we are significantly lower. Now I think that average will go up. So that is basically what we are saying, and yes, we are conservative in a sense because, like I said earlier, EUR 7 million to EUR 10 million addition to the sales price from a list price point of view is also something that customers need to get their heads around and basically need to realize that they need it. We think that they need it, but we feel we can, on average, keep the EUR 250 million level per quarter, which is a record.",147

Two questions, Eric. So first, if you look at your sales guidance for 2013, and given the Foundry war which is ongoing and the capital intensity that is happening, given that, that is going to be at least 1.7x more intensive compared to the prior nodes, your guidance seems to be a little bit kind of soft. Is it a fair assessment that you’re being very conservative here? Can you talk about the puts and takes? And then I have a follow-up.",85

Well, our philosophy and style is not to bet and have an opinion and then say, it’s a gutsy opinion or it’s not. We’re trying to guide you only on factual data that we have. And the factual data is we have one segment and a half, which one segment is, you’ve all guessed it, in the 20 nanometer leading company. And then you have a percentage of our 11 machines, and Peter was nice enough to tell you exactly which percentage we talked about. So you take these big account of 20 nanometer, it was our own understanding of how many units you really need to do, to do these 40k wafers. You add this x percent of the EUV machine, you add the standard business that we have and you come up with about the same sales level. So that’s what we guided. When we saw that number, we said we have to guide you because it’s a true statement. It’s a true number. So you can translate my point by saying there is indeed upside opportunities. The first upside opportunity is that the elder Logic people will not consider this acceptable to leave only one, and one of them take over the majority share of 20 nanometer so early in the game. So that’s an upside. The second upside, which we mentioned in the press release, is that if the PC business does pick up a bit due to the new form factors, you will see immediately a reaction in every people who do microprocessors, who will benefit from that, and memory. DRAM will start benefiting. But then you are going to have a multiplier in the NAND business for the people doing, and successful are doing, solid state drive because solid state drive will be multiplied by the PC for the new form factor performance. So again, that is not in the numbers, and this is an opportunity. Okay, so that would be, if you want to hear from me, the upside. The downside is that we are in a business now which is extremely granular. That is, if we make a mistake in judgment, it's a big one. And it could be a big one because like a fab is late by 3 months to 6 months just because the concrete did not cool, or the contractor to the Foundry business with whom we're working is having nightmares and et cetera, something bad has happened, and in which case we have a negative to the guidance. So again, we don't want to put any judgment to the upside and the downside. But I hope by doing this very candid description of what is in our numbers and how we built it up, you yourself, in fact, should make the number for the year.",469

So follow-up, I just want to get an understanding. In terms of the DRAM customers, what is the sense of urgency are you seeing for the DRAM guys to be looking at EUV given that the industry has somewhat consolidated and it’s in their best interest to see pricing continue to get better for their own profitability? What is the sense that you see that in terms of them trying to accelerate EUV at this point of time?",85
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 17, 2013",2013-01-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3805.0,403196.0,19018554.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,79,"I guess DRAM business -- or the memory business, because it is more and more merging somehow, is looking for a differentiative activity. So they have resolved probably their -- as you call this, the consolidation. I guess that they have numbers of players which have reached some kind of an equilibrium, so none of them would want to continue losing money. Why they continue losing money and the prices took time to get up because if -- by the way, the DRAM prices are getting up in the last 3, 4 weeks, so there is an upside coming on. Something is happening at this moment. The reason why they, however, had another bad 6 months or so is because the PC business, in fact, was surprisingly weak. If you remember, we started the year last year where everybody was thinking that the PC business would grow by 5% or 10%. And then it happened to be flat or shrinking. So that created problem that they are trying to resolve. So what is happening now is one will not continue driving the business, which is the same method, which is overinvesting so that they try to take the other guy out of business. I don’t think that we’ll do this any longer. But I start seeing more interest to differentiate themselves with the way they do the chips, which also include a bit of process. This is very visible in the NAND business. You've noticed that in the NAND business they've gone now to trying to differentiate on the design of the chips, on the numbers of bits per cell, on the software drives, et cetera, and you can start seeing this in the DRAM. So if you have a DRAM idea, and EUV shrink capability is not only cost, but it's also an enabler of something like power consumption, speed of access, et cetera, then you could show some huge interest. And we have started to see some of that, but I must say, I don't have specific to tell you that you should consider -- that, I mean, I have something in there. I don't know. I see questions, but I -- which leads to this idea.",369

Really just wanted to try and to ask a question around DSM risks. I mean, if you look to a lot of the EDA suppliers, they are talking about increasing DSM risks around advanced node development, such as that 20 nanometers, 22 nanometers and more so at 14 nanometers. Things increasing like DRC rules and the complication with cell slot for new features like thin fabs, I mean, I suppose history tells you there's always [indiscernible] the speed of design progression for new nodes, but I wonder if you could shed some light on what might be different this time and how this, if at all, really transfers the slowdown in development of chips at each node, and whether or not that has an onward impact to the ramp of the 20-nanometer node up to, let's say, a 320,000 wafer starts per month, similar to 28-nanometer node?",153

Now I'll try my best. The negative part of your question is really, at the end of the day, it could create an inflation of cost. You mentioned issues, design manufacturing issues, which require, in fact, investment. So there is indeed a pressure on cost and all of us, our customers, but us are trying to solve the problem by bringing solutions to the market which do not add an inflation of cost. So that clearly is a pressure. But let's conclude with the positive news. We see this as a huge business opportunity. The discussion that we just had on this metrology closed loop is exactly your point. It has triggered the possibility for us to go from EUR 100 million to EUR 200 million to EUR 400 million potential sales of these high-valued product. Secondly, that's the moment when the war is too big, EUV comes up and EUV does reduce the need for these complicated situations.

One is to widen the process cultural window in your preparation for manufacturing, which really addresses your design for manufacturing issues, that in rolling this out, we also discovered a second element, which is basically the control of your process parameters while you are in manufacturing. So it has 2 elements to it. And I think that is -- the latter is more, I’d say, a finding of the last few years, while the first part, needing to find a solution for the design for our manufacturing issues, that was really why we did the Brion acquisition. But it evolved into the latter with the Yieldstar product and the closed loops.",135

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. Our first quarter results are very much in line with the expectations we set at the end of the fourth quarter, with sales slightly above expectations. These systems sales, again, remained largely skewed towards the foundry IDM sectors, which was 70% of total, including noncritical KrF systems supporting capacity addition. Combined memory represented the balance of 30%. 
As we did last quarter, we are now reporting memory sales, bookings and backlog as one total value due to lack of transparency around system allocations between NAND and DRAM. The average selling price of all systems recognized in the first quarter was EUR 23.3 million, a bit higher but basically the same as in the previous quarter. Service and field option sales were EUR 250 million.
First quarter net bookings came in at EUR 715 million or 25 systems, excluding EUV, with booked ASPs at EUR 28.6 million versus EUR 20.9 million in the fourth quarter. The average selling price of the first quarter bookings were impacted by a higher percentage of immersion systems. 
Next quarter bookings will reflect the secular ASP trend as well as we expect increased demand in the second half of the year for the company's leading-edge systems for logic applications. 
Our systems order backlog at the end of the first quarter was EUR 1.27 billion, which totaled 42 systems, excluding EUV. The backlog profile at the quarter's end remained very similar to that at the end of the previous quarter. 
With respect to our cash generation profile, I would like to mention that we expect, over the coming 12 to 18 months, our working capital requirements in support of our EUV 450 millimeter programs to be substantial. Longer factory cycle times for these new products and investments in facilities and prototypes to deal with the anticipated volume ramp will obviously require additional capital. I think that with our attempt to accelerate the delivery of multiple key complex new technologies, this requirement can be easily understood. 
Despite these cash requirements for these investments, the company has confidently increased the dividend to $0.53 per share, which is a 15% increase, and has also announced today a share buyback program of up to EUR 1 billion to run through the end of 2014.
As to the outlook, we continue to expect sales levels for 2013 to come in at similar levels to 2012. Second half 2013 sales will be higher than first half largely due to timing of next node investments of our foundry customers and as we begin recognizing revenue for our first EUV NXE:3300 shipments. 
We anticipate second quarter total sales coming in at about EUR 1.1 billion. Based on this anticipated volume, we will see our second quarter gross margin come back to between 41% and 42%. R&D for the quarter will be about EUR 187 million and other income, which, again, consists of contributions from participants of the Customer Co-Investment Program, of EUR 16 million. 
As discussed last quarter, the co-investments in R&D by key co-investment partners are accounted for in different ways. The quarterly contribution of 2 of them is reported as other income. That amount was EUR 14 million in the first quarter and expected at EUR 16 million in the second quarter, as earlier mentioned. The contribution of the third participant is included in our gross margin. That amount was EUR 16 million in additional gross profit in Q1, with Q2 actuals to again be reported with our second quarter results. 
The SG&A will continue at EUR 63 million as we, again, anticipate about EUR 6 million in additional expenses related to the pending Cymer acquisition. 
We continue to see sustained demand from the logic sector as they begin to transition to the 20, 16 and 40-nanometer combined nodes. However, with recent pricing stability in the 2 memory sectors, we have started to see inquiries regarding litho system lead times but have not yet seen a significant order pickup to support capacity additions in addition to the current memory technology buys. Given the level of these inquiries, we could see a potential pickup in orders in the second half. 
In support of our customers' needs to move EUV from early development to real process development in anticipation of potential volume ramps in 2015, we currently have 11 systems in our adoption process. However, due to current limited supply of the source, we now expect to ship 6 EUV NXE:3300 systems this year, with drop shipments of first few sources directly to the customers' facilities. We expect that 2 systems will ship this quarter and 4 will ship in the second half of the year. 
Revenue recognition will only be possible when both scanner and source have been shipped and installed at the customer's site, so we expect to recognize about EUR 280 million in revenue this year, which still allows us to forecast 2013 revenues at 2012 levels due to the underlying strength of our non-EUV business. 
I think that's what I would like to say about our results and about the forecast, and with that, I would like to turn it back over to you, Eric.",861

I will focus my remarks first on the status of our technology development and start by our EUV program. Regarding the scanners themselves, EUV scanners themselves, we have now demonstrated production with the 10-nanometer node compatible imaging and overlay performance. Stability and reproducibility will certainly have to be improved as we prepare for production in 2014, but the specification target has certainly been reached now on the NXE:3300 platform. 
Regarding the source, significant progress has been made. The EUV light sources are now running at 55 watts with production-worthy dose control. This is equivalent to approximately 43 wafers per hour with a standard resist sensitivity. To put this performance into perspective, one should remember that, of course, we lost for the year in 2012, when the original source concept that we used to call NOMO was converted to a more robust concept called MOPA Pre. Since this concept changed, has been debugged, and it took a bit of time to do so, we have executed cycles of learnings as a standard in this industry, leading to continuously improved performance through optimization of the system software and hardware architecture. 
Our targeted production throughput for 2014 and commitment to customers since, in fact, last year, since 2012, remains at 69 wafers per hour, upgradable within 2 years to 125 wafers per hour. The current progress and achievement of 43 wafers per hour now, puts us well up to target to achieve our commitment.
Indeed, the machines will require another year of continuous improvement to achieve the specification targets and, as already mentioned, production-worthy reproducibility and stability. However, the systems performance data is now confirmed, and the nodes for which EUV can make a significant contribution, namely a 19-nanometer DRAM on about 2 layers and the so-called -- this industry's so-called sub-14-nanometer logic, sometimes called 10-nanometer, sometimes called 7-nanometer, can be planned with EUV. These are the nodes on customer roadmap for wafer ramps in 2015 and IC volume production in 2016. 
Of particular interest is the logic node in this time frame as EUV can become disruptive. Indeed, customers can use EUV, either 1 or 2 layers, to reduce the manufacturing complexity and to improve processing cost. Or they can use EUV on 5 to 7 layers to support a full node scaling factor, up to 250% scaling factor. Or on 15 to 17 layers to support both scaling processing and cost reduction if you were to build up greenfield fabs. 
The customer choices between these alternatives, 1 to 2 layers, 5 to 7 or 15 to 17, will be key for their own competitiveness. That said, EUV can influence the processing cost on one hand; the process control difficulty on the other; the design rule simplification, very important in a foundry business; the scaling factor, the shrink factor, as we said; and overall chip electrical performance. So a lot of valuable performance differentiation can be achieved using EUV. The current steady progress of EUV technology makes the layers choice complicated, indeed, but potentially rewarding. 
As Peter already mentioned, our delivery planning through 2 system shipments and installing through this quarter and the third quarter and the remaining 9 of the first order batch of 11 to be shipped and installed between Q4 of this year and Q1 of 2014. We have additional commitments for 7 systems for 2014 deliveries. We are working on the exact production needs of the customers, but we'll be waiting for confirmation of specification before we close further orders above the 7.
In parallel to EUV, we continue to support world-leading performance with ArF immersion systems. We shipped 5 of our new NXT:1960Bi system, the successor to the NXT:1950i system, already in Q1. These systems offer 20% improvement of overlay and focus control, as well as 30% improvement in CD uniformity, which supports -- which will support manufacturing at the so-called 20, 16 or 14 nanometer [indiscernible] logic nodes, with heavy multi-patterning required. 
In support of the immersion multi-patterning but also in EUV imaging specificity, we continue to focus our effort on process control products, these products that we call Holistic Lithography products, are beginning to be transferred from R&D to production at our customers, with business volume being significantly larger, obviously. For instance, we have had to expand our production facility for the YieldStar metrology tool to the ASML Center of Excellence in Taiwan to support production of up to 150 units per year, which is very large. We will have more than EUR 350 million of Holistic Lithography product sales in 2013.
Also on the product front, supported by our Customer Co-Investment Program, we have completed the concepts for our 150 millimeter architecture for using EUV and into immersion lithography systems so as to deliver prototypes in 2015. And it will be compatible to 2018 production ramp, of course, if confirmed by the industry in due time. 
Finally, we are awaiting the rulings from the Fair Trade Commissions of Japan and Korea, which we still expect in time to close our ASML-Cymer merger, still expected to be, again, closed in the first half of this year. 
As you are aware from our press release, I will personally be stepping down as ASML CEO as of the 1st of July 2013. I will remain Chairman of our holding company until March 31, 2014, when I retire from ASML. This is an anticipated transition as I signed a 2-year extension in Q1 2012, as you know. As the ASML Supervisory Board has appointed Peter Wennink as my successor, this will lead to an orderly transition period and confirms continuity of our business strategy. 
I would like to say that it has been my great pleasure to have met many of you over the last 9 years already and to have built a relationship based on trust. I will not dwell on this retirement topic at this moment as I'm still the active CEO of the company for the next 3 months. But I look forward to seeing you all these next few quarters as we manage a smooth transition of company management.
With that, Peter and I would be pleased to take your questions.",1030

We have seen a small increase in the NAND prices, so it is not a surprise that those inquiries are yet coming. If we would have to make a guess, it would be more DRAM-related than it is NAND-related. But like I said, it's pretty recent, and you're asking very specific questions on the architectural choices on the NAND side, which, actually, we cannot comment on at this moment in time because we simply don't know.

So it's quite a significant increase of the average selling price if they would choose to take the full suite of the system enhancement products.

That's very clear. My follow-up question is just on litho intensity. You guys have been very clear about the type of layer intensity increase that you see on the 2x node on 20.

Wennink,,Executives,31,"With respect to the trends, as we said last quarter, this year will be largely driven by logic with a, let's say, much lower share of our memory customers, which is still the case. So in your assumption that we should see an order increase for the second quarter, we would agree. Although the exact number, we will discuss with you within 3 months. But indeed, the order mix will be as we planned it, largely skewed towards the logic customers, the foundry customers with what we did earlier, with some upside on the memory customers. But the year will be a logic-driven year, and we will see those orders that are needed to support the sales in the second half. They will come in. Just to remind you, the ordering process with some of those customers where we have very strong relationships and we know that we are the technology of choice that we've said in earlier quarters, that the ordering process has become more, I would say, administrative in that sense. And it is more important for us that we have an agreement with the customers on the shipment dates that they need our tools to introduce their next-generation technology.

That's what you have in our basics. And we believe these numbers are conservative at this very moment. On the DRAM side, which is visible now because we are negotiating what we call availability, which is another way of saying we're getting orders. And on the NAND side, we haven't yet negotiated orders, but when you talk to the customers, their statistics of bids out is planned, is higher than what we think, we have planned for them.

And we are significantly certain that there is improvement to be shown to you towards this, I would say, minimum performance of 69 wafer, which is 105 watts, by mid of next year, when we really need to be having this done in production. So in other terms, I think we are now in the conservative curve. We'll see improvement every day, but we don't really want to be measured on whether we have one wafer less or more because, indeed, things are not that obvious.

You just talked about this potential EUR 800 million of additional revenue from YieldStar. So is that included in that ASP calculation of EUR 100 million that you're talking about for, say, 2015 or 2016? And secondly, do you have a potential size that, in 2015, you can do this many EUV tools and you think that there could be potential demand for that?",109

So I think the answer is yes and yes.  The EUR 100 million potential EUV ASP will be justified by its content, but also by its spec. And remember, this EUV machine is going to have a multiple NA -- or not NA, but illuminator settings with part of the ASP of EUV machine, and that is not part of my EUR 800 million. So I make a difference between a machine with, I will say, attach options which are 100%, and that could go, okay, between EUR 90 million and EUR 100 million a machine. And then a set of options which are not 100% attached, which are attached only for a set of process issues. And that is where I say that, at some, point we could see EUR 800 million.

I got a question about the EUV shipments for this year. I think last time, you were talking about shipping up to 11. This year, now it's gone down to 6. Obviously, they will be shipped in 2014, I guess, but what is the difference? Just maybe customers being a bit cautious on the tools and preferring to wait? Or just what -- could you explain what happened basically?",75

Wennink,,Executives,44,"Yes, it's [indiscernible] customer side. It's -- we have 11 scanners on the production floor that people who recently were in our factory actually count them in a very advanced state of production. The thing that is currently missing is the speed with which we can produce the EUV sources. And there is a delay, not so much because of the technical issues that we have with the source, but it is the supply chain issues. So we are also ramping up the supply chain for key components of the EUV source. And that is just falling behind a bit, which is only 1 or 2 months, but it just pushes the shipments into 2014. That is the only issue. That's more logistical issue than it is any customer-related or fundamental technical reason.",133

If I may, I got a follow-up about the 7 EUV tools, which are -- it seems like it's -- where do you use this commitment for 2014? What is the difference between a commitment and order? What does it take to move from one to the other?",52

So I tried in the script to be subtle and that didn't work. So I'm going to be [indiscernible]. At this moment, there is indeed an acceleration of interest of EUV because, in fact, we are seeing to make our duty and have enough data that's say it's possible. Then the customers are starting to see that it's a huge opportunity, but a huge problem. Because if they choose to execute EUV with less enthusiasm than their competition, they can get significantly behind, okay? So it's very clear that you have a risk level, which is not yet proven. We still have to do some effort every quarter, as we said today. And on the other hand, you still need to take the right risk to avoid being late in developing a chip, which will be significantly worse if you don't use EUV to reach its maximum extent. But if you plan it and EUV is not exactly performing, you did the wrong thing. So that is an obvious question. At this moment, we see a huge momentum in the discussion of how many units and layers will need to be reserved for whom in due time. This discussion is much more important than the administrative PO question. So I hope I made myself clear that at this moment, the paperwork is past a second priority to how many layers? When? What's to expect? What can you do or can you guarantee? What are the exact timing? Can I go with a single node? Can I -- Am I going to do what they call a mid-node or something that -- the back up? Or so the back up, et cetera. So all that discussion has intensified. So I think that's a positive statement to say to you, it's been commitment and we were discussing more. And we have not pushed for paperwork.",314

A couple of things. First of all, on the ASP for EUV. You said last quarter that you were going to do 450 to 500 this year, which was typically revenue recognition on about 7 tools. You were going to ship 11 and you were going to rev rec 7, which implied an ASP of about EUR 70 million. Now you're going to rev rec 280. So is the ASP still EUR 70 million, such that now you're talking about shipping 6 but recognizing revenue on 4?",88

Secondly, on NAND. Both you and Lam are talking about this 100k worth of wafers added this year. If you just write a simple supply-demand, that's going to add a lot of NAND supply this year, such that it would really pretty dramatically change the NAND supply-demand balance, and it's hard to believe that Sendo's stock would be trading at a peak, if that was really true. So I'm just wondering, whether you think that the industry can physically add 100k worth of NAND wafers and still maintain supply-demand balance?",93

This is the only way to do 36% big growth. So at this moment, you will hear that they want to do even more than 36%. So technically, it makes sense. So you can imagine that, of course, if PC continues in the wrong trend. But on the other hand, look at the new PCs, their content in NAND is much bigger. So now this thing is going to be driven not so much unit of PC, but it will be driven by content per unit. And the content per unit is clearly going to double easily with the number of -- I mean, the need for solid-state drive minimum size. So it can be less  conservative than us and take 10% less. But again, by the way, 10% less is one thing. So yes, I'm okay, with one machine less, plus or minus.",152

Does not include any NAND. Only includes 2 layers, I think, of DRAM, and only includes 7 layers of logic, 5 to 7 layers of logic, with an aggressive uptime. So in other terms, if we miss 7 layers, 5 to 7 layers, we may not have the right uptime anyway, because technically, that means the customers will not want to use that many machines because they don't feel comfortable. But then, that means the machine will be economically not as good, so we'll ship more of them. So that's why the simulation tools come around about the same amount.",118

And then maybe final point, I think you sort of touched on that, Peter, on your prepared statements. But in terms of foundry bookings, it looks like it came down a bit in Q1. But obviously, to meet your revenue target the second half and given the sort of 16-nanometer of FinFET and 14-nanometer of FinFET that the foundry customers have got in mind for next year, do you think we should see acceleration that could -- proper acceleration of bookings in Q2 and Q3?

We are guiding on sales because the sales is driven by the need of our customers to be extremely specific on when they need what for their next technology ramp. The order process is almost an administrative process, and sometimes you have customers placing orders 6 months before shipments, sometimes 3 months, and it's an application, it's 2 weeks for whatever the reason.

This is a bit less because we have lost basically 6 months of this run rate. But the interesting bit is that we've lost, I would say, an R&D comfort at the customers, so that is bad news. This R&D comfort, we lost it. But then the customers created FinFET as an opportunity, so there are less pressure on them. And so they can build the node without EUV with FinFET called 14. There's 22 nanometer with a better architecture. But now comes back the specter of the new -- the real node beyond 14, and that's one having to prepare 25-ish tools in 2015.

And then as a follow-on, just looking a little bit further down the road. ESMT keeps saying they need 100 wafers per hour on EUV, and you're talking about getting and picking it up in 2015, 2016 from logic and foundry. But it doesn't sound like you'll necessarily or you've -- that you've yet committed to have 100 wafer per hour EUV tool available then, that you're still targeting the 69 wafers for about midyear 2014. So I'm just wondering, can you meet that kind of a roadmap, 100 wafers in hour in 2015 to match the timeline for a company like ESMT?",104

So if you make an average, you'll come up with 100 wafers. About -- in fact, more than 100 wafers per hour during the period of time. And remember this node, the famous node, [indiscernible] whatever FinFET and things, is really ramping in 2015. So the customers usually do not need the speed on the first day -- on the first year. In fact, that's also when they optimize their process. So by saying 125 wafer per hour, we are a bit above the 100 wafer per hour business.",115

Clearly, the customer in Taiwan has ordered strongly and continues to order strongly. But besides that customer, how do you see foundry demand from some of the other customers, let's say, in Korea because there was some hesitation at the start of the year? And as a follow-up on the EUV side, clearly, imaging and overlay performance, as you reveal, has been quite good, and productivity or throughput is based on the source. But how do you see in terms of defect, particularly mass effects and the rest of the EUV ecosystem? Is it shaping up and progressing in the manner that you expected it to do so? And do you foresee the need to do anymore M&A to achieve your target for EUV?",137

Thank you. it's usually difficult for us to talk about customers, and now it's so granular. I mean, you know there are 3 large foundries. So I don't know what to tell you. The only thing to tell you is one of them, as you know, is ahead of the others in a huge buildup of 20-nanometer because of a number of potential customer lineup that we have, so they have to build it up, which forces the other competitors in this business to buildup. Indeed, the orders haven't been received from the other 2, but we know that they have to. So at this moment, what's happening is a bit good timing, where you have one big customer ahead, and then the second one comes in and will allow us 3 to 6 months of delay, which is good. And then the third one will come with 3 to 6 months delay, and that would probably help us extremely well in 2014. So that's why Peter's job is going to be pretty easy in 2014. On the subject of the EUV infrastructure, it's no -- it's not going to be a walk in the park because in this business like we had in immersion, you are -- the customers are going to discover issues. Resisted is going to be good as expected. Mass defects will -- blank defect will be the problem. Defect in writing mass will be a problem. Defect in processing will be a problem. Inspection is a problem, but they now have a solution entering for a while. But it is absolutely standard difficulties. Today, as you heard, 9 months to 12 months ago, everybody said FinFETs will not work. It's very difficult. Even Intel had difficulty to build up this technology, et cetera. But then 1 year later, they have mastered it. So we're probably going to be in the same mode here of huge amount of work. In fact, this is why -- what the problem of EUV is. Addition -- the problem of EUV is not that people question whether the machine we work in 2015 when, in fact, it is due. I guess, at this moment, everybody's getting [indiscernible] for that. But you would prefer to have a working machine now, so that you have 2 years to create the recipes. So it's an accumulation of recipe improvement that, that is going to happen to resolve the issue of infrastructure. So indeed, we don't plan to buy anybody or acquire anybody. They won't have that chance.",426

And it all will have a little tri-set to make this. So this thing would -- if it is normal node, then it is driven by so many detectors that we see now in the portable world where everybody has a tapeout plan for 2014, we will expect a minimum of 300,000 wafers. If this is above that, then this is, again, great for Peter, because the lithography intensity is such on that node that the multipliers for it, similarly, is huge. So if you go above 300,000 wafers, we don't need EUV. It's a big one. So -- but at this moment, we only simulate this to be a normal node, 300,000 wafers. And then getting into the node, which has all the goodies I mentioned, particular the scaling factor.",166

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Craig, and welcome to everyone. I would like to start by providing an overview and some commentary on the second quarter results and our view going forward. At the end of my introduction, Eric would like to use his -- this opportunity to review a few key issues that he considers important in what will be his last contribution to the results conference calls of ASML. 
Our second quarter results came in very much as planned. We saw this quarter that foundry system sales equaled memory system sales, with each representing about 45% of total system sales. 
The quarter shipments were highly skewed to emerging systems, driving the ASP of all systems recognized in the second quarter to EUR 24.1 million versus EUR 23.3 million in the first quarter.
Service and field option sales saw an uptick to EUR 271 million. However, that included one month of Cymer's share to sales. 
Second quarter net bookings came in at EUR 1,065,000,000, which accounted for 38 systems, excluding EUV, with booked average selling prices of EUR 28 million, impacted again by a high percentage of immersion systems, with strength in the logic and the memory sectors. The next several quarters' bookings will reflect this secular ASP trend as well, as we expect increased demand through the second half of the year with the company's leading-edge systems for logic and memory applications.
Our system order backlog at the end of the second quarter grew to EUR 1.4 billion, with total systems remaining at 42, which excludes EUV. 
The backlog profile at quarter's end shifted more towards memory but is still heavily leaning towards logic as a result of the recent bookings strength in this sector. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect more substantial working capital requirements in support of our EUV and 450 millimeter programs over the coming 12 to 18 months. Longer factory cycle times for these new products and investments in facilities and prototypes to deal with the anticipated volume ramp will obviously require additional capital.
Short term, we will also see work-in-process increases to support our sales ramp in the second half of this year. Despite the requirement for additional capital, we will keep our promises to return cash to our shareholders. The company paid approximately EUR 210 million in dividends, EUR 0.53 per share in this quarter -- or in the second quarter. And we bought back approximately 1.4 million shares, which was part of the EUR 1 billion buyback program that's announced last quarter.
Going forward, we will be guiding the combined ASML and Cymer business as one business. For the third quarter, we expect sales -- total sales to be about EUR 1.3 billion, with a gross margin of about 40%. The combined R&D for the quarter will be about EUR 245 million. And other income, which, again, consists of contributions from the participants of the Customer Co-Investment Program, will amount to EUR 17 million. The combined SG&A is expected to be EUR 91 million, but that includes about EUR 10 million of onetime reorganization charges. 
As mentioned in our press release, we will incur EUR 60 million of nonrecurring, noncash accounting charges in the second half of the year, resulting from the Cymer purchase price allocation, of which about 75% will relate to the third quarter earnings. Without this purchase price adjustment in the third quarter, gross margin guidance would be between 43% and 44%.
As to our business, we continue to see sustained demand from the logic sector as a first foundry customer begins with initial aggressive deliveries in the second half for volume ramp of the 2016 of 40-nanometer combined nodes. In addition and as mentioned last quarter, inquiries for litho system lead times have begun to turn to real orders from a broad base of DRAM makers due to what appears to be strong demand for mobile DRAM. We are also seeing NAND orders later in the second half for fab capacity additions that have been planned for sometime now by a large NAND customer. 
We now believe that this incremental combined memory spend could drive 2013 sales, excluding Cymer, to a level of up to EUR 5 billion in 2013. On top of this, we expect Cymer sales to contribute approximately EUR 180 million.
We see also growing demand for our Holistic Lithography YieldStar metrology solutions, with the demand for our in-line and stand-alone metrology tools that could reach a shipment total of 100 systems this year. We expect more than EUR 350 million in total Holistic Lithography product sales in 2013, divided over system sales and service and field option sales.
The buildup of 11 EUV systems continues in the factory and we now plan for the shipment of 5 NXE:3300 systems this year versus our prior plan of 6, which was affected by a 5- to 6-week delay of one of the system modules. The first systems are in the process of shipment and installation at customer sites now. With most systems shipping later this year and with revenue recognition only possible when both scanner and source have been shipped and installed at the customer site, we expect now to recognize about EUR 210 million in revenue for EUV, still allowing us to forecast the 2013 revenues at up to EUR 5 billion, which excludes Cymer, but that's due to the underlying strength of our non-EUV business, as mentioned earlier.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Eric for a review of our immersion and EUV programs and his last comments.",928

I wanted to focus my last comments on the company trajectory, which both Peter and I supported for all these years and which is based on a very simple strategy executing around a huge R&D investment for technology leadership. 
This leadership hinges on 4 projects basically at this moment. The first project is a relentless, continuous improvement of our XT and NXT architectures, so basically today, immersion. Now Project 2 is a buildup of an application product suite, enabling and differentiating the NXT products. Project 3 is introduction of the next-generation, game-changer technology, this is the EUV, which will be required by the industry for the next 15 to 20 years. 
And the Project #4 is the capability to insert costs effectively when the industry requires it, the next wafer size, 450 millimeter, so far planned for production not before 2018.
So on Project 1 and 2, as you saw from the press release, we are, again, proving our leadership case with our new NXT:1970, which is to be introduced in H2 of this year. This is a 250-wafer per hour system, with overlay having been achieved down to 1.9 nanometer. And with a suite of applications, product package is valued this year at above EUR 350 million of sales and growing further and fast.
With these capabilities, we will be benefiting from current semiconductor process complexities for 20-nanometer logic in DRAM. And these processes are more litho-intensive than ever and from the added complexity of inserting FinFET transistors at the same pitch, which will be called 14-nanometer or 16-nanometer.
Even the complexity of vertical NAND which, although on paper, should not require state-of-the-art lithography, in practice, however, requires significant risk-reducing, best overlay and focus capability and requires significant numbers of system as NAND chips volume grows.
On Project 3, which is EUV, we made fundamental in the first half of 2013. We have now enough data to confirm the possibility to ramp system in production in 2015 for semiconductor production in 2015 and '16. So I know a question has been asked about the progress of power and et cetera during the quarter, but I want to remind the audience that this quarter was a quarter of transition between the platform 3100, which was limited in power to about 55 watts, to the new architecture, 3300. So this is basically what has happened in the quarter. 
And within this quarter, we've been able to accumulate certain numbers of data, like that we have now more than 44,000 wafers processed in the field. We have checked further the source potential concept in the lab. We have factory experiments on the new source, a concept called MOPA PrePulse. The new NXE:3300 scanner, which I just talked about, have confirmed 10-nanometer logic and 1x nanometer DRAM overlay and focus capability.
More importantly, even the EUV light sources are now running, I would say, routinely at 55 watts, with production-worthy dose control. So this is an equivalent of the machine capable of 40 wafers per hour in the production of NAND. So this performance supports our targeted production throughput for 2014 of 69 wafers per hour, upgradable within 2 years to 125 wafers per hour. This is our commitment to the customers since about a year or 1.5 years.
So the current EUV data, the current progress is basically triggering now customer decisions. In logic, 1 or 2 layers of EUV for the so-called 10-nanometer node will deliver already significant die shrinkage compared to any alternative technology inclusive of double patterning or triple patterning. This die shrink will improve the cost of the die, obviously, the power consumption capability and the speed. This justifies -- this value, the shrink factor, justifies EUV as a good technology, even if the throughput of EUV machine is lower even than our 2015 commitment.
If, however, the throughput of 69 wafers per hour upgradable to 125, as we committed, does materialize in time as expected, then more EUV layers in logic, up to 7 layers, will deliver process control, yield and cost savings. So first, you have shrink, die shrink, which is 1 or 2 layers. And in addition, you would have your process control, yield and cost saving. And this capability will also enable the technology of EUV to be used on 3 layers in DRAM. So these 2 facets are fundamental to understand, in fact, what will come later. 
The 3 technology demand drivers that we just mentioned, if we hit the throughput targeted of 125 wafer per hour, we would expect to ship maximum -- our maximum EUV capacity of 25 to 30 tools in 2015.  After the current throughput of only 40 wafers per hour, we could still plan to ship 12 to 15 EUV tools, which will be, in fact, used for these 1 or 2 layers of logic, which are compensating emerging tool volume for the layers not handled by EUV.
So to finish, I would like to say that it has been my great pleasure to have met many of you over the 9 -- the last 9 years. I would like to thank you for your support of our business model, as measured by your very, very, very detailed interest in lithography. I wish you all the best and I certainly hope that our path will cross again.",892

Wennink,,Executives,10,"Let me answer that question, Francois. The discussions we've had with our customers over the last few months have taken another step in intensity, talking about EUV introduction, because you seem to suggest that the difficulties of customers have, when they think about not the 20-nanometer node but the 10-nanometer node, using multiple patterning strategies, those difficulties are quite significant. Just to give you an indication, the multiple patterning strategies, we believe, after consultation with some of our customers, that the shrink factor that can be achieved by using multiple patterning strategies at 10-nanometer is only going to be 1.5 to 1.6, where 2 used to be the more slow rhythm. Doing only 1 or 2 EUV layers, in effect 1, brings that 1.5 up to 1.8. And if you use an additional number of layers when we have a higher throughput, then it goes back to 2. So on top of that, the electro characteristics by using EUV are also significantly better. So yes, I think when you think about the cost advantages, the speed advantages and the power advantages, using the maximum shrink factor by using EUV, it is not a surprise that we have intensified the discussions with our customers. And customers wanted to intensify the discussion on the introduction of deep UV at the 10-nanometer node.",220

Wennink,,Executives,12,"Yes, for 3D NAND, we believe that the litho intensity is about the same. There is an upside because there are a significant increased of number of layers. And an upside is not particularly for litho, litho will be about the same level of intensity, but will be for other, let's say, process steps that position etch. So from a litho point of view, we don't see a major difference with what we see today also because those 3D NAND fabs are very, very likely going to be greenfield fabs. And in those greenfield fabs, when you buy leading-edge litho, you also buy for the extendibility, although you could argue that for the introduction node, you could have a slightly relaxed immersion litho requirement. It will always be immersion, by the way. And customers choose for the extendibility over the more leading-edge machine. So yes, I would say there's upside for other process equipment makers, but for us, the intensity will be the same.",164

So I just wondered if you could give us a sense of how much revenue you expect from YieldStar specifically. And given you talked about 100 tools, what that means in terms of capacity you expect with 30-nanometer coming online next year. And then related to that, I just wondered if you could give us a sense of the margin impact of YieldStar. Is that in line with your Holistic Lithography products historically, so high double digits?",86

Wennink,,Executives,15,"Thank you for asking 3 questions, Gareth. You probably have a follow-up. The question, how much revenue in YieldStar, YieldStar products sell for about $2 million each and we plan to ship about 100 of those this year. But they're part of the total EUR 350 million number that we quoted in the introduction. So YieldStar can be purchased as a separate stand-alone tool. But increasingly and especially for the 20-nanometer node, we see that most advanced applications used as an in-line solution with our other integrated metrology applications. So that means that it is part of our EUR 350 million target for this year. And Eric already stated in his introductory statements that this Holistic Litho application group has a suite of products that is particularly usable for the 20-nanometer node and beyond. So that means that we have very good expectation on the growth rates of that business. On the capacity expansion that you asked, yes, we will do about 100 systems this year. The capacity expansion for YieldStar next year will go to 150. And that is a reflection of what we think the needs in the industry are for the in-line metrology solution. The impact on the gross margin of the total Holistic Lithography group is significant because there's a lot of software in there. So they have margins, without going into detail, that are better than our corporate average margins. And of course, when the total sales of that business unit grows, I think it will have a positive impact on the gross margin. I think it is evident if you think about -- I mentioned in my introductory statement that without these onetime accounting charges on the purchase price allocation of Cymer, we would still do between 43% and 44% gross margin on our EUR 1.3 billion sales number. That is -- given the fact that if you've been here lately, you see we have quite a significant infrastructure for EUV. All that cost is currently also taken up by the fact that we are improving our margin for our base business by driving cost down but also by increasing value for the products that we ship to our customers, of which the Holistic Litho product program is a very important part.",378

And I understand how in the near term, of course, you've got some of the accounting to take care of and some of the incremental costs are also rising because you're in the that EUV ramp phase. But more broadly, how are you thinking about the medium-term accretion in terms of Cymer? I think last time on the call, you said looking for sort of net accretion, I guess, within a couple of years of closure. Any comment on that would be really helpful.",125

Wennink,,Executives,18,"Yes, I think when you look at the margin accretion for Cymer, you have to split the Cymer business in 2 parts. One part -- and it's basically also the way that we run the businesses now. We have the deep UV business, which is a very good, stable, profitable, cash flow-rich business, which that will be added to the overall corporate margin of ASML. And you can also look at the historical Cymer data of 1 or 2 years ago and you would get a clear indication of what I would mean. Now clearly, Cymer has stepped up, over the last 1.5 years, the expenses for the EUV source development. Stepping up those expenses was a necessity after, I must admit, a couple of years of underinvestment. We have made great progress over the last 9 months, but it was, of course, due to the fact that we were looking at, let's say, a merger of the 2 companies. But note in the last part, it was used -- it was based on the fact that we spent significantly more in research and development. And you could argue that, that has been a catch-up of the underinvestments of the years before. We do expect the next 12 months, 12 to 18 months, we will need to keep doing that. So when you look at the results for the month of June, as we showed in the press release, you see that the operations from Cymer did not contribute yet to the net income of the company. And that is because we are using the cash flow and the profitability of the deep UV division to fund the EUV source, the development cost for the next 12 to 18 months. After that, however, we see that significant integration possibilities are there on the R&D cost. It has to do with the fact that we have been developing an EUV source on 2 sides of the ocean, so to say. We have close to 1,000 people now working in R&D, of which more than half here in Veldhoven and slightly less than half in San Diego. Now you can imagine, if you do that as 2 separate companies, that is not as efficient as if you would do it as 1 integrated company. And that's what we're working on. That will take this 12 to 18 months to really sort that out. Then I do expect a significant efficiency in the R&D cost. And by that time, we're in 2015 and we'll start ramping our EUV systems, which should then start generating the gross margins to cover for those R&D costs. So it is a long answer but, in fact, it actually says we need 12 to 18 months for integration to make sure that we get EUV source to the powers so that we can deliver 125 wafers to our customers. And that will be a short-term impact. And I think that's basically it.",494

My follow-up question, actually, just a quick one, is along the same lines in terms of how that shapes your thinking on capital returns. If I understand correctly, I think in your remarks, you basically said, look, as part of this ramp, of course, your capital consumption, specifically working capital, will probably rise a little bit still. But what sort of outflow do you have in mind and how does that shape your ability to buy back more stock or choose another method of redistribution?",88

What we did over the last couple of years, basically, if you look at the numbers, everything that we added above our cash targets, we get back in terms of dividends and of share buybacks. Now part of that cash flow for the next 12 to 18 months, we will have to use for the investments in the production facilities and in prototypes for the EUV ramp and 450-millimeter. But I can assure you that there's money left. There's money left to do the dividends and to do buybacks, so we will continue with that. But if you look at the historical pattern of the last couple of years, where we basically distribute our net income, for the next 12 to 18 months, we will have to use part of -- the part of that to build infrastructure for our earnings power going forward. And I think that is an inevitable fact when you start ramping big new product lines like EUV and like 450. But I don't expect it to last longer than the next 12 to 18 months.",181

Wennink,,Executives,23,"That's a very good question. This is why I started the answer to the first question off with the fact that we have taken the level of introduction with our customers to new level of intensity. It basically refers to your question. In order to make sure that we can do that, we have teams on site that make it -- they make it very clear and transparent what the tool can do. And based on the performance of the tool and the ramp of that performance, the customer is going to scale, basically, their activity. So it's going to be a very close coordination and cooperation between ASML engineers and the customer engineers. Also, what is important, by the time that we ship those tools and the customers will calculate how many tools that they need, there will be a certain level of safety buffer in there in terms of what those tools can do now. And under what we believe is a realistic assumption that we will get to the throughput and the reliability numbers that we are currently planning, it is just a temporary buffer investment that has to be shared between the customer and between ASML. So we're just going to hedge the customer together with us on making sure that the output capacity of what they are planning on the 10-nanometer ramp is, in any case, secured.",233

Wennink,,Executives,25,"That's a pretty complicated decision that customers need to make. But I can assure you that customers are focusing on the, let's say, the cost benefits on the product level that makes them to decide for EUV. Yes, there are certainly infrastructural changes that need to happen in those fabs. You mentioned things like power consumption. You mentioned things like maintenance. That is all going to happen, but that is included in the cost calculations that our customers do. And that means that with those indications that we gave them, which are many, so I'm not going to go into detail there, they came to the conclusion that the 1 layer -- 1 or 2 layers for the shrink only is absolutely a necessity. And for the further layer growth, let's say 7, it is all driven by the economics. And then part of the running cost, as you mentioned and the throughput are all part of that equation. So for the shrink-only step, I would say, that is less of an issue than when you want to move to more layers because then it is really an economical decision.",191

Do you now expect to see a higher bit supply growth for DRAM as a result of the upside in orders that you're seeing? Or is there something else also happening in the DRAM in terms of lithography intensity? Because some of your customers are talking about moving to double patterning and we do know mobile DRAM has a high die size. So could you talk a little about the impact on supply growth and whether these orders are for technology or capacity?,102
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2013",2013-07-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3628.0,484426.0,22361411.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,28,"It's a very good question. If we think about DRAM in terms of -- if you're asking a question specifically on DRAM, I suppose, then yes, there is definitely a case of higher litho intensity for the next nodes. There are more layers and more immersion-related layers and, also, double patterning comes into play. Now if you combine that with what we have seen over the last 18 to 24 months in a situation where the DRAM market was in overcapacity and the economics in that industry were not very good, we also saw the tendency to basically do rotations out of DRAM into a leading-edge NAND. So if you combine leading-edge litho out of the DRAM into NAND with the introduction of the new products requiring higher litho intensity, then it is not a surprise, when you look at the capacity of wafer starts, that even with the additions that we see today, we do not expect that the wafer starts capacity will grow this year. Actually, as a matter of fact, at best, it will stay flat, but it could even decrease a little. And that is because of the 2 reasons that I just mentioned: litho intensity for the new nodes; and, basically, the rotation of leading-edge immersion from DRAM to NAND. And that is escalated by the fact that, as you mentioned, we believe DRAM mobile chips are a bit bigger. Not that much bigger, it's about 5% bigger. But as you said, that's where the demand is. If you put that all together, it's not a surprise that we currently see the demand from the DRAM customers being that high.",276

And then on the foundry side, is the order send that you're expecting to see -- I mean, especially if I look at the guidance implied for Q4 sales, it seems like it's significantly higher than Q3.

When you look at Q4 -- it also has a couple of questions in there. If you look at Q4, definitely, you can do the math. Our guidance was our guidance for Q3. Yes, Q4 is going to be a large quarter. That means that from a logic point of view, there's not been a lot of change. I mean, it is largely the memory customers that have upped their demand on us. And as we all said in the previous call, we have decided to build some buffers at the beginning of the year, so that's going to help deal with that upside in the relatively short time frame. But for logic, I said it in my introduction speech, there is one large foundry customer that is currently aggressively ramping the 20-nanometer node.

So it's not -- for us, it's not a problem. You could even say it extends that node from a litho point of view from our own point of view with 1 year, which means a better learning curve. So that's okay. So I think the risk for that introduction is with the customer in a sense that, of course, they need to do it. We just need to provide the same litho solution as we did for 20-nanometer.",110

Firstly, in terms of the EUV demand, if I heard correctly earlier in the call, you said that at the current level of 40 wafers per hour, probably around 12 to 15 tools in 2015 for EUV. And if it goes up to 125 wafers per hour, then clearly, you're looking at 25 to 30. Just wanted to confirm that, that was correct. And secondly, in terms of the non-EUV tool requirement or tool sales, we are probably looking at somewhere, I guess, probably EUR 3.7 billion to EUR 4 billion for this year in terms of non-EUV sales. Do you think that level is maintained as we go towards 2015 and '16, or does EUV start cannibalizing the same?",129

On your first question, yes, the point that Eric tried to make in his introduction statement is that even if we would be -- if we would stay at where we currently are, 40 wafers per hour, which is, of course, not what our plan is, but even if it would be the case, then it is still economical for our customers to still buy that tool. Why? They can do 1 layer, whereby they can increase their shrink factor from 1.5, 1.6, to 1.8, which is a significant economic benefit, even at that low throughput. That's what he was trying to say. And that would mean that you're going to calculate what would the need for the industry be, in the logic industry, for just this 1 layer, would be 12 to 15 units. Now we expect not to stay at 40. We will go higher. So when we are at 125 wafers or even over 100 wafers, then we will have to use our maximum capacity that we have at Veldhoven, which is between 25 and 30 systems in the year 2015, if the demand could be higher, but we cannot make more. And so in that sense, if that's your understanding, then it is, indeed, correct. On the non-EUV requirement,  EUR 3.7 billion to EUR 4 billion in sales, we expect, even with the introduction of significant EUV sales, where we're going to use EUV for the critical layers, there's going to be a significant EUV -- sorry, non-EUV requirement. That has to do with the fact that the complexity arises, the number of layers goes up and what are now critical layers will become noncritical layers. And they will still need immersion machines, some even at a double patterning level. So we don't believe that there's going to be a significant reduction in the non-EUV requirement for our tools. Whether it's going to be  EUR 3.7 billion to EUR 4 billion is not known, but when I mean significant, it's definitely not going to have -- it's going to be more than that. So it is too early to give you a direct guidance, but a very significant part of our business will still be immersion.",372

I was just wondering whether you could maybe give us a sense, quantify the headwinds you see on gross margin in the second half and, perhaps, persisting into '14, coming from the increase in capacity for EUV and, in fact, perhaps, even for '15, if that's relevant. And then second, on the split of immersion tools between 28-nanometer logic and 20, whether you could give us a sense of how much is 20 in the second half, how much is still 28, whether it's still shipping, in fact.",94

Quantify the headwind, well, like I said, we do have EUV-related costs at this moment because we are building up the capacity and we are increasing the gross margin on our main products. So in any case, that's where we find some level of compensation. It is obvious then where we ship the first EUV tools, the EUV -- while we have a significant increase in gross margin for our non-EUV business, our planning for the EUV gross margins when we start shipping them is in the 20s, in the areas of 20s, while we are clearly above 40 for the non-EUV system. So it's about half. That means that if we have a significant number of EUV tools shipping the next couple of quarters, that means that, that will have an effect on the gross margin of the company and you could actually calculate it. I mean, if we're about half of the gross margin, then it's not that difficult. So it will have an impact. It will have an impact of a couple of percentage points. But that, of course, like we said in previous conference calls, will take some time. We need volume. We need volume not so much in our own factory, which is an element, but more importantly, we need volume in the supply chain. In order to drive cost out in the supply chain, we need a learning curve. And learning curve goes faster when we have a higher volume. So when we follow our volume ramp planned, which actually is using our capacity in 2015, 25 to 30 units and doubling that in 2016, by that time, we should be back at our corporate average gross margins. So it will take some time. But the -- so you will see a gradual improvement as we go until we have reached the corporate average as we see it today. But that is driven by, largely, volume. And yes, we have to take into account the next couple of quarters with some gross margin percentage points impact because of the early EUV shipments.",349

Peter, you've highlighted the drag at the moment from the Cymer acquisition, from the pressure that you'll see as you ramp EUV from a lower level towards the corporate gross margin. But sort of looking beyond that and thinking about what you've described for Holistic Litho and with YieldStar in that, and I think you guys had said previously that you're aiming for something around EUR 800 million of revenue a few years from now, also there's a positive impact, albeit, perhaps, small, from the Intel sort of part of your Customer Co-Investment Program coming through the revenue and gross margin line. So ultimately, what's to prevent you guys from reporting gross margins into the high 40% range?",127

Wennink,,Executives,60,"Yes, I think it's a very good question. You just hit on, I think, one point. I think the co-investment program impact is more or less an accounting impact. So I'd like to leave that to one side. Yes, I think the impact of the non-EUV product portfolio is going to be more significant because of the fact that the Holistic Litho product portfolio carries a lot of software. So that is going to be added to the gross margin. Now once we are at volume production EUV, which by 2016, if we do 60 units, you could argue that we are there, then we should definitely also see the benefits of that volume coming through the supply chain. But on top of that, we have now insourced the EUV source, which actually means that the gross margin that would normally go to a supplier now goes to the bottom line of ASML. So your high 40s assessment of where we could be is definitely not an unrealistic one.",169

So would you quantify how long that impact, the Cymer acquisition, will impact your gross margin so that we could take at it as one-off associated with that and then model beyond that as such? And then I have a follow-up as well. And there is also, I guess, an impact on the gross margin in the short term from your investments in EUV, which are not resulting in revenue.",109

On the latter point, I said in the, let's say the 43% to 44%, is of course the rest of EUV costs in there that are being absorbed by the fact that we have good gross margin on our base business. So that's in there and I said that before. Now the impact in the second half has to do with the fact that in the purchase price -- now I'll give you a small lesson in accounting. I can't help it. But we have to revalue, at the moment of a purchase of a company, we have revalue the assets at fair value. Which, of course, is clear for the intangibles and the earnings power on the deep UV business and the installed base business. But also, you have to do that on inventory. Now while the inventory at Cymer is all on order, it means that the fair value of something that is on order, where you have an order that you cannot cancel, the fair value is then brought up to the sales price. So in fact, the first 6 months that Cymer sells off its inventory, they don't make any money because it's already taken up in, let's say, the opening balance sheet of Cymer. It's been, you could say, jacked up to the sales price. And that goes away in 6 months' time. So this EUR 60 million, about 75% of that is taken in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter and then it's gone. So it's an accounting adjustment. That's noncash. That has to do with the revaluation of those assets. On the other elements, there is about a EUR 10 million per quarter amortization of intangibles, which also has to do with this revaluation of those assets, which is basically the earnings power, the discounted cash flow of the earnings power of the business that you have bought. That will be amortized over a 15-year period. So it's between EUR 8 million and EUR 10 million per quarter that we will book and that will go into the gross margin line. But I think looking at the size of the company, that's going to be relatively negligible. And as the last element, which is the -- when we acquired Cymer, we had a remeasurement date of the share plans of those Cymer shares that turned into ASML shares. And that, over the next -- until the end of next year, I think first quarter 2015, will create a compensation expense, which we need to book. But that will show up in several lines. It will be in the R&D line because it relates to people, will be in SG&A line because it relates to people, will be in the gross margin line because it relates to people. So that will be spread all over. Those are all accounting adjustments, which are noncash, but it has to -- but it is what it is. So I think that is really the major impact. When you think about gross margins, you have to think about the base business. Now the ASML base business consists of our immersion business and our holistic application business, which are very good gross margins. We have -- the next 2 years, we have the ramp up of EUV, which will have a dilutive effect when we start. It is inevitable, but the numbers won't be that big. So that is ASML. Cymer has very good gross margins because they have an installed base business which is very profitable with very healthy gross margins. And I said earlier, you can refer to the Cymer historical financial statements, so you can see what that is. So from an operational point of view, I think the gross margins are healthy, but they will be impacted by some accounting adjustments, and over the next 2 years by the introduction of EUV. And I think I explained that in the previous answer.",664

That was before the contribution of the co-investment program. We said in the previous call that could go to around EUR 900 million next year. Cymer's R&D is just above EUR 100 million. We are now guiding on EUR 245 million per quarter -- for the third quarter. And it is my assessment that we will not go over the EUR 1 billion if you put the 2 companies together. So that is the EUR 900 million next year plus about EUR 100 million of Cymer. And our current plan is to stay within the EUR 1 billion, so that's EUR 250 million per quarter. On SG&A, the run rate is about EUR 65 million for ASML, about EUR 13 million, EUR 14 million for Cymer, so it's just under EUR 80 million run rate.

If you -- I don't think we're at the end of that yet, so I think memory for the next few quarters will probably stay at a good momentum. IDM is pretty predictable, but that basically is a result of the shipment plan and our adherence and their adherence to 6 months order lead time. So that is just going according to plan. And logic, logic will stay strong because we are ramping the 20-nanometer node and there's only one major logic player -- logic foundry that is currently ramping the 20-nanometer node and the rest has to follow. So I think there's going to be a mix whereby logic will stay strong, but also, we will see the return of our memory customers.",138

Wennink,,Executives,2,"Thank you, Craig, and welcome to everyone. I would like to take, first, a few minutes at the beginning of our call to provide an overview and some commentary on our third quarter results, our business outlook and our product strategy going forward.
The third quarter results came in very much as guided and were largely driven by foundry sales at 60%, with memory system sales following at 40% of total system sales. The core 2 shipments were again highly skewed towards emerging systems at 88% of total system sales, driving the ASP of all systems sold in the third quarter to a record high of EUR 28.2 million versus EUR 24.1 million in the second quarter.
Service and field option sales grew significantly to close to EUR 360 million, now including 3 months of Cymer service sales, as well as higher performance-enhancing field option sales.
Third quarter bookings came in at EUR 1.4 billion for 51 systems, excluding EUV, with booked ASPs at around EUR 27.7 million, impacted again by a high percentage of emerging systems with relative strength in all sectors. 
Our system order backlog at the end of Q3 grew further to EUR 1.8 billion, with total systems growing to 59 systems, excluding EUV.
The backlog profile at quarter end is nicely balanced between all major sectors driven by increased memory and IDM bookings.
As a reminder, we are now guiding the combined ASML and Cymer businesses as one business. For Q4, we expect total sales to be at a record high of about EUR 1.8 billion with a gross margin between 43% and 44%, including an impact for noncash purchase price accounting adjustments related to the Cymer acquisition, without which, our gross margin would've been about 1.6% higher.
The short-term impact caused by the noncash purchase price accounting adjustments will cease after Q4. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect to recognize revenue for 1 of the 3 EUV systems that we expect to ship this year. The first series of such systems will not contribute to profit due to the low utilization of our EUV manufacturing infrastructure, early learning curve costs in our supply chain, and directly resulting from the Cymer acquisition, at the cost of the liability to upgrade the first 11 EUV sources in the field, which cost is now assumed by ASML. Excluding the 1 NXE:3300B, the Q4 gross margin would also be about 1.6% higher. 
Combined R&D for the quarter will be about EUR 255 million and other income, which again consists of contributions from participants of the Customer Co-Investment Program, of EUR 17 million. 
Combined SG&A is again expected about EUR 90 million, including EUR 10 million of final restructuring charges not occurring after Q4.
As to our business status, Foundry customers are demonstrating sustained litho system requirements and continue with aggressive deliveries in Q4 for volume ramp of the 20 to 16 or 14-nanometer combined nodes. In addition, we have seen healthy order patterns from a broad base of DRAM makers, mostly for technology upgrades due to what appears to be strong demand for mobile DRAM. 
We are also now seeing the previously anticipated NAND orders for fab capacity additions that have been planned for some time. Deliveries will begin in this quarter and will continue into the first half of 2014. This quarter's order strength, along with expected continued strength in Q4, gives us good visibility into the first half of 2014. Based on these indications, we believe that sales levels in the first half 2014 will be similar to those of the second half of 2013, both excluding EUV.
We see growing demand for our Holistic Lithography YieldStar metrology solutions and expect that our combined Holistic Lithography product sales could grow towards 10% of sales. We have shipped just over 100 systems since the product introduction. These metrology systems generate data for our Holistic Lithography products that control overlay, CD and focus for the most advanced and complex process nodes of our customers.
EUV system integration work continues to progress steadily, with source and integrated system stability now being the main medium-term focus in support of our current 2013 and '14 shipment plan. 
We now expect shipment of 3 NXE:3300B systems this year with the first systems in the process of shipment and installation at customer sites.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to recognize revenue for 1 NXE:3300B system. The delay of revenue recognition for 2 EUV systems to early 2014 was caused by the delayed delivery and qualification of some system components. 
Despite the lower-than-planned revenue recognition of EUV systems, we are still able to meet our previously guided 2013 revenues of up to EUR 5.2 billion, due to the underlying strength of our non-EUV business, as mentioned earlier.
In last quarter's conference call, we discussed the company's trajectory, which is based on the execution around a very significant R&D investment for technology leadership, execution of the strategy in pursuit of continued cost-effective shrink for our customers, supports the continuation of Moore's Law, and involves 4 pillars: First, it is the continued significant performance improvements of our current XT and NXT architectures, which will enable the most cost effective, leading-edge imaging solutions, addressing imaging complexity over the 20, 16 to 14-nanometer nodes and the related multipath patterning strategies. Secondly, the buildup of our application products, enabling and differentiating further our NXT products in support of sub-20-nanometer process control challenges, many of them related to aforementioned multipath patterning strategies. Third, the timely introduction of EUV, which is the next-generation litho technology necessary to enable continued die shrinks in accordance with Moore's Law, thus producing large cost reduction, power savings and further device performance improvements. And fourth, the capability to ensure, cost effectively, the next wafer size, 450 mm, when the industry requires it.
We have begun delivering our new NXT:1970 in support of our customer needs for multipath patterning at advanced logic nodes. This machine maintains world-leading performance of 250 wafers per hour, with overlay achievements at less than 2 nanometer, along with a suite of application process control product packages being adopted in full at a leading foundry logic device manufacturer. 
By providing these capabilities, we will benefit from the current semiconductor process complexities for 20-nanometer logic and DRAM, and from the added complexity of inserting FinFET transistors at this stage. 
The complexity of vertical NAND also requires best available overlay and focus capability, and will furthermore require a significant number of emerging systems, as NAND chip volumes will grow.
Regarding EUV, light sources for our product -- for our production where the NXE:3300B scanners are being integrated for automated and reliable productivity at customer development fabs. We remain on target to provide 70 wafers per hour performance next year, upgradeable to 125 wafer per hour in 2015.
We are now also fully engaged in planning discussions on EUV insertion with logic customers who are seeking the most cost effective and lowest risk lithography solutions for the next-generation product and processes. 
We have learned from very recent discussions with leading logic customers that they have succeeded to develop 2 lithography introduction strategies for the 10-nanometer node. They will either use a very intensive immersion-centric approach, or an EUV-centric approach for the 10-nanometer critical layers. 
This successful development of a double-litho strategy approach will allow our logic customers to disclose designed rules to their customers in early 2014 for the next node and to begin this next node development on known lower-risk immersion-based processes, while at the same time closely monitoring EUV performance improvements for potential layer-by-layer insertion when those improvements become available throughout the first half of 2014. 
This allows an extra 6 to 9 months for a final decision on the EUV introduction strategy through the second half of 2014, instead of the end of 2013, as originally planned.
Since the benefits of EUV are clearly understood and any future node will surely require a significant amount of EUV, customers are indicating that they are likely to introduce EUV as soon as possible, in order to gain experience in the full industrialization of EUV into manufacturing. 
And as mentioned in the previous quarter, the most likely implementation scenarios for EUV appear to be Phase 1 in foundry logic, 1 or 2 layers of EUV for the 10-nanometer node to deliver tighter shrink, better yields and shorter cycle times. With this, we estimate first phase base demand for approximately 12 to 15 EUV units in 2015. 
In this scenario, a significant number of immersion tools will be additionally required for those critical layers not handled by EUV. 
Then Phase 2. When the throughput levels of the current roadmap are achieved, then more EUV layers in foundry logic will deliver additional process control, yield cycle time and cost savings. Additionally, up to 3 layers in DRAM will be supported with these throughput levels, and we will then expect to ship our maximum EUV capacity of 25 to 30 units in 2015.
Now based upon the EUV progress over the last few quarters, customers have intensified their cooperation with us, allocating investments and resources focused on potential insertion of EUV in leading processes. 
We will continue to work closely with our customers to determine the most vital insertion points and timing, such that a smooth transition to this necessary new technology is made.
And with that, I'd like to conclude. And I will take -- like to take your questions.",1572

The 10% of sales, we have target to reach it by the end of next year. And as I mentioned earlier, the -- you will find those sales back into the ASP increase of our NXT products and especially our leading-edge products, because they will be part of the configuration, and you'll see it as part of the field option and system sales. As to the gross margin, as there's a lot of software in there, and you can already see in our guidance what it means for our core business. When you look at the Q4 guidance, we guide between 43% and 44% gross margin. We have this accounting issue on the purchase price accounting, which is a -- has a noncash adjustment, which will go away at the end of Q4, which is a 1.6% impact. And EUV also has a 1.6% impact. So when you carve out our core business, which is what the company is today, then you have a 3.2% impact in Q4. If you add that back to the 43%, 44%, we are between 46% and 47% margin which, as you know, is something we've never seen before. And that is, for a part, driven by the fact that those application products which are increasingly required and to address the process complexity at the 20-nanometer nodes, that is what is driving the gross margin up. So they are, in short, significantly above the average corporate gross margins, and help to stimulate the gross margin of our core business.",255

Wennink,,Executives,8,"When we -- when you -- your first question is on the gross margin next year. Like we said in the introductory, but also was mentioned in the press release and in the introductory statements, we have always assumed as about a 20% gross margin on the systems that we are shipping as part of the first series. With the acquisition of Cymer, we also assumed the cost of the upgrade liability that Cymer had towards ASML. That is now part of the ASML cost structure. And if only the upgrade liability for the first 11 systems, so it's basically the 3300 systems being upgraded to the 3350, and those costs are now hitting the EUV gross margin for the first 11 systems. So the first 11 systems do not contribute to profit. Afterwards, we will be at the gross profit targets that were mentioned before. So low 20s, that is our target after the first 11 systems. And then we need about 2 years to get to gross margin targets that are in the vicinity of our corporate average, which is not changed from what we said before.",189

And I think some people were expecting 80 watts, maybe now, maybe later in the next few months. I mean, especially your customers to take decision, how many EUV layers they would use in the next several years. So what's going on with the laser at the moment at 80 watts? And is there any reason to believe that the number of EUV tool shipments in 2017 will be less than 5 units a month?",85
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 16, 2013",2013-10-16,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3762.0,528314.0,24177999.0,Answer,P. Wennink,,Executives,11,"Okay. Those are many questions in one question. So with respect to the EUV laser situation, there has been and there is a very singular focus on the wattage, which basically where we are today, is not the main focus that we have. We will get to 80 watts. The issue that we currently have, and is also shown as you mentioned in the introductory statement, is that we have a pushout of 2 systems, basically driven by the delayed receipt of components and the qualification of those components, which are very important to create a stable EUV source. So stability is our key focus today. And when we reach that stability and get those qualified components in on time, which actually led to about 1 month delay in this quarter or the last quarter, that means that we will have -- sorry, actually, somebody just asked something. That actually means that we will, in that particular case, ship our units starting the end of this year with about 3 units. And we are focusing, like I said before, on making the 2 stable. And this stability is our key focus. Now our tax rate and our factory is in need of a stable and an upgradable source. And we're not going to ship anything to our customers, that our customers will have difficulties running reliably in their development fabs. This is a decision we have taken together with customers. And you could argue that, that is, indeed, less than what we expected 3 months ago, and it is frustrating to us also. And like I said, it will have to do with the modules and the components that we're getting though the supply chain than it has to do with any fundamental issues of reaching the 80 watts. We will reach the 80 watts. We will reach 70 wafers per hour. We will reach 125 wafers per hour. But it is more the integration stage that we are currently in that is providing us these issues. Now this has been closely coordinated with customers. In the meantime, customers, because we have been so closely coordinating, these customers have developed, what I called in the introduction statements, a double-litho introduction strategy for the 10-nanometer node, which effectively means that there is a immersion-centric node, which is a solution that is focused on multiple path patterning immersion. And there is an EUV-centric node, which is focused on the introduction of EUV at the critical -- at those critical layers. Now the customers will start with this lower risk immersion-based 10-nanometer node solution, but they will very closely monitor with us, based on the stability of the machine, they will very closely watch what will happen in the first 6 months of 2014. Why is that important? Because it effectively means that customers can present their design rules to their customers, which are due at the beginning of 2014, in an either-or solution. So they have actually created additional time for us and them to work together, so that the ultimate EUV decision, as you pointed out, was expected to be at the end of this year, is now the second half of 2014. So we have created space and time to make sure that we will have a stable EUV source that will produce 70 wafers per hour in the course of 2014. Now this is the situation where we are today. So in summary, the wattage is not the issue. The issue is currently getting in the right level qualified components in the supply chain that will make the new architecture, the mobile people's architecture for the EUV source work. This is what we're focusing on today, which is, by the way, planned in this period. So in that sense, we are doing what we actually plan to do. We do not focus that much on the 80 watts. We are focusing on reaching the 70 watts by the middle of next year. And due to the fact that our customers have developed this dual-litho strategy, whereby they can present the 10-nanometer design rules to their customers, has created time and space for the development of the EUV solution at 70 wafers per hour. And this is where we are today. I think it's a long answer, but its effect tries to summarize where we are. I hope that is clear.",731

Now on 2017, like I said in the introductory statement, there are, in fact, 2 phases. The first phase is based on the better shrink capabilities and the better yield opportunities. There is a first phase node you could say that encompasses about 12 to 15 units in 2015 that only addresses 1 or 2 layers for the 10-nanometer logic node. Now the second phase is whereby when we reach the throughput roadmap, that we have currently on the roadmap, which is 70 wafers per hour in 2014 and 125 in 2015. When we reach that, and like we have said, we have created with our customers time -- more space and time to get there by the middle of 2014, then more layers will be adopted on EUV, and also DRAM at 60-nanometer will come into play. That will mean that we need our full 25- to 30-unit capacity in 2015. So when that happens, then 2016 and '17 are as earlier guided. But like I said, this first phase needs to happen first. And when we execute on the throughput roadmap, there will be a second phase, leading us to the 25, 30 units and the 50- to 60-unit potential for 2016 and '17. So the first half of 2014 developments and the coordination with our customers will drive their change and will drive their choices. So that will be particularly important over the next 6 to 9 months. Is that clear, Francois?",246

So on 80 watts, we're sort of pushing that up maybe 1 month or so, just due to the ability to get the components from the supply chain. But you had previously said that it would take you 2 years to upgrade to 250 watts, which was sort of implying kind of a 2016 for that. Now you sound more confident, actually, in being able to get there within one year, which would sort of imply 2015 to get to 250 watts. So maybe a little bit pushout near term, but a little more confidence longer term. I guess I'm wondering, a, is that the right read? And b, what gives you the confidence in that, in being able to pull in that longer-term target to get to 250 watts?",145

You are right with your comments on the 80 watts. I mean, it's basically our current focus on getting the right component and qualified components in, which could lead to a 1 or 2-month delay. But that doesn't effectively has an impact on the throughput roadmap, which is 70 wafers per hour next year and 125 in 2015. And 125 wafers per hour is 250 watts.

When we look 6 months ago, I think the order intake on the logic is developing as we planned, which is also driven by the very clear roadmap that customers have presented to us. Very clear in terms of the wafer capacity that they needed to add by the end of the year, and they're executing on this. So there's no change. What has changed in terms of order intake for the second half of the year was memory. And clearly, we anticipated the NAND capacity additions, but we're now also seeing requirements from DRAM customers. And I think that was different than what we saw 6 months ago. And I know it's a more extended answer than you asked for, but I think it best represents the order and the backlog situation.",140

Let's inspect them. The mask and inspection and repairs which is, in fact, the focus that customers are putting on this, is good news. Because it means that -- and this is also how we feel it, that they know that for an EUV infrastructure, you don't only need a lithography machine, you need more. It is not only mask, it's also photoresist. So yes, we have been in discussions with customers, or at least they have shared with us their ideas of what needs to be done. Now clearly, we've seen increased activity in the equipment industry as it relates to mask inspections over the last, I would say, introspectively, over the last 6 months, whereby we have also started discussions with partners in the industry and see where we can help. Now for volume production EUV, the mask inspection tool is not needed. You can do mask in especially -- or basically using our litho scanner. That's very expensive. You basically check the mask on the wafer. That is what they will
do in their preproduction, which basically means that mask inspection can be done, but ultimately, when you go into volume production by 2017, you want to have a mask inspection tool by not using the very valuable time of your litho EUV scanner. So for the time being, it's not a major issue, but it is something that needs to be resolved by 2017. And that is where contacts are now intensified with customers, but also with other players in the industry. And I think it will be done.

I think on the first 11 systems, when we upgrade from the 30 -- to the 30, 50, we actually are now in a situation where we almost have to completely revamp the whole source. So we could say, for the first 11 system, we need 2 sources, which is, of course, not our plan going forward. When we moved to the 30, 50, it will be the final EUV source, the final architecture. It's the mobile people's architecture. You might remember that we started the EUV source in what we call the normal mode, which is in different architecture, and now we need to upgrade to mobile [indiscernible].

Yes, it's -- I will answer it as a bit more broadly, but you are indeed correct. It means that if you go to us, it is dual strategy, which actually the whole dual litho strategy was developed to make sure that our customers can present a design rule package to their customers. And so they have an either-or strategy, which means that the either strategy, which is the deep UV centrical -- immersion-centric strategy is a highly litho-intensive one because it adds a few litho layers, which are highly critical ones. So yes, as a result of that strategy and being able to present a set of design rules that are either/or on 10 nanometer, yes, the consequence is that this will be more litho intensive.",131

I think on the 7 nanometer, I think there is consensus with everybody that, that is an EUV node only. And that's why I think -- in any case, the phase 1 approach that I mentioned will happen because if this is difficult technology, if you do full immersion, no EUV on 10 nanometer, then the learning curve will be almost vertical, which for 7 nanometer is a major issue. So I believe that customers will go for a controlled EUV insertion in any case despite the throughput, no matter what the throughput is. And if the throughput is what our roadmap says, then we clearly have an upside. So it is because of that reason that we need EUV at 7 nanometer. That is, I think, a driver for an EUV insertion, at least a few nodes or a few layers at the 10-nanometer node.",147

I think with respect to one of your question, we have not -- you could say, it was not our decision to tell our customers you have to delay your decision to the second half of 2014. It has been the transparent and open discussion that we have with them whereby they said we are going to develop this dual -- this double strategy, which actually is good for them and it is good for us because they can present their customers with a solution and we create time and space for the development and the introduction of EUV. Now when we reach those throughput levels, then your question is will you have the output capacity to move to 25 to 30 units. Now from an industrial capacity, yes, we do. From a supply chain point of view, there are only very, very few components. And you can think about the optics, for instance, that has a lead time that is a bit longer. Now lead times are coming down as we speak. So when that decision is taken up by the end of 2014, as you say, but in the second half, then we will be able, when we know what our customer's decision is in the second half of 2014, to have an impact on our outlook in the second half of 2015. So we will be able to accelerate in 2015 because we will have the industrial capacity, i.e., we will have the factory, we'll have the people and we will potentially have to preorder 1 or 2 very critical components like the POBs, which are the projection optics boxes, which, given the opportunity, we will probably do. But we have time to take that position. So yes, we will be able to respond, but customers will not wait till the end of 2014. It will be in the second -- somewhere in the -- I would think somewhere in the second half.",327

Is the -- I mean, because of the additional requirement of immersion, if they -- for this dual track, I mean, are they going to order both set of tools then?

But if you look at -- if the problem is can we follow with the immersion demand, that is less of an issue because the cycle times have come down significantly. So we could react within 6 to 9 months. And currently, don't forget, we are also, for the fourth quarter and the first 2 quarters of next year, at pretty high output capacity. So that will not be an issue. We can respond on immersion. So if by the second half of 2014, they decide to go for a more, let's say, aggressive EUV scenario, we can react. If they don't do it and they need more immersion, we can also react. We actually have that capacity, and we create that into an old capacity, but driving the cycle time and the factory down, which we are doing as we speak.

I'm just wondering if the reason the customers are now asking to delay the decision to the second half of next year is, is that because they've got less confidence in what you're able to do than perhaps you guys do, and clearly, you're sounding very confident today?

I think I want to -- I'd like to correct one of your statements if you say we did not request the customers do delay their decision to the second half of 2014. This has been the result -- yes, the customers have created their space for them also, yes. Whereby they said -- their problem was they need to present a set of design rules to their customers early 2014. Now if they only have one strategy, then they need to take that decision on litho early 2014. They created for themselves space and time because they also won't -- don't want to lose the opportunity of EUV, yes. And I think EUV just presents them with very clear advantages in much tighter shrink, in yield, in the electrical capabilities of the device. So they need EUV. What they've actually done is they said, why don't we create a strategy whereby it's either a litho-centric -- sorry, a immersion-centric strategy or a EUV-centric strategy on the critical layers. Thereby solving the problem for our customers early 2014, because it doesn't matter. It's either/or. And we then create space and time to work with ASML and to work on the improvements on EUV with respect to throughput, with respect to stability. So that when it is there, we can use EUV, which is our preferred way of going forward. So it's not -- indirectly, because of where we are, which we push them, but it's their decision to create this novel strategy, yes. And as a result of it, we create time and space to work with them and that this imminent decision is now basically pushed back 6 to 9 months. So this is how customers look at it today. So the good news is that we have some more time, and that is one. The other part of the good news is that it shows, again, how critically important EUV is for them and they want to -- they do not want to lose the opportunity. This is why they go through, let's be very honest, costly, double development work to create a double litho insertion strategy. I mean, this is what we meant when we say we have intensified the cooperation with our customers on this issue because we need to help them, either through immersion DPV or through EUV. But clearly, it is clear from what they're doing what their focus is. Their focus is on EUV, and they like to create a situation where the likelihood of that happening is, of course, higher. And that's what we're doing today. So I don't know whether that answers your question.",444

But the trend for the first half is that we believe that 20 nanometers will stay as strong as we have seen in the second -- as in the second half of 2013, whereby the NAND shipments, which are basically capacity additions, will ship because of -- some of the new projects that have been announced and that are -- that will take tool stocking Q4. That will -- so that will take an increasing -- a increasingly bigger part of our revenue and of total that we've seen in the first view, there are more that's coming in. And I do expect that in first half of 2014, we will have also some additional shipments to DRAM customers. So looking at the total memory portion, I think the memory portion will grow as compared to what we have seen in Q3 and Q4 of this year, whereby the total sales is for the first half 2014 as compared to second half 2013 will be about equal. But the -- in the first half of next year, higher emphasis on the memory shipments.",260

And one question on the EUV. You're shifting focus likely from necessarily not going after the higher power, but the more on the stability of the source and make it production worthy. What metrics should we be following to the -- to see the progress, how you are doing on the stability of the overall tool and the source?",63

I think, first, I'd like to correct you, if I may. It's not that we're not going after the -- in the higher power, because we are. We are on track to do the 125 watts, which is 70 wafers per hour and the 250 watts. That has not changed. The only issue is that short term, we are more focused on the stability of the machine, given the fact that we have the delay experience. And it was just as frustrating for us as it is for you. And that, we need to recoup over the next couple of months, and we will. So it is not that we're not going after the high power, it is just simply that the focus today is on the integration and on the stability of that source. Now metrics that you should be looking for, like I started off, we have to have this singular focus on the wattage, which we created, to be honest. And I think there is much more than just wattage, because there is the feature size, there is the cleanliness, there is the contamination control, there is the metrology control, there's the close loop. There's a lot of issues that are surrounding the EUV source, which all make this an integrated source, yes, which also translate back to customers, which is not only wafers per hour, but it's imaging feature size, it's imaging quality, it is overlay requirement. It is all these things that all add to the EUV solution, yes. Now I can make a glitz where all these things I just mentioned are in, and it will make it highly complex for you. The message that I'm giving you is, effectively, we've been pitching you on wattage like this was the only thing, which isn't, yes. So don't use wattage as a metric going forward. We'll do wafers per hour. In the end, that is what customers want, yes. This is what drives the economics of EUV, and this is what we should focus on. And we have made it probably unduly complex by focusing on wattage, which is not the only thing. And I hope that -- if I can give you some help, that I would say the only metric that really counts is the wafers per hour with the stability tool that gives, at least, an availability of a certain percentage for our customers to introduce into the preproduction of their next nodes. And I would start with the wafers per hour, and we will inform you about wafers per hour when we reach those levels and is basically the roadmap. So let's keep the roadmap as the metric.",448

Peter, I just like to sort of discuss with you the worst case scenario. So we saw a doubling of litho intensity from 28 to 20 for logic. If we were to be stuck with 2 -- 1 or 2 immersion -- excuse me, EUV layers at 10 nanometer, what would be the increasing litho intensity associated with immersion? Would that be a doubling again versus 20?",68

Wennink,,Executives,58,"I would not call that the worst case scenario. From an economics point of view, that's the best case scenario, because it effectively means that you have very high, intensive immersion usage with a lot of application. Now it could be the worst case scenario for, let's say, the cost. But customers have looked at this and said, ""We can do this, very immersion-centric, highly application-loaded solution for 10 nanometer, or we can do the EUV centric."" Both will present a solution to their customer so that they can start with the design rules that our logic customers are giving them, which will create the value in the end devices that the customers of our customers think that they can give. So I think it all means that shrink will happen, but the cost structures might be different for our customers. But still, the value of the shrink is not in any doubt. Now what that means is that the worst case, what you call the worst case scenario, which is only 1 or 2 layers, means that we need a lot of extra litho tools, yes. Those will be loaded with application solutions. Will there be another doubling of litho? Not very likely another doubling, but a significant increase and significant is definitely more than 20%, yes, is very likely. And that is -- you could say that's the flip side of a best economic case for a ASML and a not so good economics case for our customers is that they need more litho and they need more lithography cost and patterning cost. But it will provide the shrink value for the devices that our customers -- or the customers of our customers are currently planning.",288

That's a great color. But a bit follow-up on that. So number one, can you give us a sense of what your customers are saying in terms of the penalty cost for the customers of your customers? So how much does litho cost go up in the case of, I don't know, quadruple patterning for the majority of the layers and maybe 1 or 2 layers addressed by EUV? Number one. And number 2, how many of the -- or how much of the installed capacity already at 28 and going forward at 20 will, therefore, be of immersion machines will there -- will be sort of used again, if you want, for the 10-nanometer nodes? So in -- effectively, what I'm saying is, how much incremental tools are needed if that scenario were to materialize?",141

I think the issue on reuse on -- one, the cost per wafer is very different customer per our customers. So we always have to go on a customer by customer basis to answer your question, which I'm not going to do. But there will be a -- you could -- I wouldn't call it the penalty but there will be an increased cost to provide an extra shrink value. There will be, yes. And it will determine -- it will be different from customer to customer because some customers have a different architecture. Others have different yields. They have different utilization. So it's difficult to answer that question, to give you a generic answer. On the reuse, you have to realize that when you go into multiple-pass immersion patterning strategies, that not every machine that you can use, that currently use a 28 nanometer can be used at 20 nanometer, yes. We introduced the 1970, which is the 1970 is a new machine with a, let's say, new mechanics that will enable 250 wafers per hour throughput and 20-nanometer overlay. This is what you need with those very advanced critical immersion strategies. Now the current 1960 and 1950 cannot do that, yes. I mean, I would like to refer to a slide which is the pack of this quarterly result which actually shows that. It's quite a significant difference in performance. Now there are performance upgrade packages that we can sell, but those are very expensive. You need to think about EUR 10 million each, which actually means that those fine mechanics will be replaced, which is almost open-heart surgery in the field. Now -- and that also is -- will happen at certain places. But you have to realize then if you do open-heart surgery, that, that tool is out of production for quite a significant time, which not all customers would like. So it's a complex question. Some customers will do it. They will upgrade, 1950, 1960 to 1970 performance, but that means quite significant upgrade cost and margin for us and require a lot of downtime in their factories. So when you look at this, I think it will happen, not every critical layer needs 1970 performance. So there will be some layers that -- where you can probably do this. But for those that do not -- do need 1970, I think the best option is to buy a new machine also because, like in the foundry space, capacity of the existing node, yes, always stays basically available for device architectures that are not leading edge. So if you have a 28-nanometer device, like we have a 45-nanometer capacity out there, we haven't seen, in our foundry install base, many system changes from 45 to 28, because 45 nanometer stays needed at that capacity level, yes. It's always on top. So that I see -- there's a lot of reuse and cannibalization. It can happen, but there are quite a big hurdle. There are quite some hurdles for customers to do that.",508
