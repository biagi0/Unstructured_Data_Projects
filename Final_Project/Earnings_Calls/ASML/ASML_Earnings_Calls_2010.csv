As Eric mentioned, I would like to take a moment to share some observations on the events of the last quarter, as-well-as some details on our fourth quarter results. We will start with that. Our fourth quarter sales were EUR 581 million this was slightly higher than our sales guidance for the quarter. We shipped a total of 25 systems, 19 of which were new. New system ASP was EUR 19.7 million versus EUR 22.4 million in the third quarter, which indicates a substantial blend of emerging and non-emerging tools, we shipped 11 emerging tools and 14 non-emerging tools. Reflecting an increased demand from our Foundry customers for capacity related tools. 
The average selling price of new and used systems combined was EUR 17.3 million and was therefore also lower than in the third quarter. Our service and field option sales were high at close to EUR 150 million, this was primarily driven by productivity upgrades. Such upgrades are not unusual as customers look for incremental capacity when a rise in their product demand suddenly becomes evident. 
And the company fourth quarter gross margin was 38% versus 34.4% in the third quarter. This reflects an improved coverage of our fixed manufacturing cost, cost reductions and stronger service and field option sales later generally carrying high gross margins
We have continued our focus on R&D with a spent of 150 million in the fourth quarter, which was by the way the same as our spent in Q3. And SG&A came in at 37 million which is about the same as what we had in Q3.
As a result of the afore mentioned, operating income improved from 7% in the third quarter to around 12% in Q4. And last quarter of the year, we generated EUR 19 million in net cash. We are glad we were able to close our 2009 with a cash balance comfortably over EUR 1 billion.
Q4 net bookings were strong at 40 systems, value at EUR 956 million, net immersion bookings were at 25 systems, 23 were new and 2 are used, and that this demonstrates a continued focus on technology investments driven again by the DRAM and foundry market segments with fresh investments just beginning to emerge.
In addition we sold 12 new KrF bookings, indicating a continued need for more non-critical systems and support of the leading edge production ramp of our foundry customers.
Fourth quarter bookings pushed our backlog to EUR 1.85 billion containing 69 systems at DRAM that being the highest level of the backlog in 10 quarters.
We are highlighting is the fact that there are 51 immersion systems in our backlog, 17 of which are our newest immersion product the NXT:1950.
As for the outlook, we continue to increase factory production capacity in order to meet the growing demand, as indicated by our fourth quarter and the anticipated first quarter bookings. However, due to the fact that the normal production lead time for our more complex and new leading edge products is still fairly low, we will not be able to completely satisfy all demand in the desired delivery time. As a result some first quarter delivery requests will be shipped early Q2, but now our ramp up capability would have accelerated. And as a result, we expect the first quarter sales to be about EUR 700 million, with the second quarter coming in around to EUR 950 million. 
Gross margin in the first quarter is expected to be about 40%, R&D expenses are expected to be EUR 120 million and SG&A 40 million. Forward furthermore we expect orders in the first quarter to be at approximately the same level as the fourth quarter of 2009, mainly driven by memory customer and foundry customers again.
And finally in respect of 2009, ASML will submit the proposal to the 2010 General meeting with shareholders to declare an unchanged dividend of $0.20 per share.
And now I'd like to turn it the call to Eric who will give us some more views on the upcoming quarters.

So we close the year as planned with recovering sales and the strong Q4 systems booking of EUR 956 million, confirming the semi-conductor segment up turn. This up turn is currently mainly driven by technology buys from the DRAM sector by a fairly modest technology set of buy from flash sector and capacity buys by the first [dual] foundry at 40 and 45 nanometer. We believe that we will see a continued high level of booking for the beginning of the year. There certain numbers of engines of growth are contributing to this. First the view top of 40 nanometer DRAM capacity we had continue well into their [H2] 2010. As the second batch of DRAM players will start ramping then. 
Second, the long awaited 30 nanometer flash RAM and 20 Nanometer development flash will also start contributing more heavily in Q3, 2010. Third, we expect structural foundry built in [H2] including the first year, but also the second year customers. 
With our current 2010 shipments run rate, we have calculated that the [leasable installed] base will support semiconductor unit capacity increase of only 12% in 2010 versus 2009. Upside to this semiconductor unit gross number, as discussed by most industry analyst at this very time could justify improved lithography shipment run rates during the year. In other terms, the structural capacity catch up that we are seeing today, the technology base and the potential capacity GAAP to demand [grows] support at minimum and the current litho shipment run rate, while certainly not contributing any surplus capacity. 
With this demand ramp as a background, we are continuing to focus our product development on product development and new product introductions. We have now converted all our mid range TWINSCANS to an upgraded platform with a higher throughput better overlay and better CD uniformity. We are also ramping our new NXT platform, with state of the art performance. We are deploying our holistic lithography product suite and we continue development of the UV technology. Regarding the NXT our new platform, we now have installed base of the five systems and a backlog of 17 systems 11 in the memory sector, 5 in the IDM sector and one in the foundry sector. Customers if they are ramping up these machinery NXTs in to volume production Q2 2010.
Our holistic lithography product suite including the customer accepted software solutions, producing higher process yields is being further enhanced by FlexRay our flexible illumination system and our Yield star, Standalone and Inline metrology systems. These hardware when (inaudible) with a software of the suite provides even better scanner performance and greater factory process control. 
Regarding EUV technology, we are making good system integration progress that along with a continued source performance development allows us to confirm our ability to ship the first pre-production systems in the second half of 2010 systems for which we plan to close the fix order very soon. We believe that the renewed industry interest for product and technology transitions that we are seeing today. In conjunction with ASML's stronger position mainly due to improved cost structure, that also differentiated and diverse products has positioned ASML very well for its next significant growth opportunity.
So, on this summary I would like to leave it to you to ask Peter and I questions.

I'd just like to ask a question on the flash memory market and more specifically on SSD's just like some of your opinion on basically the impacts of that technology on your revenues if I’m correct the adoption of SSD is quiet modest at this point for Netbooks and Notebooks probably in the low single digit levels, so what I’m wondering is, is SSD's adoption in Notebooks and Netbooks were to reach something like 10%, what would be the impact in your view on demand following that we'll see equipment and related to that what sort of technology would be required when you talk to your customers to get to the sort of break, sort of inflection point on pricing to re-drive adoption of SSD's?

The customers I think have started to indicate to us that the amount rate is probably going to increase due to two things. One, they are improving the drivers with the software drivers which I think is more or less related to Windows 7. I understand that it is not yet perfect but I understand its improving and therefore will increase the speed of adoption. 
In addition it is true that there is a sort of new agreement that SSD cost target will be so much more supported by 20 nanometer which is the current development being put in place by the first year. So in other terms, SSD didn’t really contribute anything at this moment into billings and into bookings and we expect this to be one of the upside opportunities of the second half of 2010 and into significantly into 2011 and '12.

I think that’s a message that the whole industry is expecting, that the key question is an economic question really is exactly when do you have an inflection point and an acceleration point and to that I'm not a specialist of the industry so I cannot really answer to you. But clearly, we expect to beyond 10% and we look forward to say 2% to 3% market share 2% to 3% amount rate on that correspond to about 1 billion of lithography. So we feel this is a significant driver of the business and we feel good that it will last next five years or so.

When customers have underestimated the capacity around, they are looking for upgrades which they have no bend in downturns and especially productivity upgrades are done very popular which we can do relatively quickly. So, in the first quarter just to take away some of the output pressure, this is a very popular product which actually brought the revenues to about $150 million. Those revenues throughout the year, the first three quarters were less than $100. Normally the normal run rate would be anywhere between also between those, so between $90 and $150 million around $115, $120, $125 million it would be a normal run rate.

So the order intake that we saw in the fourth quarter that we got for the first quarter is a good indicator that fixed cost coverage will probably our major issue going forward as a matter of fact it will contribute to the gross margin. Also the cost reduction that are coming through what was a result of the cost programs that we had last year will come through so, the guidance that we gave you 40% on 700 million clearly gives you upside when we move to 950. How much that will be, will be more specific at the end of Q1, but clearly the movement is in the right direction and the main drivers I just mentioned.

I mean it looks as if the last three quarters you haven’t hadn’t a lot of orders, almost no orders. Revenues last four quarters were also basically zero. Then you still have $230 million of backlog which I think is mainly Toshiba. So maybe first, with regard to Toshiba and are we expecting a shipment here soon and could you maybe also qualify and whether this is likely XT or NXT? And then with regard to Elpida an update would also be very helpful. Thank you.

Yes Japan is clearly at this moment DRAM vendor, a Flash vendor and a very, very, very small market. For the rest as you know the business of logic is not booming at all at this moment in Japan. So, in the DRAM sector there is a definitely split business between Japan and Taiwan in terms of Elpida, and we are happy as you know to have won their confidence I think that is public and as you know they have announced themselves that they are ramping their production as of Q1. So this production is going to be split between Taiwan and Japan. The Flash environment in general as we said has been I would not say disappointed, but small and this is because it is true that the whole industry have built up significant over capacity which took 2009 to be digested and it is highly possible that Toshiba in fact it is clearly the case of Toshiba. 
So, we have also said that the flash business is going to comeback. It was a revenge driven by the applications we talked about, plus additional needs in mobile phones and additional needs in servers and this is starting to built up momentum as of Q2 and that will increase our business in Japan.

Looking at this regional sales with the importance of global, let’s say global, I would say alliances especially in the memory world where technology choices are actually made but could be executed in different countries than what I will call the real originating technology could have come from country A and it could be then made in country B. So, you have to be careful with just looking at the regional split, because those designs could actually be made in this lets say joint corporation structures in other places of the world and that’s definitely the case in for the regional that you just mentioned.

It is now an XT4 version, the new machine called the NXT. So you're talking about having to rebuild from scratch from zero a complete supply chain which usually would take between one year or nine months at least to be setup inclusive their own CapEx etcetera, etcetera. So this is the main constraints. Our business is one of integration where testing is more important and yes it is easier for us to build up temporary workers or using some of our engineers to do more. So we definitively are far from being the limits, the limit is because we are moving up all those new products and it takes time to build up the pipeline.

In fact this is one of the things we have discovered. It seems that now the customers have this capability of using all the installed base in the, what we call the non-critical layers of the new technology and therefore the only thing they need is the critical layers and that’s why they only buy the latest machine which obviously be immersion, so in DRAM clearly 100% is an immersion deal, critical layers and non critical are basically installed base. Regarding percentages of what remains to be booked by the guys who have already started, I would say we are at 50% of the first tier and we are low on the second tier.

Obviously DRAM supply growth was constrained and clearly you were guiding the low consensus for Q1, one of your customers this morning actually lowered supply growth projections for 2010 because of the lack of equipment availability, supposing we get another 40% or 50% demand growth for DRAM in 2011, would we need to start to see capacity orders from DRAM to meet that demand, because you are sort of using up all the shrink spent this year?

So you are going to potentially have in fact an acceleration of bookings on some areas to try to win the places where they cannot deliver. Our own constraints is, yes, we are indeed putting constraints on our customer at this moment because you start from scratch and at the moment in this industry where the customers come and say I need to have delivery in three months and we all know the theoretical returns ’09, so there is obviously some haggling about who is right/wrong etcetera and the terms we are creating some constraint but at this moment I would not consider this constraints are a life threatening to anybody nor stopping you to buy any nice end products.

At this moment most of us are running our machines, our software NXT and Nikon the 620 to try to meet their customer's requirements. We think that with five installed base and a backlog of 17 was certain numbers of committed production we have proven to the customer that we've reached the level of performance that fits the needs. We understand that our competitor will continue improving and improving and improving their machine this look very, very similar to us to the competition that started two years ago under (inaudible) and our XT, at the time we were fighting or targeting different specification, today is about the same situation the specification is basically the customer specification so we have to try to make it. 
It will have to be proven who can make it which are the products which are at the end of the day have more extendibility, more capability and better cost of ownership. We feel comfortable about that, that race because we are still using a TWINSCAN concept which allows machine to be measuring its wafers while its exposing, which allows in fact you to decide how much you want to measure, which allow you to decide to in fact obtain an extremely good performance of chip presumption. Our competitor is using still a serial method by which you measure and then you expose by doing this it is logical to understand that if you measure a lot to achieve very good exposure performance then it takes time and then the lends waits until you can expose.
So it has a lowest throughput and potentially how your cost will furnish it. So, we are comfortable that our concept is still different than our competitors and allow us to think that what we achieved when we introduced TWINSCAN in 2000 will be projected in the next decade, because we are still using differentiated architecture.

Just one question Peter on the margin, I mean in the previous calls we’ve talked about I mean hitting and going towards the 30% margin as to be. How we've been looking at gross margin then I mean given EUR 950 million in order in take approximately in the fourth quarter, by the fourth quarter of this year I mean possibly you could have revenues not of a EUR 1.05 billion or so. So I mean if you did your numbers sitting today I mean what would be we be looking at gross margins at that sort of revenue level?

But to give you an indication, we said drivers for the gross margin development were adjustments in the cost structure as of that of product mix and especially focused on those products that will enhance the value of our tools, i.e. holistic litho products which we are making progress with also in terms of shipments and ordering. That will find its way partially through lets say a field service and sales, but also in the value that we can contribute to the tool. 
Those are the elements next to the higher volume which will give us a better [load] of the fixed cost of which we said also last year that our target is to go if we start moving towards our focus on 5 billion, that we won’t have our target of 45% gross margin. Now clearly we're not going to be there from one quarter to the others going to be a trajectory, that’s going to take a bit of time, but when you talk about sales level should just indicate if clearly the gross margin will be definitely significantly over 40%. It would be heading towards our target, whether we would be there in the fourth quarter is too early to say, but that’s definitely what our target is and we should be heading in that right direction.
What that would mean for the operation margin, you were referring to, clearly we said also in the previous calls that that could be heading towards the 30% mark and that is easy if you take let’s say the 5 billion at 45%, then you subtract our R&D cost and our SG&A cost you can make that calculation easily.
So clearly the gross margin and the operating margin trajectory is quite clear to us and the higher levels of sales to level that you just mentioned, that would be help.

Citigroup, thanks. Two things, first of all if I take your June quarter shipment which you're actually guiding to and I assume that litho is going to be roughly 25% of wafer fab equipment which is up fairly sizably versus what it's in the last couple of years. So I'm sort of building in some share gain there for litho, it implies that the industry is going to spend about 50 billion, so that’s sort of at a 50 billion CapEx run rate which is odd because all the companies, if you add up where all the companies are sort of guiding CapEx to, it’s more like 35 or 37 billion. So I'm kind of wondering, is it that people are forward buying lithography or is it that the companies just aren’t sort of coming clean with how much money that they are going to spend this year? And then I had a follow up next.

Secondly, we cannot really comment on your 25% share of litho to the total CapEx in particular, on the quarter. You are now talking about not only where the customers have been able to only buy equipments which help them on the critical layers and using their install base for non critical, even for litho, it’s kind of new. We used to have a more balanced situation by which a customer would come and say, I've got the new fab to make the fab work, I need three normal line would be 3 or 4 immersion, 5 to 10 KrF and 5 to 10 i-line and we would take an order for that, that was the original way of doing business about 2 to 3 years ago.
We haven’t done that for 2 to 3 years, we are only shipping the leading-edge. So it may be that you ratios have to be re-filled completely in view of this model. I can’t really help  you on this one because you are now, having talked to Applied Materials, KLA et cetera, but for us we are certain that the guidance that we've given correspond to spots in those fabs and if we were not to ship, the customers will definitely not be able to build even the same amount of wafers of the new products than they even had in 2009 which would be impossible.
So in another terms, you can question whether the run rate we lost more than four quarters, but you cannot question that the run rate will not last for two quarters. Secondly I think you should look at another ratio if you wanted to do microeconomic ratio, you should take the diffusion rate, litho CapEx divided by sales of semiconductors. You will see an interesting curve, you will see that the curve was hovering around 3% for a long time and then it went up in 2007 when the DRAM business got crazy and it went from 3% to say 3.2-3.3 and then since 2007, that ratio is down.
Last year it was 1.5% and this year it maybe less than two or at 2% if some of the analyst are correct. So you are talking about significant number, yes 950 million in the quarter but if you divide this by the total expectation of silicon revenue, you are going to be surprised that we are much lower than historical curves.

When you usually come up with this question, the customers always want NXTs and of course then you get yourself into a mode and say well an NXT has a nine-months lead time and XT has a six months lead time. And then you have to compromise this because of course the customer want an NXT because it has supposedly a longer lead time, a longer lifetime with more extensibilities. So the customer is ready to pay more money et cetera, so you have got that debate and to be honest it last until the last moment usually, in particular because they are excited about the NXT, so they want to wait until the last moment to switch between XTs and NXTs.
So, what’s happened if you will is that we were expecting or we could have expected some customers to be more I would say realistic and ask for XT shipment in the Q1 timeframe, but in reality we could not deliver the NXT, but they basically agreed to that they had to accept a certain of NXTs would not ship in March, but would ship in April. So, now remember an NXT costs 40 million so you can imagine how many NXTs it makes to have this slight change of expectations Q1 to Q2.
So, that’s basically what happened. I think it is nothing special regarding the trends of business, it is just a timing plus or minus one months on four or five machines.

So that’s a way for us to say we believe that there is enough engines of opportunities of gross and what you mentioned about flash not being there already but should be there, DRAM a bit gross not that big at this moment etcetera, etcetera. As much opportunities to sustain this type of run rate that we're talking about. 
So, let me try to summarize it differently. If you and its not us to answer it, it’s an economist to answer. If you believe that we are back into a rebuild up of a normal semiconductor cycle. So, you look at your current semiconductor and we are down now and wherever you are, you are putting yourself and then back into an historical curve. If you do that, clearly we're talking about a sustained gross profile for 2010, 2011, 2012 and I do not know if we are going to hover plus or minus the variant or whether but you are talking about a very healthy opportunity which is why we has continued talking about our corporate target to reach EUR 5 billion when in fact during this next cycle.
. 
Of course if an analyst would tell you, no this cycle will in fact be impeded by a sort of W curve or some sort that is the world is going to have a hiccup due to unemployment or etcetera and all the good news, all these engines we talked about, the fact that there is tons of applications coming about, the fact that there has been under investment for longtime in some segments like the Foundry segment, the fact that as Jim (inaudible) was in fact we were discussing, surprisingly people are buying only the leading edge, they are not buying anything else that that has to [pertain] the fact that they hasn’t been any fab lately but you are starting to see global foundry etcetera, etcetera. So all those good news are going to be impacted by an economic W curve then you would have a slightly less aggressive or you won't have the sustainable 1 billion thing but you probably won't be very far.

We'll be profitable, we'll be generating cash, but it could be that in a year like 2010 we see I've indicated from Q1 to Q2 we see a growing sales trend which will the way we run our business mean that the investments in working capital like in receivables and in inventory will clearly precede the generation of the cash so it means that you first have to collect it in the end before you can distribute. So that was the comment that was made if you think about cash generation that will be good, but you have to keep in mind that there is a cash (inaudible) version cycle which first has to go through working capital and to receivables in a lets say year where you could see growing sales.

So, no we are on the same trend of pricing that we talked about which basically is targeted at offering the customer the standard cost of ownership improvement per year.

Yeah I think on the guidance we give you our best estimate at that moment, three months is almost like feels like a century from time to time in this business so its very difficult to let me go back to Q3 and in July and early August we saw no trends of any booking activity really and just we came back from the holiday period and it was all fired. So these things happened fast its difficult to predict we base our estimates on our current contacts with our customers but now as we speak there are days when we have an estimate and emails from top executives of our customers comes in and they are changing the demand these things change and its could be a few tools it could be like I said and already said 42 million, 40 million tools,  you know if they want 4 extra its 150 million, so its that level of granularity that has an impact so that’s basically what it is and on what could happen going forward I would like to refer what Eric said earlier,  you know there are clearly when we look at the three sectors in our business DRAM, Flash and Foundry or Logic it was quiet clear about where we are and that we feel there is an upside potential and that upside potential was somewhere down the line, we will translate into orders. What will happen in difficult is difficult to say.

In one hand, the memory guys DRAM, Flash have all placed orders for only shrink or technology to have yet to comeback for capacity and on the other hand as one of the colors I suggest that maybe orders have peaked, but it seems like a tool conflicting file process. So if the memory guys have yet to comeback with the real capacity orders and given the increase in lead time how should we think about the timing of those, is that just the Samsung’s of the world are waiting to have more confidence on the world economy and PC unit shipment or something else?

So, I do expect in fact when they will have a need for capacity which could happen with the example of a Foundry guy who is today focusing on 45 nanometer but can get capacity order on 65 that will be on very-very short term lead time. So you will not have a preparation of that it will happen and we are in drive to be ready for these things.

So we have also some reasons and we've some good sources to check whether this is true or whether it's just fantasy.

Yeah it's Liberum Capital. Just a question, just following up on the previous set of questions which is by when would you expect to get the lead time on the 1950 down to around 6-7 months or rather by when would a customer feel that delivery of this tool is not a sort of bottleneck for his capacity RAM and my (inaudible) question is when you first came out with the 1950 the assumption was that your early customers will be from the NAND Flash market and but now it looks like DRAM industry has gone ahead in NAND Flash and placed the live orders for this tool. So why do you think the NAND Flash industry is actually holding back on placing orders for this tool and do you think that the IBM industries especially microprocessor will also adopt this tool in a fairly wide way?

The build up for Q3 is at this moment reasonably under control so Q3 shipment July 1 I would be, I would say on the standard situation where we don't control constrained market.
Your question about NAND before DRAM or vice-versa I don't think it is product related it is when do they need the capacity and I think again the reason why there is no urgency or there was no urgency on NAND in the past 6-9 months or so has been because the big players have overinvested and have been digesting a fairly good set of (inaudible) by the way and the next batch is at this very moment being planned and I think it is again applications driven and or volume driven and I think it is because they may have been disappointed about the SSDs and are getting the SSDs to re-ramp back into the Q3 timeframe so its application driven not us and in extreme machines, a good machine for logic, in fact we have been told by certain numbers of leaders of the logic arena that the challenge that the next generation loads give them in overlay as such that they are very highly worried about process control and therefore the more tolerance that you have all the less budget that you have for the machine, the drift is fundamental decision making point.
So we feel extremely happy with this difficulty. I should not say this in a cynical way but we think the NXT is offering in fact a significant solution to this environment in the logical environment which is even worse in requirements than DRAM which is a good user of NXT. So the only negative part of Logic is it takes longer for them to build up the recipe and to ramp into production. So we would expect R&D to be done now in fact you have seen in the backlog is mentioned that we have a lot of ideals who are in the NXT now in R&D but those guys will ramp probably production 2011.

Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. As Eric mentioned, I would like to take a moment to share some observations on the events of last quarter, as well as some details on our first quarter results. First quarter sales came in at EUR 742 million versus EUR 581 million in the fourth quarter of last year, which was well within the range of our guidance. We shipped a total of 34 systems, 23 of which were new. Our new system ASP of EUR 25.8 million is a significant increase from the EUR 19.7 million in Q4. And it indicates a shift back to richer mix of immersion tools. The mix of the prior quarter was impacted by the demand from foundries for capacity-related tools. Our service and field option sales came in at EUR 110 million, which can be considered normal given our current business commissions. The company's first quarter gross margin was 40.3% versus 38% in Q4. And this reflects an improved coverage of our fixed manufacturing costs and cost reductions. We continued our focus on R&D with a spend of EUR 120 million in the first quarter. SG&A came in at EUR 41 million, slightly higher than Q4 but that's in support of the growing level of sales through the course of 2010.  On higher sales and improved gross margin in the first quarter, operating income improved to 18.5% from 11.8% in Q4. In the first quarter, despite the working capital ramp, we generated EUR 50 million in net cash. With that, we again maintained a cash balance comfortably over EUR 1 billion.  The first quarter net bookings met our expectations at 50 systems valued just over EUR 1 billion. Net immersion bookings of 24 systems demonstrated a continued focus on technology investments, driven again by DRAM and the Foundry market segments. But in addition, we saw KrF bookings of 17 systems, indicating a continued need for more non-critical systems in support of the leading edge production ramp, and is mainly in the non-memory applications. First quarter bookings pushed our backlog to over EUR 2 billion, containing 85 systems, which is by the way, the highest backlog value in our history. Worth highlighting also is the fact that there are 58 immersion systems in the backlog, 28 of which are our newest immersion product, the TWINSCAN NXT 1950. As for our outlook, we continued to increase  factory production capacity in order to meet the growing demand as indicated by our Q4 and Q1 bookings and our Q2 bookings guidance. The latter, we expect, again, to be at a level that is approximately the same as we saw in Q1. With this level of bookings and the ramp up of our production capability, we've clearly created the potential to record a top line revenue number for 2010 that will exceed the previous peak revenue of the year 2007. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect net sales to be about EUR 1 billion. Gross margin for the second quarter is expected to be around 42%. R&D expected to be around EUR 125 million, and SG&A around EUR 42 million. With that brief summary, I would like to turn back over to Eric for more on our view of the coming quarters. Eric?",545

So as I said, Q1 sales and bookings came in as planned with high bookings expected to continue also into Q2, giving us added confidence in a prolonged recovery of the semiconductor industry. Such an upturn can last two to three years if one replicates a profile of historical cycles. Of course, our challenge is to remain cautious as to any signs which may signal a correction to this trend. But the two main drivers, IC unit demand and technology conversion CapEx requirements currently remain in positive territory. In fact, I would say IC unit demand is in positive territory and technology conversion CapEx requirement is in very, very positive territory. Indeed, the large first half revenues continue to be driven by technology buys from the early adopters in the DRAM market segment, currently converting capacity from the 65 or 55 nanometer products to 40 nanometer node. And in the Foundry segment building up at this moment, there are 40 nanometer capacity. The second half of the year, we'll see this trend continue, in particular, as the second tier vendors are ramping in those same segment, with also initial demand for 30-nanometer NAND Flash capacity starting. This NAND Flash has been fairly weak so far. Our 2010 revenues could therefore exceed our previous EUR 3.8 billion peak annual revenues achieved in 2007. Demand for IC units is still forecasted to be robust, as up to 15% above 2009. And importantly, the technology transitions that we discussed are requiring a significant increase of immersion lithography layers. That is the numbers of lithography passes per wafer processed using these new immersion lithography systems. Immersion layers will respectively double for the DRAM and Logic products, and increase by about 40% or more for the NAND product. Considering that there was a reduction of almost 20% of the memory capacity in the form of 200 mm fab, which were retired in 2008 and 2009. We are comforted that the significant and prolonged lithography tool delivery level is absolutely necessary, without creating overcapacity in the industry. To enable these technically aggressive node transitions, we have now shift nine NXT 1950, which is our most advanced TWINSCAN dual-stage scanner, having proven critical dimension emerging uniformity well below 1 nanometer, and overlay of less than 2 nanometers, which is industry-leading performance, of course. At the end of Q1, we had 28 NXT systems in backlog, 22 in memory and 64 IBM's Logic. We expect to ship 11 of those 28 in the second quarter. And we'll still grow our NXT backlog in the second quarter. On the technology front, as immersion processes are extended by the use of complex double patterning techniques, we are deploying holistic lithography project suite, which enables the widening of critical process windows in within. And allows for tighter process control in the fab on the other. This capability further significantly differentiates our TWINSCAN immersion product from competition. For the next simulation technology, we continue our EUV development and are on track to ship our first TWINSCAN NXE:3100s this year, and have now received our sixth order for this tool confirming the interest of now older, Semiconductor segments from DRAM and/or logic arena. We will ship the sixth pilot production tool in the next 18 months and are currently planning with all the industry leaders the 2012 production ramp for the new version of this machine called the NXE:3300. Orders will be taken already for these production UV tools by mid of this year. In summary, we expect this cycle to be sustained by the normal technology transition of the early adopters and the subsequent technology conversions by the second tier DRAM makers by the next Flash memory upgrade cycle anticipated for the second half of 2010, as well as the foundry structural capacity built under advanced nodes. In view of the technical requirements for immersion layer growth, which I mentioned is go as far as doubling for DRAM, we appear to be in no real risk of creating industry overcapacity between now and the end of 2011. Although we will remain, of course, cautious as to the overall state of the economy and its potential impact on overall semiconductor unit growth, which is the second driver of our gross behind the technology node transitions. So with this explanation, Peter and I will now be pleased to take your questions.",730

And the numbers would, in fact, really be between 15% and 20%. So this is a very actual question. So of course, we're preparing capacity for this ourselves. And as I think I said last quarter, our capacity will be at the level of about EUR 1.5 billion of lithography tool per quarter within or by the end of the year. So we will be ready in case this upside would come or is confirmed. Obviously, the customers themselves are ready. Most of the customers have enough space in their current buildings. As you know, we do not have the time anymore where people would build walls and then fill them completely. Most of our customers have already the walls and have filled them by phases. And you have, in the industry, a lot of fabs, which are basically, definitively not full, and are expecting the next phase. But in addition, you are starting to see, of course, fabs in Singapore, in Korea, in Taiwan, which are getting to completion or are already completed and are shelved. So this is, again, a good preparation of the possibility of an upside.",228

With some quarter a bit higher, some quarter a bit lower, around, I would say, the current level. That plateau-type activity could last, again, as I said, two to three years. And allow us to reach, as I said also last quarter, our potential target of sales of EUR 5 billion, or as we said that we would reach on the next up cycle.

You've said that you could see a Flash memory upgrade cycle in the second half, where Flash goes to 32 nanometer. Can you sort of quantify, on a relative basis, how big that can be versus the DRAM upgrade cycle that you're currently seeing to 40 nanometer? You think without a big  SSB-led boom, but you just get a significant Flash technology upgrade cycle. Can it come close to the levels of orders that the DRAM industry is placing? And a short follow-up, if I may, your capacity on the 1950 seems to be moving, at least your production is moving from nine to 11. What is your maximum capacity in that going to be in the second half of the year? And when will you be in a position or are you already in a position to satisfy customer requirements for any kind of rush orders on those tools at this point in time?",159

We think Flash is equal to 1/2 of DRAM, roughly, in numbers of immersion tools in units. Of course, you cannot have this every quarter. So some quarters may be higher and, et cetera. But we would expect the Flash 32 nanometer wave to start, as we said in Q3, to look like half of the big wave of 40 nanometer DRAM. So that is happening as we say at this moment. Regarding the capacity of immersion tool, as I said, I express myself in euro, a EUR 1.5 billion of capacity. That would be about 30-ish to 35-ish immersion tool per quarter. Plus the KrF, and et cetera, et cetera, of course. But your question was on immersion.",131

When I'm doing my math, I conclude that with sales of EUR 1 billion, Q2 gross margin could have been a little bit higher, maybe 50 basis points higher.

Wennink,,Executives,17,"Yes, I think, clearly, we have guided a gross margin percentage of around 42% like we did around 40% for Q1. In Q1, we're 30 basis points higher. That is within the realm of, I'd say, the differences that can always happen during the quarter, 30 or 50 basis points difference, it could happen. I'm not saying that it will, but if you come 50 basis points up, that's pretty reasonable. But as you have seen also in the actuals, there's always somewhat of a difference between our guidance and what we actually come out with. But if so, it is within the margin of, you could call, error.",109

So in other terms, I don't say this to all our customers too much. But we can turn the orders within three months when we have reached the maximum capacity and have prepared the lenses. So in other terms, at the moment, we reach back a sort of a plateau work. We can offer customer very short lead time, turn around the time, which then makes the business much more stable for them where they put orders on the long term when they can do this and they can plan it. And they have x percent of the business, which can be done a very short lead time.",118

Because there's, at least some portion of what's being booked today, that's happening because of the fact that your lead times are so long and people want to get in the queue. So I'm sort of curious as to why that kind of a reset in lead times would not drive a correction, maybe mild, but a correction nonetheless in bookings?",94

Things that can be booked early like a new fab, as we discussed, or a new line is going to be booked early because people understand that the real lead time of those machines are within nine months -- six to nine months because you have to build up the lens, glass, et cetera, et cetera. So when they can do it, they will do it. So a very large part of our bookings will always be on that basis. Then you have a part of the bookings which are due to the fear factor. As you said, we need a slot. And you have a big part of our bookings, which is based on complete surprise, out of the blue. So depending on the year, the fear factor is higher than the blues. There's stuff coming from the blue, and sometimes the things coming out of the blue is higher than the fear factor. But this impact could be responsible for say, 20% to 25% of the fluctuation quarter-to-quarter of the bookings. But they are not, I would say, more significant than that.",201

If we were, at this moment, I would say, because we have now accumulated two or three runs, we need to accumulate three quarters of high bookings. The question is not even real. The bookings are based on the fact that the customers now have realized that they need more capacity. It's driven not for double bookings. It's driven for definite -- I would put, in fact, all of our machines are expected, weighted for, they're all running at a bit above 100% capacity. So you can see in there, there's no paper tigers. This is, at this moment, highly, highly required. In fact, the first question was is the business going to be plus 15% or more? At this moment, everybody is thinking that it could be more than 15%. Therefore, every orders is for used. So I would not say at this moment that there is any luxury for what you just mentioned the possibility of saying, ""S***, I have to double book because I'm not sure."" That is not the case at this moment.",184

Wennink,,Executives,25,"Also if you look at the presentation, 76% of the backlog is shippable over the next six months. So it's pretty tight. And it actually is more a proof that customers are not adhering to our standard lead times, which currently is not a very short lead time, but it is a long lead time; more for the leading edge products, closer to nine months than to the six months. So you have this management problem that we have that we have a lead time, a total lead time in the supply chain, which is in fact closer to nine months, and the order lead time that customers are granting us. And that is a game. That's a game between a customer and a supplier that is sometimes played very smartly by our customers, sometimes very smartly by ourselves.",139

The first message is that most of the industry semiconductors and beyond really are under product pressure. So there's clearly a volume pressure at this moment. And you're driving a lot of demand for that. And then second reason, second thing that I said, which is very, very important, in fact, is the numbers of layers on each of the chips are doubled in the immersion for DRAM, and probably 40% to 50% increase on Flash. And in 2011, these ratios, again, are increased; potentially not doubled, but not far from it. So at this moment, everybody, there's no rush to be overly smart about double booking. We are putting all the capacity necessary to, in fact, execute these ramp needs. The double booking opportunity, in fact, is impossible that, at this moment, because again, we are running everything at full capacity and our customers are doing the same.",164

Wennink,,Executives,30,"Yes, the orders in -- just to give you a breakdown of the bookings in Q1, just to refresh your memory, of the bookings that we have in Q1, it was about, I would say, 20% was Foundries/IDM. 55% was DRAM, about 10% was Flash, about 15% was what you call -- so called hybrids. So could be used for either/or, which we think is logically going to be DRAM. So that's the bookings split in the first quarter. We don't expect in the second quarter that it will be a big difference in that split. And we will probably see the first few bookings coming in for the Flash ramp, like you talked about the 30 nanometer ramp in the second half. But we don't expect a big change.

Eric, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that we might not see an oversupply for a while. My question's on foundries. The foundries are spending, at least, the Tier 1 foundries had been spending quite aggressively since last year. And the capital intensity is about 40% level. And the last time we saw this high capital intensity was in 2004, which was followed by a correction. So as the yields that foundries 40 nanometer are low, like 40% to 50%. And you get 30% more incremental capacity, even 40 nanometer yields improve, I'm just curious how sustainable are the foundry bookings at level of from here onwards?",109

We have many IDMs doing the same ramp. It's quite different than we have in 2010, where 45 nanometer Logic ramp is basically Foundry.

If we just assume that revenues be at 1 billion level in the next few quarters and you have margins that are only 42% from software holistic contribution.

If you want to check, the 45% would need -- we've always had EUR 5 billion. We don't have EUR 5 billion today, but at EUR 5 billion in the future, which we hope is not going to be a very far future, that will be driven by the volume impact on the gross margin, but also by that time, the impact of the new, or what we call, the holistic litho products. So we are seeing shipments of the first of those products this year. They're going to add to the margin profile. But to get to the 45%, we've said that before, that's between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.3 billion per quarter. That is a volume and a product mix issue. And we're well on the way, especially on the holistic lithography that Eric alluded to that in his speech. That we are being increasingly successful in selling those products.

Lead time is one thing, but when you know for sure that you need something at a given time because your walls are finished, you will say that's all. You can say this about, say 10%, I think is shippable later. But on the other hand, there are certain numbers of orders which are ""virtual"" at this moment. These consumers have told us they absolutely need the units but the paperwork is not finished. So that, in fact, has always represented a very large part of our business, which is why we do this forecast of bookings as well as the forecast of billings with usually some accuracy because we have so many virtual orders which are being discussed in terms of the spec, the timing and, in fact, sometime to price, et cetera, et cetera.",179

I think I'd like to correct, there's a feeling out there very often that there's a one-to-one correlation between our lead time, our production lead time and the lead time that our customers give us in terms of a sales order. That's not the case. I mean, we can have an internal lead time that takes us nine months to build a tool. And from day one, from that first day of the nine-month period, we can have a discussion with a customer for a particular shipment, and it can take two, three months before they finally give us the deal which is signed, sealed and delivered. Some customers are very good. They give us POs 12 months before. That's why we have POs for shipment in the first quarter 2011. There are also customers which are a bit tougher, we need to put a bit more effort in, in getting the POs on time. So don't assume that one-to-one correlation.",182

The need for machines and the placement of feature of the machine, I don't know how to express this better, but the placement of each of the machine in each of the places of each of the fabs are negotiated one by one. Remember, these are EUR 40 million each. You're not having fear factor order for the pleasure, especially that you have to take deliveries of them.

Give me a second. No, DRAM is always going to be a much bigger business than Flash for two reasons. One, the numbers of layers of immersion required by the NXT technologies from 40 to 30 for instance, or 30 later to smaller or Flash. There's always a factor of about 50% more, 50% more immersion layers in DRAM. So that's one thing. And the second thing, if I'm not mistaken, the numbers of units of Flash is about half of the numbers of DRAM. So DRAM is a bigger business and it has more technology requirement.",108

If I look at the unit immersion backlog, it's now at this quarter almost 50-50 between XTs and NXTs. I mean, I was asking myself and looking 12 months out, who still will buy XTs in 12 months? Because, I mean, if I look at NAND, we have the Double Patterning development; in DRAM, overlay requirement. And if I understand correctly, in Logic, the overlay requirements are even worse than DRAM. So who's buying XTs in 12 months time? And if I look on it, the implied ASP for NXTs is about EUR 40 million. So is it totally unreasonable to model EUR 40 million immersion ASPs in 12 months' time?",114

In fact, we cannot answer fully that question, not we are hiding, but we're not 100% sure. It is true that if the customers want to have the appropriate target of a lith [ph] (42:06) for instance, they would convert 100% to NXT. However, we also know that there are some layers within the numbers of immersion layers which are less critical than others. So it may be that some customers would say, I want to optimize CapEx for one or two years, and they would have a mix. But it may be that a customer would say optimization for one or two years makes no sense and I prefer to buy the machine which have more extendibility. So to be clear, our history has been that the customers have always gone for extendability, which is why we've been, in some way so successful. But this time, we clearly offer the customer a choice between an XT or an NXT. Both machines will have about the same margin for us so it's not a big issue of what their choice is, but the customers may have then the choice between a cheaper version if they do not need to use a full performance.",209

But like Eric said, the percentage of XT, there will be XT sales. And I was just -- will be, in the end, that's a bit difficult. So your assumption of a EUR 40 million flat ASP for immersion is, in that sense, a bit too optimistic.",73

Now if you talk about 40 nanometer nodes, you have to multiply it by a factor which is a numbers of parties, as I just said, the numbers of layers. So what I can do is separately or frankly, and Craig could give those numbers to you, there is no secret. There is a need for much more immersion machine now on every new node. And there is another ratio for the 30 nanometer DRAM node, which is already being worked on. So all these nodes have a different response. So whatever I told you then was probably correct because it was based on an average mix of different nodes. And if I have to re-update those numbers for 2010 or for 2011, we can do it, there's no secret. But they are probably higher than what I ever said.",165

I had a question on EUV. I was wondering if you could give us some color on the progress done by the rest of the Semicap ecosystem to launch EUV. And I'm always a bit concerned that ASML is a little too far ahead of the others on this.,53
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2010",2010-04-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3840.0,56246.0,4237661.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,62,"The first question about, are we too much ahead versus market needs, the answer is no. In fact, because EUV is considered a cheaper solution to a current problem, if you do Double Patterning immersion at the level of, say, 22 nanometer node or 18 nanometer node depending on which products you're talking about. EUV, at the current prices, is a cheap version. So if we succeeded, customers like it. And the proof is that we've got now six orders. And, say, by July, we probably will announce a certain numbers of orders for the new version called the 3300. So we are, time-wise with the current market need, okay. Are we ahead of the ecosystem? Good question. There are, I would say, four areas of concern. One is the light source, which is basically a supplier of ours. And at this moment, the issue with the light source is not so much if it works or not, if it's what is the power we're going to get out of that source. And at this moment, we have a minimum power which is already demonstrated, which already gets us into a more definitely breakeven of total cost-wise of EUV versus immersion. So every effort we do now an improvement, and granted we don't know how fast we can do that at this moment, but every effort is in the green territory. So we think that is under control. The second part or potential limiter would be the resist. And at this moment, resist at 10 millijoule per square inch, or 15 millijoule per square inch, depending on usage, is being proven. And you can see this resist I make at Albany, New York and at customers. The issue here would be line roughness, whether we can clean it up so that it allows perfection and good yield. So again, I don't think people will tell you that there is a showstopper. The next one is a mask, the blank mask in particular, and the writing. So here, again, most of the customers who are interested by this are big mask vendors themselves. And the fact that they buy our machines, we can think that it is a proof that they can find a way to build the mask and the blank. There are some issues, of course, of getting enough blanks at this moment or having the right -- the defect density on the blanks. But again, as I said, if they've had it or as a showstopper, anywhere that it's under their own control. And when you look at the amount of billions that we invest in R&D versus the poor amount of money that is required on that business, we don't think that is an issue. And the fourth issue is defect inspection on the mask, and that it is true. At this moment, the industry has not completely converged on an industrial solution. There are solutions, solutions like you test your defects not on the mask itself but on an exposure. That's possible, but that's not elegant.  And there are also ways of inspection based on non-EUV source, but on 193 source and you can see a significant amount of defect. Probably not everything you wanted to see, but -- et cetera. So this again could be considered, which I said today, as the area of least excitement. But those guys, as usual, react more when you are nearer to production because they are not a showstopper in the whole R&D and recipe management. They could become a showstopper when you want to get into full production. But full production is 2012 to 2013, so there is significant time to solve that.",615

So you first have to have the tool before you can release all the other. So it is logical that if you don't have an exposure, that the exposure tool will be the first there and then the rest needs to follow because you cannot solve those problems if you don't have the tool.",89

So for instance, when you are a Foundry business and you tried to do the maximum shrink on a given node, that is you give the maximum flexibility to your customers to shrink, there is no real solution. Flash could potentially get one generation more by cloud system, but that's it. Some other customers could decide to be less aggressive on some nodes and therefore, go around certain numbers of years. But I repeat my fundamental statement, what is important with EUV is that we reach a cost factor there. It's an economic decision. So every customer, including the person, the one you mentioned, will be moving into EUV at the moment ASML and their peers develop the right economic solution. So we're not dreaming here. And people would tell you at this moment they plan to convert in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, et cetera. This moment is irrelevant if they do not know what economic equations we are giving. And if we are able to give an economic equation, which at the end of the day is cheaper than anything else, and you and I know there will be a jump into it. Now again, we do not feel highly concerned ourselves because if we cannot reach exactly the level of performance that we want, we can still do one or more years with our immersion machine and we would not be business impacted in some way. So we are doing this because we think it is necessary for the industry. We think that in any event past 2015 there are going to be some nodes where there is absolutely no choice. But between 2010, 2015, it's for us to define the economic equation that makes a transfer happen.",313

And therefore, in the second half, we expect the natural second-tier DRAM, new Flash and second-tier Foundry. But in addition, in 2011, or in the progressive fashion from now until end of 2011, there is a conversion of nodes which requires so much more passes of immersion, which the first tier, who have been doing some things in the first half of this year, will start moving back in, and they probably will start moving back in Q4, Q1, Q2, 2011.

So there's good understanding of what we try to say. We believe that we are going to have a sustained period of booking and billings because of this phenomenon.

You add to this sort of volume correction, which globally is what we call the 15% unit, you add to this the numbers of layers are multiplied by two, and they will be multiplied by another factor in 2011. So everybody is going to come back. Is there going to be a shortage? I hope not.

As usual, Peter and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the quarter. Peter will start with the review of the financial performance and we’ll add comment on the short term outlook. We’ll complete the introduction with some further details as to the current position and as we close the second quarter and how the balance of 2010 will evolve. Following this introduction we will open for question. So Peter, if you will?

As Eric mentioned I would like to take a moment to share observations on some of the events of last quarter as well as some details on our second quarter results. 
Our second quarter sales were EUR 1.69 billion, further 742 in the first quarter which was just above the range of our guidance. We shipped a total of 43 systems, 35 of which were new. Our new system ASP remained strong at EUR 25.6 million and it reflects the continued demand for leading edge lithography. Our net service and field option sales came in at EUR 146 million, driven by an increased demand for our holistic lithography and service products.
The company’s second quarter gross margin was 43% versus just over 40% in Q1. The gross margin improved due to volume-driven coverage of our fixed manufacturing cost, cost reductions and a better mix of higher margin products. We continued our immersionary re-product developments with an R&D spend of EUR 125 million in the second quarter. SG&A came in at EUR 42 million, both slightly higher than Q1 but as guided.
Higher sales and improved gross margin in Q2, operating income significantly improved to 27.4%, up from 18.5% in the first quarter and the second quarter’s a new high for the company. 
In the second quarter we generated EUR 193 million in operating cash flow and after deducting the CapEx spend and the dividend payment we added a EUR 100 million to our cash line ending just under EUR 1.2 billion at the end of the quarter.
Second quarter net bookings came in at 59 systems valued at close to EUR 1.2 billion. Net immersion bookings of 25 systems demonstrated again a continued focus on technology investments. But in addition, we also saw KrF bookings of 27 systems indicating an increased need for more non-critical systems in support of the leading edge production ramps which may then happened in the non-memory applications. Second quarter bookings moved our backlog 200 to just over 100 systems in total, valued at EUR 2.4 billion. We continue to be encouraged by the success of our immersion products demonstrated by the fact that there are 58 immersion systems in the backlog, the 38 of which are our newest immersion product, the TWINSCAN NXT 1950i. As for our outlook, we continue to ramp factory production capacity in order to meet the growing demand as indicated by our increasing backlog.
And our net of outlook indicates bookings in Q3 to be at around 1.3 billion. With this level of bookings and the ramp-up of our production capability, we now see our 2000 sales exceeding our previous peak of EUR 3.8 billion by about 10 to 15%. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect NXT sales to be about 1.1 billion. Gross margin for the second, for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 43%.
With R&D expenses rising EUR 237 million, which is basically to enhance the support of the EUV infrastructure. And SG&A rising to EUR 50 million supporting the growing level of sales anticipated through the balance of this and next year. However we have made sure that the increase of our cost structure remains flexible and have therefore managed 80% variability in our OpEx and manpower increase. With that commentary, I would like to turn it back over to Eric for more on our view of the coming few quarters. Eric?

388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2010",2010-07-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,,67346.0,4964836.0,Presenter Speech,Eric Meurice,,Executives,5,"Thank you, Peter. So as you said, Q2 sales came a bit higher than planned and Q2 booking rose to nearly EUR 1.2 billion, a good number. We expect our bookings level to be higher in Q3, EUR 2 billion were good number. We expect our bookings level to be higher in Q3, also at about EUR 1.3 billion. With this, it is appropriate to ask ourself the question, if the current positive trend will continue or if we are seeing the first signs of macroeconomic slowdown of some sort.
At this point, we are confronted with request for capacity at a very brisk rate and we are discussing with customer the capacity increase plan which extend well into 2011. We therefore certainly see no weakening at all of the overall demand for lithography tools. This could be the result of an industry myopia, too much optimism or could create a potential for build up of excess capacity, although we do not think so in view of the drivers which are very strong behind the demand.
The first driver is a 2010 IC unit demand growth expected to be at about 15% versus 2009 putting the industry back on its historical growth curve. There is nothing extraordinary with this 15% level, achieved thanks to a healthy Chinese market and to somewhat average US and European economic environment. The other growth drivers are structural, the first driver is a standard technology transition driver which fuel this industry, which have been fueling this industry and which is currently indeed in play with an exceptional conversions of the ramp in the DRAM industry at 40-nanometer, in the Flash industry at 30-nanometer and also in the Logic industry at 40-nanometer. The 40-nanometer Logic ramp, volume ramp is now the transitioning from market prototyping or an early adopted phase, to a higher share of the total Logic business.
And at the same time, the more mature 65-nanometer is continuing its normal growth curve, that is the first structural driver. The second one is that the demand for new tools in the foundry and IBM segment is further increased due to several years of relative underinvestment and retirement of [obsolete] capacity by the IBM. The third structural driver has to do with technology transitions, which combined are resulting in an average doubling of the numbers of immersion layer exposures between 2009 and 2010. And this immersion layer exposure increase will continue well into 2011, as indicated in one of the slides that we have on our website, slide 21.
In view of these three structural drivers, and aware of the potential macroeconomic uncertainty however, we believe still that our 2010 revenues could exceed our previous 3.8 billion peak annual revenue by 10 to 15%, with no excess capacity being built, and that we expect this trend to continue into 2011.
On the technology front, as immersion processes are extended by the use of complex double patterning techniques, customers are accelerating the adoption of our holistic lithography suite of products in order to widen manufacturing process windows, and allowing faster startup of production of chips. This capability further increases our market leadership by making our systems even more efficient.
In addition our EUV program focus continues, as we speak, we are in the process of final integration testing of the first EUV pilot product in June, six of which we shipped within the next 12 months. Orders are being taken in this quarter by the way for delivery of production systems of EUV products and systems in 2012.
In summary, we expect lithography system remain to be sustained by one, the multiplicity of technology transition in all sectors, two significant wafer capacity addition in logic to make up for the low level of fast investment and re-target of similar capacity. And three, the emerging demand caused by increased critical layer processing associated with our current technology transitions. Although we remain cautious as to the overall set of the world economy and its impact on the overall semi-conductor universe, we remain fairly optimistic about lithography opportunity through out this year and the next. 
So with this summary, I think Peter and I will be ready to take your questions.

Now about EUR 150 million, so to what extent is the increase in service revenues sustainable. And to what extent is that, it’s probably at the moment mainly related to one particular product in Brion [public] tax rates so how much opportunity is there with holistic products to sell further in to the installed base.

But also the sweet of our service products which include the holistic products that can be added on later to the tool is also growing. The flex rate you referred to and will be sold best part of the tool. And is not part of the service products. It’s in the integrated part of the tool. So it will increase the sales price of the tool. But we are seeing holistic litho products that can be you know retrofitted and those really leads to somewhat higher sales. So there is going to be a trend, we always said within 100-125. I think it is safe to say that over the next two years that could grow from 125 to 140, 150.

So, with regard to the NXT capacity, clearly at the moment you are focusing on reducing the cycle time, but are you also actually expanding the capacity in the NXT fab itself, because I think there is probably another factor that needs to be enhanced to get above 20 probably per quarter.

388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2010",2010-07-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,,67346.0,4964847.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,16,"So clearly we’ve seen an opportunity to increase a bit of our R&D budget as you see and there is of course not in there only EUV investment. We can discuss that later but yes EUV is part of our increase and the reason for this increase is that we have seen in fact sort of acceleration of the interest by customers which should translate into the need to potentially prepare for say one EUV machine per month in 2012. So in this environment we have to prepare a part of our R&D budget. We have also to create this new infrastructure to prepare for this type of run rate.
As I have said last time, we hope to in fact close most of these orders for one-two per month or so, as early as this quarter and potentially we will announce at the next conference that we have those orders closed. Now the question is, is there a business impact if we were to delay the degrees of those, for ASML there would be no impact per se because if we are late with the new technology called EUV, there is still a requirement for capacity to do the appropriate note which will be done by complicated double patterning solutions which in fact would allow us probably to claim a bit more revenue than if we were early with EUV.
However we consider that we have to be on time because it has industry impact. EUV is a good technology that enables lower cost at our customers and more possibility. So this would be definitely negative if we were not to ship on time. So we will focus our attention in doing so. But I repeat, if we were not able to do this in due of the complexity of this project then there would be no financial impact on ASML.

Peter, when you were on the conference call, in your Q1 results you had said that the pattern in terms of your order intake for Q2 in terms of where the orders will come from will be roughly similar to what you saw in Q1, or that was what your estimate was at that point in time. But the order sources changed quite a bit with the IDM percentage going up very sharply and the memory percentage coming down quite a bit. So I was just wondering, was there any specific factor, was that a surprise to you and what were the factors behind that in terms of the IDM orders coming in this kind of volume, and what do you see happening in Q3? The $1.3 billion, will that be a similar pattern to Q2 or will there be much change in that? A follow up if might is on ASP, as you go forward, so far you have been very heavily on technology and going forward we are seeing quite a few new fabs coming up and presumably those will ramp over the next 12 to 18 months. So, will there be structural decline in the ASP because of that, the sort of low 20s level from the sort of mid 20s for the new tool ASP that we’ve been seeing so far?

388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2010",2010-07-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,,67346.0,4964851.0,Answer,Peter Wennink,,Executives,20,"Okay, to answer your first question, the order pattern of Q1, it is not a surprise to the people who follow ASML that the number of large customers is going down. That means that the timing at which we get the orders from those big customers becomes pretty important in a particular quarter, and has also happened. I mean we were looking at the IDM orders base be coming in Q3, they are coming in Q2 and some of the DRAM orders that we thought came in, in Q2, will come in Q3. So that’s the simple answer.
On the order pattern, clearly we will see memory staying strong. We will see some foundry activity in Q3 but NANDs will be stronger than it was in Q2, which when you look at the Q2 order intake, it’s not a big surprise. You see changes will be in foundry, would be in NAND.
On the ASP going forward, yes you are right. When we look at this, also in one of the slides in the presentation, the number of officially announced new fabs in 2011 is eight. There is currently also, I am going to discuss more in a couple, it’s about, five are under discussion or six are under discussion which means if you have to fill up those fabs, you have to have the whole suite of lithography products there which includes dry products. And that’s why you see an increase in our KrF systems which is the 248 nanometer tool technology ramping up in our order book and this also will be noticeable in the next quarters to come. And that means that the ASP will go down. I wouldn’t call this a structural decline in ASP, just the structural trend in ASP will go up and not down. But it is clearly a reflection of where we are, and customers adding extra capacity means that they have a more broader mix of products order.

On book-to-bill ratios, your guidance for Q4 revenues is more or less in line with what you’re thinking about for bookings in Q3, maybe it’s a little bit more than your bookings in Q3. As you start ramping your capacity for immersion shipments do you start seeing book-to-bill ratios start approaching parity from the Q4 quarter onwards and as a follow up to that what is the current lead time for NXT?

In fact I think the same comment which was confusing maybe for some last quarter is holding but if these drivers continues to come in then we see nicely increasing booking trends. So quarter-to-quarter it maybe that one quarter we will see a book-to-bill a bit at one or below and some quarters we will see at above one. So at this moment we are more in a situation thinking that the business grows into 2011 than situation of stability. 
Regarding our capability to address this possibility of growth in 2011, we need to have the two things happen; one, we need more capacity which is I think what Peter was referring to, so we are building up more capacity, more capability per quarter. This has been done by hiring of the flexible workers and updating certain numbers of our CapEx so that new machine can get in. And then second is we have to get our cycle times to be as fast as possible. And yes, in Q1 2011 we will have cycle times. We did production cycle time in our factory, which are fairly more sort of standard to typical for about three months or so.

Eric, sorry just to ask what are the follow-up to your three points in terms of your drivers. I mean for the past few quarters you have been talking about these flattish trends in orders and clearly it seems to have changed at this point. In that the orders have accelerated to some extent. I mean the acceleration which you are guiding to is mainly manned Flash fab, new fab related or is it that you had always expected this acceleration? And also, if you could talk about, historically you have not guided up, given numbers in terms of orders into the following quarter, so has your visibility changed substantially?

So on the DRAM segment, we are not surprised. Its very similar to what we always expected. I can translate it as we expect to ship as many units necessary for about 50% bit growth. This has not changed. Everybody I think is now converging, there will be 50% bit growth in this business in 2010, probably also in 2011. So based on that we had already planned the lithography business, which is nice going forward with additions about (inaudible). 
In Flash, we’ve always said that Flash was disappointing. But that was in the progression mood, because they were starting to move more Flash into dedicated applications or call it application specific type Flash. So this is happening also. At this moment the industry would expect to deliver about 70% bit growth in Flash, as you know so much easier to do bits in the Flash arena than DRAM. And at this moment we are booking at a level a bit under the 70%. So, there could be as we go into Q3, Q4, Q1 2011, a additional booking due to the fact that we are a bit south of I would say the expected demand. And what surprised us or what you can call is an acceleration, is the Logic arena. There are in fact two engine I mentioned briefly. One is 65-nanometer which is the standard work horse. This is getting in fact good, nice growth because of the countries like China and things, and this load is continuing its I would say mix improvement and you add to that the 40-nanometer which becomes now more mature which will probably grow from a mix of 10% of total business to potentially 20% and this as I said would multiply the numbers of layers because you go from 10% of your business at 16 layers to 20% of the business at 16 layers, that’s a doubling of layers and if you know what I am talking, so this is happening in a stronger fashion than we expect in particular in view of the fact that all the customers in the areas of foundry or IDM find themselves a bit with the pants down, the demand is happening and it’s happening as we say in a normal way, but these guys have not invested enough in any capacity immersion or KrF and there is a bit of aggressiveness on that curve at this moment to try to meet their own customer demand.

",26
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2010",2010-07-14,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,,67346.0,4964875.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,44,"Yes. So I usually don’t like that question in a sense that it’s very driven by the ASP of the industry. So when you see that ratio popping up very high, it’s really when in a semiconductor industry has an ASP problem. This happens when they run business tanked with an ASP of 70% down. At this moment the intensity went up and then the intensity went back down in 2009 as you know a very, very low number and in 2010-2011, we may go back to some normalized number based on history.
So what would be my expectation in 2010, I would think the intensity litho divided by total semiconductor sales would be in the 18ish percent range and I would guess that 2011 would be probably in the 20ish percent range. But again as I say, you’re asking me to look at the crystal ball about the ASP of our own customers, that’s a bit complicated to do.
But I don’t see this anywhere problematic at this moment. The second question is OpEx going forward. So we were clearly, clearly managing this company on scenarios, not on forecast. We’re not religious as to whether the industry has to go up or has to go down. We have to know that in an industry, there will be cycles and therefore we have to have OpEx on a very, very flexible nature.
So you will see from published numbers that we have always a very large amount of flexible workers and we leverage our business with a lot of external contractors, so today we have moved our OpEx to a certain level to sustain this business as you have noticed 1.2, 1.3 or more billion euro per quarter and being profitable on it.
If these numbers were to go down, we can reduce our OpEx again significantly. We of course have had to build up some structural OpEx in particular for the new factory that we are just starting on EUV which will cost us an amount of millions above I would say what which are not flexible. Yes, but this is still very measured.

I was just interested in a bit more detail around the structural drivers you’ve highlighted for next year. You’ve clearly sort of outlined it from a topdown point of view. I am just wondering if you can give us any insight from a bottoms up point of view from the customers’ standpoint as to your pipeline that perhaps haven’t materialized into firm orders yet or discussions you are having, visibility et cetera that can give us a sense as to whether orders can indeed increase above the guided level for the third quarter and then just a quick follow-up after that, on the gross margin structure given where you’ve guided revenue to for the fourth quarter around 1.2, 1.3 heading towards 1.4 billion, where do you see your gross margins at that point? Thank you.

Regarding to give you a bit more color on the driver, what can I say, so can leave things which I haven’t mentioned but which are part of the top down and common is that’s most of this industries now segments are getting into very, very complicated technologies. And, this complicated technologies, have two significant impact at this moment for our customers. They have more difficulty to stabilize their yields, so you could estimate that the utilization of the machine and the yield of those dyes will be lower in other terms, such this technology transition requires even more lithography to cover for this complexity. Also I have been told that the logic arena is developing 40 nanometers products which have on average a bigger dye size than the 65 nanometer business, so that’s also another driver and as we say in addition to the numbers of layers you also need more machinery to build the same amount of chips because they are of bigger size. So that you said you can see this happen also but not another caller, when you do things in foundry or in logic in general, you are more doing this by project rather than one at a time machine. So when you are in the DRAM business or Flash business, you can do one at a time machine. You build, you buy some this quarter. You build some chips, and business is good, you buy more et cetera so very flexible type of environment. And we see this in a way where the customers would react with very short-term orders and things. When you in the IDM business or foundry business, you cannot this, these are big projects which have about a year to two year before they have real market impact. So what you see today which is why we are highly optimistic is not withstanding an economy downturn, the customer has to stick by their strategic moves. And the numbers of quite new comers in the foundry business who are committed to building up factories and [lines] which are strategically going to be there no matter what the volume is. So these one are the ones we see now which will cover 2010, 2011 in [admin] and has to happen, so I hope I gave you enough color on your question and I leave the other question on the gross margin at 1.4 billion for Peter. Peter likes simple question.

But I can only refer to what we said earlier is at 5 billion run rate we want to be at 45% gross margin levels. So that’s our target, it’s the only thing I can say.

Could you give us some color as to what 2012 would look like in terms of revenues?

Your question is, is 2012 going to be a recovery year or no, a down year in a sense of some [digestion]?
It’s very difficult to know because we are getting now into businesses where most of the mix will be of high-end level where each of the layers of lithography are very, very expensive. So we are at this moment celebrating in fact a fairly long cycle opportunity for us. 
Now if you added two years, that 2012 may be a year of 12 EUV tools at about EUR 65 million per machine which we will be serving as the rule formerly only R&D and we’ll not really split any wafers for production. So you have a new relay of R&D to a normal business. So as that normal business is anywhere near sustained, 2012 could be again for us a growth year. 
But again these are scenarios of opportunities of possibilities and I cannot at this moment declare that there will not be a negative point somewhere the volume goes down, the driver of the ICs and therefore it is some kind of two to three months delay into what I just said.

It’s a mix driven activities at this moment. The volume part is mainly is due to China, I refer you to Morris Chang whose article I think about a month ago where he mentioned that I’m not sure exactly, of about 10% of this growth was due to China, it’s a volume type driven activity. But for the rest, Smartphone, the SSDs are really moving up now. All these new PCs, I don’t know how you call them, the table thing and et cetera. PCs type [animals] are growing like 20% versus 10% before, so you’ve got all those new form factors, creates much more demand.

CapEx for the first half was EUR 25 million, which was - so they don’t have to spend to the budget at several courses. We will spend between EUR 60 million and EUR 70 million in the second half of the year and that has to do also with the fact that we will start breaking ground of an extension to the EUV factory which we had finalized last year. Like Eric said, really in anticipation of the 2011 ramp of EUV, so between EUR 60 million and EUR 70 million in the second half of the year.
On the taxes, taxes are currently averaging about 17 to 18% of our profit before tax line. That could trend down one or two percentage points when our profit goes up. That has to do with arrangements that we have made with the Dutch Governments with respect to the Royalty Boxes, which is a specific tax law here. So it’s going to be 17 to 18% good trend, one to two percentage points down when the profit goes up to levels off, let’s say based on 5 billion sales.

It could be because we just finished negotiation on price, which by the way should happen now. We’re going to start lots of negotiation in Q3 and probably cruising in Q4. So you can have some delays to that. We can some delays because some customers would not know where we’re going to ship these products, but all this is as you said irrelevant to the revenue number, which in fact is based on an industrial requirements, not so much of a booking’s timing. But I’m not saying that at this moment we expect the bookings run rate to fall as you said to 700. This is beyond our understanding at this moment. So we don’t know more than that at this time.

But if you have not enough lenges and you have to create lenges from scratch or if the lenges are in the pipeline, then of course you will stop and you have to wait until that you have enough lenges.
But as I said if we get to a capacity of 1.5 per quarter out in Q1, we should have our eggs in the correct basket, which is three months return. That doesn’t mean however the customer will put three months return bookings booking if that’s what your question was. I think the customers will probably put the orders with about six months lead time as usual because they don’t want to take the risk of being surprised by a problem in supply chain. So don’t make them although that is because we are getting [grievance] about lead damages. At some point the customer will take risk with the bookings we have done, which would be a bit dangerous.

Thanks for letting me ask a question. I would just like to talk about 2011 and the road of the smartphone and tablet industry, I think some of my colleagues are where you touched upon that, but I was just wondering what you thought would be the impact of basically specs for tablets and smartphone especially for DRAM increasing from 0.5 gig to 1 gigabyte, I mean we could have an incremental EUR 150 million units shipping next with 1 gigabyte of DRAM, do you think that the industry is capable of handling that, number one. And second of all, given the increasing complexity of those type of products particularly as it comes to 3D graphics as well as a more content for data driven by Flash, again do you think the industry is capable of handling basically the growth that is expected next year for tablets when it comes to NAND Flash capacity.

The DRAM activity is interesting because on one hand, you still have the need for having a 3 gig or 4 gig per PC on a normal PC and then in parallel, you are going to create these new markets with 1 gig et cetera, but which still requires low power and forces then the suppliers to invest in 40-nano, but also and you are starting to see some of the readers going to a conversion to 30-nano, so all this richness of application drives in fact technology, technology is becoming more complicated. They need more machines, but they know that they are planning this and this is what we think is the driver of the current year and half to your business.

We will return on cash through the shareholders absent in major investment plans and that cash will be distributed to a mix of dividend and share buybacks. 
Now how much of dividend will be, it will be the subject of the general meeting of shareholders next year, so I cannot comment on that but clearly what is important I think in this context is that about 1.5 billion like I said again absent in major invest plans, we will return that money in that mix, dividends and share buybacks.

But it is important for us to always stay available, do something synergistic which will create another engine of growth. And yes, we are looking into some technologies, we have put more R&D into these technologies and we have put more people in scouting for alternative but nothing in the very short term and nothing of the very large scale that we should be discussing.

So what you see here on our published “backlog” is only bookings for delivery within a year, we don’t record bookings beyond that.
But you will know of these numbers and it will be put on the press release more as an information on technology. It is obviously EUR 65 million except as Euro goes under one to $1 in which it is, I will change my mind going after services. We are a Euro company, so its EUR 65 million. And the last question is, yes we are maturing the NXT.
Obviously, we are always paranoiac as to our competitor’s product. As you know they have announced on paper a product which is similar to our NXT. We are happy to report that we’ve got accelerating bookings on the NXT which means that in fact the NXT is recognized probably by our customers. It’s being ahead of the competitors as product and we haven’t heard at this moment any data that would confirm that this competitor’s product is ramping into a production. So we therefore hope to get to 200 vehicle per hour. At this moment we spec, which has agreed with the customer is 175 vehicle per hour, so this is what we will achieve by the end of the year. We are at 150 at this moment which is a current same value as what we get on the XT, but the machines are upgradeable by software to 175, and 200 vehicle per hour will be introduced in 2011.

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. As Eric mentioned, I will take a moment to share some observations on the events of the last quarter as well as some details on our third quarter results.
Our third quarter sales came in close to EUR 1.2 billion, which is just above our guidance. We shipped a total of 51 systems, 40 of which were new. Sales were balanced between the Memory and Logic customers. Our new system, ASP, remains steady at around EUR 24 million, which reflects the continued strong demand for leading-edge lithography. 
Next is the leading-edge demand. We shipped a sizable number of die tools, reflecting additional wafer start capacity at our Memory and foundry customers. Our service and field options sales came in at EUR 149 million driven again by an increased demand for system performance enhancements and service products.
The company's third quarter gross margin was 43.6%, which was just above our guidance. The operating expense for the third quarter came in as guided, and we continued our immersion in EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] product developments with an R&D spend of EUR 137 million, and SG&A came in a bit lighter at EUR 48 million. With continued high sales and solid gross margins, net income came in at close to 23% of net sales in the third quarter. 
Net cash from operations was just about EUR 400 million, which was also fueled by customer prepayments, thereby growing our gross cash balance to between EUR 1.5 billion and EUR 1.6 billion. As mentioned before and in line with our stated policy, the company intends to distribute excess cash through payment of dividends and share buybacks. The size and timing of such distributions will be announced when it is appropriate. And as for our dividend, we will announce dividend proposal as part of our fourth quarter results.
The third quarter net bookings came in at 60 systems valued at EUR 1.3 billion. Immersion booking of 29 systems demonstrated a continued focus on technology investments, which was predominantly came from our Logic and DRAM [Dynamic Random Access Memory] customers. In addition, we saw KrF [krypton fluoride] bookings of 20 systems and 11 i-Line systems, indicating a continuing need for more noncritical systems in support of the leading-edge production ramps. Third quarter bookings moved our backlog to a total of 110 systems valued at EUR 2.7 billion. Our significant leadership position in immersion products is again demonstrated by the fact that there are now 63 immersion systems in the backlog, 48 of which are TWINSCAN NXT:1950i.
As for our outlook, demand for the TWINSCAN NXT immersion tools remains extremely strong, and we are challenged to produce enough systems in time to satisfy our customers' needs. We continue our focus on cycle-time reductions and introduction of more parallel workflows in order to meet the growing demand as indicated by our current backlog.
Our near-term demand outlook firmly indicates bookings in Q4 that will exceed the level that we saw in Q3. We see no signs of restrained demand for our tools as we believe that our customers, who clearly remain profitable, are in need of these tools to support their business strategies and related necessary cost reductions. With this level of bookings and the ramp-up of our production capability, it's also clear that we're beginning to see a potential for sales growth in 2010-11.
For fourth quarter of 2010, we expect net sales to be about EUR 1.3 billion with a gross margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be around 44%, with R&D expenses at EUR 140 million, which focuses on the second-generation EUV system deliveries and a third-generation EUV system development. SG&A is guided at EUR 50 million in continued support of the growing level of sales, which we anticipate throughout the balance of this year. As a reminder, this OpEx buildup remains largely flexible as we continue to use outsourcing and subcontracting to enable us to manage growth. 
With that, I would like to turn it back over to Eric for more on our views of the coming quarters. Eric?",683
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2010",2010-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3840.0,1155094.0,47773046.0,Presenter Speech,Eric Meurice,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Peter. So with a growing level of sales and bookings expected to continue, it is certainly appropriate to ask ourselves, what this current positive lithography trend means as it relates to the current negative sentiments regarding the macroeconomic environment. We indeed continue to receive a strong and continuous order flow for our systems in spite of some negative macroeconomic signals, like: the PC unit sales demand, which have been softening, in particular in the consumer area; some Memory pricing decreasing; some semiconductor inventory increasing a bit; and some indications of softer-than-expected short-term sales from some semiconductor vendors.
Well, the drivers for the strong demand for lithography equipment are the ones that we discussed before last quarter. They have not changed, and they do justify the current order flow. The first driver is a 2010 IC [integrated circuits] unit demand growth, which is expected to be about 15% 2010 versus 2009, a 58% bit growth of DRAM, 78% bit growth for NAND. This growth puts the industry back on to its historical cost curve, and there is nothing extraordinary with this level. And the analyst remain convinced that these numbers will happen in the short term.
The second driver is the need for next-generation tools to ensure a standard technology transition. That is not due to volume growth itself but to the fact that mix is changing. This driver has very high impact as it is sustained by a near doubling of the lithography critical layers. And in fact, we are seeing, in addition to these, an exceptional conversions of the ramp of three major industry segments: the DRAM segment, which ramps 40 nanometer; the Flash segments, ramping 30 nanometer; and the Logic segment, ramping 40 nanometer. And all of these happening at the same time, which is pretty rare.
The third driver has to do with the structural capacity development in the foundry world. First of all, 65-nanometer capacity is now catching up after several years of relative under investment and current retirement of obsolete capacity above 65 nanometer. And second, nearly all foundry players are now building new fabrication facilities for strategic capacity, which will deliver wafers well beyond 2011. So in other terms, this capacity, these new factories are not planned to produce any wafers short term. And therefore, will not be impacted by a macroeconomic situation.
The fourth driver is our growing market share, as our KrF and immersion systems offer unique performance in the market necessary for sustaining new node specifications. On this front, on the front of technology, we are seeing a growing need for tighter on-product overlay for immersion system but also for KrF. And therefore, a strong requirement for our products in the holistic lithography suite. These products extend the process windows and ensure a better process control.
Sales of the new NXT system are also accelerating. We will sell more NXTs, our new architecture in Q4 than the former generation XT system. These machines are capable of 175 wafer per hour while, at the same time, maintaining an overlay under 2.5 nanometer and offering a high level of capability for the customers for this transition, but for the next also.
Regarding the technology of the future beyond NXT, we are currently shipping the first of six NXE:3100, our second-generation extreme ultraviolet, that is EUV system, to a Memory semiconductor manufacturing site. This is a big deal. This machine has imaging capability close to 20 nanometer to productivity, which will reach 60 wafer per hour over time. To date, our EUV prototypes have only been operated at IMEC in Leuven, Belgium and in the nanotech laboratory in Albany, New York, where all major semiconductors producers have worked collaboratively in developing EUV lithography processes recipes. Five more NXE:3100 systems are planned to ship between now and mid-2011. 
But in parallel to that, ASML is developing a third-generation EUV tool and infrastructure, the NXE:3300, which imaging capability down to 17 nanometer and targeted at 125 wafer per hour for delivery already starting in 2012. And we have an exceptional success here also as we have agreed with customers on orders for eight of these NXE:3300 system and are in negotiation for additional orders, which we will close in the fourth quarter, that is, in this quarter.
In summary and somewhat redundantly from our previous calls, we expect lithography system demand to be sustained, thanks to structural drivers, not so much volume drivers. This includes a richer mix for new technology product in all sectors at the same time and the new foundry fabs providing 2012 wafer output and our market share growth. However, while we are focusing on delivery on this strong system demand, on this strong bookings, we will certainly remain cautious as to changing worldwide macroeconomics and its potential impact on overall semiconductor unit demand. 
With this, Peter and I would be pleased to take your questions.",816

But none of that has impacted at all the booking run rates because, again, most of our customers are seeing this as a temporary seasonal adjustment, which they will address through prices, and they will not adjust through neither units nor weakened technology transitions. So in the DRAM and NAND sectors, clearly, these softening that you've seen are considered short term. In the Foundry business, or the IDM [Integrated Design Manufacturer] business, clearly, there have not been any changes. You've heard a bit of PC weakening in the August time frame, when I think Intel made a judgment, but this hasn't again impacted any of our traditional customers.",133

I was just wondering have you heard that as well? And is that maybe a fair point or?",70

One is, the NXT has precision, which is summarized by CD and overlay performance, which is unique in the market. And at this moment, this overlay and CD performance seems to be a fundamental for successful yield. So no matter what the throughput is, in fact, CD and overlay is a fundamental requirement. But on the other hand, don't misunderstand the point. In the fab, DRAM guy would be able to run the machine at, say, 92%, 95% of the time at maximum speed. In a Logic arena, the numbers would be more like 40% of the time at, say, 80% of the speed. But it is still a percentage of the capability of the machine. So if your machine is capable of a lot of wafers, even if you run it at 40% for a lot of reasons, logistics and technology, you still are making more money out of a machine that run fast than a machine that doesn't.",174

And as to where we've come from over the last quarter, and then where you see that by the end of the year?

So it is not a secret that we are at capacity. And it is not a secret that because the customers are transferring to NXT at good rate, at a high speed rate, this puts us into even more difficulties to reach their needs. So we expect to be at capacity for Q4, Q1 and Q2. And this is, again, as we said, sustained by the bookings. We expect to be out of this problem of capacity by Q3, Q4 next year because we are, in fact, building a lot of new capacity. In particular, we are transferring some of these XT cabins to NXT. We are hiring about 80 people in production per month. And this very moment, to avoid a significant customer impact on the need, we've transferred a number of engineers from R&D into production for a period of three months or so. So that we reduce very negative impact to our customers, so that we execute to their needs. So yes, capacity constraints for a period of, I would say, six months or so, six or nine months.",184

I recognize there's always a bit of difference between the one that actually may dispatch and one you can recognize revenue on the SAB 101.

With respect to the second generation, the 3100, we will recognize that revenue when we have, let's say, the final site acceptance at the customer side. So it means we ship it, we install it, customers starts running, we'll sign off on the specifications, and that will be somewhere in 2011. So for the 3100, I do expect it in 2011, we will see revenue recognition, which would not be the first half but likely the second half of the year. On the 3300, which is a 2012 product, which is basically a third generation and an extension of the 3100, we are aiming at revenue recognition at the moment of their shipment, which actually means that the product specifications and the performance of the products needs to support that.

Obviously, the 44% that you're running at now and have guided for, saw for the fourth quarter is a very healthy increase from what we saw last up cycle. Is there a ceiling to that figure now at 44%? Or is there something like Brion or other software-type elements, which are allowing you to get a premium even beyond here if your revenue continues to improve on a sequential basis?",83

Wennink,,Executives,24,"Yes, it is always, when you start talking about a ceiling for gross margin, it's always difficult because, let's be honest, there's many, many things that will impact gross margin, negatively but also positively. On the positive side, yes, we will see the impact of more, let's say, holistic litho Brion-type products that will increase as we go forward. The current business plan on that product line clearly foresees a growth, a quite substantial growth next year and the year thereafter. That is, of course, one because it's highly software driven, as you know. The other thing is the lowering of our fixed cost. Clearly, if we have like one of the earlier people who asked the question, what is our maximum capacity. I said our nominal capacity will be at EUR 1.5 billion in the first half of next year. That will have a positive effect on the load of our fixed cost, so we have a better coverage. And also, the learning curves, we will see learning curves where we will be able to make those tools faster, which will also have a positive effect. So I don't think it's a ceiling. But at this moment in time, we are not willing to give any guarantees on where that might go. But like I said earlier, 44% is not a ceiling.",223

I'm sort of wondering we've actually never seen that happen before. And pretty much every other cycle whenever pricing comes down, orders come down as well.

So first of all, I didn't say we're not weakened because, as you can see from one of the page of our presentation, we expect DRAM to be weaker next year because they have already bought a number. In Slide 17, it's written. So DRAM will be a bit weaker, but that was planned since six months ago. Flash will be much higher, and foundry will be a bit high. So there is going to be a weakening of DRAM because of the build-up of their leaders, at this moment, is going to be concluded. I would say by Q1-ish. And the catch-up of the other guys are going to be concluded of the older generation, I would say, in the same time. I don't know if I make myself clear. So some guys are ahead with one node basically. And then it will be a little bit of plateau, and then it will go back. So to your point, DRAM will weaken but not due to this current seasonal volume impact, due to the fact that they have done their six to nine months built plan and they need to go and execute. And then there will be another built sometime in 2011, probably Q4.",207

That's Moore's law. So that's also logical. So you really need to look at the pricing of the next generation that is then being introduced. So it is always the case that prices go down, so that's also the investment will go down, because prices for a particular device, over time, should go down because costs go down.",97

And the 3300 will have an NA, which allows 17 nanometer or lower, and has a target speed of 125 wafer per hour. The 3100, we are only going to build six of them. So we have shipped only one now. And these machines will be serving as a recipe builder at the customer site. They probably will go into production, but we're expecting for them to probably remain much more in an R&D-type environment. The 3300 is really the production machine. That's the one that will be ramping production. So customers want it early in 2012, because it would probably run production during 2013. So they need about nine months to, I would say, qualify the 3300 product.",154

So yes, Elpida at this moment is back on to the former plan of creating conglomerate of companies in Taiwan using leveraging or contracting their subsidiary, Rexchip, and their partner Powerchip and their other suppliers promos. We benefit of that in the sense that Elpida is trying to drive a significant or the same technology at those different places, so that our machines are compatible, basically, to on all those sites.

One is our own salaries and staff is very variable. Our employees and management have a very high bonus level into their pay level. So if something goes wrong, we have a salary variability. The second bit is that we have a lot of contractors, not temporary workers. So contractors means we do subcontract R&D work. We do subcontract some activities, which we can stop from one day to the other if we wanted to, because, of course, strategically, sometimes we don't want to. So this would, if I take the example of R&D, we have a potential to reduce R&D budget by 20% to 30% if we play with contractors. And then, you've got, third, the temporary workers. I think we publicized the number, 2,000-ish people are on a temporary contracts. And these are contracts which allows us to reduce to zero in three months, but that doesn't mean we will do that. All these decisions are, I would say, strategic for us. If we have air pocket of one quarter, we probably would manage all that. If we have air pocket of a year, we probably will have to do it.

That did have an impact on existing cash balances. We saw the recovery this year. And in the case of ASML, for instance, we are just, let's say, at the upper end of our stated cash balance that we would like to keep for operational purposes. It takes a bit of time. And then especially in the capital goods industry, you first need to invest in a lot of working capital before that money comes back.

Gross margins are impacted by the absolute sales, because it gives you coverage of your fixed cost. It's the mix of products and especially when we have more application or holistic litho-type products with very high gross margins, it was in software. And it's also cost reductions when they are coming in, and cycle-time reductions basically learning curves. And those are relatively flexible, and those are not linear. But they do indicate a clear trend, and that's why I have made a comment about the ceiling of 44%. Now there is no ceiling on 44%.",137

We do expect strong cash generation, which is not a surprise given our positive outlook on the rest of the year and 2011.

Some of us may be concerned about that it takes time to do this processes, but on the other hand, I think we have to do this in a responsible manner. So yes, you may have a point at if we had put a press release six months ago, saying we'll be above our target in due time and therefore we will prepare. It would have been smarter but, again, we're trying to avoid having some opportunistic approach to this. It's a bit complicated, but we haven't changed our appetite to execute exactly the policy. And at this moment, we have to execute it on the dividend side, as we committed to dividend.

And my second question that is, forget foundries, I mean, CapEx run rate in 2010 are at the highest level in several years. So I'm just wondering how sustainable is that sort of CapEx increase in 2011 that you were alluding to? Does that require further strong revenue growth for the foundries in 2011?

So you will know yourself if you understand that the market will go for 50% bit rate growth anywhere in 2011, then our plan is going to be sustained. If it goes lower than that, then you could see some reduction below our plans. However, this is compensated by the fact that the DRAM segment has gone through a much stronger technology transition behavior two years ago. And before, we used to have a transition every 18 months. Now since this year, we have a transition every year. So if you have a transition mid-next year again, we are in fact going to see the opposite happen. We're going to see an increase of CapEx. So in other terms, you've got now the driver, and you will yourself figure out exactly how that can impact us in the future. Regarding the total CapEx for 2010, let's recognize that for us, of course, it's going to be big number. We've guided 10% to 50% growth compared to the best year ever. But if you make this in relative terms versus our customers' total sales, you know the famous CapEx divided by sales of our customers, we're still in the 3% range or lower. I think, it's 2.5% to 3%, so we're not in the high number. We are clearly not in a history called high. So we could imagine that the CapEx number at this moment is definitely be sustainable at this 2.5% to 3% range. And I added to this that we have all seen the foundry segment and the Logic segment have really not bought anything for a fairly long periods, three years or four years. That it will take them 2010, '11 and potentially '12 to compensate for what they should have done in the first place before. So this compensation time is a good thing. Therefore, there is a scenario for ASML, which is the following. 2010 is good year, 2011 is going to be a better year, because of what we just said, and 2012 where you could start seeing a correction or one segment starting to sputter. And we will bring in EUV, which then is an enabler for major chip revolution, which we think can also get us to stabilize the whole thing. So we said six months ago that we maybe now on a trajectory of reducing the Lithography business being cycling, and I try again to articulate the fact that, so far, we confirm our point.",453

As a follow-up maybe on that, can you remind us whether you expect to make a margin on your EUV systems comparable with what you are doing right now on your systems? And a slightly related question to that is on the roadmap of your EUV, it seems like in terms of resolution, you made pretty good progress with the machines. I'm looking at a presentation of last year, where the resolution is slightly lower, I would say. Can you confirm whether you have made some progress or have you overcome some issues there? Some more detail on that would be much appreciated.",106

So these guys will not have a very high margin. It will not have the typical margin. It will be a bit under. But the machines at EUR 65 million will have the standard margin that we expect. Of course, in the first year it will be a bit lower than normal. And in the next year, it will become standard. And the following year, it will be a bit better, as we usually have. These are learning curve. On the resolution bit, yes, we are improving. And in fact, resolution as we grow on the 3100 and the 3300, the 3300, mainly, because of the smarter line of the lens and the smarter design of the illumination. So we've come up with pretty good ways of doing even better. And when we said 17 nanometer, we even think we can get to 15 nanometer, but that will have to be proven.",180

I mean, just a quick question on the service revenues. I mean, your service revenues have been at a higher level for the last couple of quarters.

Wennink,,Executives,96,"Yes, I think we also indicated that, during our last quarter call, we used to say service revenues would be between EUR 100 million and EUR 125 million. I said last quarter, it will trend up to between EUR 125 million and EUR 150 million. Whereby in periods like we see today, clearly, it will be closer to the EUR 150 million level. Yes, there are some Brion and holistic litho products in there. But many of those products are actually sold as part of the system enhancement or options, which the customers order when they order the tool. So you will see what we call a factory options, which can be holistic litho products not showing up in that line. When it's a field upgrade, it will be field and service sales. So yes, it does have an impact, but the biggest impact is in the average selling price for our leading-edge tools.",154

I mean, in the 3300, I mean, how many of those eight customers you've already signed up for 2012 are already in for the 3100 program? And also, with regard to the 3300, are you likely to sign up a lot more customers or are all mostly now signed up?",57
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 13, 2010",2010-10-13,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3840.0,1155094.0,47773140.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,98,"No. So all of the, let me think -- on the 3100 players, two out of six have not signed up on the 3300. On the 3300, the eight that we have, eight orders, not eight customers, as I said two of them are two, we expect at the end of the year to have another maybe two or three more. And these will cover, I would say, every semiconductor, every guy of the top 10 maybe minus one. So in other terms, let me say it differently, I don't know if I'm clear, it is very obvious that all the Logic players have discovered that they cannot handle beyond 2015 without EUV. So all those Logic guys have clearly understood they cannot handle. They have to go. The DRAM guys have this -- it's the same situation, except it's not 2015, it's 2013 or 2014. So DRAM have to go. And the Flash have the chance to take EUV only if EUV is cost effective. And if it's not fully cost effective for them, they can push out for a bit of time. So the way I'm translating this is that the Logic guys and the DRAM guys are rushing to get the orders, and the Flash guys are the ones kind of waiting a bit to see when is it really strategic to get it.",227

Either the mask inspection and resist infrastructure will be resolved because these are important issues but not fundamentally difficult issues, and players were waiting for us to show that, in fact, the machine was delivered. So at this moment, you have now a momentum, and level of technology issues to resolve is not an extreme situation. You just have to put a bit of money and go, so I would not be worried about that. The issue still remains for us and the three players of sources to prove what is the power that they can get out of an EUV laser, and that number is still the one to be proven. We are shipping our machine, so of course, we have already some run rate and stability. So we have a minimum. We're not yet at 60 wafer per hour, power-wise. That's not good enough. And within the period of now weeks and month, we will issue slowly but surely a press release that says, ""Now we've reached this speed. Now we've reached this speed. Now we've reached this speed."" So we feel that we have a bottom, which allows us to ship machines, but we are clearly not to the 60 wafers per hour, which would be considered comfortable.",246
