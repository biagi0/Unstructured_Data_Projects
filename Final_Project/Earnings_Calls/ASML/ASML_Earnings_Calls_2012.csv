388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2012",2012-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,2712.0,208298.0,12230917.0,Presenter Speech,Peter Wennink,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Eric and welcome to everyone. Firstly I would like to take this moment to recognize our record sales and profit year in 2011 where we posted close to €5.7 billion of sales and net income of 26% of that sales number. Clearly, a very good year.
Our fourth quarter sales came in at €1.2 billion. While the third quarter sales were evenly distributed across industry sectors, the fourth quarter sales were skewed significantly towards the foundry sector with 55%, with the balance spread equally across the memory sectors, NAND 22% and DRAM 19%. Although units shipped favored ArF immersion, non-critical KrF unit shipments were still significant, which indicates capacity additions in some industry segments.
We recognized 23 immersion systems in the quarter leading to a total of 101 immersion systems sold throughout the year of which 78 were our most advanced TWINSCAN NXT-1950 immersion tools. The average selling price of all systems shipped in the fourth quarter was €24.2 million, which is an increase of €1 million per unit versus the third quarter.
Service and field option sales for the quarter came in at a record €218 million, but that was difference by a significant adoption of performance enhancing field options. We also recognized the sale of one EUV system for a total amount of €39 million.
So at the end of the year earnings per share was for 2011, €3.45, which represents a 47% increase versus the €2.35 in 2010.
Updating our previously announced share buyback program, as of December 31, 2011, ASML had repurchased 25.7 million shares for a total amount of €700 million, giving an average buyback price of €27. Of the shares repurchased, 13.2 million have already been canceled in 2011 with the remainder to be canceled in 2012. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had €2.7 billion in cash.
Regarding further cash returns, it's our intention that pending shareholder approval to increase our annual dividend by 15% to €0.46 per share and to increase the size of the current buyback program to €1.130 billion to take advantage of the maximum amounts which are available for dividend withholding tax-exempt share buybacks in 2012. This increase, together with the shares we will buyback to cover our employee share plans, allows us to buyback a total amount of €500 million, which in addition to the dividend announcement adds up to €700 million of potential returns to our shareholders. On top of this amount, the Company still has a capacity of more than €1 billion with which we can do a synthetic share buyback similar in style to the one we did in 2007.
Q4 net bookings came in at 37 systems valued at €710 million. Booked ASPs declined from €22 million in Q3 to €19 million in Q4, but that was due to a product mix shift.
Our fourth quarter bookings profile changed significantly, with foundry increasing to 71% of total, followed by NAND Flash at 22% and IDMs at 15%. DRAM actually had negative bookings as we de-booked two systems for €64 million in total. One system was canceled and one was rebooked to NAND.
Our order backlog exiting the year was €1.7 billion, totaling 71 systems with an average selling price of €24.4 million, and the backlog profile at year-end changed significantly as the combined memory continued on a downward trend to only 27% of the backlog versus 41% at the end of the third quarter.
As to the outlook, we feel comfortable guiding our sales level as far as we have reasonable visibility. That is why at this time last year we guided with a 12 months view. Currently that view is six months and based on this, we expect the sales level for the first half of 2012 to be €2.4 billion. Together with our year-end backlog, we expect orders in the first half to adequately cover the sales expectation.
System demand is currently strongly driven by Logic manufacturers needed to shrink beyond the 30 nanometer node for enhanced product performance while building critical mass capacity at those nodes in a growing competitive environment.
As to the NAND segment, the forecasted bit growth for 2012 fuels our expectation that the NAND sector will be able to continue their aggressive shrink while adding required rate of capacity during 2012.
The DRAM market is currently experiencing a very difficult environment as evidenced by the share of DRAM customers in our backlog. However, if the current forecasted demand for bit growth in 2013 comes through, lithography demand will very likely follow which could potentially happen towards the end of this year in preparation for that demand.
Sales for the first quarter are expected to come in at around €1.2 billion. The gross margin these revenues will have will be about 43%. R&D expenses in Q1 will moderate a bit to €145 million as we drive greater efficiency while giving complete and continued support to our dual product leadership strategy. Efficiency gains will also decrease SG&A to about €54 million in the quarter.
With that, I would like to turn it back over to you Eric.

As Peter mentioned, 2011 was a record year for ASML and 2012 opens with a very solid first half. This success confirms the robustness of the fundamentals of the lithography business and the value of technology leadership to sustain this robustness.
As articulated during our last quarter results call, two technologies will be enabling the next generation of semiconductor technologies, multiple patterning using immersion on hand and EUV on the other. Both technologies will cohabit for a while, as the transition to EUV will be gradual. At some point, which last call we described that being beyond 15 nanometer to 20 nanometer in the DRAM business, beyond 10 nanometer to 15 nanometer in NAND and Logic. And so at this point, the immersion technologies will have a hard stop for use on critical layers. Until then, multiple patterning and EUV will coexist indeed with a mix depending on every critical layers complexity and respective manufacturing cost.
Most customers are therefore proceeding with parallel process developments preparing some layers to be either processed with immersion technology or with EUV, thus having the security of a known technology as a backup and having full use of the installed base while preserving the enabling capability and cost effectiveness of EUV.
ASML will support this gradual EUV ramp with an aggressive dual product strategy, continuous innovation on our immersion platform concurrent with the development of the EUV platform itself.
Regarding immersion, we have completed the qualification of our second generation NXT which will set a new throughput and overlay benchmarks respectively 200 wafer per hour plus and 4 nanometer on product overlay. We are also strengthening our suite of holistic lithography software and hardware products to enable process windows enlargement, process drift management and machine matching. We are planning the introduction of our third generation NXT at the end of 2012 with the next level of performance throughput and overlay. 
Regarding EUV, as you know, we've shipped six EUV pre-production NXE-3100 system and integration has begun on the 3300 production too, slated for delivery starting in H2 2012. We can claim today two significant accomplishments in EUV. First, we have stabilized the throughput of the current NXE-3100 in the field to about five to seven wafers per hour, thus enabling the customer recipe development and infrastructure qualification, particularly in mass making. More than 5,000 wafers have now been processed and customers have imaged down to 16 nanometer with a single exposure capability, accumulating therefore valuable experience in a number of cycles of learning.
The second achievement in this space, we have made progress on the different work packages advancing the development of the source and have been able to address and fix the number of technology limiters. We confirm our roadmap therefore to achieve proof of stable throughput of 60 wafer per hour in the field in the summer of 2012, and 125 wafer per hour, which is our target, a year later. We have started the process of order taking of the next batch of system, a process that we hope to close by June. The systems of this next new batch of orders will add to the 11 systems that we have already booked.
As also mentioned a number of times, ASML revenues opportunity in selling EUV technology or the alternative multiple patterning immersion technology or a mixture of both technologies for different layers as we mentioned, will be similar during the transition period, and therefore, we put equal emphasis on both technologies allowing our customers to choose the most appropriate technology for their respective lithography layers.
In summary, we are encouraged by the insight that we have gained on the first half of 2012 and allow us to sustain a large quarterly R&D investment, which in turn will support our secular growth well into the future.
With this, Peter and I would be pleased to take your questions.

Thanks for taking my question. It's Citi. I was just wondering whether you guys could give us a little bit more color on 2012. I mean, fundamental demand seems pretty strong, I mean 12 months ago, although I admit in a different macro context, we were talking about €5.5 billion sales. Maybe this year we have very aggressive order behavior and we have EUV shipments kicking in the second half. So I was just wondering, to what extent could H2 be flat or maybe even slightly up on H1 and if you can comment on that?

I think there is of course a reason why we stick to the six months, because we have visibility to the six months. And the reason is that, basically what we do here, we have a top-down simulation based on forecasted growth numbers from some of the analysts companies like iSupply and then we do a simulation which is top-down. We corroborate that with the bottom up that customers are giving us and when that is within a reasonable range of each other, then we feel comfortable enough to go out and to give you guidance. This is what we did last year. So that actually customers gave us 12 months. So we could collaborate this and gave you 12 months. Now what we are doing, of course, the market is a bit more uncertain. I talk about the macro economics; so customers gave us six months. We can collaborate six months and this is what we do. So not more color in that sense. 
The only thing is and that is what I repeat what I said in my introductory statements is that when we look at the order backlog, it is more skewed towards Logic which actually means that Logic will be an important element for us to ship in the first six months. NAND still for 2012 shows good bit growth numbers, which actually needs to be supported. We know they shrink roadmaps and you could say the outlier is a bit that DRAM market today because it's not good. But now clearly we have then had 2011 and 2012 as not very good DRAM years and what we are currently seeing in terms of expectation of bit growth in 2013 for DRAM is actually quite significantly up. That needs to be supported, so I would say that is an opportunity. I think that is - but that opportunity is clearly not for the first six months. I think that is kind of the color which I would like to give you and stay with that because we simply don't know more.

And maybe as a follow-up, I think your main competitor recently extended their modern wafer stage handling system from cutting edge to capacity tools and I was just wondering to what extent you would expect an impact on your capacity tool opportunities going forward and to what extent this reflects also more mature handling system from your competitor compared maybe to your TWINSCAN system?

In fact one of the competitor is working on i-Line area and the other competitors is looking on trying to improve a bit on the ArF dry area and I wonder if we'd try to use some of that into the KrF arena. But we still believe that our product have a number of advantages still on paper and in reality the issue of what we call machine matching become even much more of a problem. So, if you have leading technology machine in your factory and then you have to process multiple layers, and you use a KrF or an ArF immersion or an ArF dry, you would prefer these machines to be matching your state-of-the-art machinery and it is usually better to or easier to use the same supplier to do so. So indeed we are worried.

It's Goldman Sachs. I was wondering, Eric, on your crystal ball as I were on - in terms of supply and demand in the foundry industry. I guess the premise of the question is, it seems like both the Intel and ARM ecosystems are spending aggressively at the same time and pace. So I just wondered what you felt maybe the risks and balances are surrounding foundry spend as you go into the second half just because there seems to be a lot spending going on at the same time from both ecosystems?

On the preparation of R&D for 20 nanometer, this is irrelevant to your question, it's irrelevant in that case, there is a critical mass of investment that they had to do no matter what so that they are present in the business. In the 28 nanometer, what's happening at this moment is, even if you would consider a sort of aggressive build, this aggressive build is still very small to a full node. It's just a ramp, so it's good for us. In fact, it sustains nicely H1, but the numbers are nowhere near huge. So the fight at this moment would be on capacity, do they build too much capacity on the 30 nanometer? And I would say at this point on that one, Intel is not present in that segment. Intel plans to be present in the future segment. So in other terms your question would be probably valid at the next big batch of orders we may receive from Logic. At this point there could be a question of 'double booking.'

In the past, I think, the parameters that you've always put forward is to talk about some sort of desirable net cash level I guess, including some of the prepayments and so on for the EUV ramp. I just wondered as to what that range was just so we get a sense as to when you may in reality start getting more aggressive in a potential redistribution to shareholders.

I mean you are correct. I mean we need a certain level of minimum cash. A couple of years ago we used to say it was €1 billion. Now we're a bigger Company, so that is indeed a bit higher, but where we are today, the €2.7 billion, and actually also having used part of those prepayment, so that prepayment balance is actually going down. And the fact that clearly we will be profitable, very nicely profitable, means that we will generate also cash throughout 2012. That means that, like I said earlier, the maximum we can distribute under the withholding tax rules, there is about €500 million, €200 million dividend or €700 million we can easily distribute. On top of that we have that capability. Starting from this €2.7 billion effective we will generate cash that the balance of the prepayments will be shrinking because we are using that money to build up working capital, means that we will have indeed enough cash flow opportunity taking into account a minimum cash level which will be above the €1 billion level. But it will be still lower than €2 billion. So there will be enough capability if you do all your math to say that there is still an opportunity for us to do something substantial.

But qualitatively NAND will see 2011, 2012 no layer growth, it's stable on that sense. So we are shipping and we expect to ship more in NAND because the business is booming, but not because the technology is overcomplicated. In the Logic arena however and in the DRAM arena, this still continues with one or two layers more on average, if I'm not mistaken, which would make it 15ish% type - sorry, no, it's more than that. In DRAM, that's correct. So 10% to 15% more layers and in Logic, the numbers of critical layers are much larger and I would prefer not to quote you myself, because I may be wrong, so we will follow that on you. So the big layer driver in 2012 is indeed Logic, followed closely by DRAM and NAND not too much, which is good by the way. That means in 2013 we expect the next NAND problem, if you know what I mean, an opportunity that the critical layers in NAND will become a problem, requires more lithography.

At this moment so that's a hugely complicated question because we have - you've seen indeed some capacity due to - because we are shipping KrF, you've seen this in the order book. So there is indeed capacity, but surprisingly this capacity is for the big note, for the new notes. So in two years ago when we had the capacity surge, if you remember, we had good news for six, nine months about 65 nanometer. That was a huge capacity business due to China at that time, if you remember. This is not happening today. In fact, if you want to see in a crystal ball, I think this will be an engine of growth for us in 2013 or 2014. So, we're going to have in 2013, 2014 a number of, I would say, call it traditional designs like automotive designs who will shrink from 90 nanometer to something like 40 nanometer or something and there is a question in the industry whether these 90 or 65, 90 will grow - will shrink to 30, 40 or something like this. 
That is in other terms a way of saying in Logic there will be a wave of capacity entries into by the transfer of the traditional IDMs like ST and XP Freescales, Infineon, et cetera into the foundry. So you will have that. This is not happening today. This will be happening in the future and that's good news. This is an engine of growth of the future. The capacity that you have today is because for the first time in our history, the customers, in particular foundry, are building up the early node, the new node faster than usual. Don't remember the exact historical curve, but when you ramp a 28 nanometer, you would expect to ramp, say, 2% of your capacity for one year, then you go 5%, 5%, then you go 10%, then you go 15%, 20%. 
So it takes forever to get to this. At this moment, and this was the question related to the competition between the architectures, this new node 28 nanometer which will be fundamental, will be - is being built at the same time with more capacity than I would say we would have expected from historical standards. So we were concerned about that. But when you ask the question to our customers, you have a list of design wins and a list of hungry customers in the areas of portables in general, smartphones, tablets, et cetera, and all these devices which create a need to ramp these early nodes faster than ever in history. And indeed there is a question about whether that's too much, but as I say, it's so much at the start that it's not yet going to be a problem.

I'm just wondering how the conversations are going with your customers and how you see them planning for the use of EUV over the next few years in terms of the critical layers that they will deploy that with and are you still expecting that orders should start to increase over the next few quarters for 2013 as a result of that?

The whole EUV question. Numbers are facts. Nobody would expect EUV to be in huge volume in production before 2014. That has not changed. I think - I hope I had mentioned it before. So we would build EUV infrastructure between 2012, 2013 by shipping, as we said, about - it could be one amongst or something of this nature. But these are not really products provisioned in 2014. So the real issue for us is to achieve the performance necessary for 2014 which we said is going to be between 60 wafer per hours or 125 wafer per hour. If we do 60 wafer per hours, we have not so many EUV and a lot of immersion, and if we have 125 wafer per hour, we're going to have a lot of EUV and less immersions. So that's basically the status. We are well within this timeframe. 
The problem, however, and the reason why our customers are not happy with us and we are not happy with ourselves is, and we still have not enough data to prove this. As much as we are happy to have identified a lot of, I would say sub-project to make effort, we haven't been able yet to integrate all those sub-project together so that you can immediately see the 60 wafer per hour. We are able to show 105. What we are able to show debris control, we are able to show cleaning up capability of the collectors, etcetera, but we have not yet enough experience. We haven't put everything together in the same machine to be sure. So we still have an uncertainty point. So we still think - we are basically having a bunch of unhappy customers saying, guys, it is now time that you give us certainty. 
We think that we can give them certainty. It was my point at the beginning in the summer with proof of the pudding, proof of the 60 wafer per hour which would allow then them to say, obviously, it's a go and then they would accelerate their own recipe development and they will get us under pressure for delivery. So from now until the summer, there is going to be question mark as to the credibility of our development. And for us complication here is because we can't integrate all the improvement at the same time. We have to go through hugely technical discussion with our customers to explain the progress of every one of the legs until we converge sometime in the summer. 
So, that's the situation. However, the progress is visible. It's tangible enough that, in fact they continue having pressure, significant pressure. Tangible first, because the customers, although unhappy with our five to seven wafer per hour or so, they are able to do cycle of learning and that is a fundamental. So if you now talk to them and discuss about their mask shop, their activities to build up some wafers, the learning in the process, issues that you definitively always see in process development and the magnificent photographs that you can get at 16 nanometer which is also true, you get some excitement and you get some actions and you get some development on the six - in fact the five machines, the sixth one is just I think ramping the first wafers. So that's positive. That puts credibility into the product and that makes the customers develop. 
The second part of the equation is that we have enough facts in our joint work with source providers that the customers are ready to potentially put more orders. And this is what I announced in the discussion at the beginning that, say, we're starting now to put the official letters out that say dear customers, this is our facts. We are now ready to take more orders and we are offering yearly phases which is three or six months or so. And we offer a phrase today where we say dear customers, we'd like to get now the next commitment and that will be commitments for delivery with the lead time of about two years. So anything we take now will be delivered at the early 2014. Really difficult to give you colors at this moment. The numbers of folders will depend in some ways with the level of data that we're going to provide the market. 
I can tell you happily that today I think I've got an order into pocket but we have refused to take the paperwork because we want also ourselves to be sure. So we will wait. But we do have indeed huge interests which also confirm what I said before is whatever issue we will say and be concern about, there is a hard stop to immersion in due time. So we are convening to success at some point and indeed we can survive a period of time with a double approach, with multiple patterning, et cetera. But the whole industry knows that we cannot go and continue slipping the project and as I said, at this point, we feel still comfortable that by the summer we'll be able to say. Unfortunately, we now have to ramp with the hard work that it takes to ramp a new technology.

Thank you. And then a question for Eric. Longer-term from an industry perspective, do we think we need to get EUV right before we move into 450-milimeter wafer size or do you think those two can be done in parallel? I'm just talking from an industry perspective.

Obviously, everybody expect EUV to be right before 450 gets in. You're not going to quote any customers on it. But it seems now to be the obvious truth and for two reasons. One, 450 does not offer you the cost savings nor the performance capability of the chip, nor the power reduction requirements of EUV. So 450 is a palliative to the need to manage a cost structure of some sort. So in other terms, 450 helps a company who says, I've got a big fab and I'd like to use the square meters more effectively to be honest and of course there is a cost of square meters and the cost of infrastructure in general, but this has nothing to do with the usual 30% to 50% shrink factors of chips, which then allow you performance, cost and power. 
So there is no debate at all in the industry that EUV is a fundamental much more than 450. The second thing that is obvious to everybody as far as - EUV is a priority obviously - the second thing is that you cannot do transitions of the level of 450 which requires a complete change of the whole insides of the fab with every equipment supplier aligned in two years. You can dream this, but it's hugely impossible. So what you do is you create noise and activities and media, blah, blah (inaudible).

So there is going to be activities for people to do some 450 prototyping etcetera. But in any event, such process takes time, and if even EUV would not exist, the 450 best insertion in would be 2016-2018 anyway. So we have made that clear to all of our customers which we said look this is your views, what do you think, and I understand that we heard from everybody that the obvious is in fact proper. We do EUV. This is a fundamental. We will make it happen by 2013-2014, then after that we have the whole industry to plan to 450 transition, and the 450 transition will be done in of course effective way which takes some times so there is not going to be 450 before 2016-2018.

So at that level I would - if I stigmatize a bit, yeah, there are no issues with the economic situation that are big enough to change the strategic investment plans of those large account. Indeed, in Logic, as we said at the beginning, you're not impacted by the fear factor of the Euro or whatever. In the NAND arena, you are clearly not considering this as an issue, because you just want to have the capacity to do the new products like the SSDs and the SIN PCs etcetera which are going to cover for your demand, your investments. So that's not a problem. In the DRAM business, what you have is a recovery from the bad news of last year. If you remember, last year the DRAM vendors were basically telling us and every one of us that they were reasonable people and they would build up just a minimum capacity and that's what they did in 2000 - at the beginning of 2011. 
The bad news however, tablet came in for the DRAM people. So the tablet basically cannibalized the PC business somehow. So the capacity installed in the DRAM business became too big for the product capability for the - they were basically planned for higher level of PC. So today, the DRAM people are waiting for the PC curve to get back in order to recover the - I would say the trend which makes then the installed based in DRAM cost effective or profitable and this is what Peter was saying by saying, well we don't think that is happening in the first six months and there is a high chance that it does happen in the second half and at that point, we would expect the DRAM industry to kick in. But indeed this - the numbers of PCs being sold, which is the only in fact piece of macroeconomic as I probably brought to the call, is an uncertainty and therefore, we do not want to call H2 on that uncertainty.

If you remember, in 2010 I said €5 billion in 2015 and we did - sorry, 2005 to 2010. I said €5 billion for 2010. So we are kind of at that level. So now I'm ready to set up a number and you did quote something interesting on the phone, but I would prefer not to mention it at this very moment. I am waiting clarification of this EUV curve versus double patterning because for me at this moment for two years or so, there is no difference between double patterning and EUV in terms of economics. Revenue will be about the same. But beyond that, EUV has a huge opportunity of growth and I want to clarify that one with us achieving some technical results before I come to the market and say, I'm going to make another visionary statement. The size of the Company will get to the next level. So, give me another week or two - sorry, month or two, maybe until June or something hopefully where you would ask the same question.

The receivable days, there's nothing going on there. Only that the shipments were skewed more towards the quarter end. So that they were simply nothing there. That's a due day payment yet, so that's not an issue. On the inventories, we are building up 3300 inventories, you are right and that will only lead to sales in the course of this year. So we will have to have over next couple of quarters a build-up in inventory, which is going to be relatively short-term, because like we said, we are going to start shipping those tools in the second half of the year. But the work in process which is basically related to those sales, we will see this quarter and next quarter in inventory balance. But like I said, it's going to be short-term, so within 12 months. All the other inventory elements actually like inventory days on our regular inventory on work in process on NXT and our immersion tools, there's nothing really special there. It is really 3300 build-up.

There is a difference between capacity and whether you can use the capacity and have no failures. So if you do an Excel spreadsheet on 2013, you may not want to put 12.

One is a just management factors which is the reason why we got delayed in EUV by 1.5 years or something is we face huge complexity on an area we didn't think there was as much complexity and this is a judgment, a misjudgment that we made jointly with our suppliers of sources. So when that was kind of understood last year in Q4 of 2011, in fact 2010, we jointly worked with our suppliers on a re-staffing and we multiply the staffing by a large factor and then from there we cut programs into pieces. So we have now much more visibility and understanding at the management level of each of the piece. And in this business, on one hand I'm going to say it's hugely complicated. On one hand, I'm going to say it's very simple. Every work packages when they are small enough. You go to a process of checking and it's complicated. So you can't really design it, but you check it. 
So you make a prototype, you check it and then you discover something and the discovery usually gets you a solution. We are rarely and at this moment this is why I'm saying I'm not worried at all about 2014, as we are in situations where we think we have a bunch of small little things which do not work, but we can simulate them, emulate them, check them and discover problems. So the good news is we have the staff and we have the work packages and we now have an estimate that there is no signs. That's the good news. The bad news is because it's trial and error situation of multiple work package in parallel, we are not 100% sure of the timing of the whole convergence, which is why I said at the beginning. So for instance what we knew for sure is that the moment you raise the power into any chamber, you will create numbers of physical impact, whether your coating will react chemically to something else, et cetera. 
So when that happens, you have to - if you're lucky, nothing happens. If you're not lucky, everything happens. So you have to change the coating chemistry, you have to change the weather and this is what the learning is. So on one hand we are very comfortable that we have cut the thing in pieces. On the other hand we are annoyed by the fact that we're still in the learning phase and we cannot tell our customers there is on another 10 works - 10 months or three months or so we have to do. So yes, the body language is good because EUV is not a monster that we don't understand and know the body language is not so good because I am also announcing that we are doing immersion and EUV at the same time because we don’t know enough to be sure that we will be able to have 100% of the layers on EUV on time.

So you have a project on 105 watt, you have a project on 20 watt, you have a project on 14 watt, you have a project, et cetera. So all of these things have been demonstrated and to be honest, all of these things have shown problems and the problems are being worked on. As I said, there is one which is stupid. We put a coating and the coating is being destroyed and we wondered why we had the coating and we don't need the coating. So now we are rebuilding a chamber without the coating. It takes time but we know for sure it's going to work. So you cannot - unfortunately, we cannot give you data which are serial like what you would want. Do we have a 20 watt fully working in the full conditions with debris mitigation, with the transmission coating being in place, et cetera? No, unfortunately, we don't have that. We have work packages, multiple people working on solving their own side of the problem.

Could we see a situation by summer time where as EUV bookings start to be recognized, especially for 3300, that the ASP difference would enable ASML maybe for the first time to do better than the industry? If this year's CapEx is similar to last year front-loaded, could EUV make a significant difference for ASML when compared to the rest of the industry?

So no. It has always been our strength to always cannibalize ourselves if you want to - we always put R&D into every project that we think has an opportunity. The reason we do that is for risk management. So for instance today, it's a fundamental that all of you as investors understand that if for some strange reason we are delaying EUV by a major factor, we are still capable of delivering the same revenues for the next two to three years anyway. So there is a fundamental in the company, when you are single product company that you do not do stupid things that put into a situation of catastrophe of that sense. Also at the customer level, we are now as you know a fundamental supplier of lithography machine. 
So we have to have the solution to the need, no matter what situation could happen. So we do have to cannibalize. Therefore, even we are certain that EUV would work, I would still have somebody doing an NXT Version 2 or Version 3 in that case. Second point is, because as also immersion is not dead, when EUV happens and imagine you put yourself, you translate, you get yourself and this is a bid to answer Sandy's question. What’s the size of the Company in 2017-18? You are again going to have huge number of EUV layers and you are going to have a very huge number of Immersion layers at the same time. So the exciting bit here is, that today I am talking about either or and in 2018, I am going to talk with additionally, we are talking about huge complexity that where the two technology would be required, therefore the NXT 3 is designed so that it addresses the layers of immersion also of the future of 2017-2018. 
So in order to get there, you need to have a machine that runs towards 300 wafer power. Don't quote me. I didn't say that NXT 3 will do 300 immediately, but we have to start thinking about architecture that can do that. It has to be fully modular because a machine that runs at 300 wafer per hour cannot fail, if you know what I mean. The impact on the factory will be so huge. So we have to create machines which are 100% in action all the time. And if they don't, we can save the day within 10 minutes and we can reach out them and also it's a huge concept. And the third huge concept is own by the way when the nanometers in 2017-2018 will be sub-10 nanometer for the resolution, you have to have an overlay which will be potentially in the areas of 2ish or whatever which now doesn't make too many nanometers. We'll have to invent the picometres. So it's a huge thing that we any way have to do. So what we do here is we do it a bit earlier than necessary as a backup to EUV, but this R&D will be hugely useful for next generation EUV until immersion 2020-2022.

It’s highly complex and especially with the resolution going down. So it means that the focus on the system enhancement products, which is the holistic litho product portfolio becomes ever increasing important to us and to our customers. So you could even argue that next generation double patterning without a good suite of those holistic lithography products is even not possible, so that is good for the Company also and adds significantly to the ASP and to, I would say, the margin profile.

Just a quick follow-up on this one. Memory customers were supposed to be the early adopters of EUV. Given the weakening DRAM situation and somewhat of a cautious behavior or capacity addition by spending by NAND customers, how much of latitude do these guys have in terms of pushing out EUV until they find that they have to have a certain specification before they commit to it?

388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2012",2012-01-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,2712.0,208298.0,12230985.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,72,"First of all, I think we may have miss-communicated a bit. The two drivers segment of DRAM and Logic. The weaker driver is NAND. NAND is a simpler design. So they are alternative delivery to the longer. So you have priority is DRAM then Logic, if there is even then by the way, but okay, and then NAND. The DRAM nightmare is indeed affordability, but look at the current structure of the market. You have numbers of leaders who do not have this affordability problem, but they do have the need to shrink. So we think that the DRAM leaders would be usually happy that the market remains a bit difficult in terms of affordability and that EUV would be available. There could be a differentiator here for that segment and in particular, the DRAM node is the worst one to do beyond 20-ish nanometer or even at 20-ish nanometer. This is not pleasant for the DRAM vendor at this point. 
Logic, you have a huge value creation with EUV because if you do not to EUV, you have design restrictions. If you have design restrictions in your foundry, you go to a customer and say, dear customer, I can do anything you want but these are the rules now. You cannot do that, you cannot do that, you cannot do that, you cannot do that, you cannot do that, and your shrink factor is 10% worse than the normal shrink. That's usually not very pleasant. So EUV will be driven. NAND, it will do everything possible to do simple sales until they have to do EUV, like we knew it is, and we will force EUV in with a cost-effective solution and at that point we have the switch. So, the good news with NAND for us until 15 nanometer is we can modulate our entry the way we want. If we price EUV low, we get in. If we price EUV high, we sell more immersion, so it's a nice opportunity.

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric and welcome to everyone. Summarizing our first quarter, sales came in at EUR 1.25 billion, essentially the same as the previous quarter. This quarter sales were again significantly skewed towards the Foundry IDM sectors with 75%, including non-critical KrF capacity additions. 9% of the first quarter sales went to the DRAM sector representing only 6 system shipments. The average selling price of all systems shipped in the first quarter was EUR 20.2 million, and this reflects the high KrF systems shipments versus the previous quarter.
Service and field option sales came in at EUR 202 [ph] million, again driven by the adoption of performance enhancing field options. We also recognized sales of one EUV system for a total amount of EUR 44 million, which is one quarter earlier than planned. It’s due to a faster than anticipated installation and customer acceptance process. This had an impact on our gross margin by the way the EUV shipment for the quarter of about 1.5 percentage points.
Updating on our previously announced share buyback program, as of April 1, 2012, out of the total program, ASML had repurchased 29.8 million shares, of which 4.1 million shares in the first quarter for a total amount of EUR 839 million, of which EUR 139 million in Q1 giving an average buyback price of EUR 28. The repurchased shares have been or will be canceled.
At the end of the first quarter, we had close to EUR 3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The first quarter net bookings came in at 36 systems valued at EUR 865 million. The booked average selling price shot up from EUR 19.2 million in Q4 to EUR 24 million in the first quarter. That’s due to a product mix shift towards the most advanced tools. Our first quarter bookings profiles saw foundry increasing slightly to 74% of the total, followed by IDMs at 13%, NAND at 8% and DRAM at only 5%.
Our order backlog at the end of the first quarter was EUR 1.6 billion, totaling 56 systems with an impressive average selling price of EUR 28.5 million. The backlog profile at quarter-end changed again as combined memory continued on a downward trend to only 23% of the total backlog versus 27% at the end of last year.
As to the outlook, we can confirm our earlier guidance of EUR 2.4 billion net sales for the first half 2012 and given a continued solid 6 months of visibility, we can now say that the third quarter sales are expected to be stable at Q1 and Q2 levels. Based on this visibility and in combination with our first quarter backlog, we expect orders in the next quarter to adequately cover our sales expectation.
We believe that specific quarterly order guidance has become less relevant over time due to the fact that fewer, but larger customers are placing bigger and lumpier orders, making quarterly order patterns more and more imprecise. On top of that, customers have significantly increased their visibility towards us of their real shipment needs, leaving the order placements as a kind of secondary and almost administrative consideration in the business process.
System demand is currently strongly driven by the continued need of foundry manufactures to add capacity at the 28 nanometer node in an environment of very strong demand and high competition. We now expect this strong demand trends to continue for the remainder of the year.
The NAND segment continues their aggressive shrink with an apparent moderation in wafer capacity additions in the reaction to the current weakening NAND pricing. The continued difficult DRAM market environment is keeping the DRAM sector share of our backlog at historically low levels.
As for an update on the expected EUV shipments in 2012, system integration has begun here in Veldhoven on the 11, NXE:3300 systems on order. Current plans are to shift 2 of these systems later this year with the remainder shipping in the first half of 2013.
To compensate for the recent source delivery delays, we have decided to alter the shipment process for the first 2 systems, which means that revenue will not be recognized until the systems are assembled and integrated at the customer side. Therefore, we do not expect the revenue recognition on these tools to occur until early 2013.
And finally sales for the second quarter are expected to come in again at around EUR 1.2 billion with the gross margin that will be about 43%. R&D and SG&A expenses will remain constant versus the first quarter levels at EUR 145 million for R&D and EUR 55 million for SG&A in the quarter.
And with that, I would like to turn it back over to you Eric.",787

As Peter mentioned, the short-term, mid-term demands for advance logic lithography capacity is stronger than we expected and guided at the beginning of the year. Bridging nicely to 2013 sales when first we expect memory lithography capacity demand to pickup, and 2, when we are able to ship and recognize the first EUV pre-production system, so short-term, mid-term looks very good.
The longer-term future looks also positive for us as articulated often during our quarterly results call. The lithography intensity should increase further when either of the 2 lithography technologies enabling the next generation semiconductor technologies, so whether it’s immersion multiple patterning or EUV when these 2 are introduced into production. Both technology will cohabit until EUV becomes the only technology capable of imaging the next generation device due to its lower cost and scalability.
To keep our immersion leadership which would be used in multiple patterning, we continue to enhance the overlay and throughput performance of our TWINSCAN NXT:1950 systems.
We’re certainly the market leader in immersion as evidenced by one of our NXT:1950’s exceeding another productivity milestone by processing in the product and environment more than 4,500 wafers per day with an overlay at about 4 nanometers, which -- it’s a great performance.
We’re planning further improvements with introduction of our next generation NXT at the end of this year 2012, with the next level of performance in throughput overlay and focus.
We also continued the development in introduction of strengths and suite of holistic lithography software and hardware products, so have to enable the process window enlargement, process drift management, and machine matching, which are all necessary for multi-pass patterning requirements.
Regarding EUV, we are certainly confirming steady progress still with the objective to release the program in the summer for customer production ramps in 2014. So exactly as we said in the last call.
As highlighted in our press release, we have installed 6 EUV pre-production tool now the NXE:3100, they are in use imaging wafers of customer side, they are contributing to the progress of the EUV fab infrastructure as over 9,000 wafers have now been imaged on these systems to-date. These system have also demonstrated an exceptional performance overall with the 6 nanometer on-product overlay and with dedicated chuck overlay of less than 2 nanometers. These are extraordinary performance.
As Peter already mentioned, we are also confirming at this moment the delivery of 11 of our NXE:3300B which is our production systems between Q4, 2012 this year and the summer of 2013.
Regarding the source technology stages that we still do not have a proven source power, the proven source power in situ, which would confirm our target throughput performance, but again this was not planned in the first quarter. This has always been planned in the summer, at the end of the summer, but we have made significant progress no matter what.
We have now demonstrated source power at 30 watts to 50 watts at high duty cycle for prolonged periods. These achievements are significant as we only need 100 watts to achieve a 60 wafer per hour machine, which some customers will find acceptable for initial production implementation until we reach our nominal throughput specification of 125 wafer per hour.
In view of this progress and although we have not yet confirmed, as I said desire powers integrated into a system, we have still -- we now started negotiation on the next batch of orders of EUV systems, targeted mainly for customer production ramp, expected to begin in late 2013 and into 2014.
So in summary, we are definitively encouraged by the market demand development in the last quarter for the short-term and mid-term for sales opportunities in the second half. We are additionally encouraged by our progress in EUV performance and the unwavering support that we are getting from our customers regarding this technology for ramp in 2014 as planned.
With that, Peter and I would be pleased to take your questions.",664

So Nick as we said a numbers of time, there are certain numbers of phases when you introduce such a technology. The first phase is to have some R&D tools to do some recipes and confirm the technology, that’s what we’ve been doing. And although, there have been delays in our creditability, by the end of the day, the recipes are being made. And the windows of opportunity is as you mentioned and we have not lost any of them yet. The first window is DRAM 1x, so I think you’re going to 1x or 1y, the very near the 20 nanometer. This seems to be a very complicated to execute with multiple patterning and the customers are ready to in fact wait for EUV to be ready to get there. And the competitive product that could also be very near, #1 need is the 14 nanometer logic node, which has shown in particular in the last 3 months, 2 major pushback by end customers using or attempting to use multi-patterning. They have seen 2 problems, one is a cost issue, which seems to be too high to justify the shrink if they do multi-patterning. And they also have seen a shrink factor limitation. So in other terms, you go to 14 nanometer, but you do not really reduce the size as much as you should, if you were to use the EUV. So we are having at this moment the heated pressure from the people going to 1X DRAM, the first node below 20 and the 14-nanometer Logic. And at this moment, the race is on to know who is going to be having the first 1, to get into both. That will create a demand in 2014, which we believe will be appropriate in terms of industrial capacity, meaning not too much and not small enough. So perfectly, exactly in the numbers of tools that a company like ours would want to do. To do too many tools, it costs a lot of money, if you do not enough, it costs a lot of money for dilution purposes. So we’ve seen at this moment to have achieved a run rate target, which has been discussed and which I translated in the press release as we are negotiating the first orders for 2014.",387

So we call it Goldilocks EUV, I guess. Just quick follow-up on the more near-term, you added in your presentation for expecting NAND Flash to recover later in the year.

We were expecting in fact them to start showing some positive color. But instead what we’ve had and this is in fact the stronger positive news is the NAND hasn’t happened, but the Logic has more than we thought, so this is good news, and we can talk about that later. The NAND Flash however will have to be much bigger than the current run rate if you believe in the tablet numbers, in the smartphone numbers and in the SSD numbers. If you just charter, what you hear in the market, the statistics expected for those products, then you would see a shortage of NAND as early as Q4. So now we are hopeful that this is not going to even happen in Q4, so that we stabilize nicely our sales between good 2012 and a sustained 2013.",152

It’s very evident that the foundries and IDM are obviously a bigger piece of -- in terms of concentration. But my sense is also that it really wasn’t all that meaningfully different -- sorry, after the Q4 and he was very comfortable indicating that orders would be at least flat.

Wennink,,Executives,14,"Yes, well let me answer that. I think orders are generally used by guys do as a proxy for our sales, which is circling, but that’s actually top line and ultimately drives the earnings per share. Now, I think that’s what we are exactly doing. We are giving you a sales guidance for the next 2 quarters with some, I would say very positive consideration for the remainder of the year. In that sense, I think from an outlook point of view, we are not -- we are very clear, probably clearer than we have been in the past. Now, on the order -- from the point is that we have fewer customers, which is indeed true and those customers are getting bigger, but also the order sizes are getting bigger. So it means you can have between the end of June and the end of July, you can have hundreds of millions of difference, so a very widespread of when those orders are actually going to hit the books, which is no indication whatsoever of the outlook that we have on our shipment pattern. So, this is the only reason why we are not doing this, because we want to be clear on what the outlook really is and what the outlook is, is driven by sales and not by the orders. And that’s why we’re giving you sales, which we believe is a better indication.",237

And my follow-up question would be, I mean, I guess in terms of orders and deliveries, it seems like actually KrF is perhaps somewhat higher, so clearly a good amount of capacity that’s happening at the 28-nanometer node. And I think I would agree absolutely, that for the 2x I mean, 2.0 and 22 nanometer, there’s clearly an avenue for an event from an aggressive upgrade power from all your customers at the leading edge. But I guess, I’m trying to get a sense as to whether you think there is perhaps the transition risk between the 2 nodes, just because it looks as if capacity has been very strong specifically in KrF and some other capacity tools?",120

We were worried that there was excess capacity due to the fact that, as you know today there are multiple players running after the same customers. So we’re a bit worried that there is duplication. But this doesn’t seem to be the case and there are 2 factors: One is, if you talk to foundry customers, you will see a lot of exciting products getting into mobile applications, which requires power and these things are usually complex with very large die size, so this drives a lot of silicon square meters, so that we can test, check, touch. The second thing that we have now recalculated is of the sizes of each of those nodes in compared to what we ship as units. And I’m happy to report that we are far from having yet, I’d say a stabilized capacity level necessary for normal node at 28. So that is we have another 6 to 9 months of production and shipment of machine before we have delivered to the market. I would say sort of mature not high level of wafer per month. After that, there is another engine for 2013, which is to be proven, but we are getting now a significant interest is the customers want to go from 28 to 22 already and they do that because they easily drive our product again. So this is not now a driver due to volume, it’s a driver due to product and architecture. And as you know there is 5 time the arm environment, et cetera, that forces this activity to happen. So now what we discover is we have a former system that was in the Logic arena, a node every 2 years, every 18 months that gets into a node every year. And therefore faster ramp to a stable numbers of wafers per month. And then immediately not replaced. But it’s prolonged by another ramp. So that’s what we see at this moment, so therefore we do not see significant risk of these being wrong excess type business decisions. If I were to be negative, pessimist, I would say however, these are very complicated nodes technology-wise, and you could always have issues of difficulties to yield the ramp, et cetera, but this probably would not impact the litho business, in fact it could even create upside for us in case the difficulties to ran those things.",424

The first one was just on the, if I could just cap on this comment Eric that you’ve made I think on the second batch of EUV to the current negotiating and the run rate 2014, 2015. I seem to remember the longer-term target was to ramp up your manufacturing capacity to about 9 tools per quarter by 2015. Are you still thinking in these sort of dimensions or in the process of negotiations is your thinking on that capacity maybe to increase or lower it depending on the demand? That would be my first question. The second one was just quickly on the potential buyback extension that you’ve talked about last quarter, could you just remind us how much net or gross cash you think you need to run the business? Obviously your company is now bigger than it may have been 2 or 3 years ago. So if you could just remind us what minimum level of cash you would need?",167

So I will answer the buyback question and Peter is going to answer the EUV question. No, I think I wish. So the EUV question, yes, I would say, there is 3 stages of Goldilock capacity with integration at this way, which in the first year, we will probably want to be at 1 unit a month, 1 unit a month, 1.5 unit a month in the first year, then we will go to a period of time at 3 per month, as you said, 36, and then we probably will mature business [Audio Gap] at about 60 units per year roughly. So you’ve got these 3 stages that is now being discussed, negotiated with most customers, so that we have the proper capacity to achieve this. So we start with one a month. We then go to 3 a month and then we will go to whatever 60 is divided by 12, 5 months. Now with our buybacks.",160

Wennink,,Executives,20,"Yes, we basically are still in the same position as we were last quarters, no change on that. I’d just like to reiterate that on the announced buyback program, which also would include the shares we need to buyback to cover for the share plans and the dividend, we still have more than a EUR 0.5 billion to go, so that we will do of course first. And that actually means that in the fourth quarter, we always review with our board the distribution policy for basically the next year, which includes dividends and the share buybacks, and the division between the 2. So that’s what we will do by the end of the year. And let there be no question in your mind, this is a very profitable and cash generating company. So in excess of what we need, we will keep giving that money back. There is no change whatsoever. You could say, a basic cash balances that we would need a couple of years ago like you roughly, we indicated we were smaller and we just had between EUR 1 billion or EUR 1.5 billion. It’s probably now within EUR 1.5 billion and EUR 2 billion, but above that you will see us in a cash return mode. So, I think that’s, it’s for now when we would announce the potential synthetic share buyback. Clearly, it is a function of where we are at the end of the year in terms of our decision-making and like I said last time, you do not do a synthetic buyback for EUR 100 million, you want to do it for a big number and I would not expect that number to be anything lower than EUR 500 million. So that needs to be a big chunk. So it is not going to be eminent because we first have to do the first EUR 500 million left on the remainder of the buyback program and on the dividend payment.",328

You may have heard me in the speech talking about design window enhancements and the process drift management. So you are now in a point where the customers have to work extremely closely with litho supplier to define the machine and the software that goes with it and their own design, so that your window is as wide as possible. But the design now is kind of dedicated to the machine. And then when that happens, you put this into production and you are going to drift not only the litho, but also my peers in fab, the hatch and et cetera. And then you correct every drifts in production through a new set of parameters that you input into the litho machine. That’s again another set of products that we are shipping. And we are not satisfying the customers, this is what I’m trying to tell all of you now that the Double Double-Patterning makes the windows enhancement and the drift, a huge concern and a huge challenge. So, yes, we can do it, but it’s not as pleasant as EUV. So the customers will always try to get EUV, if the EUV works. That’s the first statement. The second statement is, however, is our competitor capable of doing this better than us? We’ve got a feeling that it’s not the case for the usual reason. One is we invest huge amount of money in the packages, which are dedicated to windows enhancement and drift management, which are dedicated to the machines and the machines themselves have 3000 points of controls, which we are well ahead of anybody in the market doing this. If you feel something, you are better off with the machine with maximum numbers of flexible items. The second bit is that we still have a concept, which is a TWINSCAN with a numbers of measurement points capability, which is superior to the paper specification of competitive products. So, we think even on paper, we will remain the leader conceptually on the critical layers. And I hinted to you the third point is that the level of risk that is now existing in the fabs do not justify defocused on R&D, the R&D to get a machine to work is a year or a year and half activity and duplicating it with multi supplier with multiple architecture is a non-economic risky situation in particular that in production, then the machines are not matching, which is you cannot process anymore a wafer on different machines, and that would be pretty bad. So we think that during the period of time where EUV is not yet fully available and immersion is there we have a high chance to remain leading.",474

To figure out what the problem is, but we are only guessing that these 4 players are -- 3.5 players are now more in the business of call it embedded NAND and embedded NANDs are like Logic. They are not anymore what you want to do you manufacture. You just manufacture to the numbers of and the products you’ve been designed in. And usually in this business for Logic, you’ve always seen this at the beginning, if things takes a bit longer than expected before you get designed in and the product really works and et cetera, et cetera. So, I would consider this moment that all the exciting new products, on which the new NANDs are being designed in, haven’t yet pumped in the volume and you had although this people just waiting for the products to come, so waiting for the new PCs, the utilities waiting for the SSDs new generation with a better driver. I think if I’m not mistaken Windows 8 is going to drive those things much more aggressively, so that’s also you’ve got to wait to make it valuable.

So you’d be pretty big predictability of these things not because you have a view. The predictability is because you know why they are used for.",133

But when you say that you have a necessity to ramp the node 28 and then the node 22 critical mass, which is you reach still a critical mass, which represent about 250 wafers per month, because just all industries have 1000 wafers per month. I would think that is going to happen, because it has always happened. It’s a minimum numbers of wafers that the industry would bear or consider critical.

Just as a -- so continuation of the last question really related to the customer concentration and order lumpiness. Can you also comment on your lead times, I take it that these haven’t really changed and it’s just a question of sort of difference in the time from initial indication from your customers with which you can start to plan the tool manufacture to actually putting a pen to paper for the official orders that’s changed.",78

Wennink,,Executives,53,"I think, we have of course used, you may remember, because a lot of your -- the people currently on the call or were on the call last year also that we talked about lead times of our NXT program about 10 months and then to 11 months and then it actually come down significantly in the sense we’re now 6 to 7. So that is a lot better. I expect anything that we currently see not to have any issues with lead times with delivery schedules, now we’d also tell our customers, please give us the challenge to be under pressure if they want to have more tools, then fine we’ll start pushing the ciphers down in the factory again. But 6 to 7 months that’s the general lead time but like you said and Eric also said, we have these discussions with customers about their shipment pattern and then we had that agreement with them which, because of their ramp needs, is almost cast in stone, and especially when it’s 28 nanometer Logic which is extremely high in demand today. So that’s what we can plan relatively easily when the orders come, it’s just very lumpy like you say only a few customers where you can have per quarter depending on when you get the batch of those orders. You don’t get them one by one, you’ll get a batch. It could be hundreds of millions difference between one and other quarter meaning nothing. So all-in-all about the order lumpiness, one thing I would say we expect very healthy order levels basically supporting our sales guidance for this year.",271

Can you give us any information on how you are communicating this progress to your customers and what they’re telling you that they need in terms of what they need to see to a make a determination as to which node and to what extent they begin to build EUV into their roadmaps?",91

So you can consider this a victory because most of the time we’ve told you that it is not as good as we thought. So today I think we could say that we have an inflection point. So that puts us into a situation of higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is however only based on the fact, as I said 3 months ago, that we are doing experiments more than experiments, but we are checking the numbers of upgrades separately. So each of the upgrade at this moment are running pretty nicely all of them. So therefore, we have increased our level of confidence, but this is not sufficient and good enough, because the customers haven’t seen all these upgrades in, as I said in the speech, in C2. In C2 means you will try all of this into the same machine and as expected into our business, you discover a bit of issues. So on one hand, the message that we give you today is a message of we now confirm our concept and we are absolutely at 60 wafers or more per hour, there is no question. The bad news is, in C2, we may discover a numbers of clean-up activities, optimization that may have an impact of once to the situation. So the customers are not thrilled with this, because their decision has to be frozen as we said 2 months ago in the summer. So the summer looks like a time by which, one, we have to bring a certainty, and two, they have no choice and go for steam on one or the other. So this is why the summer is an important date. Now some of you would say, is the summer July 15 is when we have a recall or is the summer October 15 is when we have a recall. We do understand that in my view the summer is going to be in between because indeed it’s okay for both of us, the customers and us to struggle our way with a proof, until the proof is solid enough that they will release, so at this moment the probability of release is high enough that they negotiate the orders by the way.",385

I was wondering to understand the bit on, what you are describing between the order versus sales forecast, how that impacts how you manage your business thinking about, for example working capital it might be up and down a bit differently, holding your costs, commitments to suppliers, these sorts of things, given you’d be working without say deposits and hard purchase orders with the same length as before?",75

Wennink,,Executives,58,"Yes, well, actually we are planning our business based on the shipment commitments that we agree with the customers, and as I’ve told you earlier, then the orders will follow later on. Whether that means that we have a different risk profile with respect to our investment in working capital? That is practically not the case. We used to have orders in 2008. At the end of 2008 when we went into the financial crisis, those orders were just pushed out and they are never canceled. The orders pushed out to a point where they need them later, because it’s all about technology that doesn’t go stale. I mean NXT:1950s will still be sold in 2013, 2014 and beyond. So they never cancel, they just push back. They only have a few customers, so we accept the pushback, which means that the working capital is exactly the same as when we would not have the order. So in that sense from a working capital point of view, it doesn’t change anything. That’s why the order relevance is not that high either. It’s just the matter of do we accept the commitments of our customers to take a shipment, which will support their product roadmap which is clear to us. And if we say yes, we have the commitment in the chain,. To add to that our commitment in the supply-chain builds up overtime. So, it means that the closer we are to the shipment date the higher our commitment is to our suppliers. So it’s an effective fairly flexible, flexible system that we’re using.",264

One hand, DRAM business is going to only pick up after -- already some decisions are taken with Elpida and only by the end of the year driven by the -- multiplied by 2 DRAM content in the smartphones and the tablets, that’s only come at the end of the year. So we should be having the time to get there. Okay, in the NAND, I said, I was not sure by the drivers, but I could guess the drivers are the volume driven type drivers, which also are a type of Christmas season, new product type thing, which nicely puts us into a situation for getting the orders of these guys probably in the end of Q3 beginning of Q4 for delivery date in Q4 and deliveries into Q1. So we’ve got a high chance here to have a nice flow of those 2 segments and as some of you have already written in your notes, if you added to this 11 EUV tools that we will now recognize in 2013 we are going to have a good trans to have now a managed revenue flow, which is stable to growing nicely, although, it’s too early of course to guide on 2013.",233

So I mean what kind of capacity should we be looking at for EUV in the first full year of wrap? I mean you are going to do 11 tools next year is what you have talked about in terms of orders. I mean if you look into 2014 for instance, can you do 22 or can do you only 15?",111

So we need to be giving you proper direction. I would say at this moment, if we get 2 customers, 1 DRAM, 1 Logic to start and we get some R&D activities, you should do 15. Let’s not be over-enthusiastic about the complexity. In this transition, customers would always ask you for a lot of things in the transition and when the transition comes, they’d find ways to use most effectively the installed base. So you have to always be usually conservative as to a new technology, they want a lot and then it will reduce it by a factor, because they can use the installed base. Now if in 2014, we have a volume driven business, meaning it’s a good business like the economy is doing good. Then EUV would be even higher, because EUV would be a Greenfield and then you all are going to have much more than that. But at this moment, because none of us can call 2014, you would want to just put yourself into 2 customer plus 2 or 3 R&D and make it 15.",201

And on top of whatever Peter said, EUV will be coming in. So, let me give you my brainstorming view on that is, we book when we ship. Which is one way or we decide at some quarters to say we are going to book the whole EUV because it’s now officially assigned off spec wise or something. I don’t know, but we will not use this as a political item to save bookings quarter, in fact at this moment, our body language may have felt it, it tells you that we do -- may not need to do that anyway.

Good afternoon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations here at ASML. I would like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast. Joining me from our headquarters here in Veldhoven, the Netherlands is Mr. Eric Meurice, ASML’s CEO; and Mr. Peter Wennink, ASML’s CFO.
As the operator mentioned, the subject of today’s call is ASML’s second quarter 2012 results. However, on July 9, ASML announced a co-investment program in which customers will potentially contribute up to €1.4 billion over the next 5 years to accelerate development of 450 millimeter wafer platform and the next-generation of EUV systems; both expected to enter volume production in the second half of this decade. So we would welcome any remaining questions you might have about this program in addition to those questions you might have about our Q2 results.
At this time, I would like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and in our second quarter results presentation both of which you can find on our website at www.asml.com. This Safe Harbor statement will apply to this call and all associated presentation materials. The length of the call will be 60 minutes as normal.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Eric Meurice for a brief introduction.",227

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. Summarizing our second quarter: Sales came in just above €1.2 billion which is essentially the same as in the previous quarter. This quarter sales remained largely skewed towards the foundry IDM sector which was about 73%, including non-critical KrF systems which are supporting the capacity additions. As in the first quarter only 9% of second quarter sales went to the DRAM sector with just under 20% going to NAND customers.
The average selling price of all systems recognized in the second quarter was €22.4 million reflecting a bit higher immersion shipments than the first quarter. Service and field option sales came in at a record of €243 million which is again driven by a significant adoption of system performance enhancing [ph] field options.
Updating our previously announced share buyback program, as of July 10, 2012 last week, ASML has repurchased 33.2 million shares of which 7.5 million shares in 2012 for a total amount of €970 million of which €270 million in 2012, giving an average buyback price of €29. For regulatory reasons in connection with the Customer co-investment program which we announced last week, ASML has suspended its share buyback program from July 10, 2012 until further notice and we intend to resume share buybacks when permitted under applicable regulations.
The second quarter net bookings came in at 43 systems valued at €949 million, excluding EUV. Our booked average selling prices came in at €22 million with the quarter’s booking profile seeing a significant moderation in foundry orders at 36% of total orders, half of that, slightly half of what they were in the previous quarter. The balance of orders was almost evenly split between IDM’s NAND and DRAM. Our order backlog at the end of the second quarter was €1.5 billion, excluding EUV by the way, totaling 55 systems with a strong average selling price of €27.3 million.
The backlog profile at the end of the quarter changed as combined memory moved upwards to 36% of total versus 23% at the end of the prior quarter. Much of that change coming from DRAM as it moved from 2% to 14% off the backlog; reminding you by the way that this change is only 4 high end units divided over 3 customers.
As to the outlook, we estimate second half sales coming in between €2.2 billion and €2.4 billion with the third quarter estimate at €1.2 billion at a gross margin of 43%. R&D and SG&A expenses will be about €145 million for R&D and €60 million for SG&A which is slightly above the previous quarters as we decided to upgrade and invest in our IT infrastructure throughout the remainder of the year.
The second half looks to be sustained by an increase of system shipments supporting NAND shrink plans and by a low, but relatively stable level of DRAM system shipments. We see a lower 28 and 32 nanometer Logic shipments in the second half compared with the first half and we see IDM’s coming in slightly higher when compared to the first half of this year.
The exact level of sales achieved in the second half will largely depend on the strength of NAND pick-up to be mostly fuelled by new ultra book PCs and new smartphone ramps.
And with that short summary, I would like to turn it back to you, Eric.",563
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3586.0,327039.0,15805126.0,Presenter Speech,Eric Meurice,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Peter. It was confirmed by Peter the balance of 2012 looks, in fact, steady. This should lead to 9 consecutive quarters of about €1.2 billion or more of sales. This is pretty good in a non-fully supportive economy worldwide.
Further, our developing views on 2013 suggests that it will be supported by NAND and DRAM at the beginning of the year assuming a good pick-up of the PC ultra book business and the continuation of the high end mobile unit growth along with a steady shipment to IDM’s which is also driven by PC’s and a start-up of 20 nanometer Foundry Logic by midyear 2013.
The reason for the acceleration of the Logic business in 2013 is a shortened node transition period between the current 28 nanometer node and the future 22 nanometer node which will be about only one year driven by the current race for best integration, best feature set, best power consumption in the mobile arena, where Intel architecture, the Intel architecture and the ARM architecture will boost play. This transition is also very, very lithography intensive as we expect between 1.7 and 2x more immersion systems used for wafer start in 22 nanometer compared to 28 nanometer.
EUV for R&D use will also contribute to 2013 sales as we will ship up to 11 systems of the 3300 as we planned now for a long time. These will not contribute to production by customers. They will be only used for recipe engineering; but this will create nearly €800 million of revenue for ASML which will add to the base sales for 2013.
Technically, to keep our immersion leadership we continue to enhance the overlay throughput performance of our TWINSCAN NXT:1950 system. One of the system, by the way, has exceeded productivity milestone, an enormous one, of more than 5,100 wafers in a single day at the customer manufacturing site to 600 wafer more per day than the previous record, achieved only 3 months ago. It illustrates the continuing productivity improvement of our platforms for high volume chip manufacturing. In addition, we will introduce a new version of the NXE even capable of higher performance, higher throughput and also better overlay along with an install base upgrade by mid 2013.
We will continue in parallel to develop and introduce the extensive line of holistic lithography software hardware product, so as to enable required process control machine matching improvement which is necessary in the complex nodes of the future. As part of this product portfolio, our computational lithography unit Brion has delivered significant enhancement with leading mask 3D models and applications which are required at the 20, 22 nanometer node and below. The full accuracy of the Brion mask 3D model can now be realized with virtually a 0 incremental computational costs versus substantially less accurate thin mask models.
Regarding our EUV program, customers have now exposed more than 15,000 wafers on the 6 machine to 6 NXE:3100 product development systems which are currently installed and we are confirming steady progress qualifying the platform towards customer production ramp -- in fact, the new platform, towards customer production ramp for 2014. This platform has shown exceptional performance with demonstrated 6 nanometer on product overlay and with dedicated chuck overlay of less than 2 nanometer which is extraordinary performance.
We have made constant progress on the EUV source which, as you know, has been for a while the critical pass technology that we have to master. With regards to the productivity itself, 50 watt power capability has now been repeatedly demonstrated at one supplier and 105 watt concept potential has been confirmed in lab experiments supporting our roadmap to volume production system starting at 70 wafer per hour in 2014 and upgradable to 125 wafer per hour 2 years later.
However, in situ not only lab, but in situ experiments on the new machine called the NXE:3300 will be still necessary for full confirmation of this roadmap; although as already planned we still target together in effect by late summer to prove and confirm that roadmap.
In view of the progress made, we have received a customer commitment to purchase 4 additional NXE:3300 systems. That makes it a total of 15 preparing, in fact, for the first semiconductor device production on EUV in 2014. So in summary, we are encouraged as Peter said by the forward term view 2012 and by the immediate to long-term prospect of this lithography market which is very, very much driven by a huge industry technology transition appetite. So with this Peter and I will be pleased to take your questions.",768

My question is actually more to do with the announcement last week and your R&D expense. Given the last week’s announcement you obviously intend to increase your R&D budget by 25%, I suppose starting from next year, and I was just wondering how you will be recording this on your P&L and how will you be recording the cash from your customers which is being paid for this extra R&D. I mean should we be anticipating a contraction in your operating margin next year and hence EPS, as well as a real revenue benefit from this higher R&D will only be coming in a few years time? So that’s my first question and I have a follow-up.",124

The accounting is going to be a bit different per customer in case of a significant party, the accounting of these funding will be done below or above the gross margin line so there will be a bit of difficulty to trace all these numbers. But as a generality, we intend to manage the P&L as we have always been doing which is providing to the market a steady increase of profitability. We expect the steady increase to come through this funding a bit, but also through the fact that this acceleration of new products is going to deliver a higher top line. So we are going to have a higher top line, we are probably are going to have a higher gross margin because of these accounting situations. We are going to have a higher R&D gross expense because, in fact, we will invest more in R&D for these accelerations and a part of that will be compensated by the R&D funding; but in any case we do expect a steady increase of our profitability.",194

So we’re going to have to ship lithography tool and then 6 months or so later, you will see the chips. So we’re talking about chips out in 2013, lithography in starting Q4, Q1, Q2 of 2013. This pickup will be new factories, yes, absolutely and requirement for more machines because of the technology transitions. So you’re going to have the 2 drivers: more factories, more wafers and more machines per wafer to adapt to the new technology. Your other question was?",113

We just follow what Gartner says and at this moment I think Gartner, kind of says 40ish -45% gross of DRAM, I guess, and about 60% gross on NAND. If these numbers are realized, we will grow as we said. We also believe from what we heard from the importance of the new FormFactor PC and new drive, then the Gartner numbers may be conservative. So in other terms, if the Gartner numbers are what they are, they will sustain gross for us and it is possible that the Gartner numbers are a bit conservative.",102

Just to follow-up a little bit on the memory side, you said that in the first half of next year your sales will be more to the DRAM and NAND segment and then with the Foundries picking up around the middle of the year. So what kind of visibility do you have on that memory spending for the first half of next year? Do you have sort of commitments which are not yet reflected in your purchase orders and therefore not shown in your backlog? Or is it that you are expecting those orders to come through to you -- all those commitments to come through to you over the next couple of quarters? And a follow-up is on EUV, you said you will hit 70 wafers an hour by 2014 and 120 wafers a couple of years later. So what kind of throughput do expect to get to when you start shipping the units at the end of this year or early next year for the NXE:3300?",174

We have a startup of orders, bookings which came driven by these goals curve so we have a bit -- we have received a numbers of orders for that but most of the orders haven’t come yet. There are more commitments/production expectations, so they will come into the backlog through new bookings in Q3 and Q4. Regarding the speed of EUV, so the reason why we still don't have factual data on the speed itself of EUV machine is because the lab experiments are driven in the lab as well as in -- on the 3100 architecture which is not similar architecture than the 3300 machine which is planned to be available to experiment by October-November timeframe. So only by then we will know exactly how all these technologies, how do you say, get installed onto the “final machine.” The minimum performance from what we can see at this moment would be, I would say, a 30-ish wafer per hour if we get unlucky on the first machine with more work to stabilize the control mechanism potentially taking 3 months, 6 months or so to get to a point where the 30 wafer per hour will transform itself in 70.",214

We are negotiating a number, additional number. The data today is good enough to suggest that you should start investing into production in 2014. I would even say to you with the data that we have today, if we were to stop any development we would get to the 30, 40 wafer per hour. So yes, without anymore development based on the new machine, the 3300 which is much more effective, I mean, energy effective and that already would not be a bad number for production. So the level of customer risk for 2014 at this moment has reduced significantly. Now don’t get me to say that 40 wafer per hour is a good number and it’s my new commitment; it’s not what I mean. But it says that the worst case situation, in case a terrible situation happen by which we can’t do even any progress, is already not a catastrophe.",159

Two questions, if I may; the first one is that you are talking already of the 22 nanometer or 20, 22 nanometer transition and you are saying there is some weakness in 28 to 32. Can you tell us where we are exactly in the current transition? And you also said that 20, 22 was twice as much litho-intensive than the previous generation. Can you remind us how much more intensive is the 32 for the 28? And also second question on the bunch of orders for EUV, can you specify if it’s for memory, if it’s only for one customer? And I heard you say that you had you are negotiating currently. Are you currently negotiating the new bunch of order?",126
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3586.0,327039.0,15805144.0,Answer,Eric Meurice,,Executives,22,"Okay. So a good set of questions. So I didn’t say that 28 was weak, I said that we are getting to the end of the buildup of 28 nanometer capacity. So if we ship all the plans up to the end of Q4, we would have reached about 200,000 wafers per month, 200,000 to 220,000. There is a set of customers who tell us that 28 will continue well in to 2013 and there are plans at this moment to get from this 200,000, 220,000 to about 350,000 wafers per month capacity. So if I were to listen to customers at this moment, I would in fact tell you that 28 nanometer is only 70% done and you need another 30% or whatever capacity to be built on, even with upside possibility by Q4 and clearly significant shipment in Q1 and Q2 2013. So call it a potential upside for 2013. So 2028 in our press release is like we would have expected this to stabilize at 220,000 to 230,000 wafers but people are talking about more. The 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer is -- usually would have started in 2014 but in view of the huge drive by the mobile environment in which you have the big fight between the ARM architecture and the Intel architecture, whose architecture driving to excellence and excellence being very far away, let me try to explain. When you get to an application where you still have multiple chips, you have a chipset into a smartphone, you know that you’re forced to try to get the chipset to be integrated on to one chip. Until that continues, there will be a huge incentive to customers to try to make that leap and get to the next technology, which allows you to have the famous one-chip solution. So we expect the one-chip solution to happen beyond 20-nanometer, 22-nanometer and we expect this to be a hard fought battle between the Intel architecture and the ARM architecture. So that creates a momentum in the market on the side of Intel and on the side of the others to build up these new technologies faster than ever before. So that will benefit lithography because, in addition, those technologies are very complicated to build; as I said, 1.7x to 2x more lithography-intensive by wafer on 20, 22 versus 28,32, because 28,32 is the same node. So if you wanted to compare 28,32 to 45 nanometer I cannot answer your question easily, but here we can get you the data in due time if you call Franki or Craig. Regarding EUV, so yes at that moment the units that we have accepted an order are for DRAM. As we always said, DRAM at least 2 critical layers are so complicated that I guess if we do not execute EUV by 2014, there will be a delay in the shrink. So customers have realized that and therefore they are usually incentivized to do that. The second set of batch of orders that we are currently negotiating are for also 2014 and they are for DRAM. The third set is for Logic and in the Logic arena we expect to have to be in production for 2015 or so in a node which will be called anywhere near 14 nanometer or 11 or 12 nanometer whatever, but they will mean the same thing. You are going to have in the Logic arena, a node which will look like a 20-nanometer design rule using architectures of transistors like FinFET. That would be a node that will come just beyond 20,22 and then on the back of it there will be, in 2015 or so, a node that was using same type of architecture FinFET, but with a shrink factor and that node will be called 14 or 12 or whatever for, I would say, marketing reasons and that node is absolutely requires EUV. Without EUV you cannot shrink. So in other terms if I make myself clear you are going to have 20,22; you are going to have 20,22 with a type of FinFET architecture which allows an improved performance, but not yet a shrink; and you are going to have that technology shrunk. And that will happen from now on until 2015-16 and that's, again, hugely lithography intensive. Even whether you use immersion, double, double patterning or you use EUV, you are talking about huge numbers of critical layers and a huge number of lithography-enabling tools like the holistic lithography set of products that we have. So we see Logic dwarfing basically DRAM anyway by 2015 or so, back with revenge.",768

Wennink,,Executives,23,"Yes and just on your question what the difference was between the 28 and the 20-nanometer nodes in terms of lithography usage. On the 28 nanometer node, the average that we've looked at is about 1 or 2 double patterning layers for a 28-nanometer node going to about 10 at 20. So that is quite a significant increase in double patterning. Of course some of that we will compensate by giving customers access to new technology that gives them higher throughput and better yield, so some of it will be compensated through the new technology that we are shipping.",100

Actually I had a similar question about the layer intensity, but I was wondering whether maybe you could help us understand how we should translate that sort of layer intensity into a percentage of sales computation. I think the one thing that is obvious that is that lithography has clearly been the one area in Semi CapEx overall or we just have equipment at least where capital intensity is not falling, but the historical average I think is sort of in the 15% range. Any sense as to whether that 15% is now slightly 20% or 18% or any sort of measure to the top of increase that you may expect would be very helpful.",119

Wennink,,Executives,28,"Yes, I think, this is going to be a repeat of what we said last quarter. Basically we have the policy to return cash that we don't need and we do that through share buybacks and through dividends, whereby the latter we intend to let it grow, but once we have decided to let it grow, it at least has to be stable at that level. Clearly, what we have decided internally that we will use the full period to reassess every 1 or 2 years, we are going to reassess the policy, the capital policy of the company, and we are going to review whether the ratio between share buybacks and dividends as we have seen in the past whether that should remain or whether we should adapt that to different use. So that is more, let’s say, a further detailing of our overall policy which is the money that we don’t need, we will give back. As I said in my introductory comments, we have temporarily suspended the share buyback program because of regulatory reasons. Once those have been resolved and they result from the transaction that you mentioned last week, then we will just resume share buybacks as we did before.",204

As some of you know the 11 original tools are as-is because the customers accepted to participate to this project as a R&D project. As we know this is beyond commercial relationship, this is a development of a new technology so they accepted to take the 2D 11 tools as-is so we can ship at the best specification we can get and that’s it; which is why we believe that we are going to recognize the revenue next year no matter what the exact performance of the tool is. However, we mentioned clearly to the customers that we now are ready to take a firm commitment on the specification. We did not get feedback from the customers; indeed they understand that we have to take that responsibility which solely defies in fact the fact that we are serious for production in 2014.

The consolidation has 2 values: One, it creates an opportunity for customers to have R&D capability and the fear factor for us remains only whether customers can shrink. If customers can shrink and there is enough design to take the shrink, lithography will be a huge growth businesses for the future. So the fundamental is we need customers capable of shrinking; we need customers capable of R&D and, therefore, we are very, very happy with consolidation. This is huge compared to any commercial short term situation. The second bit about consolidation is what happened last week is, in fact, due to the fact that the consolidation of large customers allows us to make a point that lithography becomes a nature or it’s a weapon required by the whole industry, for the whole industry’s benefit. And if you had 15, 20 customers this message would have been extremely difficult to pass where the 15, 20 customers would fight themselves to try to have a smart way of solving the lithography system. But with a fundamental, say, 10, 8 large customers they understand that lithography has become the weapons that they have to help to subsidize to get going for their own business model which, at the end of the day, is designing chips for shrink. So consolidation is a very good thing for that and it has helped us tremendously in the discussions of the deal, first with Intel and at this moment with the others.",252

We've -- at the danger of repeating myself, at last quarter I also said that the gross margin target for 2013 is the high 20s. That is what we are focusing at on EUV; yes, yes, thank you, Eric, just to make that sure. And we need about 2 years it appears to get to the corporate average, that's what we've said before. This is still our target. Now on the gross margin of the non-EUV tools, you can always -- if you re-look a bit deeper into our current results and you look at our gross margins that we are currently showing, that gross margin currently includes running EUV cost that we have in EUV factory that we currently have. So the gross margins stay where they are from a corporate point of view. So from a corporate average point of view they stay flat while our costs have gone up, so you can deduce from that, that the underlying gross margins of our non-EUV tools have actually gone up, which is true, and that has been driven by the increase of the system enhancements which we sell on top of the bad tool. That has given it a positive side or, what I would say, a positive boost to the gross margin profile of the non-EUV tools and has helped us cover the current EUV running costs that are not part of cost of goods.",238

The question asked and it’s not our opinion, sorry that I missed it. I did not communicate our opinion. We did not want in the press release to say the €2.2 billion to €2.4 billion guidance reflect an upside; it doesn’t. Now there is always a possibility of an upside. Why would they go for an upside; what’s the rationale? The rationale is that they have under-invested in 45 nanometer, 40, 45 nanometer. The 65 was a big node; 28 could be a very big node to compensate for the fact that they didn’t transfer too many things on 45 nanometer. So there is a business model out there that says, in fact, 28 should be bigger and we don’t have an opinion on that. We have to see whether they are right and whether, in fact, there is going to be so many mobile systems, et cetera. If you talk to the fabless guys and they talk about the potential numbers of smartphones at 2 billion, going from 1.2 billion or so, 1.2 billion, 1.3 billion to 2 billion if that’s a case, yes, you can imagine that they will need much more wafers.",201

And then just secondly I guess, wonder, Peter, in terms of hiring the additional R&D staff that you need, the 25% to 30% additional R&D engineers, what, I guess, problems that poses and whether you feel you can get the available labor for 450 mm [ph] in the second phase of the EUV.",119

You talked about our ratio 1.7x to 2x more litho. No, I think we always said that. I do not remember having said less than that. In fact, we were waiting a bit to know if that ratio is based on the same yield and the same utilization rate than 28 because you don’t want to be biased by a difficult start and the 2x to -- 1.7x to 2x is based on a good start. So if 20, 22 is a big issue where they have trouble to do yield and to do utilization, then we will have to ship even more than what we’ve planned.

We have dozens of companies that actually help us find those people. Those are specialized engineering companies which basically temp labor companies so there they are already gearing up. I think I mentioned on the previous call that over the last 12 to 18 months about 50% of the people that we hired were non-Dutch so we basically kept them out of the European zone and so we are not confined to the Netherlands only. So it is us and our supply chain, which I mean the flex labor supply chain, that have to deal with this particular challenge. But also some of that work, and I think a significant part of that work, will go into the supply chain with our knowledge and research institute partners which, of course, have also people available now and especially in this macroeconomic circumstances and they are glad to take up the challenge to provide us with additional engineers. So yes, it is going to be -- and also it's going to take a bit of time until we ramp till the peak of the program with 2, 3 years down the road, probably 2 years, which also gives us a bit of time to actually hire those engineers. And hiring 750 or 800 engineers per year we have done that before. So yes, it will be a challenge for our HR organization but in these times that’s a nice challenge.",267

I think it's a good thing for the industry, so it’s going to be a good thing for us. As you know, you may be asking your question because some of our peers are concerned about 450 mm. If you are a chamber-type business, 450 mm is a big problem because the same chamber in the same time would process twice as many dies. So theoretically if your price is about the same because the chamber has the same price, you would cut your business by a factor 2; so 450 mm would be a very negative point for a chamber-type business. We are not a chamber-type business, we are painting business. The painter is a big lens and it paints a centimeter by centimeter or nanometer by nanometer and therefore if you have on the same wafer more nanometer where the painter will spend more time. So the machine itself you will need as many machine per square centimeter on the 300 mm base or 450 mm, it doesn’t change at all our economics. We were a bit concerned that we would have to do this work without the industry completely aligned on the specification and the timing, and we would have to overinvest in R&D in a wait-and-see attitude. And then, as usual, wait and then have the machine ready, nobody takes it and then 2, 3 years later somebody takes it. That would have been a cost inefficient way. Now with this consortium that we've built we are now pretty happy that the execution is an execution between consolidated customers, consolidated suppliers and we can align the dates, align the money and therefore do this in a most efficient way.",289

But in 2018 when those machines will be in production, the 300 mm machine will cost X times more than what we are doing today. So the NXT machine of -- 3300 mm machine of 2018 will cost, I don’t want to give you a number, but in the 70 million anyway, so -- and the 450 equivalent would cause 77 or something of this nature. So the ASP gross comes through the resolution and the performance of the machine [indiscernible] and not so much of the die size -- I mean the wafer size, the wafer size will get us an additional inflation of 10%, roughly.",136

Wennink,,Executives,64,"Yes, on the revenue recognition, Eric said, I think, at the beginning of this call when somebody asked a similar question, we have for the first 11 or 12 units we have an agreement with our customers that they accept the tools as-is because it's more an R&D project and that we basically share the risk of the introduction of that tool. So that, that will be when we ship the tool, we book the revenue but also we will book the order. I mean, how many orders we have so if you want to see when it flows into the backlog and when it goes out, it will be a turns business when we ship, so we give you a separate number of units that we have on the order. Beyond that we said the tools that we are booking today, they will -- they are currently being booked with a certain performance criteria that we need to meet at shipment which will be for 2014, which will basically mean that we will have revenue recognition as we have it today. And also we will have bookings as we have it today. But for the first 12, so that’s for the next 12 months, you will see turns when we book the revenue for the first 11, 12 units.",220

And in terms of the dollar value of booking, should we expect similar trends like last year where foundries took a pause? It did have an adverse impact on overall booking, but then it came back very strong in Q4 of last year with shipment for 2012. Should we assume the same kind of trend especially given the higher dollar of booking because of the increased capital intensity?",91

No, no, no, it’s too early. It's too early. What we said at the beginning of the call is we have a number of positive drivers. The biggest one is 20, 22 nanometer ramp. It could be a big one. As I said, it’s a multiplier by 1.7x to 2x the run rate of 28 nanometer. So if it starts early enough in 2013 and you will have a run rate which is 1.7, double time, what will happen in 2012 then of course it will only be 6 months. But then in the first 6 months if you have NAND and DRAM, as we said we’re going to have and if the upside on 28 nanometer comes in, 2013 is a fairly good year and therefore there is growth of immersion tools. Then you add to this, the famous 800 million of EUV and then 2013 is a pretty good year. But it is too early. In 6 months, 22 nanometer may be delayed because of a technology issue. Qualcomm may say the price is too high so I am not going to convert my 28 to 22 so quickly. You may have some impacts. So it’s too early to build up your firm semi [ph].",226

I was just wondering how are you going to be de-risking yourself in terms of the laser source vendors. It looks like one of them is ahead of the pack. I was just wondering that given that there could be so many challenges ahead, so how are you de-risking yourself and how are you pushing the other vendors to come up to certain level in terms of the source power so that you can kind of pick-and-choose between those vendors?

So indeed at this moment one of the vendor is ahead of the pack as you know. And as you also know, we are investing significantly into this relationship for them to succeed. On the other hand, it is our responsibility to derisk the situation. So there are numbers of ways of derisking, one is we are still working with Ushio and with Gigaphoton on their own business model. Clearly one of them has a business model of insertion of EUV in due time, so this is not a race of only one horse. The timing is not immediate, however it does help in the production that on R&D because production, as we said, is only starting in 2014, 2015, but then in '16, '17, '18 is when the unit comes in. So if you have a second player coming for production, it's derisking the situation. On the other hand also, we are building, as you know, a knowledge of the sources and so for us it will be easier also to know what to do in case we need to be even more involved into source development.",190

Wennink,,Executives,3,"Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone. As mentioned by Eric, I will focus on a review of our third quarter results, which are very much in line with expectations, and we’ll close off with a brief overview of the other announcements we made [indiscernible] today with Cymer.
A quick look at our third quarter. Sales results show us coming in at about EUR 1.23 billion, just above our guided level. This is very much in line with the previous quarter. This quarter sales remained largely skewed towards the foundry and IDM sectors, which accounted for about 70%, including non-critical KrF systems, which supported the capacity additions.
Memory combined represented the balance at 30%. This percentage seems high when looking at the state of the memory market, but we recognized a few leading-edge evaluation systems as sales in the third quarter that were shipped in prior quarters. This issue also affected the memory bookings in the quarter as these are recognized as turns business.
In addition, there is increasing uncertainty in the last few quarters as to the application for which these systems are used, which lead us to combined memory sales and bookings data DRAM and NAND in our presentation materials this quarter. The ASP of all system recognized in Q3 was EUR 35 million, which is an increase of about 10% from the previous quarter. Service and field option sales remained at a healthy level of around EUR 230 million.
Q3 net bookings came in at EUR 830 million for 33 systems, excluding EUV. We have booked average selling prices at around EUR 25 million versus EUR 22 million in the second quarter. The quarter’s bookings profile was skewed by the turns business of the evaluation systems as mentioned previously. Our order backlog at the end of Q3 was EUR 1.34 billion, excluding EUV, totaling 48 systems. The backlog profile at quarter’s end remained very similar to that at the end of the prior quarter.
Regarding our share buyback program, as of July 9, ASML had to suspend the current program for regulatory reasons in connection with the Customer Co-Investment Program. And in Q4, we planned to reinitiate and complete the previously announced buyback program of EUR 1.13 billion.
As to the outlook, we anticipate fourth quarter sales coming in at about EUR 1 billion putting 2012 annual revenues at about EUR 4.7 billion. A gross margin of about 41% is expected from Q4 sales. R&D and SG&A expenses will be about EUR 155 million for R&D and EUR 64 million for SG&A. The increase in R&D is a result of the initial ramp of the 450 millimeter program, for which the Co-Investment Program has been initiated. Customer funding of this program will start by the way in 2013. The increase in SG&A is due to a one-time Dutch austerity taxation for the year 2012, on high-income individuals, which taxation is fully payable by the company. This charge will be booked fully in the fourth quarter.
We currently recognize our customers’ uncertainty regarding underlying semiconductor demand in the tablet and smartphone segments, as well as the fact that the PC sector is not yet accelerated by Windows 8 and the Ultrabook form factor. The uncertainty around broad-based semiconductor demand, which is especially relevant in the memory sector, where spending is expected to remain subdued for the next 2 quarters, is currently limiting our view of 2013 rendering us unable to be specific with a reasonable level of certainty about the coming quarters at this time.
We do see, however, sustained demand for the logic sector as the planned 28 nanometer node strategic buildup to a worldwide capacity of about 30,000 wafer starts per month is expected by the middle of next year, mid-2013, and as the 22 nanometer logic ramp will start in second half of next year. The reason for the strength of the logic business is due to the accelerated ramp times of the current advanced technologies and to a reduced time period between the transition from 28 nanometers to 22 nanometer nodes.
As previously mentioned, this transition is very lithography intensive with a significant increase in immersion tool usage versus the 28 nanometer node. In addition, there are revenue impact of market uncertainties, we anticipate the shipments of our first 11 NXE:3300B EUV systems that will help prepare our customers for the insertion of EUV in volume production lines by 2014. This will contribute approximately EUR 700 million in revenues for next year.
Turning the subject of our offer to acquire Cymer. As per this morning’s press release, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of San Diego by Cymer Incorporated. The transaction, which was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of ASML and Cymer, would entitle each Cymer shareholder to receive $20 in cash and a fixed ratio of 1.1502 ASML ordinary shares per Cymer shares.
The issued ASML shares will be New York shares and will be listed on NASDAQ. As it will take some time to harvest most of the obvious synergies resulting from this merger, we believe that the first 12 months after the closing of the transaction will be somewhat dilutive to a maximum level of 5% of the earnings per share. But 24 months after the closing, we should see the full benefits of the synergies and that should account for up to 5% accretion of the earnings per share.
These assumptions by the way do not yet include the impact of the accounting of the purchase price allocations, which the impact needs to be determined after closing. And we expect the transaction to close in the course of 2013.
And with that, I would like to turn it back to, over to you, Eric.",962
388904.0,"ASML Holding NV, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,48.0,Earnings Calls,ASML Holding N.V.,3674.0,366065.0,17478136.0,Presenter Speech,Eric Meurice,,Executives,4,"Thank you, Peter. Let me in fact focus my comments on the planned acquisition of Cymer. This move is designed to achieve in fact 3 things. First thing is to derisk and accelerate the Extreme Ultraviolet, the EUV, technology roadmap. Second thing is to give a similar positive impact of a steady and growing service business. And the third facet is to improve our financials through the benefit of vertical integration and of synergies. So let’s go back and discuss these 3 points.
Regarding the objective of overall derisking and accelerating EUV development as well as creating synergies; we believe that this merger will enable significant execution performance improvement. First, it will help taking duplication out of development. Responsibility for each key module like the vessel, the CO2 laser, the C laser, control software, algorithm et cetera, et cetera will be assigned to only one site without fear of IP know-how transfer control with no need to duplicate or to distribute development ownership in a non-optimized fashion. The development will also benefit from the flexibility of a larger pool of dedicated talents, dedicated experts.
Secondly reducing the complexity of manufacturing and test flows, module will be manufactured in numbers of Centers of Excellence, of course in San Diego, Veldhoven and at our key suppliers. They will then be integrated and qualify as a system near the scanner or at the customer site. This will save the cost and time of assembly and testing at the different locations.
Regarding the objective of improving our financial prospects, of course part of it comes with the synergies and efficiency I just talked about. But also by integrating such a high-value component of the total machine, we will certainly increase our gross margin, mathematically, while we will scale R&D and SG&A structures through the synergies, thus creating an EPS improvement opportunity.
Regarding the objective of getting access to a growing service business, we’re very much encouraged that the source business as per nature includes a significant consumable content, like the oil for printers, which is even more significant for the EUV technology, and this will ensure growing profit opportunity on a somewhat less cycle-dependent business. This merger is also well-timed. We now expect steady progress towards 2014 production goal of achieving 69 wafer per hour, a goal which we disclosed, I remember about a year ago.
On the overall scanner system, from the scanner system not the source, the progress has been excellent. The customers have now exposed more than 23,000 wafers on the 6 NXE:3100 machines which are currently installed. Regarding the 11 NXE:3300 system, which is a new generation being prepared for shipment for 2013. The platform has already shown exceptional performance, demonstrating imaging of the level of 16 nanometer, direct imaging of 16 nanometer, and overlay of significantly less than 2 nanometers or extremely good performance, confirming that the system itself is ready for high time.
On the source front, the progress has been made first in stabilizing the source utilization rate in the field. In the field, the sources themselves can now reliably can be expose. Second, we have now been able to prove 30-watt exposure of power equivalent to about 18 or 20 wafer per hour on an NXE:3300 on a sustainable basis in different lab experiments at Cymer and ASML.
We would have hoped to have shown about 40 wafer per hour not 18, 20 equivalent by now, but it was more difficult than expected to obtain beam control stability during the summer as we worked on. The achieved 30-watt plateau, however, is a very good basis from which to move up, or hopefully steadily towards our 2014 goal of 105-watt, or 69 wafer per hour equivalent as I mentioned at the beginning.
Last quarter I also mentioned that we had received customer commitments to purchase 4 additional NXE:3300 for delivery in 2014. And we are now expecting another 4 to 8 commitment to be received in the next 6 months from multiple customers and as the industry prepares for first semiconductor device production from these EUV systems by 2014 as again we planned since about a year.
One last word regarding the status of our Customer Co-Investment Program. As you know, we received shareholders' approval for execution of this program in September. This program allows investment by Intel, TSMC and Samsung in 23% of our equity and provides also for the commitments of these 3 customers of nearly EUR 1.4 billion of R&D funding over the next 5 years. The share issuance to those customers and the related synthetic share buyback, which avoids any dilution, will be completed in Q4 as planned.
The proposed merger with Cymer is very, very much in keeping with the objective of this Customer Co-Investment program, as it enables the next step in technology, which was an objective of the Co-Investment Program. The merger itself will also be significantly facilitated by the customer R&D financing pledge, the EUR 1.38 billion I talked about, and by the customer backing of our equity through the fact that they will own soon 23% of our shares.
So with that, Peter and I are pleased to take your questions.",863

If 1 of us would -- 1 of the 2 partner would see things differently, like 1 of us would protect IP, 1 of us would try to do something in parallel, et cetera, you can create a risk of a fight, risk of economic -- with a negotiation, which would be of no value for both, and also the human factor. To get engineers to work together, it’s always better to put them into the same aquarium as opposed to different aquarium. So it’s an efficiency question. It’s also a business question.

Well, the CapEx trend, I think Peter was clear in mentioning that at this moment, the logic business is clearly on a roll. There is indeed discussion within the market about where the different players are manufacturing the project. And everybody knows that as discussion where Apple would have their different logic chip manufacturers, et cetera, et cetera. All this is happening, however, we see a steady request for our machine for capacity, because 28 nanometer has not yet reached the level of capacity required necessary for just basic demand of these products. That will go up to June and we think these are strategic buys, they won’t move with market's short-term fluctuations. And we have seen that 22 nanometer, which was immediately after 28 is in fact accelerated, because there is a war out there between the different architectures, ARM versus microprocessor architectures, which pushes everybody to be even more aggressive in the logic arena in their shrink strategy. So we're going to have a significant demand on 22 nanometer second half of the year. And as I think we mentioned now for 2 or 3 session in a row, 22 nanometer is a huge node in terms of numbers of lithography layers. In fact, I mentioned last quarter that we think the multiplier is 1.7, 1.7x more machines in 22 nanometer than 28, would require for the same amount of wafers. We think now it's going towards 2, 1.7 to 2, so that is good inflation here for lithography. The trend, however, in memories is clearly, in fact, there is no trend. At this moment, it’s a dead duck business, there is no trend, but that doesn’t mean it won’t come back. This is a key message we have to give. We don’t want to say that we lose something that the business in 2013 will not be sustained in the memory business, no. I think we are saying that, there is absolutely no statistics as to where the PC business will be. And without any clarity on that number, I could understand our customers waiting to see how much DRAM capacity needs to be built, and how much NAND capacity needs to be built, because as you know, the new PC form factor, which is basically a tablet with a keyboard and in fact more NAND and more DRAM than the tablet. That thing is going to be a huge factor to the capacity requirement. So it is a key question mark as to exactly what the number is and when is that going to start? Let’s say, we will all feel probably the data when Windows 8 starts, and Window 8 as we know is a enabler to these new form factors, and it will have this time a significant impact on the PC trend. So we have to wait, and I don’t think at this moment, anyone of us would be able to say there is a negative trend. There is just no trend, no position at this moment. If you talk about the 3D structures and things, yes that has always been the case. You have a numbers of opportunity for 3D structures, which means more traditional lithography and less state-of-the-art lithography. But as we often say where we simulate this impact on lithography plus or minus 10% of the NAND business, so it’s not something that you could see easily compared to other parameters.",572

Wennink,,Executives,17,"Yes, for the valuation, it was pretty much based on the fundamental analysis of the business. We of course work in the same business, so we understand the business of Cymer quite well. They understand our business also very well. As you know, with every scanner where it has one DPV light source sold, and with 1 EUV scanner, it will be 1 EUV source. So there was a lot of insight on both sides on, let’s say, the fundamentals of the market that we are currently operating in. And we basically looked at it from 2 sides, you have the EUV business, which is a business that is surrounded with, like Eric said, still has a lot of execution issues that you could call it execution risks, but there are also executional opportunities. But that is less straightforward than the DPV light source business with a very large service component. So a significant part of the fundamental evaluation can be attributed to the DPV business, where of course there is also potential significant part of evaluation for the EUV business, but there are still a lot of things need to happen and that of course could be realized when we put the 2 companies together for the reasons that Eric just talked about. Now after having done that fundamental analysis, we of course also look at where the share prices of the 2 companies were over the last 3 to 6 months. This is not a cash deal, we believe that it's largely a deal that will be paid in the shares of ASML, which makes it clear, this is from our point of view very much a strategic deal. So we also look at the, let’s say, 3 and 6 months premium based. So it would take the fundamental analysis and the valuation what kind of premium would that in the end represent. We came between 50% to 60%, if you take 50%, tack on the 6 months on a 3 months basis and looking at precedent transactions for strategic acquisitions, that falls right in the middle of those precedent transactions. So from both sides, I think from a premium analysis point of view, but very much from a fundamental evaluation point of view, that’s how we came to where we are today.",385

Two facets to your questions, one is, we do not choose who is the source is, supplier is, our customer do. So for instance, Samsung or Intel or Toshiba or TSMC would ask us which supplier they would want us to have and then we qualify what they are requiring. So the future market share of Gigaphoton and/or Cymer depends in fact on again their choice, not ours. So we feel that this is a very important point to the authorities.

So that will happen sometime in the first or second quarter of 2013. But that issue is of much less importance, it has logistic problem, yes, are we going to make it exactly on time, et cetera.

We definitively would plan to have this group, this division as again an independent division. And they would have to justify the business on their own. So at this moment clearly there would be no decision on our side. We will wait for close to have a proposal made by the current management of Cymer. Regarding the NAND orders, yes, we are seeing in fact our famous simulation system says that, we should start seeing some orders, but we don’t yet. And the real point at this moment is that, in the production environment, you can always squeeze a bit your environment, your production to get more out, so we see this is happening, but not yet to a level where we would get orders, because again, nobody really can understand the capacity required by the PC environment.

So all this is just the same type of behavior potentially improved, but not because of the merger, just because we are in a situation of cooperation. I believe the law would be a concern to us if there was a risk that either of the 2 companies would reduce or lose numbers of rights or assets during this transition period, that’s not case.

Basically, when we looked at it, we said we work both companies, like I said earlier, we work in the same segment. We also I believe after I think talked to Cymer and Cymer listened -- talking to us. We identified that in the shareholder base of the 2 companies were very much a focus of the shareholders on similar issues like the success of the EUV program going forward and the value that could generate to the company going forward. So actually it appeared that both shareholders basis institutional investors focused on the semiconductor industry, especially at equipment industry with an understanding of where we are going with our technology choices. That made it for us clear that a deal on the basis of stock would actually be the most logical, because the institutional investor exposure would actually stay in fact at the same with regards to the industry that they are investing in. One of the requests was that of course cash is always an attractive feature, but that should not be the, let’s say, main element of this consideration. We wanted to do that, but basically the majority we wanted to be in stock to reflect the strategic nature of this transaction and the cash was there too as an additional request and we were fine to do that.",237

Just 2 questions, 1 is on the foundry side, on the logic side. I’m just wondering given that capacity at 28 nanometer is being ramped up as about 200,000 wafers this year and then to 300,000 wafers by middle of next year plus the 22 nanometer ramp in the second half of next year. If you just compare those 2 ramps without taking into consideration any other factors like, what end demand may be, et cetera, what would be foundry CapEx spending overall this year versus next year? Would that be a flattish trend, would that be up, or would that be down just based on the up to 200,000 this year and then 300,000? Of course, I agree that the slightly unknown factor is the extent of the 22 nanometer ramp next year, but I presume you have some idea there. The second question is on the acquisition of Cymer.

But I think it’s 40K wafer capacity, which would be planned, so on that assumption, which is realistic, we would expect a flat logic. But if it is more than 40K on 22 nano, and that could be because there could be additional customer coming in 22 nanometer because the current plan that we have is a very limited numbers of customers would go into 22.

We think that Gigaphoton’s business model has been to get into EUV, when EUV is more mature, to get to this business as a follower. It is our understanding that they are still expecting to do so, and therefore when they get into the business, they will then benefit from what I explained it before, which was equal opportunity based on the decisions made by the end customer. So in other terms, in this business it’s obvious that we did not expect this before the merger plan that the 2 would come early. We always expected Giga to be a follower, and this new concept doesn’t change that. We are going to make sure that our division Cymer is indeed going to get this EUV machine early enough and cost effectively. And then in 2, 3, 4 years or whatever, Giga will come in when EUV is, in fact it is a big business in which case everybody would be happy.",175

And there is also 1 of those systems is going to be an R&D system, which is going to be booked as a credit into the R&D line. But we will be a bit of accounting accrual what we normally have with some, but it is largely the fact that’s 1 of those systems is not in the sales line, but it is in the R&D line.",93

I’m just curious to hear your thoughts as to what was the incremental catalyst for this transaction to happen. Over the past several years, there have been a number of challenges in commercializing EUV. As a matter of fact ASML has put in place your own technologies at Cymer site to help with the migration or commercialization of EUV. But what happened over the past couple of months that pushed you over the edge and caused this transaction to happen? And I have a follow-up.",93

So of course in the mind of a manager, there is always 2 things: One is market timing, do we buy at the wrong place, wrong time? And the other one, which is in fact much more important, is does it make sense business wise? So we of course looked at both. On market timing issues and valuation and stuff which will unfortunately have to go through sometimes. We also we’ve looked at times where our share versus Cymer shares went up and down and et cetera. And you will notice that if you do this, the ratio of share to share today is not a bad time versus a year-ago, versus 2 years ago. So we did manage this so that there is no bad timing versus valuation. It’s never the perfect timing, but we thought, we think that today is not ridiculous. Being, however, the master decision has been the business. And yes, I have to be honest with you, there are 2 models. One is a model that says, we are out of the source business, and we benefit from that as we benefit for instance to be out of the lens business, Zeiss is out, and we benefit from that. There is a good P&L compatibility, but sometimes they have bad time, we have bad time, et cetera. And all this is well-organized and we also benefit from being separate. In the case of a source business, we saw that there could be sometimes, where it’s better to be out, it’s better to benefit from a fight between Ushio, Gigaphoton, Cymer. It’s better to also have them have a different cycle than we have, et cetera, et cetera. And then we also looked at the positive of moving together, which was the access to a bigger part of the pie, because EUV source is going to be a bigger part of the pie of the total system than ever, so there is an opportunity for us to get in. Second is, we realize as I explained at the beginning that there were so much synergy of efficiency in view of our going further. More we went into the development, more we discovered the complexity, and more we discovered the need in fact, to merge the way how to do it. So there was a learning slowly, but surely that we gained a lot of synergies by in fact, merging. So on one hand, we discussed all the time here whether it’s good or bad to be in that business, and then we were forced to get into this business when we discovered that there was positive synergy to get in and there was negative synergy not to do it. So in other terms today and I won’t go further, but if we were not to do it, we were at a point where we may have had to duplicate effort to develop a numbers of parallel stuff, which would have not been in the interest of Cymer, nor would it have been at the end of the day, a cost interest for us, therefore, for the industry. So when we made this decision, it was a natural thing that happened during the last 9 months or so. And I have heard or read things in the newspaper that we have been influenced by customers and things. Honestly, the customers are supporting us, indeed, there is no question that that also will be helpful with the anti-trust, we are going to be hugely supported by customer. But really what happened is, we discovered that the best model for us, for Cymer and for the industry is that we find the solutions together.",622

Just 1 quick follow-up, rather clarification, you did say that you think that there will be 300,000 wafer per month of additional or incremental logic capacity added by the middle of next year. Does that mean that the logic-related bookings could decline in early 2013 or am I missing something here?",53

So first of all, in logic where we mentioned the numbers of wafer per month. We do that because the logic business goes towards a ramp-up from 0 to some level, which is be either 200,000 wafers or 300,000 wafers. They have done this for 15 years or something. Every node gets to this, but the old node remains in action. So in other terms, an engine controller on 65 nanometer is still there. So 65 nanometer, I think it is at 300K wafer per month and it will remain there. So now you got a new business called 28 nanometer, which is a new chip and in this case as you know, these chips are basically the ones used in mobile stuff. And that will reach a level of 300,000 wafers and if I’m not mistaken 14 nanometer will only be 200 nanometer, 14 nanometer…",151

It’s Goldman Sachs. Actually just wanted to go back on the question of sort of trying to get a sense as to where you think cross-cycle profitability now is? The premise of the question is that you clearly mentioned that the proposed Cymer transaction is margin accretive at the gross margin level. I think that’s obvious from a multiyear perspective and knowing the financials and then, I think you’ve obviously also referred to the likelihood that the customer investment program is gross margin accretive just because you do need to get compensation for the increased R&D level. So my question is, cross-cycle, historically, I guess in the last 5, 6 years, you were looking at a [indiscernible] to maybe 45% type gross margin range. Going forward, if and when the cycle may recover, what sort of margin uplift do you think you are looking at? And if you could split that between the customer investment program and the proposed Cymer deal that would be very, very helpful. Thank you.",173

Wennink,,Executives,72,"Yes, I think you are right. And Eric alluded to that going forward, especially when EUV kicks in, there is going to be a significant component in cost of goods that is now going to add to the gross margin, which is clear, because we don’t need to buy it in. So that is going to in the EUV area, especially in 2015, 2016 when EUV will start to ramp, we’ll have a big impact on the gross margin, that is for sure. And we talk about the big impact you could see, you could think about, let’s say, gross margins anywhere between 45% and 50%, so they will move towards that range. Now, what the impact will be at that same time of the operating margin, that has to do with how quickly and I mentioned that, how quickly we can get to the synergies that we see, basically, it’s a more efficient R&D, it’s simplifying the manufacturing processes, simplifying the sourcing strategies. Yes, you have to realize that a big part of the sourcing chain for Cymer, EUV is similar to what the ASML sourcing chain is, so it's a lot of opportunity for also synergies there. Now, we made a preliminary calculation, the only thing I can say if we put the 2 companies together and you look at what we have now identified as synergies that we can achieve, we say, well, after 24 months after closing and say closing happen somewhere in 2013. So it’s in the end of 2015 area, you would see on the basis of the combination of the 2 companies, there is about a 5% accretion of the earnings per share. I think but if you now ask me, Peter, what does that mean in terms of your gross margin and your SG&A, I have an idea. But I think it is not opportune right now to give you all that detail, because there is a still a couple of things that are open. I just want to give you, let’s say, and the impact on the EPS the way that we see it today and I would like to keep it there, but the couple of things happen. Gross margin will go up and also there will be more efficiency on the operating expense line.",385
