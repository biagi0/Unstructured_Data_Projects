[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.",34
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-25-2010",2010-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,5700.0,54675.0,4124879.0,Presenter Speech,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,2,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter and Year 2009 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a complete description.Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for March 8. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges, as appropriate, with this update.In today's call, we'll address growth, what's driving it and is it sustainable. We'll also address inventories and provide our perspective on where they stand today in the supply chain. Finally, we'll discuss actions that we're taking today to support continued growth in the future.Revenue in the fourth quarter was near the high end of our range of expectations. Earnings exceeded the top end of our range of expectations. Sequential growth began in the second quarter of 2009 as our shipments normalized the customers' production level following a sharp inventory correction. We believe growth is now being fueled by expanding production at our customers. Inventories through TI's and our customers' supply chains are lean, and growing in-demand is stressing the entire supply chain.Let's start with breaking down the fourth quarter revenue trends. Overall revenue was up 4% sequentially or 21% from a year ago. Sequentially, our calculator revenue seasonally declined by $116 million. Our semiconductor revenue, therefore, grew about 9% sequentially.Our Analog, Embedded Processing and Wireless segments all contributed to sequential growth, while the other segments declined due to the lower calculator revenue. Analog revenue grew 9% sequentially and was up 27% from the year-ago quarter. Again this quarter, we had good contributions by all three of our major Analog product areas to this growth.I described last quarter our high expectations for the long-term opportunity that we have in the Power Management area of Analog. Power was the fastest growing part of Analog for TI this quarter as we penetrated new opportunities and gained share. Specifically, growth was strong in power supplies for computing applications, an area where our share is rapidly expanding in a strong market. We also had strength in displays, specifically LCD TVs, as higher frame rates, LED backlighting and power efficiency become more important, and we saw strength in notebooks and smartphones. And for TI, these are products, such as white LED drivers and battery gauges. In HVAL, automotive was the fastest growing area sequentially, and in HPA, low-power wireless products were the fastest growing.Embedded Processing revenue grew 5% sequentially and was up 21% from a year ago. Catalog products were the biggest driver of this growth followed by automotive. Embedded Processing should continue to benefit as the industrial market strengthens. Wireless revenue grew 8% sequentially and 13% from a year ago. Baseband revenue of $465 million grew 3% sequentially and was even with a year ago. Most of the wireless growth was driven by applications processors and connectivity products. These products collectively grew 19% sequentially and grew 46% from a year ago. Other revenues declined by 9% sequentially due to the seasonal decline in calculator revenue and grew by 17% compared with a year ago. DLP was the biggest factor in this growth and more than offset a significant decline in RISC microprocessors from a year ago.  From a geographical perspective, while sequential growth was fastest in the U.S. and European markets, all regions grew. Compared with a year ago, all regions were up, except for the U.S. market.Turning to distribution, resales or sales out of our distribution channel, increased sequentially in the quarter as well as from a year ago. Distributor inventory was about even in the quarter and remains lean compared with historical metrics.Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.",692
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-25-2010",2010-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,5700.0,54675.0,4124880.0,Presenter Speech,Kevin March,,Executives,3,"Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Our gross profit continued to expand this quarter as revenue and utilization increased. Gross margin increased 150 basis points sequentially to 52.9% of revenue. Compared with the year-ago quarter, gross margin increased to 890 basis points.Operating expenses were down slightly from the third quarter and declined $90 million from the year-ago level. Operating expenses were 23% of revenue in the quarter, well within our planned operating model.Restructuring charges in the fourth quarter were $12 million, about the same as the third quarter and down $242 million from a year ago. The distribution of these charges across our segments is included in our earnings release.Operating profit for the quarter was $875 million, 15% higher than the third quarter, mostly due to higher gross profit. From the year-ago quarter, operating profit was up $824 million, primarily due to higher gross profit, as well as lower restructuring charges.Operating margin in the quarter was 29.1% of revenue. The last time we approached this level of profitability was the fourth quarter of 2007, when TI's operating margin was 28% of revenue. It is noteworthy that revenue was 18% higher in that quarter. Today's improved performance reflects the potential of our business model that is now focused on Analog and Embedded Processing. We expect the benefits of the strategy to continue to accrue to TI and our shareholders in the years ahead.Net income in the fourth quarter was $655 million or $0.52 per share. Net income includes $16 million of benefits from discrete tax items.I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. All of the higher net income compared with last quarter fell through the higher cash flow from operations, which was $1 billion in the quarter. This strong cash flow allowed us to increase our investments in manufacturing capacity, pay a higher dividend and repurchase more stock, all while increasing our cash and short-term investment balances.Capital expenditures increased to $436 million in the quarter. This included our purchase of the Qimonda fab equipment, as well as continued elevated expenditures to expand our assembly and test capacity. As we've discussed before, the Qimonda equipment is going into our 300-millimeter Analog factory, called RFAB. We have the initial pilot line in place today and have begun to process initial wafers. We're on track to achieve full production qualification before the end of the year.We used $351 million in the quarter to repurchase 14.8 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $149 million in the quarter. We increased cash and short-term investments to $2.92 billion in the quarter. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and remains a competitive advantage of TI in this environment.We were able to increase inventory by $86 million in the quarter, almost all in finished goods, resulting in inventory days increasing to 76. This will allow us to continue to improve our customer service performance levels. Our delivery performance has been improving since mid-November. Even so, our inventory remains lean in this strong demand environment.TI orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, up 5% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.08 in the quarter, the same as last quarter.Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.95 billion to $3.19 billion in the first quarter, or a negative 2% to positive 6% sequential growth. This compares favorably with our more typically seasonal decline of about 5% in the first quarter.We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.52. This EPS estimate includes the negative impact of a higher annual effective tax rate, which we estimate will be about 31% in 2010. The increase in the tax rate includes our estimate for higher profits as well as the impact of the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit at the end of 2009.For 2010, our estimate for capital expenditures is about $900 million. We expect these expenditures to be weighted toward the first half of the year as we continue to expand our assembly/test capacity and install equipment in our 300-mm analog fab.  Our estimate for 2010 R&D is $1.5 billion, about even with our 2009 level. We estimate depreciation will be about $900 million this year, about the same level as 2009.In summary, as the recovery continues to develop, we are seeing the results that we expected from our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing. We are investing to position TI for growth in these strategic areas, as evidenced by our investments in the industry's first 300-mm analog fab and our assembly/test capacity expansion, as well as our continued investment in deploying field sales and applications resources into the regions and markets that we expect to grow the fastest.And we're well-positioned in electronic markets that we expect to drive growth. For example, our position in base stations is strong, and continued data traffic increases should drive accelerated deployments of Wireless infrastructure. Also our products are well-positioned in the industrial markets that are still in early stages of recovery. And there's a lot of pent-up demand for PC upgrades, especially in emerging markets, for which we'll benefit from well-positioned products such as our Analog Power Management, as well as products sold into hard disk drives and other peripherals. All of which gives us confidence that there is plenty of opportunity for TI and our shareholders ahead.With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",915

There's been some talk in the industry about lead times generally coming down. Can you just give us some color as to what's happening to lead times across the various products that you have. Are there still areas of shortages and tightness? Any color there will be helpful.,54
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-25-2010",2010-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,5700.0,54675.0,4124884.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,7,"Okay, Uche, I can't break that out product by product, but what I would describe is that our operations have responded aggressively to meet what's been some pretty strong increased demand across the last few quarters. But with that increased demand, our lead times have generally moved down as that demand has outpaced our supply. And that, say, it moved out fourth quarter overall relative to third quarter. And that's very similar to what I think how I described it back at the December update. We're certainly investing in manufacturing equipment to relieve these operational bottlenecks, especially in our assembly and test areas, and thus get the lead times pull back again. But to this point, I would describe fourth quarter, generally lead times moved out relative to third quarter. I will note what Kevin said in his prepared remarks that our delivery performance has improved since the mid-November time period. But we're focused on getting delivery performance improved before we start pulling lead times back in. Do you have a follow-on, Uche?",173

Kevin, you made a point about gross margins, and the fact that revenues are lower than December levels that you thought they're same level of gross margin in 2007. If I look through the rest of the year, can you just kind of walk me through what will be the key driver for gross margins? It will be utilization rate, demand, make [ph] (26:14). Any color you could give us to how to think about gross margins, maybe for next quarter and also for the rest of the year, if possible.",93

On the gross margins, we did turn in a solid quarter at about 52.9%. And as we look forward, as we've discussed in prior calls, we would expect that trend to continue to work its way up, really as we move forward on a higher mix of Analog and Embedded Processing as a proportion of our total revenue. From a utilization standpoint, we're getting back closer to more normalized utilization levels, and so there's probably a little bit less to be expected on that front as we go forward. And really, it's going to be much more driven by a higher mix of Analog and Embedded Processing. I would add to that that we'd expect to see some benefit also as we put in place low-cost manufacturing, and a good example is 300-mm analog fab that we just opened in Richardson.",164

And I guess how comfortable are you that you can tell the difference?",51
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-25-2010",2010-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,5700.0,54675.0,4124889.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,12,"I don't know that we have great visibility into our customers and their supply chains. I think we commented that our view was that you go back to fourth quarter, and this is more anecdotal versus direct measurement. Our view is that the supply chains, truly all the way to in-demand, are lean on inventory. I think customers would have liked to have built inventory. But to this point, they're pretty much hand-to-mouth, ramping their production to be able to support higher levels of in-demand, where we can measure is our own distribution channels. And I'll just repeat what we said in the prepared remarks, inventory there was pretty much unchanged from the third quarter on resales that were higher. So again, our distribution channel inventories are clearly lean by any historical metric. Do you have a follow-on, John?",140

I guess when we look at these [ph] (28:58), you guys have done a great job gaining market share despite pretty tight back-end capacity. How would we think about your ability to gain share if you were able to grow back-end capacity going into Q2? Do you think you're leaving that business on the table right now?",76
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-25-2010",2010-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,5700.0,54675.0,4124891.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,14,"I think, John, if you look at most of our products, they're proprietary or they're differentiated products that customers don't have a lot of fungibility across different suppliers. I know there are some suppliers especially in the marketplace that have been vocal and crowing about their short lead times. But I'll also note, those are the same Analog suppliers that, in most part, are not growing. And I think although some of the Analog competitors and suppliers are starting to show some sequential growth again. I don't think any of our major competitors in Analog had posted anywhere closer to 27% growth that our Analog business just did from a year ago. So to the extent, and that is not a statement that says we are satisfied with all aspects of delivery and customer service levels. You've heard us say we're doing a lot of investment to try to fix that. But I'll also note that to a large part, especially when it comes to the Analog space, I know I'm not aware of too many suppliers that added capacity, both fab capacity as well as the assembly test capacity, all the way through the downturn the way TI did. So I think what you're seeing in terms of lead times from TI simply reflects the demand that customers have for our products. And to the extent that there's anything left on the table, it really comes about because our customers may not be able to fully get everything they want in the near term that they would maybe desire from TI. But again, I think if you look at the investments we're making and generally the relationships we have with our customer base, it's pretty clear to us that they like where we're headed. They like where we're headed long term with the capacity, investments we're making, and they believe TI's the Analog supplier they want to bet on for the long term.",324

And as far as our foundry usage going forward, we're going to doing more of the same that we've done in the past. And that is increasing a portion of our advanced CMOS or advanced additional capacity will come from foundries, and we'll source pretty much the majority of almost all of our capacity for Analog internally with a little bit of supplemented external.",89

So what we're seeing, I think, from OEMs in general, is that they give us visibility into their orders a little bit further out time. The backlog is extending and so I could suggest that an increasing level of confidence, that's given us the better bode-acting [ph] (33:01) plan for their needs as well.",82

And then separately, we have consignment programs where those customers, they provide us visibility into their needs based on rolling forecasts from their MRP systems. So again, 40% of our revenue on consignment. And for that revenue, basically, order entry occurs at the same time as the revenue is recognized. So from an investor standpoint or externally, you see that as kind of what looks like turns business because the order comes in inside the same quarter that we're shipping. But from a visibility perspective, their forecast provide us a more detailed visibility.",115

But what I would say is that inside of Q1, we don't specifically try to break our forecast out. But we have some areas that typically are seasonally down that we expect to be seasonally down in the first quarter. And we have other areas that -- for example, industrial, I think you've heard from a lot of suppliers that industrial usually tends to be seasonally strong in first quarter. Industrial was an end market that came on later in terms of its recovery, and a lot of that strength is still ahead of us. So I would say in spite of that first quarter outlook, you have a range of some areas seasonally down and other areas that are still kind of ramping, driven by a recovery, and there's going to be a range inside of there. Do you a have follow-on?",162

So again, I'm not going to try to forecast specifics about that segment or product lines inside of that segment. In terms of Baseband, you're right. I think if you look at the trends there, you've seen sequential growth now three quarters in a row. And the reality is, I think we have some competitors that are late relative to the original plans in bringing up their Baseband product line. And until they do, we are more than happy to continue to supply our customer with Baseband products. That being said, we have, as we've described before, stopped our investments in the Baseband area. But again, we will continue to supply that product as long as the customer needs us to provide it. That being said, even though the profile maybe has been a little bit surprising in terms of the sequential trends of late, we continue to expect that revenue basically to have ramped down by the end of 2012, such that we really have no remaining revenue in 2013, so no real change in expectations. On the end point, although the last few quarters certainly has held up stronger than maybe we would have expected. And I'm not going to try to forecast 2010 other than to say or suggest, look at various Baseband alternative suppliers and make your own assessment as to when you think they are going to be positioned to ramp. And especially, I would say ramp on 3G products, as that's where the strong majority of our sales continue to be.",273

And I know it's kind of difficult for you to give in how wildly-diversified your Analog business is. But since that's the big grower here, or maybe we could touch on that quickly. How do you determine whether or not -- and we all talked about inventory, whether or not the channels fill in, we understand that, but how much of this is market share gain versus how much, say, is economic recovery? Or did you just see, as the quarter unveils, that you're posting better sales than you would've expected and just go with it for as long as it lasts? I mean, can you give us some kind of feeling on where all the strength is coming from?",143

If we look at the majority of our Analog competitors, our Analog business has continually outgrown them sequentially and year-over-year for several quarters in a row now. So I would certainly suggest that one answer to your question is that we're gaining some market share. But as to how much additional growth may be attributable to inventory replenishment or economic recovery, I would have to say it's pretty much an impossible answer for us to give to you.",105

And so certainly, to a large -- not necessarily still today but as I said before, for certainly second quarter and third quarter sequential growth, a lot of that was just our shipments normalizing back to their production level. So again, that's not inventory replenishment, but there was that normalization process taking place, whereas now we believe it's being driven by their increasing production levels.

All map or perhaps [ph] (40:47)  Processor, and your connectivities are doing particularly well. Do you see this as a few big programs? I think everybody knows the smartphones that you're on now, some of which are launching, some which have launched and they are still selling well. Are you seeing share gains? Is the strength you're seeing in Wireless due to a lot of other folks signing up and starting to ship product, or to a handful of very successful products that are still ramping?",120

It is share gain in the form of more customers that we're engaged with. And then it also ties to penetration of technology, for example, the various connectivity technologies into a broader range of handsets. So again, share gain on both OMAP and connectivity and then certainly, the number of smartphones and the size of that market be at which is growing is a big factor on both ends.

So really, right now that's really talking about China, India and certain parts of Eastern Europe. And of course, well, as you pointed out, come through the SG&A line but I don't think you'll see it like a pop, but you see as just a gradual change in that over time. I would just take a moment to point out though that growing into first quarter embedded in our discussion about what our earnings range is, is that we do expect pay and benefit increases to occur first quarter which often happens in the first quarter of the year, did not occur last year, of course, because the restructuring was underway. But we are resuming giving increases this year. We also expect 2010 to be a more profitable year than 2009. And so other incentive type of compensation such as profit sharing and so will accrue at a higher rate going into next year starting in the first quarter. So you will see some increases probably in the G&A line, perhaps even in the R&D line as well as we transition into those higher accrual rates, but you'll also just see a steady increase in the sales and apps line as we go throughout 2010 and probably into 2011 as well.",243

I'm trying to think what's been publicly announced, but I think clearly, it's known that Nokia is a customer, Sony Ericsson has done an announcement, Samsung has done an announcement, Motorola and a lot of their new products, their Android-based Droid handsets are OMAP based. Obviously, there are couple of players that are more positioned in the smartphone space, those being Apple and RIM, where we are not engaged with OMAP. Apple, using their own proprietary architecture, and then RIM, using, for most part, a legacy architecture that they've been engaged with for some time. And then there is one other player, Palm, that is focused primarily in the smartphone space that is OMAP based as well. So hopefully, that gives you a feel for where we are positioned. What I would say also is OMAP 3 has done very well for us. We expect we have something like 40 different program engagements that will be ramping into production over the next 12 to 18 months. That will be good for us in that space.",191

I think if you kind of go back through 2009, late in the first quarter and into the second quarter, you heard us talking more about high-volume spaces, products like computing some of the handset areas, some of the consumer areas that seem to recover fastest. And then probably, the last market that has been more recent in its recovery would be industrial. And I'm sure inside of those different markets, you can find particular products that maybe you're still lagging. But for the most part, I would say, with industrial now picking up, it looks like all the major markets are now in recovery mode.",127

So apparently, that's going to suggest that Baseband will become less than 15% than it currently has reduced to over time. And as Ron mentioned earlier, we expect that to go to zero by the end of 2012. So really, just the growth alone of the Analog and Embedded Processing even with baseband in their 15%,you're seeing margins come up pretty strong. And so I don't think you have to depend upon baseband to be gone in order for margins to begin to improve, but that certainly will accelerate the arrival of higher margins.",118

Now whether they are able to take an advantage of -- does in-demand seasonally slow in Q1 and are they able to take advantage of that to be able to get some inventory position?

If you look at our balance sheet, you actually saw that we grew inventory in the fourth quarter. And principally, on the finished goods line, which is one of the things that will allow us to be able to continue to improve on our delivery commitments to customers in first quarter and help our revenue out in the first quarter, that also goes to say that we probably have enough wafers in flow to begin to deal with demand. And so therefore, we don't expect utilization of our factories or our front-end wafer fabs could change that much in the first quarter. I mentioned a few minutes ago that the outlook for the year is for higher profitability than what we had in 2009. And I also mentioned that we're resuming increases in base pay for people. Those two combined will increase not only on our OpEx fourth quarter to first quarter, but will also have an increase on the cost of goods line, which will affect GPM a little bit.

Some of those other spaces that you were referring to actually was in the power products, where we're seeing a lot of success with new products going in there. And while the margins, the gross margins there may not be quite as high as what one might expect in high-performance analog, the operating margins are very similar. So while there may be mixed over time that causes bits and pieces to move it up-down a little bit as we pass through from quarter-to-quarter, we think, overall, the mix will continue to go up, because the total Analog portfolio and Embedded Processing portfolio combined exceeds what we get from the rest of the portfolio. And in addition, they're growing faster than the rest of the portfolio so become a bigger portion of the overall revenue mix.",168

To the extent -- the second part of your question I think is totally pertinent though, which is, is there enough inventory out there such that true demand from our customers would go volatile. And that's where -- given how lean the supply chains are, I don't think it would make any difference. So again, if lead times pulled in today, customers may not feel the need to give as much long-term visibility into their demand.

I think we're back more to a normal kind of utilization environment unlike where we were a year ago, of course, when our utilization in the first quarter dropped into the mid-30% kind of range. We're back in for a more normal kind of utilization rate today. I mentioned a few minutes ago that we would expect our utilization going into first quarter will be very flat to what it was in the first quarter. That's a reference to our front end or the wafer fabs. On the back end, we have been investing for a couple of quarters now on expanding our capacity there, especially on certain package types and clearly our utilization is very, very high in certain of those lines. But the equipment is getting into place now, and we're beginning to see our throughput increase. And again you can see that in our balance sheet where our finished goods actually we had an increase actually for the first time since second quarter of 2008.",174

It's probably about 30% of our revenue goes to the distribution channel. And of that, about a quarter of it, is on consignment.

So over the last six quarters, we've gotten 25% of that revenue converted over the consignment. You probably, based on that, can go make some average or headwind calculations from that consignment program. But the fact that we're doing a relatively slow deployment on that would stay probably in any one quarter. It's kind of a slow, steady headwind on the timing of revenue. But again, it doesn't impact the resales at all, it doesn't impact the in-demand. It just has the effect of moving it out a quarter as distributors rely more and more on that consignment program.",123

We didn't set those as a ceiling, we just set those as an objective the company should be able to operate at and ideally on the sustained basis.

So pricing is moving up on commodities as you might expect. Outside of commodities, I would say, which again is almost all of our revenue, pricing is pretty much following normal trends. So nothing really environmentally unusual there. Even in commodities, it's not unusual but it has moved up in this constrained environment.",105

I mean, typically, when you get call the cycle rolling over again, you are coming from periods where inventory had been inflated. Usually, as that inventory build is taking place, customers, suppliers, distributors convince themselves that's being done because the demand environment outlook is going to be strong. And then it results in some form of correction of that excess inventory level. I think what's different between -- and we all recognize when that inventory is being built. But again, we convince ourselves, and I'm talking the entire supply chain here, that it's appropriate relative to the demand outlook. I think what's different in this environment is pretty much if you look at TI, you look at our distributors, you look at our customers, you see inventory levels that are historically lean. And that's a big difference between pretty much every other cycle that peaks out, rolls over versus where we are today. We have demand today that is being driven, call it more macro level, in-demand increases. And you have inventories that to date have remained very lean and well behaved. So I think Stacy asked a question earlier about replenishment and whether that's an expectation. I think typically, at some point, as demand continues to build and as suppliers get capacity online, you would expect, at some point, replenishment of inventory levels. But I would describe that as ahead of us, as opposed to anything that we've seen today.",258

Clearly, historically, we've had really good growth in HPA and we've had outstanding growth in Power, but HVAL has been a laggard. And frankly, it wasn't just a laggard relative to those other two product areas, it was a laggard relative to what our perception of the market was. So our view is, there's no reason that all three of those areas shouldn't have growth that is relatively similar across them. But to some degree, you're going to have variations that develop. I think if you look at -- historically, like I said, I would just almost have to leave it at that. HPA and Power clearly have been the primary areas of growth in Analog over the last few years, HVAL lagged. HVAL lagged through even the first part of 2009. I would say mid-year, we've bottomed out some of the fruits of our efforts over the last few years, basically to -- starting with management changes and then organizational changes below that in markets in which we are focused and all the things we've talked to you about in the past started to come to fruition. And over the last couple of quarters, certainly, HVAL has pulled its weight as well. That's really what we're intending to say. And I think we're reasonably satisfied that we have good growth opportunities in all three and we're positioned to realize those growth opportunities. But in a quarter-by-quarter even year-by-year, you may have differences and that'll be okay.",284

So my question is, when you guys first saw the lead times going out, why didn't you just ramp up your back end aggressively and squelch them? Are you trying to sort of keep the lead times a little bit longer? I'm just -- wondering about the machination to that process?",85

But it wasn't that long ago when the bottom has fallen out of demand across the board. And then when demand did start coming back the second quarter, all of us scratched our head trying to decide whether or not that was real. Certainly, in retrospect, it was real. And once we acknowledged that, we began to step up capital spending. You saw us move up in the third quarter and you saw it move up again the fourth quarter, and most of that money is going towards back-end capacity trying to [indiscernible] (1:11:30). So again, kind of remembering the history that we came through is how we kind of got to where we're at. It certainly was not an intended outcome. The last thing we want to do is displease our customers in a manner which we have on certain of these product lines. It's our objective to get this fixed as quickly as possible. The experience also tells us that when we get behind like this, it really takes us quite a few quarters to get caught back up.",210

Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at www.ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a complete description. 
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 8. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges, as appropriate, with this update. 
In today's call, we'll address TI's plan for growth. We'll talk about our progress to transform TI to a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing, how it's driving our growth today and our plans to support growth in the future. We'll address near-term trends and inventories and lead times, as well as our strategy for capacity to make sure we are positioned to grow in the years ahead. 
Revenue in the first quarter slightly exceeded the high end of our range of expectations. Earnings landed at the top end of our expectations. Demand was strong and broad across end markets and regions, while supply chains across the electronics industry continue to be constrained, and inventories appear to remain lean. 
Revenue in the quarter was up 7% sequentially and 54% compared with a year ago. Analog, Embedded Processing and our Core Wireless products, excluding Baseband, were TI's growth drivers in first quarter '10, and we're investing to accelerate their growth from here. They received about 90% of our R&D investments in the first quarter. These businesses comprised 66% of our first quarter revenue, up from 61% a year ago and 58% in the first quarter of 2008.  
Analog revenue grew 8% sequentially and was up 70% from the year-ago quarter. Once again, all three of our major analog product areas were strong contributors to this growth with each expanding about equally from its fourth quarter level. 
For HVAL, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of solid sequential growth, further evidencing the turnaround of this business that we told you to expect and that is now being achieved. A more important metric could be that our Analog revenue is up 8% compared with the third quarter of 2008, the quarter before the industry entered the downturn. While not all of our peers have reported, I believe this growth will compare favorably when results are in. The importance of this metric is that it captures performance over a longer period of time and indicates who is growing stronger out of the downturn. 
We are working to extend our lead with investments we've made in product technology, sales support and manufacturing capacity. Just last week, we bought another 100 tools for 300-millimeter Analog production, kicking off Phase II of RFAB. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew 7% sequentially and was up 39% from a year ago. As a reminder, the year-ago quarter benefited from growth in our communications infrastructure business as China deployed 3G infrastructure. The strongest areas of growth this quarter, in both comparisons, were in our catalog products that are used in a wide range of applications. Catalog microcontroller products were especially strong in the year-ago comparison. Similar to Analog, Embedded Processing revenue was up 3% from the third quarter of 2008, which should compare favorably to competitors. 
Wireless revenue declined 5% sequentially and was up 27% from a year ago. Baseband revenue of $424 million fell 9% sequentially and was up 6% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger mix of 3G products. Basebands are now down to 13% of TI revenue compared with 15% in the fourth quarter and 19% in the year-ago quarter. Revenue of $293 million collectively from applications processors and connectivity products was even with the fourth quarter and was up 80% from a year ago. This is up 12% compared with the third quarter of 2008, another indication of our strong performance in the smartphone market. 
I should note that we have moved our low-power wireless products from our Analog segment to our Wireless segment. We made this move because our Wireless organization is better suited to support this significant growth opportunity. This low-power wireless product line is based on products that were included in, or subsequently developed from, our 2006 acquisition of Chipcon. Revenue from these products was $68 million in 2009. We have a chart on our website that shows our Analog and Wireless segments historically adjusted for this change. 
Other revenue grew by 19% sequentially. Royalties increased, and we had a strong sequential growth in custom ASIC products as well as growth in DLP products in calculators. From a year ago, Other revenue grew 68%, mostly due to strong growth in DLP products, where revenue more than doubled, as well as strength in royalties, custom ASIC products and calculators.  From a geographical perspective, almost all of the sequential revenue growth came from the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Japan regions. 
Turning to distribution, resales, or sales out of our distribution channel, were up more than 10% sequentially. We believe this represents share gains across multiple distributors. Even with this strong resale growth, we were able to help distributors build some inventory to support future growth. Even so, distributors' total weeks of inventory remain about five, similar to last quarter and low by historical standards. 
Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.",952

Our gross profit expanded by 6% sequentially this quarter as revenue grew. Gross margin declined slightly, by 20 basis points, to 52.7% of revenue. 
Operating expenses increased to $27 million from the fourth quarter. As I explained in January, this was mostly the result of higher compensation expenses that resulted from our stronger financial outlook for 2010, for example, accruals for employee profit sharing and annual raises in February. 
Operating expenses were 23% of revenue in the quarter, within our planned operating model. 
Restructuring charges in the first quarter were $10 million. This was for U.S. pension plan settlement accounting associated with actions that occurred in 2008 and 2009. The distribution of these charges across our segments is included in our earnings release. 
Operating profit for the quarter was $950 million, 9% higher than the prior quarter due to higher gross profit. From the year-ago quarter, operating profit was up $940 million due to higher gross profit. 
Operating margin in the quarter was 29.7% of revenue. 
Net income in the first quarter was $658 million, or $0.52 per share. Included in net income was $7 million of discrete tax charges that were associated with the change in tax treatment of Medicare retiree drug subsidies. 
I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make a few comments. 
Cash flow from operations was $710 million. This was down from last quarter's $1 billion due to higher receivables. Cash flow from operations was up from the year-ago quarter due to higher net income. 
Capital expenditures declined sequentially $219 million in the quarter. Expenditures included the purchase of additional assembly and test equipment, as well as additional Analog wafer fab equipment. Our process qualification work at our 300-millimeter Analog wafer fab, RFAB, is producing good results. The initial wafers that we began producing in January have completed processing with good early yields. We continue to track well to our goal to have full process production qualification before the end of this year. 
In the quarter, we used $504 million to repurchase 20.6 million shares of TI common stock, and pay dividends of $149 million.  We were able to increase our inventory by $74 million in the quarter, with most of the additional inventory staged as work-in-process to support our forecasted higher 2Q revenue. Inventory days held steady at 76. 
Consistent with what we described in our mid-quarter update, our delivery performance has continued to improve and our lead times have continued to decline as we bring additional manufacturing capacity online and get better positioned with inventory. Even as we have begun an orderly process of reducing lead times, demand from our customers has remained strong. Orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 12% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.14 in the quarter, up from 1.08 in the fourth quarter and our strongest book-to-bill ratio since the second quarter of last year. 
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.31 billion to $3.59 billion in the second quarter or a 3% to 12% sequential growth. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.64. Our estimates for 2010 R&D, depreciation and capital expenditures are unchanged from last quarter. 
In summary, as the recovery continues to gain momentum, we are seeing the results from investments that we maintained even through the depths of the downturn. We have products well positioned and a field sales and applications team that is second to none. Our production output is at an all-time high, and we have a multi-year ramp in capacity underway that will allow us to support our customers, and therefore our shareholders, with strong growth potential. And this capacity, both fab and assembly and test, is being procured at cost levels that will also advantage us competitively without burdening TI with a lot of fixed costs. We see this strategy as having lots of upside opportunity and manageable downside risk. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",682

And so really what you're seeing is the effect of that going through the gross margin line. In fact, if you adjust for that, the fall-through would be very close to where you probably would have expected it.",90

The main driver of that, of course, is going to be just the revenue mix as we go forward. I think Ron mentioned already that Analog and Embedded Processing and the core Wireless products are now about 66% of our total revenue. We're becoming a richer mix and those deliver very nice gross margins. We'd expect that mix to continue to richen up as we go through the year and the years to follow and the gross margins will move up accordingly. Beyond that, I won't really give a specific time period as to when we think we'll be achieving that 55% gross.",129

So you only saw 2/3 of the effect of that in the quarter. So you'll see a bit more of that going into second quarter where the full rate will burden the quarter.

It was very consistent with what we talked about. And while we do expect utilization to go up a little bit next quarter, it's not going to be that much again. You may have noticed from our balance sheet, we were able to build some inventory in the first quarter, even with our utilization not changing by that much. That helps position us well for growth going into the second quarter. And so we have just a smaller -- relatively small additional wafer starts, we'll be able to reach those types of revenue numbers that we gave in the guidance.",109

Again, most of our pricing there tends to be driven more by longer-term contracts. But since most of our Baseband revenue really goes to a single customer, it would be inappropriate for us to talk about pricing trends. With respect to Analog, really no abnormal changes there. I think Analog pricing in general, especially in the high-performance area, tends to be very stable. And in areas like HVAL, where it may tend to trend down over time, it tends to trend down based upon longer-term pricing agreements, and those are well-understood trends that we engineer for. If I can broaden that, the only area where we've seen pricing that moves more with the near-term market environment would be in some of the commodity areas. And we've said, probably from the last quarter or so, that pricing has trended up and, in fact, we saw that as well in first quarter.",159

It just seems to be -- is there a way you've kind of tried to analyze this yourself and try to figure out whether this is happening because that seems to be a little bit of a disconnect with the trends we have seen with the component growth and the end market themselves?",107
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-26-2010",2010-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,,57890.0,4364390.0,Answer,Ron Slaymaker,,Executives,19,"Uche, I guess the advice I would have in doing that comparison is you can't have the starting point be in the last three or four quarters, because in the first half of last year, especially first quarter of last year and probably even starting in fourth quarter '08 as the downturn really started to take force, we were significantly under-shipping our customers as they were reducing inventory.  So to look at growth trends coming off of that bottom when we were under-shipping customers is probably not an appropriate metric. I do believe that -- first of all, let's talk about the customer inventory. You heard us say, first of all, with respect to distribution, our channel inventory, we were able to get some inventory built there, but weeks of inventory maintained at about five, which is by any historical metric going to be lean. We have an additional significant percentage of our OEM customers where we are managing their component inventory because it's business that's done on a consignment basis and we know that it's lean and it tends to be very productive, fast-turning inventory. So if you put distribution and the OEM consignment programs together, that represents about two-thirds of TI's revenue base. So that leaves about one-third of the customers that we have, frankly, less direct visibility into their inventory levels. But, Uche, all signs and indications that we picked up is that inventories remain lean. As I said, this is a general supply chain-type of consideration that inventories are lean. The customers are trying to build inventory and bring in product consistent with their in-demand, but they are really not to the point where they have been able to significantly increase inventory from a days or a weeks basis. So certainly we watch it. We watch relative growth. We talk to customers about their needs and all of that, but we haven't seen anything to this point that is setting off any kind of alarm.  In fact, if anything, we're still the other way around where we're trying to continue to pull up our supply to be able to fully meet the customer's demand with the service levels that they're used to from TI.",368

I mean, one of the key contributors there, of course, is royalties. Can you give us any comments as to what's driving royalties at the moment? If you don't give us the absolute size of that number, but just to get a sense of what's driving royalties right now. I know you started to deal with DRAM companies, and what your expectations are. And also within DLP, if you could also talk about what your expectations are within that?",100

I won't quantify any of the business units underneath the Other segment other than to say what's up and what's down. Royalties was up sequentially. DLP was also up quite a bit. That also happens to be a very attractive margin business. And that's on the strength of front projectors. In fact, not only quarter-over-quarter, but also year-over-year. If I recall, I believe it about doubled on a year-over-year basis.",95

Again, without being specific on that area because we don't really forecast, or publicly forecast, below the company level. Overall, what we'll see next quarter, just so it's not lost on folks, is the calculator business is inside the Other segment. And you may recall, that has a seasonally stronger second and third quarter. That's when the back-to-school selling season happens. So we would typically see an uptick from 1Q to 2Q for that business and we are expecting around $65 million to go from 1Q to 2Q [indiscernible] revenue there.  It will typically go up a little bit more in third quarter and then drop off again in fourth due to the seasonal nature of that business.",136

But actually inside of DLP, education is a very big market and market driver for our front projector products. And we're seeing a lot of strength now especially, for example, in Asia as schools and classrooms over there start deploying DLP projectors in the classrooms similar to what mainland schools here have done. And DLP has just a very significant reliability advantage that makes it attractive to educational systems. The other thing that is more recently starting to play out as a differentiator for our DLP front projectors is they're 3D capable. And so you certainly know of 3D in the cinema, but actually educational systems are using the 3D capability to help students better visualize things that wouldn't normally pop out in textbooks or in 2D diagrams. And then certainly, you don't have to look very far to realize how big 3D is with the movie cinemas these days. And what I would just say is almost all of that is being done on the TI-based DLP projectors.",200

But if you go back further in history, they would have even carried even more weeks of inventory. Certainly, part of the reason that inventory levels have come down are just structural things that we've done from a consignment program. And just as a refresher, today we actually started, I guess it was in June of 2008, deploying consignment programs to distribution. Today, about 30% of our distribution revenue is supported by consignment. So structurally, that will tend to bring down inventory levels. But even accounting for that inventory level, distributors remain lean. And, Kevin, would you like to answer the second?",123

And we have further pulled those in as we came out of the quarter. We still have a number of products that have lead times longer than we prefer at this point, but we are getting significant progress coming through the first quarter.

Lead times that were in excess of 16 are pulling back into the 12 to 14 kind of range.  We're kind of seeing across the board where proportionately more and more of our products are moving back into a normal lead time for that particular product.  Not all of them are the same. It depends on the manufacturing process.  Some processes take longer naturally than other processes. But the lead times are all beginning to move back in consistent with those processes.

I think we certainly believe we have it well on its path and we think the turnaround that we had talked about, I think really for a couple of years now, is well underway. But there's still work to do. There's still additional progress to be made in terms of further diversification of those products in the markets that we're working through. I think if you look at HVAL, it really isn't a single market, a variety of markets. You just even specific to first quarter. Clearly, computing and peripherals. Peripherals that we participate in with those products would include areas like printers, but maybe more significantly would be hard disk drives. Those were some examples. Probably automotive would be another one that I would mention as a notable area of improvement.",151

But even beyond it, I think that kind of focus really is missing the forest for the trees in this type of very strong demand environment.  So was there any noise in the order line associated with our changing lead time? There could have been, but it was more than swamped by just rising in demand, rising production from our customers.

And that's not to say that's a ceiling or a floor. It's to say our portfolio should be able to deliver that on a fairly reliable basis. Going forward, we continue to be even more confident that we will be in those kinds of gross margins, especially as we see Analog and Embedded Processing becoming a bigger mix of our revenue overall. On the CapEx front, we talked for a while about CapEx probably running in the 5% to 8% kind of range, percent of revenue. And in fact, we're consistent with that. I was just looking over some data this morning and our capital spending for the last 12 months has been almost exactly the same percent of revenue which bodes well for depreciation as we move forward, also. So we shouldn't see a  depreciation threat on the gross margin.  In addition to that, we've been acquiring capital at extremely attractive prices. So we're getting more capacity than we would normally get dollar-for-dollar in capital spend, which bodes well very well for being able to grow our topline, which is where we're highly focused inside the company is driving top line growth at this point as opposed to trying to adjust any gross margin models.",232

Coming out of the fourth quarter into first, we're back into a more normal manufacturing environment for our customers, more uniform factory loadings, and so our shipments are more uniform across the quarter which in turn, by contrast to fourth quarter, raise your receivables levels up when your revenue rose and the line-up of your days going up as well.

This is an area where for some time, I think since really the beginning of the year, we have actually been on what we call controlled order entry process where customers just could not come in and place unlimited demand on us based upon a certain lead time. We provide certain levels of support to customers that have been historic customers. And if competitors were having issues supplying product, we weren't just going to be the benefactor for all of their customers to be able to gain support. So commodity really has been kind of a different environment for the last few quarters. Very typical for this part, this kind of market environment in terms of how we and how our competitors move to a controlled-order entry process. But the statements about lead time reductions and such have not yet applied to those commodity products. That was more statements about general products and Embedded Processing, high-performance Analog power, HVAL, those types of product areas.",178

And then again, you had some very high margin kind of cash-cow items, if you will, that are in that segment. And so dollar-for-dollar, they tend to fall through quite rich.

How should we think about it, big picture basis?",54

Maybe if I can even move beyond this year. You've heard us say for some time, and we'll say it again today, that we expect our Baseband revenue to be essentially zero by the end 2012. So if you take our first quarter Baseband revenue of $424 million, $425 million, and straight-line that to zero at the end of 2012, I think what you're going to find is there will likely be quarters above this line and quarters below the line. The exact profile of decline is going to depend upon our customers' success in the market, the mix of their 3G versus older technologies, as well as our competitors' progress in delivering Baseband product to meet the customer's needs. So maybe some additional color that can help you do your own analysis on this is  if you consider that today 3G Basebands represent about 75% of our Baseband revenue. And that's up from about 50% a year ago as the market really has transitioned to these more advanced technologies. I think it's well known that our largest customer is intending to multi-source their Baseband. And I think what you can expect in 2010 is that competitors should begin to support the older technologies that represented 25% of our Baseband revenue in first quarter. And for 3G, we don't anticipate competitors to begin ramping new products there until sometime in 2011. So our revenue profile this year in 2010 is going to depend on how the competitive incursions compare against the ongoing market shift to 3G and, also, how our customer performs in that 3G market. So hopefully that provides you some level of insight.",276

So it's just being expensed. The way to think about the economics on that is, generally speaking, the die costs will be about 30% less than what the equivalent die would be on a 200-millimeter wafer. On Analog parts, about 50% of your cost is in die and 50% is in the assembly and tests. So you'll net only about a 15% kind of manufacturing cost reduction in the apples-to-apples comparison to 8-inch.  That's really at the product level. And so as we look at turning that into Analog revenue coming out of that factory, I think you can kind of model those numbers in and figure out the incremental gross margin we'll get out of that factory.",146

But let me just say, it ties to a smartphone market where we believe you probably have smartphones growing on the order of 40% unit growth this year compared to last year. So being in a rapidly growing market is always a good thing. And then secondly, it's our full expectation that over the course of time, we want to continue taking market share there across both the applications processors as well as the connectivity products. So it's a combination. The strategy, as you might guess, is very attractive market in terms of growth, which is why we've centered up our Wireless investment in that space, and then also playing from the strength of our position and our technology with the OMAP applications processor. And then a lot of connectivity right now is a lot about integration of multiple connectivity technologies into pure chips, both for power consumption and cost. And we are absolutely leading that integration. I think near-term on OMAP, the growth driver will be just the deployment of OMAP 3, which is our latest production part, and soon to be followed up with OMAP 4, as you might guess. So we've got a good pipeline of technologies and we have a great pipeline of design wins. OMAP 3 will be ramping more than 50 design wins over the course of the next year into production, and we think that points to a very attractive growth opportunity.",248

I can't make any specific forecast on those because -- on dividend increase, of course, because they are subject to Board approval.

So the core business is the non-Other stuff. They all compressed. Embedded compressed quite a bit differently than the others. It was down about 500 basis points versus about 100 to 200 basis points for Analog and Wireless.  Can you give me some feeling for -- I mean were the compensation increases and OpEx increases by business unit about the same? And what does that imply for the gross margins of those individual businesses and the change in those gross margins out this quarter?,94

I think Ron mentioned in his opening remarks that about 90% of our total R&D is now going towards our three growth areas of Analog, Embedded Processing and a non-baseband portion of Wireless. That transition has been underway for -- very aggressively during 2009, but even started earlier than that. So what you're seeing on a quarter-over-quarter basis is a little bit more of just our redeployment. Again, some of that is coming out of the Other segment, going into Embedded Processing and so on. We've also stepped up our staffing level there quite a bit in the sales side in order to accelerate the opportunities we see, especially in the microcontroller space with the 32-bit opportunities that we see emerging on that side.",144

How complete is the purchase for Phase II? And can you give me a feeling for, I guess, the degree of discount you're getting for this equipment versus what you paid for Phase I? I think Phase I was $173 million for the full 13,000 wafers per month?",68

One of the things that Phase II is really doing is some line balancing for us. We spent about $75 million on those 100 tools that we mentioned earlier. And we'll be needing to acquire some more tools to complete Phase II. Overall spending will probably be below what we spent on Phase I, but that's really because of your line balancing. What I mean by that is some of the Phase I equipment can support more that just the incremental $1 billion of revenue that we have been talking about. It supports into the $2 billion number. But without some of the line balancing equipment that Phase II starts bringing in, you really can't get that kind of fruit.  So that's what you're seeing happening here. And our cost for that equipment so far in Phase II has been quite similar to what we saw in Phase I.",161

Are you thinking that you're likely or planning to build some more inventory in the coming quarter? And as you've now made some progress in reducing the lead times, do you get the sense that your lead times, Kevin, based off what you see now are likely with the plans that you have in place to be at the normalized levels by, say, the end of the third quarter, or do you think that could happen somewhat earlier?",95

I would just point out though, as I mentioned earlier to one of the other earlier questions, at a 1.14 book-to-bill, clearly our orders are stronger than our outlook which means we were getting orders that were probably out into the third quarter. And so in second quarter, we will begin to build not only for second quarter deliveries but also third-quarter deliveries. And to the extent that the revenue continues to grow, of course, we'll have to build more inventory to support that. So you'd see some growth if, in fact, we expect revenue to increase in the third quarter. But it's too early for me to give you a forecast on that. As to when lead times reach a normal level, I think our customers would love it if I could say right now, but the truth of the matter is we do plan on continuing to put equipment in place for each of the quarters of 2010 and it's really going to be a function of just how strong demand continues to be. If it keeps on coming out of the upper end of our forecast ranges, it's going to take us a little longer to get that lead time cleared up. But if it comes in around the midpoint or lower, we'll clean it up sooner. Clearly, it is in our interest to try to get it cleaned up as quickly as possible. I'd like to say that 2010 puts it behind us.",262

Or do you feel, given the strength of the beginning of the year, that you might expect it to be somewhat more moderate than the norm? And obviously, Rich, in recent speeches has been talking about how it's unusual to see a book-to-bill of more than one for five quarters, and this is the fifth quarter. But on the other hand, it seems that you are saying that you've seen quite good order strength through the beginning of this. Do you have any further thoughts that you might be able to sort of share or frame with us in terms of expectation on how that book-to-bill might begin to trend?",169

We're seeing it in the automotive space. We're seeing the consumer space. We're seeing the industrial coming back. We know that inventories remain very lean, as we've been talking about, and it doesn't appear to us that they are likely to become that filled up, if you will, in the first half.  So that would suggest that we will continue to see some interesting growth. As to exactly what size, I don't know how to forecast that for you right now.",126

I mean, I think the last 18 months has been highly unusual so I wouldn't try to force it into any kind of normal pattern matching. And then I think, the other comment I would make is if you look at our second quarter outlook of -- the middle of the outlook really is pretty seasonal for TI in terms of the second quarter. So we don't have an outlook that we're issuing for second half, but at least the next quarter we can affirm our belief that it should be seasonal, at least in the middle of that range.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the Web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 9. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update. 
In today's call, we'll provide an update on our strategic progress, discussing how the quarters results align with our longer-term objectives. Our core businesses of Analogs, Embedded Processing and the smartphone-focused applications processors and connectivity products in our Wireless segment collectively made up 67% of our revenue in the second quarter. They grew 11% over the first quarter and 53% from a year ago. They are also the areas where we have focused our R&D investments, with 88% of our total second quarter R&D spend focused in these areas. These are the growth engines for the future. 
Part of the attraction of our Analog and Embedded Processing businesses is the breadth of their position across the electronics industry. With these products, we have the potential to sell into literally every electronics product that is produced. This includes computing applications such as fast-growing tablet computers, and at the other end of the market spectrum, includes industrial applications such as smart meters. 
As we've seen over the past year, these end markets often move at different speeds. The recovery that began in the first half of last year initially began with the high-volume computing and communications market, with the industrial markets not beginning their recovery until late in the year. Although some of the high-volume markets are now normalizing into their more typical seasonal growth pattern, the industrial market has continued its recovery. For TI, this is evidenced in the strength of our various catalog product lines such as catalog microcontrollers and digital signal processors in our Embedded Processing segment, as well as High-Performance Analogs and Power Management product in our Analog segment. 
These catalog products are typically sold through distribution, often in low volumes to a large number of customers across the world. Our revenue in the U.S. and Europe regions are both weighted toward industrial applications, and both areas performed well in the quarter. These catalog product lines will particularly benefit over time from the size of TI's field sales and applications force and the breadth of our product portfolio, as we have a stronger capability to call on more customers and sell more products to those customers. 
The notable area of weakness in the second quarter was in Wireless, where we experienced an unexpected slowdown late in the quarter. We believe this weakness was a customer-specific issue and not a broader reflection of the market. I'll discuss that more in a few minutes. 
Overall, TI revenue in the quarter was up 9% sequentially and up 42% compared with a year ago. Analog revenue grew 11% sequentially and was up 56% from the year-ago quarter. All three of our major Analog product areas were solid contributors to this growth in both comparisons, although sequential growth was most significant in High-Performance Analogs due to its strong position in the industrial market. 
Over the past five quarters, HVAL revenue had continued to pace well with our other Analog areas and was up more than 50% from the year-ago quarter. This provides additional confirmation that HVAL has turned the corner and should be a strong contributor to our growth in the years ahead. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% sequentially and was up 47% from a year ago. Catalog microcontrollers and digital signal processors were the areas of strongest growth in both comparisons. The relatively large size of the microcontroller market, combined with the potential for TI to gain significant share, represents our most significant Embedded Processing opportunity. Microcontrollers led our Embedded Processing growth in both the sequential and year-on-year comparisons, as our investments in this area are producing results. 
Wireless revenue was up 1% sequentially and up 18% compared with the year ago. Revenue of $311 million from applications processors and connectivity products for smartphones was up 6% sequentially and 52% from a year ago. These products are redefining our Wireless segment and are delivering strong growth. 
Baseband revenue, which as expected continues to decline, was $416 million, down 2% sequentially and about even with a year ago. Basebands are now 12% of total TI revenue compared with 17% in the year-ago quarter. As you know, we made a strategic decision to exit baseband market, and as we do, we are maximizing profits during our multi-year wind-down of the product lines and using these profits to fund growth in other areas. 
Revenue in our Other segment comes from a mix of product lines, mostly DLP products and calculators as well as royalties. Although there will be significant variance in growth across these product lines, collectively, they will have relatively lower growth. Nonetheless, they have strong profitability. 
In the second quarter, revenue in our Other segment grew 9% sequentially. Calculator revenue increased seasonally and more than offset the decline in royalties. From a year ago, revenue in the Other segment grew 42%, mostly due to strength in DLP products. 
From a geographical perspective, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the U.S. regions grew sequentially, while Japan declined. All regions were up from a year ago. 
Turning to distribution, resale or sales out of our distribution channel were up almost 15% sequentially. Once again, we believe this represents share gains for TI across multiple distributors. Even with this strong resale growth, we were able to help distributors build some inventory to support future growth. Distributors inventory remains low by historical standards at about five weeks of inventory, similar to the past few quarters. 
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.",1050

As we have shifted TI's focus to Analog and Embedded Processing, we are addressing better opportunities, and our financial results are reflecting this through higher levels of profitability, better earnings per share, lower capital requirements and higher returns. 
Our gross profit expanded by 12% sequentially this quarter as revenue grew and grew in the right areas. Gross margin also increased by 150 basis points to 54.2% of revenue. 
Operating expenses increased $41 million in the first quarter. Almost all of this increase was focused on our core businesses. Operating expenses declined to 22% of revenue in the quarter. 
Restructuring charges in the second quarter were $17 million. This was for U.S. pension plan settlement accounting, associated with actions that occurred in 2008 and 2009. The distribution of these charges across our segments is included in our earnings release. 
Operating profit for the quarter was $1.11 billion. This is the best operating profit TI has ever produced. Operating profit was 17% higher than the prior quarter. From the year-ago quarter, operating profit was up $764 million. In both comparisons, the higher operating profit reflects higher revenue and the associated gross profit. Operating margin in the second quarter was 31.7% of revenue. Not only did our core businesses drive most of our revenue growth this quarter, they also drove 75% of the incremental profit. 
Net income in the second quarter was $769 million or $0.62 per share. An interesting comparison is to the third quarter of 2007. Prior to this past quarter, 3Q '07 was our high-water mark for operating profit. This quarter's operating profit exceeded that quarter's by 9%, even though revenue in that earlier quarter was 5% higher. 
Earnings per share is an even better story, up $0.10 or 19% compared with 3Q '07, as our operating profit gains have been further amplified by our stock repurchases. These results clearly represent the power the portfolio changes we've implemented and the benefit they are providing to our  financial results. 
I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $562 million. This was down from last quarter due to income taxes that we paid in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was about the same as a year ago. 
Capital expenditures increased to $283 million in the quarter. Expenditures included the purchase of Analog wafer fab equipment as well as assembly and test equipment. Recall that we announced earlier in the quarter that we had begun the build-out of Phase II of our Analog capacity expansion at RFAB with the purchase of additional 300-millimeter equipment from Qimonda's bankruptcy proceedings. 
We will continue to make opportune capacity investments to support our Analog growth as these opportunities arise. Just last week, we announced that we will be buying additional 300-millimeter equipment to help complete the RFAB Phase II build-out, as well as an operational 200-millimeter fab and an additional fab facility that can be equipped with 200-millimeter or 300-millimeter equipment as needed in the future. These facilities are located in Japan, and were purchased as part of Spansion Japan's bankruptcy proceedings. 
The purchase price on this manufacturing capacity is attractive, and these purchases will help give us the capability to significantly grow our Analog business while providing strong returns on these investments. 
I should note that in the second quarter, our return on invested capital moved up to 31%. Our strategy is to continue to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations while making sure we have capacity in place before we need it. 
We used $750 million in the quarter to repurchase 29.7 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $147 million in the quarter. We were able to increase our inventory by $73 million in the quarter, while inventory days held steady at 76. We have continued to improve our delivery performance, and our lead times have continued to decline as we bring additional manufacturing capacity online and get better position with inventory. 
Even as we have continued an orderly process of reducing lead times, demand from our customers has remained strong. Orders in the quarter increased to $3.73 billion. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.07 in the quarter. 
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion in the third quarter or 2% to 10% sequential growth. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. 
Our estimates for 2010 R&D and depreciation are unchanged from last quarter. Our estimate for 2010 capital expenditures has increased to $1.2 billion from our prior estimate of $900 million, reflecting the additional manufacturing equipment acquisitions. 
In summary, we continue to execute a strategy that will allow us to grow our Analog and Embedded Processing business significantly faster than their respective markets. Results in the second quarter confirm the effectiveness of this strategy, both in terms of the top line growth that can be produced as well as the earnings potential of these businesses. And we've continued to pave our path to long-term growth, with low-cost acquisitions and manufacturing capacity that will provide us competitive advantage while not burdening the company with unmanageable fixed costs. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.",892

What we saw was bookings actually broadly across all of our products and markets and across all the regions. We actually think the orders are coming in probably more consistently with underlying demand. You may recall that last quarter, our book to bill was 1.14, and this quarter, 1.07. We believe what we're seeing here is the effect of us, in an orderly fashion, beginning to pull our lead times in, that has given our customers more confidence, that don't have to place orders on as quite as far out in the future as they have for the last few quarters. And in addition, the underlying demand is going on, is increasing orders as well as the market share gains. So combined, we think the order pattern is beginning to line up consistently with the change in lead times and just underlying growth through market growth as well as market share gains.",154

What's the plan going forward? Obviously, you've got plans to add a bunch of capacity. And in addition to that, I guess you're also moving to a consignment model with some of those distributors. Can you talk about, as you build that inventory, is that showing up on the revenue number? Or is that mainly going to consignment at this point?",85

And in addition, we were able to build some inventory in the distribution channel. I would point out that the turns in that channel continue to be at historically low levels at about five turns overall. On the point of consignment, that inventory, of course, was previously carried onto the distribution books is now moving on to our books and will constitute some growth that you'll begin to see in our held inventory. But at 76 days, I'd characterize that as continuing to be very lean inventory balances overall. As we go forward, we will continue to convert more distributor inventory to a consignment arrangement. And so, that will shift from their books onto our books, but that will be over the next year, year and a half or so before we complete that process.",151

However, you also have to keep in mind that the area that we said was growing most significantly in Embedded Processing were the catalog products. So just by definition, those catalog products go into lots of different end markets, and it's not any particular end market that's driving it. All I would say is, and then just in addition, catalog grew strongest, but we also saw growth in coms infrastructure [communications infrastructure] and automotive as well. But it was catalog products that were growing most significantly. And when you think about that, think about applications, metering was the one that I think I mentioned previously. Motor control, you get equipment like safety equipment, medical equipment, those types of applications that come in. Do we believe we're gaining share? I believe so. And we haven't seen the competitors' report, but with 17% sequential growth in that business, I would venture to say that probably represents pretty clear market share gains from TI in that area, pretty similar to what you're seeing for the last five years from TI in that area, where we have been growing well above market growth rates in Embedded Processing. And the reality is, we're kind of feeling the investment in that area as well. So if anything over the course of time, we would expect to maintain that relative outperformance versus market overall, if not even accelerate that. Do you have a follow-on, Uche?",246

Can I just ask you about Wireless? Okay, so probably besides you to say we're seeing early signs of the Nokia's share ship to other suppliers into Nokia.

And also, as we go through the rest of the year, any sense as to how much of the Baseband revenue is 3G versus 2G. And should we still be modeling this going down to zero, say by 2013?",95

The composition of Baseband these days is, 80% of that revenue is 3G. And then, that would leave 20% basically representing the older technologies. By comparison, in the year-ago quarter, 50% of that Baseband revenue was 3G. So we've seen a very significant market shift over the course of the past year away from the older technologies and toward 3G. And I believe you commented, but I would agree that in terms of competitive pressure at Nokia, where again they've acknowledged and they have a strategy to multi-source this product. This year, basically, the competitors that they have on board will be addressing those older non-3G technologies, which represent 20% of our Baseband technology. And then, the 80%, that is 3G, to the best of our knowledge, it will be 2011 before they have any other alternative suppliers on board with 3G basebands there.

If you just take that out and look at the five years prior to that, it would have been two percentage points less, so 8%. So again, what we just reported, I would say generally right in that range of seasonal Q2. With respect to Q3, again, the five-year average is 8%. Last year's Q3 was similarly robust with 17% sequential growth.

But they came down a little bit again in second quarter as you saw in the first quarter. So we continue to make progress as we bring more capacity online. And you could actually see the way we're supporting that is through restocking our finished goods inventory. And if you actually look at our balance sheet, you'll see that's where most of our inventory build was at. As we continue to bring capacity online, notwithstanding variability and demand going forward, we'd expect that lead time to continue to come down. And it's coming down pretty much across the board. So those items that were greater 16 weeks, we saw some of those coming down to less than 16. Those that are greater than 14, we saw some of those come down to less than 14, and so on in each of those contracts as you take a look at them. We would expect continued progress on that front.",175

And we're having customers coming to us and asking us if we can help out with some of those issues. That customers are also recognizing that unlike our competitors, we in fact have been pretty aggressive in putting in capacity, not only opening assembly test sites at the bottom of the downturn last year, but starting RFAB late last year, and more recently, the announcement we just did last week of the acquisition of the Spansion Japan factories. That seems to be resonating well with our customers. And in fact, we believe this is helping us win additional orders that should accelerate our growth going forward and accelerate our gains against most competitors from a future standpoint, let alone current lead time, which is -- that some of them are starting to experience.",180

If you look at capital spending between the year 2007 and 2009, TI's capital spending was basically up 10% over that time period, where when we look at general the math of our competitors collectively, they were down. And I believe this is an Analog-specific comparison, they were down, on average, 57%. And that doesn't even comprehend the fact that many of these Analog competitors took a lot of capacity offline. So in addition, not suspending on new capacity, they were taking capacity offline. Customers see that data. They see the spending we're doing that we did through 2009, plus what we've done in addition to that. And frankly, they know how that's going. They know how to extrapolate into the future, know what that situation is going to result in, in terms of availability of products, and that's why I think the situation Kevin is describing is there. They already have seen some of these various competitors start to extend lead time, while at the same time they're seeing TI pulling lead times plus, as Kevin said, really lay the path for our future in terms of these capacity investment. So frankly, we think that's big, and we think it's going to be a big differentiator for TI over the course of the next few years.",235

Between the Spansion addition and the Qimonda equipment, you talked about adding $3.5 billion of revenue capacity. I guess two questions on that. First, can you tell us how much you paid for those Spansion assets? And then secondly, the $3.5 billion is about 2½x to 3x how much dollar growth you've seen over the last four years in your Analog business. Are you just getting more optimistic about how fast you can grow revenues? Or is this kind of a pull forward the CapEx? How should we think about that kind of big investment you're making?",108

I think that we started talking last year that as we were coming into the downturn and watching what was going on there, that we would remain poised to be optimistic to go ahead and take advantage of acquisition of capacity as well as companies that essentially if it made sense for the smaller companies we've been buying because their prices are so attractive. This is just a continuation of what we talked about back then. We have been able to acquire these  manufacturing assets at extremely attractive prices. In the case of Qimonda, we were able to discuss what that pricing was. In the case of Spansion, we have not disclosed that. But I can say to you that our estimate is that the original acquisition costs of that capacity that we bought is close to $2 billion, and we spent -- got it for a very attractive price, one that we are not at all concerned about will cause us to have an undue level of fixed cost to have to incur should the demand take a long time to play out. But to go back to what Ron said a few moments ago, with the underinvestment that we've seen from a competitor standpoint, we expect our growth rate, in fact, should be poised to accelerate versus our competitors. And we may look back on this a couple of years from now and find this very inexpensive pack capacity acquisition to be a very opportune move for us to make the company much larger.",263

So annualize that, and call it a $6 billion business. I think last year, we were at $4.2 billion, and it's still growing. So as we've said, the strategy is to have that capacity in place before we need it. And we're not trying to forecast exactly what time period we will fill it up.

And that as lead times have -- as we progress in reducing lead time, customers no longer need to provide us the very extended visibility that they had done in, let's say, six months ago when lead times were kind of out of their peak level. So With that lower visibility, the new orders are basically coming in to replenish at a level that is consistent with their true demand as opposed to the rate of orders basically reflecting a backlog that was extending out over time. So probably, that's about the best I can do in terms of trying to explain that. Do you have a follow-on, Sumit?",176

I would say that orders, quarter to date, have remained strong and fully consistent with the outlook that we just provided in terms of revenue. In terms of our inventory expectations, we do not, at this point, try to project any kind of inventory plans because our inventory plans for the third quarter really have more to do with our outlook for the fourth quarter.

I mean we do need to keep in mind that third quarter is typically the quarter when customers will order material in anticipation of fourth quarter holiday sales and even some orders in anticipation of the first quarter Chinese New Year holiday sales. So this seems to be shaping up consistent with that. In other words, we've got a global economy that's still growing albeit at a pace that may be or just a little bit downward at least in some areas on second half versus first half, but still growing nonetheless. And the order pattern that we have seen reflects that. It's broad-based. It's probably been very strong, and as we indicated earlier in the Industrial and Automotive segments that Ron talked about and it's probably got more to a normal seasonal kind of demand pattern in some of the other areas such as Computers and Handsets.",153

I think the same guidance you had before. But I'm thinking about you've now added some incremental capacity, obviously, through both Qimonda and Spansion acquisitions.

But I would just kind of point you back to some of our spending over the last few years. And our depreciation over the last 12 months has run a little bit less than 7% of the last 12 months' revenue. Our CapEx, if you include the most recent acquisitions, have been running about 9%. We've been talking about a CapEx target of between 5% and 8%. But I'd say that spending is pretty consistent with that sort of kind of goal, and that is that you'd probably see depreciation in the 5% to 8% kind of a range over time. And looking forward, with the CapEx that we're doing right now, it's probably going to be still inside that range, which is just fine. Of course, it's a function of what you wind up with revenue after 2011 and '12, but anticipation of growth there, which of course is what we're expecting with the capital acquisitions that we're making. I would expect to see that depreciation kind of stay inside that range without actually getting to a dollar amount right now.",194

And Glen then you take those numbers, make an estimate maybe for some incremental equipment from Spansion and our depreciation schedules five years will get you roughly into a ballpark, and that would be pretty much the full Phase 1 plus Phase 2 of RFAB. So at least, that'll help. And then, Kevin, just a clarification. On Spansion, the 200-millimeter fab is an operating fab currently and when we first purchased it. So any additional depreciation associated with that fab is already in our depreciation guidance, which was unchanged, that we just provided. Is that correct?",126

Although if it's a product for Handsets, which is where most of our Wi-Fi focus is, we have a very strong position. I think I mentioned before that connectivity for TI is really focused on both discrete GPS chips as well as wireless LAN. And just note that industry analysts would estimate that last year, we had about 55% share of Handsets are really smartphone, Wi-Fi market shares. So again, that doesn't get to the specific product that you were describing or asking about. But we have a very strong position and you can rest assured we're doing what we need to do in terms of new product development to extend if not expand that share. So the other thing I would just point out on that is of all of the conductivity options in a Handset, Wi-Fi is the least penetrated, but it's also the most rapidly expanding. So we like that combination for our connectivity product, and that we have share in the connectivity technology that is growing fastest in Handsets. So we think great growth in terms of revenue in terms of that product line, and we expect more going forward.",220

We were discussing it when it was illustrative of what was going on, what was dropping so fast and coming back up so sharply. Our utilization levels have fared back to a much more normal level or somewhat elevated right now given the strong demand, which is why we're adding capacity. Our utilization levels really didn't change that much last quarter to this quarter, and I wouldn't expect them to change too much going to the next quarter, partly as a function of we're bringing on additional capacity.

I sure would like to be able to say yes, but that's going to be not only a function of the order mix that comes in, but also a function of just how fast the top line continues to growth.

That's what we've already discussed with the RFAB, and that is 300-millimeter RFAB coming up and actually getting production material out of it by the end of the year. That will be in relatively low volume at first as you can expect, but it will ramp up all through next year. And then as to the Spansion fabs, we will get started pretty quickly here on getting process adjusted in there so we can start wafers in those fabs by the end of the year. But I don't expect to see them qualify for production until about sometime in the middle of next year, when we could start actually generate revenue on product coming out of that.",134

We bought back $500 million of shares in the first quarter, $750 million in the second quarter. As we've been doing -- by the way, we have about $1.3 billion of unexpended authorization remaining. As we've done over the past few years to the extent that stock buybacks remain accretive, that will be one way that we use cash. But really it's important to note that the first priority for our cash is just towards growth. And that will be, as you can see us do, either through acquisitions of companies as we acquired in about a few moments ago or opportunistic acquisition of capacity. And of course, the third way that we use the cash is in the form of when the board approves to deliver back to shareholders in dividends. On the hiring front, I don't have any specific comments on that other than to say that as we bring on these factories, we've already talked about in the Richardson fab that several hundred people will be hired to staff that fab as the equipment comes online. And we did mention in the acquisition announcement last week of the Spansion factories that we would hire almost all of the people that are there. That's 450 plus people that we'd hire there. And as to the IT budget, that's something my CIO would like to know and I'll talk to him about it when we do annual plan time for next year.",259

So I don't know whether how the comparison is as to how we moved back to peak levels. We certainly know we've moved very aggressively off, I'd say, in the last five quarters. I think first quarter of '09 was when we saw that revenue bottomed and it's grown very nicely since then. And we would say that represents really a turnaround of the business. It's not just a, I'll call it a cyclical bounce back in our revenue. But in fact, a lot of the things that we have been talking about really since, I believe, it was the May '08 Analyst Meeting that we had done to restructure and create efficiencies in that business are, in fact, coming to fruition. So again, that's where we would declare it truly as a turnaround as opposed to a cyclical recovery. And we do expect HVAL to continue really what you've seen over the last year, which is to grow consistent with the other two Analog businesses and contribute consistent with the overall Analog revenue, as opposed to the drag that it had been previously. Do you have a follow-on, Steve?",210

It certainly is meaningful, although, it's a pretty small part of that HVAL business. And even inside of that space, you would have to say there is the trend away from commoditization as they try to address more higher-valued opportunities within there.

As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at www.ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
 This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
 Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 7. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update.
 In today's call, we'll describe how TI's strategic position in our core businesses of Analog, Embedded Processing and smartphone chips continues to strengthen. We'll discuss our manufacturing strategy and recent additions that we have made to our analog capacity. We'll also provide our perspective of the near-term demand environment.
 Revenue in the third quarter generally tracked closely with our initial expectations in the quarter. In July, the middle of our guidance range projected about 6% sequential revenue growth. We held that level with our September update and in the end, we delivered 7% growth.
 Although our results are good, demand is a bit of a mixed bag. The industrial market was strong for us in the third quarter as it continued a cyclical recovery. We believe this market has now recovered and, therefore, we expect industrial growth will be somewhat less robust in the fourth quarter. In communications, wireless infrastructure was strong as operators continue to expand capacity to support increased data traffic. Accordingly, demand for chips that we sell into smartphones was also strong in the quarter. As we said at our September update, we saw a notable slowing in demand for products that we shipped into the PC market during the third quarter. We expect demand from our PC customers to remain subdued in the fourth quarter. Similarly, some of the consumer-related markets, such as televisions, also slowed in the third quarter, and we expect these trends to continue through the current quarter.
 The increase in TI revenue was driven by growth across all of our segments. Analog revenue grew 5% sequentially and 35% from a year ago. Sequentially, Analog revenue was up most in High-Performance Analog, where we have higher industrial exposure. High-Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management products both grew, although to a lesser extent, with their exposure to the computing and consumer markets. From a year ago, all three product areas contributed to growth about the same and all contributed to TI's market share expansion in Analog.
 Embedded Processing grew rapidly again this quarter. This partly reflects its exposure to markets that performed well, including industrial and communications infrastructure. It also reflects continued market share gains for TI and the strategic importance of Embedded Processing to our company. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 12% with both communications infrastructure and catalog products contributing about equally to this growth. Catalog products include both digital signal processors and microcontrollers. From a year ago, Embedded Processing grew 47% with catalog product being the biggest factor in the growth.
 Wireless revenue grew 6% sequentially and 11% from a year ago. Collectively, products targeting the smartphone market, both being connectivity products and OMAP applications processors, grew 6% sequentially and 37% from a year ago. These are the Wireless products that we're investing in for growth. We've had tremendous design-in success especially with our latest generations of OMAP applications processors across a range of smartphones and tablets, and we look forward to solid growth as our customers' new product transition into volume production. Baseband product revenue was $438 million in the quarter and grew 5% sequentially and declined 3% from a year ago.
 Our Other segment revenue grew 10% sequentially, driven by custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators. From a year ago, this revenue was up 29%, with growth from DLP products and custom ASIC products being the biggest factors.
 Distribution resales were up 8% sequentially in the quarter, about the same as TI revenue overall. We were able to help distributors build a few days of inventory in the third quarter. We're comfortable that their inventory is appropriate relative to current levels of demand and to historical metrics. Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.

Our financial performance this quarter underscores the benefit of our transformation to a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing.
 Gross profit increased 8% sequentially and our gross margin moved up another 30 basis points to 54.5% of revenue. The combination of R&D and SG&A increased $38 million from the second quarter with most of the increase in R&D, especially for our core businesses.
 Operating profit for the quarter was $1.23 billion, an increase of 11% from last quarter as we once again pushed the bar higher from last quarter's record high. Operating margin in the third quarter was 32.8% of revenue.
 Net income in the third quarter was $859 million or $0.71 per share. In the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units that receive dividends. In the third quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $13 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have recorded.
 I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for your review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $1.32 billion. This was up $756 million from the last quarter and up $484 million from a year ago.
 Capital expenditures increased to $396 million in the quarter and include additions to our assembly and test capacity as well as our Analog wafer fab capacity.
 In July, we announced that we had purchased additional 200-millimeter fab and 300-millimeter equipment as part of Spansion-Japan's bankruptcy proceeding. This purchase closed on schedule at the end of August, and we are now porting TI's Analog process technology into that fab.
 Earlier this month, we announced that we also acquired our first wafer fab in China. This 200-millimeter operational fab was also purchased at a substantial discount and will support our growth strategy for Analog in the years ahead. With these acquisitions, we believe we are very well positioned with wafer fab capacity to support our intermediate-term growth plans.
 Return on invested capital in the quarter moved up to 34%. Our strategy is to drive significant growth while also generating higher returns our investments. Having purchased manufacturing assets that have long productive lives and purchasing those assets opportunistically at low prices is an important part of the strategy.
 We used $600 million in the quarter to repurchase 24 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $143 million in the quarter. We increased our inventory by $75 million in the quarter while lowering inventory days by one day to 75.
 Our lead times have continued to decline as we bring additional manufacturing capacity online and get better positioned with inventory. Orders in the quarter declined to $3.43 billion. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 0.92 in the quarter.
 Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.36 billion to $3.64 billion in the fourth quarter or down 10% to down 3% sequentially. Part of the decline will be associated with the normal seasonal decline in calculators following back-to-school as well as seasonality in semiconductors. Depending on where we land in this range, revenue could come in a little below normal seasonality due to the impact of continued subdued demand from our computing and consumer customers.
 We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.67. Our estimate for 2010 R&D now rounds up to $1.6 billion. Our estimates for 2010 depreciation, capital expenditures and the annual tax rate are unchanged.
 In summary, we continue to execute on a strategy that is focused on significant expansion of our market position in the Analog and Embedded Processing markets, as well as the strong growth resulting from increasing demand for smartphone chips. These are all large, diverse markets that provide us an excellent opportunity for long-term growth. Combining the financial returns of these markets with growth that is significantly above market rates will deliver an earnings model that we believe will be attractive to long-term shareholders.
 We are also maintaining a strong discipline on capital and spending levels. If we find great opportunities for investment, we have a strong balance sheet and have resolved to move aggressively to pursue them, such as you've seen us do with the manufacturing assets that we've purchased over the past year. If we're generating cash beyond the needs of the business, we're proud to return it to our shareholders through share buybacks and increased dividends. For example, since the end of 2004, we've lowered our shares outstanding by 32%. This means that all else being equal, our shareholders are now getting 47% more earnings per share than they would have had we not done these repurchases. And in September, we announced our board authorized an additional $7.5 billion in repurchases or about 25% of our recent market capitalization and another dividend increase.
 We're confident that continuing to tune our business to generate higher growth and earnings while also maintaining a capital model that lower our shares outstanding will be a good combination in the years ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Ron.

I guess what I would say is you're right. Those are the areas that would be below kind of the normal run rate. Probably the one area I would say that continues to be strong is comms infrastructure. Handsets, since we only have one customer there really, I don't want to provide any specific commentary. Industrial, I would say probably the best description there is that it's normalizing. It's transitioning from third quarter, which is really an extension of the first three quarters this year, where it has been growing pretty rapidly due to that cyclical recovery. But I would say fourth quarter would represent more normalizing to probably a more typical seasonal pattern from industrial. So you did identify really the two areas that we would call out as being weaker. Those being computing and parts of the consumer markets.

That is that the adjustment that we're seeing underway are starting now is probably more focused and not broad-based and is probably generally pretty mild. If you look in the past, when you look at book-to-bills, typically, if we get to four, five, six quarters of positive book-to-bills and followed by a couple of quarters of negative or near one book-to-bills, I would typically suggest that maybe a couple of quarters from an adjustment phase before we have a resumption of demand. In the PC and consumer space, as we've discussed here, we saw demand soften up in that quarter, so we're probably halfway through our first quarter on that. And so if we take a look out, it would be, from our view, reasonable to assume that we get through this adjustment process over the next quarter or two, and then we see a resumption of overall end market demand.

I'd refer you to ZTE in terms of anything they may want to offer. But we've had a strong presence in China overall, and we've had a relationship specifically with ZTE for many years. So I think this is just an extension of a lot of good things that had been happening for TI for some time and our growing momentum in that market, which is one that we see is going to be especially important for TI in the years to come.

But capacity, you may recall, that we began over a year ago with the acquisition of equipment from Qimonda, who was in bankruptcy at the time, to begin to put 300-millimeter equipment into our fab, our Richardson fab. We went through a second phase on that with another location they had in Dresden where we purchased equipment to complete Phase II in RFAB. In addition last quarter, we announced acquiring Spansion of Japan out of bankruptcy. And this past month, we announced our first manufacturing acquisition for manufacturing plant in China. To put in perspective where we're at in those acquisitions right now, the RFAB qualified its first products this quarter, and we do expect to ship our first revenue-generating wafers out of that factory this quarter. It will ramp up consistent with demand. As Spansion is concerned, the one we acquired in Japan, we expect to have our first wafers out of that factory by the end of this quarter as we ported one of our processes into that factory. And with the Chengdu factory in China, in fact, we had already been using that factory as a foundry for some of our HVAL products, and we will be porting additional products into that factory over the next couple of quarters. So we would expect those factories to ramp up fairly slowly on our products consistent with whatever we see in demand. In the meantime, those two factories, the one in Japan and the one in China, in both cases, we have transitional service agreements with the sellers, whereby we are selling them some products out of those factories that, to a large extent, will offset our operating costs as we bring up our own process technologies in those factories.

So really, if you think about the timing of that as well as the other two factories and you compare that to what Kevin said previously about this period of market weakness, our view is going to be relatively short-lived and mild. Those factories ramping really are probably coming on more online on the other side of this period of weakness as opposed to a lot of market weakness is underway.

I mean, probably the best I can do is point out that if you look in the prior quarter, the third quarter, resales generally tracked very closely with TI's own revenue trends, but I don't have a specific projection for you on resales in Q4.

You've had a nice ramp of margin improvement here. Why shouldn't we expect say through next year that margins will continue to improve as your cost base drives down. It doesn't sound like we're in a downward cycle with demand and yet your costs have got to be starting to drop, especially if you bring up this new fabs cost operating costs in terms of the agreements you've gained with the people you're buying them from.

Importantly, as Analog and Embedded Processing become a bigger portion of our overall portfolio, that also will give us more tailwind on our margins. But the fact of the matter is we're not really focusing on trying to improve our margins so much as we are focusing a lot more on trying to improve our top line growth. You've heard us talking for a number of quarters now about having a growth objective, whereby we are considerably outgrowing our markets and gaining market share from our customers. And that's really where all our energy and focus is at. That doesn't mean that we will not let margins fall through as they produce themselves, but that's not what we're aiming at and that's not the purpose of the acquisition of those factories. The purpose of the acquisitions of those factories is really to support the top line growth. And happily, those factories came to us at very inexpensive costs.

If it comes down between you're not getting the top line growth that you're after and your margins are at record levels, we would be reasonable to assume that the margins will be capped and maybe a little more aggressive pricing profile so that you can build the top line?

I think that we don't set the prices. The markets set the prices, and we can't anticipate how competitors will respond to customer demands. What we're really focused on is making sure that we have adequate capacity to grow as rapidly as we can, as our customers will accept our products. But to infer that, that would lead us to a pricing decision would be an incorrect conclusion, because frankly, prices are set competitively, not unilaterally in our space.

But that's not how you win business. You win business based upon the quality and performance levels of the product. And so even in a weaker market environment or if growth is not producing the levels that we expect, you don't change that fundamental dynamic by changing your prices. Changing prices or lowering prices below market just leaves the money on the table. It does not result in incremental revenue for the vast majority of our product lines. There's a small part of our product line that represents less than 5% of our revenue that would be considered commodity type products that is price-elastic, but again, that's a net relative to, I think, the broader product portfolio.

I don't want to say predominantly. We actually saw calculators increase sequentially from the second quarter to third quarter but that's just seasonal. Back-to-school usually peaks in the third quarter for us, and third quarter typically increases somewhat beyond second quarter. The biggest area of sequential strength in that Other segment was in custom ASIC. I would probably know the couple of areas inside of that. One is we do have a significant part of our custom ASIC business that goes in the communications infrastructure, both wireless PlayStations as well as the enterprise side and both increased sequentially in the quarter. And then we also sell custom ASIC products. This is kind of more one off but for touchscreen controllers going into smartphones that's also did nicely for us in the quarter. So that's a little bit of insight into the custom ASIC. The other area that we mentioned was DLP. DLP is still being dominated in terms of that revenue base by front projector business, and it continues to be a nice business and it's even have shown some recent growth for us, so no real change on that front though.

There's probably there, the computing tie is more through products that go into hard disk drives. Our Power Product line in Analog also sells into PCs, some of the Power Management products, but HVAL is probably more through hard disk drives and storage products. I think your description of that -- well, I'll just say we expect that it will continue to be, what I said before, demand will continue kind of the current trends that we saw in the third quarter of slowing going into the fourth quarter as well. HVAL also sells into a range of other products such as smartphones. Some of the Power Management areas in smartphones, they sell into some video gaming on the consumer side. And even though we've said consumer televisions are weak, there were other areas such as video gaming on the consumer side, and that actually did reasonably well for us in the third quarter. And I'm trying to think if there are other areas of notable to mention. Those are probably the ones I would tie. Yes, maybe a final one would just be infrastructure. It sells into some of that communications and wireless infrastructure as well, and of course, that's almost anything that's touching infrastructure for us that would be, I guess, on both the HVAL side but then also some of the HPA products tie into comms infrastructure as well. And as I said, anything that we have selling into infrastructure whether it was the ASIC products I've mentioned, the Embedded Processing products or some of these Analog products have done well. And we would expect to continue doing well into the fourth quarter.

And my question here is how does that impact TI across the board, one would obviously expects gains for the OMAP business, but I would like to get a sense of your focus there and your positioning in some of the upcoming tablets? And then how that cuts across other segments of your business through -- we talked about HDD. Obviously, tablets are going to cannibalize the PC. What would be impact of that on TI? Or do you have a commensurate gain also on tablets offset in the weakness there? So any comments you can make as what it means for TI across with your OMAP business?

We saw strength in those areas as you might guess in the third quarter. That strength was not -- even though it's a nice growing business and offset some of the weakness that we saw along on the PC front or the notebook front, it wasn't the PC exposure these days just because of the relative size of that market, of course. It's higher for us. We'll see how that changes over time. But those tend to be some of the more -- those type of products tend to be a little less visible, I guess you might say. I know I see all the various tear downs and they try to describe who has this processor or that processor. Products like Power tend to run under the radar. A couple of other areas I would mention the audio amplifiers, some of the connectivity products, certainly, there's opportunity in tablets. And then, as I previously mentioned clearly, OMAP as the main processor to handle some of both the applications, the graphics, et cetera, certainly, is a great opportunity. But the opportunity goes well beyond OMAP, and we're already benefiting even in third quarter from the growth of tablets, and we expect that to just broaden as products like OMAP transition into production in that space.

In fact, you could see that on the cash flow statement with our earnings release. For example, on the Japan acquisition, we used net of about $130 million acquiring all of those assets and about $59 million of that is for an acquisition of the business in the balance acquisition that goes through CapEx. With the acquisition in Chengdu, we will initially used about $140 million in acquired net asset. And most of that will probably through the acquisition of the business. The remaining $35 million or so will be earned out on the acquisition over the course of next year. So it's a bit of a mix. Some of it's going through CapEx and some of it is acquisition of a business. As far as the revenue that we expect, we anticipate that the revenue that we will get through those transition service agreements will be less than 1% of TI's revenue. And by and large, what that will wind up doing is absorbing the cost of those factories during the period that we are bringing up our own process technologies and tie those factories.

But at the same time, I'll remind you that we also are selling our cable modem business, and we expect that transaction to close in Q4.

And even though we've made progress, lead times are still, as Kevin pointed out earlier, extended beyond where we really want them as of right now.

And in fact, with the qualification of RFAB this quarter, we expect to see depreciation going up a little bit in the fourth quarter. But I would remind you also that there's a natural roll-off that goes on. So while depreciation may be up for a couple of quarters, I expect it will come back down as we move into next year. In fact, if you just kind of step back and take a look at the broader picture, you may recall that we depreciate on a five-year straight-line basis. If you go back to 2005 and look at our capital expenditures back then, it was about $1.330 billion if I recall. And that's beginning to roll off and will roll off over the next couple of quarters. Our CapEx forecast for this year is $1.2 billion. And I mentioned earlier that some of those acquisitions are going through acquisition of the business. So if you add it all together and we're probably talking about $1.4 billion or so of assets that we're acquiring this year that will be depreciated. So to a large extent, what's rolling off will be replaced with the acquisitions that we've made in 2000 and plan to make here in 2010. And so year-over-year, we don't expect our depreciation to change all that much. We'll be able to give a more precise outlook on that after we close the fourth quarter. But for some early planning and for trying to figure out what depreciation might do for GPM, that may help frame that for you a little bit.

So clearly, staffing and material cost and so on are highly variable and will be brought on only as revenue pulls demand through that factory. And then the variable costs associated again with the acquisitions in Japan and China, by and large, are being offset by the Transition Services Agreement as we bring up our new processes there. So we expect a fairly smooth transition unless those Transition Services Agreement begins to shift downward, and that cost is left behind, that should happen about the same time that we're bringing up our own production inside those factories and we can absorb that into the revenue-generating wafers.

I believe we have the most integrated connectivity solution that's out there centered up on our WiFi solutions. And even if you look at where connectivity has been over the last few years and where it's going, clearly, there's a trend towards integration and a lot of the players that kind of were a single technology players just don't have the capability to integrate and do it as quickly as TI has, where we played across historically WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, FM radio. And so, it's quite natural for us to have the capability to roll that all altogether into an integrated solution. So the trend toward integration in the connectivity market has positioned just favorably worked to TI's benefit. We've won a lot of designs as a result and you're seeing that in terms of revenue growth. Now before you take that and extrapolate it too far, as I said in the prepared remarks, we've also had tremendous success in designing in OMAP 3 and OMAP 4 product generations as well. And so, I think you'll see that even though for the last few quarters, connectivity's probably been the fastest growing, that could rapidly change and go through a period of time where OMAP is growing fast. So I think you'll see both of those areas grow, but it will kind of happen in fits and starts based on as new generations of product roll out and as design wins move into production.

I did mention earlier that we will see depreciation go up a bit in fourth quarter because we have now qualified most of the equipment in RFAB. So clearly, that will be there. But I don't think it will actually move the needle that much from an overall GPM standpoint.

You do give out the number every quarter. I'm just going back looking historically.

We're about 34.2% by my math there. I wouldn't say that there is a model per se other than that we're mindful of the fact that profitable enterprises has have to return on their capital in excess of what their of cost of capital is. So clearly, as long as we're above that, we believe we're adding value to our shareholders and clearly, we are well above that right now. One of the things that high ROIC does do for us is that it allows us to generate healthy levels of cash. And as we've seen here, certainly for an extended period of time, cash in excess of what we need to actually grow and operate our business on a day-to-day and quarter-to-quarter basis, which allows us to be pretty aggressive on buying back shares and also over time, returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends as well.

And there's obviously been a lot of talk from some of the analysts side some of your competitors about where the low hanging fruit is for you guys.

If you take a look from a 300-millimeter standpoint, clearly, the higher volume first, especially those parts that are developed in our HVAL business as well as some of our higher volume Power parts and certain other parts would be prime candidates to go to that factory. I also mentioned earlier that the factory in Chengdu, China was already manufacturing some parts for us for our HVAL business and we'll continue to do that. And as we port our processes in there, we expect to put our Power MOSFET business into that factory as we go into 2011. And then as it relates to our factory in Japan, the process reporting there will be initially ideal to suit the High-Performance Analog business portfolio. So each of those factories will be able to support all three elements of our Analog. But again, they're really aimed at the Analog portfolio. As we look into 2011, with the fab capacity brought online, we'll be continuing to pay attention to our assembly and test capacity and make sure we that keep that ahead of the output from those wafer fabs.

And what I would say is 300-millimeter is going to go across the board in Analog. And that means HVAL, it means Power and it means High-Performance Analog. And we won't delve off too deeply here. But 300-millimeter, we have a lot more flexibility given the automation systems in that factory to take a 300-millimeter lot of wafers and subdivide it down into two wafers of product A and four wafers of product B. That lot does not have to all be at the same product. So therefore, the argument that somehow 300-millimeter scale doesn't apply to certain areas such as High-Performance Analog makes no sense to us. And I think you'll see us move forward accordingly.

I gave it in my prepared remarks. It was $438 million in the quarter. So that grew looks like about 5% sequentially and it was down 3% from a year ago. So again, probably nothing really has changed. I think what we've described before is that if you basically just straight-line it from here to zero by the end of 2012, you'll have quarters that you've seen, some quarters that are above that line, some quarters that are below that line. And so really, it's probably no different in terms of guidance from us. It will be a bit noisy, but that's probably about the best that we could recommend. No change in terms of when we expect that revenue basically to be essentially to zero by the time we go into the year 2013.

And in fact, we appear to see just the opposite of our channel inventory remains fairly lean, at least from indications from our products that we can get from permission from our customers for our products. And broadly speaking, it looks for us for the whole industry, I've seen numerous reports that indicate that total installed capacity for wafer fabs from starts standpoint globally is still down significantly from its high point in third quarter '08. Most recent stats I've seen suggest that it's still running around 14%, 15% below where it was back then. So we don't have excess capacity driving excess production. Generally speaking, we do not see much evidence of any excess components of ours up in the channel. What we do seem to be seeing is after the sweet cyclical snapback last year at many of these channels, we're seeing growth rates now that are beginning to mirror much more to what's happening in the global economy from overall demand. So from that standpoint, and just from the history of these kinds of adjustments. We'd expect a couple of quarters of relatively mild adjustment and a resumption of growth. We're not making a prediction as to what that growth looks like when it resumes, but we expect it will be a resumption of growth after a few quarters of pause.

They actually stepped down in July and held up that level relatively stable through August and September. So that's just another data point, I guess, you might say is what's driving those comments from us.

Obviously, you have some significant customer concentration and you've done pretty well in terms of the portfolio and ahead of many or your peers, but I'm just looking out longer term. I know you're not going to tell us you're going to shut it down or sell it tomorrow, but I'm just curious how committed you are in terms of R&D investment going forward given that you're not in the Baseband market going forward?

I think that the R&D investment is probably good intro to an answer on that. Over the last year, we have pretty much removed all of our investment in the Baseband as we talked about multiple quarters now and directed that over to the non-baseband portion of our Wireless portfolio, which is both connectivity as well as the apps processor. Included the apps processor is getting a large share of that R&D investment. I would add that connectivity is also, as we're finding different markets for those products to be sold into, but clearly, the lion's share of the R&D is going into the apps processor space. So that is a space that is ripe for growth not only in cellphones, but in tablets and other applications as well such as personal navigation devices, infotainment systems onboard in cars, a number of different spaces where those products can be used.

But if you just look at it, our Connectivity and OMAP revenue is up over 50% year-to-date. And so, it's a great growth businesses and that's up 50% while -- I mean, it's clear we're getting out of the -- we're pulling back on Baseband and exiting that marketplace. So again, I think that data and evidence increasingly proves that can be a very good growth business for TI even without being in the Baseband business. So we'll keep riding that one hard. We like it.

The overall operating expenditures, we increased those. You might recall back in first quarter, we moved quite a few resources from our Other segment into the EP segment, into the Embedded Processing segment, which temporarily depressed operating margins there.
