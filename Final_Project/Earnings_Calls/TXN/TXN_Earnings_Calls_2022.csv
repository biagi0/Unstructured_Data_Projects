Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.",38
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876427.0,Presenter Speech,Dave Pahl,,Executives,1,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2021 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.  
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.  
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call for our capital management update on February 3 at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and our approach to capital allocation.  
For today's call, let me summarize what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll start with fourth quarter revenue results, including some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I'll then provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insights into onetime items and our guidance for first quarter 2022.  
Starting with fourth quarter results and the market environment. The company's revenue grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in the industrial and automotive markets. Analog revenue grew 20% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing grew 6%. our Other segment grew 35% from the year-ago quarter. Let me now comment on the current environment to provide some context of what we're seeing with our customers and markets.  
Overall, the quarter came in stronger than we expected. The strength was across most product families, end markets and geographies. The market environment is similar to what we reported 90 days ago. Lead times for the majority of our products remained stable, but hotspots continue to exist. However, customers continue to be selective in their expedite requests, increasingly focusing on products that complete a matched set rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior is not specific to any product family, end market or geography. Discussions with customers confirm a high level of interest in our commitment to expanding our internal manufacturing capacity road map, including 300-millimeter wafer fabs; RFAB 2 and LFAB; our recently announced plans for a multi-fab site in Sherman, Texas; and the associated assembly test expansions. These investments, to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, will provide lower cost and greater control of our supply chain. And while there is a growing recognition that the near-term supply/demand imbalance will end at some point, the secular growth of semiconductor content per system will continue to increase, and this requires a robust manufacturing capacity road map for 2025 and beyond.  
Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market for the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial market was up about 40%, driven by broad-based strength across all sectors. The automotive market was up high single digits with strength in most sectors. Personal electronics was down upper single digits, off a strong compare from a year ago. Next, communications equipment was up about 25%. Finally, Enterprise Systems was up about 50% off a weak compare from a year ago, driven primarily by data center and enterprise computing. And lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2021.  
We break our end markets into 6 categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The 6 end markets are: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 41%; automotive, 21%; personal electronics, 24%; Communications Equipment, 6%; Enterprise Systems, 6%; and Other was 2%. In 2021, industrial and automotive combined made up 62% of TI's revenue, up about 5 percentage points from 2020 and up from 42% from 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content for application, which will drive faster growth compared to the other markets.  
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",794
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876428.0,Presenter Speech,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,2,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.4 billion or 69% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 440 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $793 million, up 1% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 18% of revenue. For the year, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term.  
Restructuring charges were $54 million in the quarter. This expense is driven by the Lehi wafer fab purchase we closed in October. Operating profit was $2.5 billion or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 38% from the year-ago quarter.  
Net income in the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion or $2.27 per share, which included a $0.04 cost that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to the purchase I discussed earlier. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.  
Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion in the quarter, which included about $900 million for the LFAB purchase. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.3 billion, up 15% from a year ago.  
In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends. We have increased our dividend per share by 13%, marking our 18th year of dividend increases. For the year, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.  
Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. Inventory days were 116, up 4 days sequentially and remained below these higher levels. Now let's look at some of these results for the year.  
In 2021, cash flow from operations was $8.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion or 13% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2021 was $6.3 billion or 34% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value.  
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion and earnings per share in the range of $2.01 to $2.29. We expect our 2022 annual operating tax rate to continue to be above 14% and our effective tax rate about 1 percentage point lower than that. This is based on current tax law and would be about the same as we saw in 2021.  
Next, let me help you model our expectation for expenses for the LFAB purchase. As we have said, we expect to have about $75 million of cost per quarter until we start production, which is still expected in early 2023. These costs continue to be mostly reflected in the restructuring line on the P&L, so it will be visible each quarter to you and therefore, part of our operating profit results. Once the facility begins production, this cost will move and be primarily reflected in cost of revenue.  
As I close, let me explain why we're so excited about this capacity investments as they strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage. First, we have significant 300-millimeter capacity coming online with RFAB 2 and LFAB in 2022 and 2023. Second, with the announcement of the Sherman Complex, we have a 300-millimeter road map to support growth from 2025 to 2035. Third, customers are excited that our capacity investments are in 45-nanometer to 130-nanometer process technologies that are optimized for analog and embedded and will support their growth in the decades ahead. It is clear that owning and controlling our manufacturing and technology will give us both lower cost and greater control of our supply chain. It is with this confidence we look forward to sharing with you more details of our plans in our capital management call next week.  
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",714

Dave and Rafael, last quarter was the first quarter you talked about customers being a little bit more selective about their ordering patterns. And that was somewhat reflected in upside in September, which was a little bit muted. You characterized Q4 as being the same, but the upside was a little bit stronger. I'm wondering if you could help me just square that circle as to what drove the magnitude of upside in the December quarter above that of September.",85

Yes, the upside that we saw in the fourth quarter was very, very broad-based. So as we described it, it was across our product families, across our end markets and geography. So it really wasn't one thing that was driving it and it was very broad-based. So that was the difference that we saw between last quarter and this quarter. Do you have a follow-up?",70

Just as a follow-up, notwithstanding the impressive growth you put up in your Analog business in calendar year '21, if I comp that against the SIA, it's going to end up having been an unusual year for you guys because you would have undergrown the industry by a fairly wide margin, at least versus history. And I'm wondering if you can help me understand, is that a function of peers being a bit more aggressive on pricing menu? Is it something that we shouldn't take to the trend? Or how do you explain the difference there?",97

I think whenever we look at the SIA data, regardless of which direction that it's trending, and you'll know that I'll always be consistent that I say never look at 1 quarter, sometimes even 1 year on specifics. That really needs to be something that is looked at over time, especially we go through a period of the last 4, 6 quarters through COVID and the choppiness that's been going on, I'd just be real careful to get too precise on measuring things in this type of time period. So I think with our competitive advantages, with the investments that we're making, we're very confident that we're making progress in the markets that we're making those investments. And we really believe that we've made progress over this time period. Thank you, John.",133

Would you call it early, mid- or late cycle? Or if I ask the question differently, do you think any of your end market is overheated right now in any way?",41
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876437.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,11,"Yes. Vivek, I would say that the demand environment is similar to what we saw 90 days ago. So we had seen strength in orders, and our backlog continue to be strong, those types of things. The upside that we saw, of course, this quarter was very broad-based. And so that was the difference here in the fourth quarter. I'd say that we did see the match-set behavior last quarter. And again, we did see it again this quarter. And that's where customers are really looking to complete that instead of expediting across the board. And you could describe that behavior as being symptomatic of growing customer inventory that's out of mix. But as we've talked about previously, we don't have direct visibility into customer inventory. So that's not something that we could measure over time. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?",142
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876438.0,Question,Vivek Arya,,Analysts,12,"Yes. So the other question is now on the supply side. There is an investor concern that the semiconductor industry is overinvesting at a time when demand might be peaking. And I know you guys have made it clear that you invest for the longer term. But how are you thinking about your current acceleration on the investment side? When does that translate into actual useful capacity? And what are you doing to make sure that you don't over invest, right, at least in the next couple of quarters?",89
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876439.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,13,"Yes. Vivek, I'll go ahead and take that. As you alluded to at the beginning of the question, we think of the long term when we make this decision. So this is not about 2021, '22 or even '23. This is over the long term. And the secular trends in our industry, we're confident of where those are pointing and specifically, in our products, analog and embedded, and the end markets that -- where we put a strategic priority industrial automotive.  
So on the manufacturing investments that you alluded to, we're very excited about those. As I mentioned during the prepared remarks, they're going to strengthen our competitive advantage on manufacturing and technology. First, we're going to have significant 300-millimeter capacity coming online with RFAB 2 and Lehi. That's going to happen actually this year and then going to next year with Lehi.  
Second, with the announcement of the Sherman Complex, we're going to have a road map that's going to support us out to 2035. And then finally, customers are very excited about our investments specifically in 45- to 130-nanometer process technologies that are optimized for Analog and Embedded and will support the customers' growth for decades ahead.",199

And as you pointed out, you're still below where you'd like to be. But to the extent you have visibility into customer inventory, how would you characterize where they are today?

And Dave, if you want to add to that. But yes, you pointed out is our inventory days are 116. That is higher by about 4 days from last quarter, but still well below where we want to be. And our goal is to be significantly higher than that. Our guidance on that is 130 to 190 days. Just know that that's a very tactical metric because it's just based on 1 quarter. The bottom line is that we want to have more inventory. And in that measure, I would not be uncomfortable at the very high end or even above the high end of that measure at some point, 190 days of inventory.",125

I wanted to ask about OpEx, a fairly mundane item, but you've done an incredible job in leveraging OpEx over the past years during which revenue has gone up significantly, particularly considering kind of the inflationary environment and the competition for talent. What's driving the flattish OpEx? And how should we think about potential upside to OpEx going forward, given the current backdrop?",66
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876445.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,19,"Yes. So I'll take that. First, yes, we've been running OpEx at about $3.2 billion per year, a little lower, a little higher than that. But for the last 5 years, eventually, they've rounded -- that number has rounded to that.  
OpEx, most of OpEx is an investment. That's how we think about it. Obviously, R&D continues to strengthen our -- the broadest portfolio in the industry that we have, both analog and embedded. But even inside of SG&A, there are several key pieces there that are key investments. ti.com is one that comes to mind, and we'll talk more about at the other conference, specifically at the capital management call next week.  
So OpEx fuels our future growth. We don't really think about it from a percent of revenue standpoint. But to help you with that, we have guided that over the long term should trend between 20% and 25%. Of course, we're -- right now, we're at about 18% or so. So that 3.2, I wouldn't expect it to change significantly in the short term. But over time, over many years, it should -- 20% to 25% is probably the right way to look at it.",198

I wanted to ask about the gross margin side of things. I know 1 quarter doesn't make a trend, but the incremental gross margin was way bigger in the fourth quarter than expected. And it seems like the first quarter has also guided for the gross margin to perhaps rise again sequentially. So whether it's a short term or kind of a longer-term description or answer, what are the big drivers of the upside that you're seeing in the near term? And how much of that do we expect to continue going into 2022 and beyond?",103
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876448.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,22,"Yes. So a couple of angles on that question on gross margin. First, as you know, you follow us for a long time, we do not manage to gross margin. We manage to the growth of free cash flow per share. We think that's the key driver of value for the long-term owners of the company. And you can do that with higher gross margins. You can do that with lower gross margins. So that's our focus. But specifically on gross margins, our guidance has been and continues to be, think about it on a fall-through basis, over the long term, 70%, 75%. We have been doing pretty well on that front. The key driver, of course, is revenue growth. But then beyond that 300-millimeter capacity, that continues to be a great tailwind as we have more and more of our capacity on 300-millimeter, we had -- has a structural cost advantage and we'll be continuing to add to that with RFAB 2, Lehi and the Sherman Complex. 
The last comment I'll make is -- and we'll give you more details on that next week on capital management, but CapEx has been going up and will continue to go up over a number of years with those investments that I mentioned. Those are long-term investments. Those are going to set us up great for the next 15-plus years. So I'm very happy about this. I'm pleased with that. We're confident about those. But that does flow through the P&L as higher depreciation. So I expect CapEx to go up, and depreciation will follow. And that will have an impact on gross margins. But frankly, at the end of the day, that's accounting. The investment is happening now. It will happen over the next few years with that additional CapEx, and that will just put us in a great position to grow the top line and have really great fall-throughs over a long time to come.",325

I just wanted to pivot back to the revenue side. And whether it's industrial or automotive, your 2 focused markets, they look like they both grew kind of 30%, 35% year-over-year in 2021 as a whole. That's significantly faster than the secular growth rate that you guys have delivered, but not terribly different than the peer group for the year. So I just wondered how do you guys explain that level of growth. You don't seem to see any inventory anywhere. The end markets don't seem to be growing that fast. But whether it's for TI specific or the group as a whole, I wonder -- the sector as a whole, I wonder how you would explain that growth and the sustainability of it.",125

So I think that it's clear, as we look at those markets over time, we believe that there's going to be content growth. So let me just talk about the long-term prospects of both of those markets. So it's very easily seen in the automotive market that there's content growth. We can see the cars today just have more semi content in them per vehicle than what we drove 5 years ago and 10 years ago. And it's very clear that that's going to continue. 
That same phenomenon, it's just a lot harder to see, is going on in the industrial market, and that's what we love about it. It's not one thing. We've got 13 sectors that make up that market. We have hundreds of end equipments that we're working on and tens of thousands of customers that we're working for. And our product portfolio is just positioned perfectly for that. So it's really a strategic focus that's on it. 
Now is there going to be noise around growth rates in any one given year? And John pointed out with SIA data, the stuff bouncing around, that's going to happen, but we're going to put in place growth and capacity to support that growth for the long term. And it's because we've got the confidence that those markets are going to grow and those secular trends are going to continue. So thank you, Ross.",236

First question is on customer behavior, perhaps on the ordering front. So I think there's a lot of investors that are worried that inflation is kind of stalling the economies globally. Are you not seeing any change at all in your customers' behavior from higher prices? Because obviously, there is inflation in the semicon the industry, too. So have you not seen any change in order behavior at all sequentially?",76

I'd say that the environment that, as we mentioned before, is very similar to 90 days ago. The customer behavior that we talked about with the match set continued. So really not -- in a 90-day period, has there been a change nothing that we could measure on that front. So Rafael, anything to add?",68

When we think about your capacity expansion, you talked a lot about the front end. But Rafael, you mentioned you're also doing some assembly and test expansions. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, especially how it would impact the CapEx numbers going forward?",46
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876458.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,32,"Yes. No, thanks, that question. We -- as you alluded to, a lot of the conversations on CapEx do tend to be on the fab side. That's because that's where a disproportionate amount of the money goes to, which is very capital intensive. And it's also because the lead times to build those are much longer, the type of structure that you have to build, et cetera. But we're also spending a lot of time internally on the back end and what we need to do on that front. We're going to give you more details on that next week. But essentially, we do have plans going on at various countries where we already have operations to continue to expand capacity to match that front-end capacity and always be ahead of demand.",132

As you guys mentioned, relative to your view 90 days ago, it looks like things didn't change all that much from a fundamental perspective, right, selective hotspots, lead time stable, broad-based demand. So how much of the upside was actually driven by an increase in supply availability, both from your internal manufacturing and outsource partners? Because it looks like you guys were capacity constrained starting from about the middle of last year. So just wondering if you're able to bring on some additional supply in Q4, which drove some of the upside.",99
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876461.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,35,"Yes. So I'll start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But I would tell you, first, as Dave mentioned during the call, prepared remarks and during a couple of questions, the strength was broad-based across geographies and end markets, et cetera. 
On your specific comment on capacity. As we have said probably for the last 4 quarters or so any longer, we have been and will continue to bring capacity incrementally. Incrementally, meaning relatively small steps. But nevertheless, those make a difference, especially on a cumulative basis, right? So we have been doing that for some time, and that's obviously helping. I mean you could see not only our revenue has improved during this cycle, but we went from draining inventory to now, the last 2 quarters, we've actually increased inventory, albeit at a relatively low level, but still much better than draining in inventory. So that gives you an appreciation for what that incremental -- those incremental relations to capacity have done. We expect to continue to increase incrementally, again, relatively small steps for another 2 quarters, and then RFAB 2 comes online sometime in the third quarter of this year, of 2022, and that will give us more legroom on those tailwinds. And then about 6 months later, first Q '23, we'll have Lehi, LFAB come online once it's qualified, and that will give us also more legroom on that front.",235

So when the team announced the purchase of the Lehi 300-millimeter fab, you noted that Lehi would start off with 65- and 45-nanometer analog and embedded processing products, which is somewhat of a strategic change, right, because you guys have always been focused on 300-millimeter analog product. So is TI bringing embedded in-house because you have some sort of competitive differentiators on the manufacturing side for your next-generation embedded portfolio? Or is it just a focus on lower cost versus outsourcing and moving the manufacturing mix towards more in-sourced over time?",92
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876464.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,38,"Yes, I'll start, and Rafael, if you want to add, please do. If you look, we do manufacture embedded today and DMOS6. So part of our manufacturing footprint today includes embedded. And so with the Lehi factory, we will be able to build additional products there. And I would say, over time, foundry will continue to be a portion of our footprint. But as our revenue grows as a percentage of revenue, could that move some, but it could. But we will continue to build products, both internally and externally. And I'll just say that as we invest in 300-millimeter, both for analog and embedded, that brings the same cost advantages to us. It allows better control of our supply chain. And certainly, in periods like this, it shows why that that's an important advantage for us. So okay. Thank you, Harlan. And I think we've got time for one more caller.",152

And specifically in auto, there is a lot of concern, it has been for more than a couple of quarters, about semi components going into the industry and the auto units, the big gap. And if I look at your automotive, the year-over-year change, at least a rapid -- I think it was up 2x a couple of quarters ago. That seems to be decelerating. So can you just help us kind of -- seems to be some parts of forward, but the concern is that the supply chain collectively is holding up on a lot of inventory. So just with -- I'd love to get your perspective. And Dave, I think last quarter, you had given us a pre-pandemic level, and you had kind of contrasted what you shipped last quarter versus that number.",145
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876467.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,41,"Yes. So Ambrish, maybe I'll start, and Rafael, if you want to add to it. And first, I'll just make a comment that our team has done a good job supporting customers really across all of our end markets. When we look at that pre-pandemic level of fourth quarter of '19 and just picking that to fourth quarter '21, revenue overall is up 40%. And we grew shipments in all of our end markets. So I think that that's important to point out. So we believe inside of that, we've made strategic progress in industrial and in automotive that will pay dividends for us for years ahead. But our teams really have done a great job supporting customers across that board. 
And some of those year-on-year transitions, Ambrish, as you know, some of those really big numbers. I think 1 quarter, we had close to 100%, maybe even above that. That was more of a function of how low shipments have gotten the quarter before. So that's where I talk about when things get really noisy, you really have to begin to look at it over these longer periods of time. But I think that that's a really good number to look at for our overall shipments. So do you have a follow-up to that, Ambrish?",216
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876468.0,Question,Ambrish Srivastava,,Analysts,42,"I had a separate follow-up, Dave. I've never seen a -- such a broad mention of a TI chip being short as PMIC. And it started with PCs. Now we hear from pretty much every end market. Everybody is pointing the TI. The question I get from investors, and I have it myself as well, so I don't want to just say from investors, just how did TI -- you guys are -- at least I hold you at the pedestal in terms of ops, planning, supply chain management. How did you guys get through that point where one part -- and I know it's a small piece of your overall business. But more importantly, how do you convince us that this does not translate into potential share losses when people start to design you out potentially because this time, several quarters, you couldn't supply the part?",148
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2022",2022-01-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2322.0,2477142.0,93876469.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,43,"Yes. Fair question, Ambrish. And I'd point to maybe a couple of things. First, I'd point that we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry. When we engage with customers, it's not unusual for us to have a dozen, 2 dozen, sometimes 3, 4 dozen different components shipped or on any particular design in any particular system. So it only takes one of those products to -- for our teams to have to work closely with that customer on. And as I talked about before, our teams have really done a great job supporting customers across the board, across those products. And that's what we'll continue to focus on. 
I think as we look to this year, we've got capacity coming online later this year with RFAB 2 and those investments that Rafael talked about, we're putting in capacity. Every quarter this year, we've put in capacity, every quarter last year incrementally. So you see that showing up in our results. And then we've got -- follow that up with the Lehi fab in early 2023. So I think we're in a really good position to continue to support our customers overall. So we'll continue to work really hard at that and deliver the results that follow with that. 
So with that, I'd like to remind everyone of our upcoming capital management call. And it is on February 3 at 10 a.m. Central Time. And a replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening.",249

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into first quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for second quarter, including the impact from COVID-19 restrictions in China.
Starting with a quick overview of first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $4.9 billion, an increase of 2% sequentially and 14% year-over-year driven by growth in industrial and automotive as well as enterprise systems. Analog revenue grew 16%, Embedded Processing grew 2%, and our Other segment grew 27% from the year ago quarter.
Now let me comment on the environment in the first quarter to provide some context on what we saw with our customers and markets. Overall, the quarter came in about as we expected across product segments, end markets and geographies. The market environment in the first quarter was similar to what we've observed for the last several quarters. Customers continued to be selective in their expedite requests, focusing on products that completed a match set rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior was not specific to any product family, end market or geography.
Moving on, I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end market from the year ago quarter. First, the industrial and automotive markets were each up about 20% and both were driven by broad-based growth across sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-single digits off a strong compare. And next, communications equipment was up about 10%. And finally, Enterprise systems was up about 35% off of a weak compare, and the growth was primarily from data centers and enterprise computing.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",420

As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.4 billion or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 500 basis points. As a reminder, we had about $50 million of additional utility expenses in cost of revenue related to the winter storm in the year ago quarter.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $830 million, about flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $66 million in the first quarter and are associated with the LFAB purchase we closed in October of last year. Operating profit was $2.6 billion in the quarter or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 32% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $2.2 billion, or $2.35 per share, which included a $0.02 benefit that was not in our prior outlook.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $443 million in the quarter and $2.6 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.5 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $589 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $5 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $9.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.8 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. Inventory dollars were up $150 million from the prior quarter, to $2.1 billion, and days were 127, up 11 days sequentially but still below desired levels.
For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.84 to $2.26. This outlook comprehends an impact due to reduced demand from COVID-19 restrictions in China, which are affecting our customers' manufacturing operations. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate for 2022 to be about 14% and our effective tax rate to be about a point lower.
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We'll continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",488

Do you have any view for like what demand would be if you could ship? And like are the customers like getting out of line at all? Or is the overall demand and order environment like kind of where it was, you just can't ship? But any color you can give on the size of that gap would be helpful.",88

I'll comment on that. Our assessment in early April indicated that revenue would continue to incrementally grow again in the second quarter. However, it just became clear that we were experiencing lower demand, particularly due to COVID-19 restrictions in China. And just to be clear, customer's behavior wasn't changing as it related to backlog or cancellations. In fact, we continued to see expedites for deliveries. However, we did see that our customers' manufacturing operations were being impacted.
So as a result, the approach that we took, we just took a tops-down assessment and just reduced the midpoint of second quarter by 10% and so from roughly $5 billion at the midpoint, to the $4.5 billion that you see. And the second thing we did was we slightly widened the range just to comprehend the higher uncertainty that we're seeing overall. Do you have a follow-up, Stacy?",148

And that's helpful. Just wondering, the fact that you guys have mostly internal manufacturing and you're trying to go most direct, does that imply that, I mean, you have to ship more direct to your customers in China?

Do you think this is something you can recover? Is this demand destruction, or is this something you can recover?

Again, the approach that we took was really just a tops-down 10% assessment of what the impact would be. So I wouldn't look at that as any precision in choosing that number, part of the reason why we widened the guidance.
I think trying to get into predictions of what could happen as the quarter unfolds, I think time will tell, and we'll see how that unfolds and we'll report that when the quarter is over. So that's really the approach that we took at trying to assess what was going on. Do you have a follow-on?",99

So how are you managing your fab utilization and your inventory? It seems like you're implying gross margins down a few hundred basis points sequentially. So just curious how you are managing fab utilization because I thought I heard Rafael say that you are still below your target inventory level. So do you continue to plan and build more inventory during the quarter?,64
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2032.0,2543987.0,96205925.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,13,"Yes. So a couple of things in that question. Let me try to address most of them. We -- our factories are running at high levels of utilization as they have been over the last couple of years really. We've continued -- in fact, we've continued adding incremental capacity, as we have said we would. And the next step beyond incremental will be once RFAB2 starts production in the second half of the year and then LFAB in the first quarter of next year, of 2023, while at the same time, we're breaking ground later this year for the Sherman factory.
So we're going to continue running our production high. We are going to build inventory. Inventory did build about $150 million in this last quarter we just reported, but we're still below desired levels. So our intent is to continue building that inventory that is -- our objective in inventory, as you know, is to maintain high levels of customer service. And roughly, our target is 130 to 190 days, but we want to be at the high end of that and we would not be uncomfortable even above the high end of that range.",196

But to the extent there are shortages across the industry and demand elsewhere, it doesn't sound like it's changed, from part of your preamble, Dave. Why wouldn't this allow a little bit of the fungibility of your standard product shipments to just increase to those customers and shortages to make up for the shortfall that you're otherwise going to see in China?",84

We -- our processes allow for that redirecting of inventory. But keep in mind, we're talking about 100,000 different parts -- 100,000 different customers, 80,000 different parts, so it never quite fits in a perfect situation where the excess in one place can go to the other places neatly, right?

And maybe I'll just add to that too, Ross. The behavior that we've talked about now for a couple of quarters, that we've been seeing as customers being more focused on match sets, and that can be symptomatic of growing customer inventory that's out of mix.

The quarter came in, I would say, about what we expected. We were just slightly above the top end of our range overall. The quarter was driven by the industrial and automotive markets. We did see a strong growth in enterprise systems as we had talked about. That was primarily from data center and enterprise computing. Now that's a small part of our revenue, but you saw it grow strongly last quarter.
And as you look over the coming years, that probably will continue to be a strong grower, but it's just not a very large portion of our revenue. So we continue to be pleased with the growth that we're seeing in industrial and automotive. That -- when you zoom out for a second, that is where the strategic focus has been for the company.

First, I want to maybe adjust what -- your premise a little bit. We are still seeing some expedites. But as Dave mentioned a couple of times, customers continue to be selective in how they're expedited. So they're continuing to focus on the match set, okay? So it's not just expedite across the board. Second, specifically on what you said, on your second -- the second part of your question, what we're seeing is primarily based on the -- how our customers' manufacturing operation is -- are being affected in China.",95

So I think your question more, Joe, is where we do have constraints, what's driving those. And that's not specific to any product or any particular area. It can move from 1 quarter to the other. It may be a process technology. It could be a packaging technology, other things that may drive it, that our teams work with customers on to meet those needs. Do you have a follow-on?",83

I also was curious about pricing to the extent that your competition has kind of passed along foundry price increases and has raised prices. How have you guys reacted to that? And do you have -- can you give us any sense for what your pricing has done on a like-for-like basis?,53
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2022",2022-04-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2032.0,2543987.0,96205942.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,30,"Yes. So a couple of things. First, on the input cost side of things, part of our -- one of our competitive advantages is manufacturing technology. We own the vast majority of our manufacturing, in fact, on the front end, over 80%. And our goal is to grow that to 90% over the coming years. So that puts us in a really good situation to not be beholden by -- to the mercy of what those foundries or subcons do in terms of pricing, right? So we have a much better way to handle those input costs. So that's on the input cost side of things.
On the pricing, in general, we -- our pricing with our customers, our process on that has not changed. Our process is to price to market. And as prices have moved up over the last 2 or 3 quarters, and that certainly did happen in first quarter, we have moved our prices as well. And growth in first quarter did benefit from the pricing tailwind.",171

Maybe as my second -- yes, yes. Thanks, Dave. So I guess, my second question is, this is a question that Ross asked before. But if customers are so tight and if the lockdowns are certainly going to be transitory, I would think, it seems like customers would just take the product and they would put it into inventory.
So obviously, during the past 3 weeks, you opted to take this big cut to guidance. But is that because they're pushing out shipments? Or is it because they just can't accept shipment of your product? I mean it seems like it has to be the latter versus them pushing out shipments or not pulling from consignment because everything is tight and the whole chain is trying to build inventory.",131

Yes. And Tim, I think we've talked about now for a couple of quarters that we've observed behavior where customers' behavior really shifted to focusing on those match sets. And as we've talked about, that can be symptomatic of growing customer inventory that's just not a mix, right?
So -- and with that, we've got tens of thousands of products that are immediately available on ti.com. So they can get more product if they wanted and if they're indiscriminate of the types of products that they need. But increasingly, they're trying to find those match sets to complete those bills.
Whether that's our product, in some cases, a lot of times, it's our peers' products in the industry, and sometimes, it's maybe not even a semiconductor product that they need to complete their system to get it out the door. So yes, so just to say just because you have a product sitting there, customers just indiscriminately aren't taking product overall.",162

And Tim, if I understood your question correctly, you're asking tactically of whether the customers -- where is the bottleneck for the customers in China not being able to run their operations. We're seeing cases where factories are shut down, and they just will not accept -- they cannot accept deliveries.
In other cases, the freight forwarders will not take our parts from our distribution centers to ship them to the factories in China, particularly in the Shanghai area, because those are shut down. So tactically, that is what's keeping -- the primary reason why we took this adjustment because that's keeping our parts from being delivered to the...",115

And I just want to ask it maybe in a little bit more of a detailed fashion. When we talk about the disruptions in China, are you -- maybe you can just provide a bit more detail. Are you not shipping to the region as a whole? Or are you taking this on a customer-by-customer basis in terms of what you're choosing to -- or in terms of what you're able to ship?
And then the follow-up is related to that, we've heard at least one large automotive OEM talk about having opened up their facility recently and ramping with a vengeance. And I wonder if you see this among customers more broadly, or is that an exception.",126

So I'll give you my take. It is case by case. There's at least, just on a report, dozens if not hundreds of factories that are shut down, but there are other hundreds that are operating at different levels, right? Some -- and some cities are affected more than others.
Obviously, Shanghai, we've all read in the news what's going on there, and factories in that area are affected more. And -- but there are restrictions beyond Shanghai. But it's case by case.

The other thing I would add is as we have seen in other cases during the entire pandemic, but being able to ship direct and have the direct relationship with customers, it was just a huge advantage. Especially when you face these type of challenges, just not having an intermediary that kind of, frankly, most of the time, gets in the way, and it's not optimal for your relationship with the customer, but also there's the tactical operational delivery of products. So whether it's ti.com or non-ti.com legacy shipments are going direct, it's a huge benefit being able to do that. Now close to 70% of our revenue is direct.",111

You're pretty clear about your plans with the capital allocation today. I guess the spend in March is a little bit kind of flat at that kind of base level for, as you said, Lehi.

So a couple of angles on your question. First, no changes to our plans. These are long-term plans. So our -- in terms of CapEx, so our $2.5 billion per year for the next 4 years, that is intact. We're very excited about those. I'm very excited about those. We are -- RFAB2 will ramp production in the second half of this year. Lehi will qualify in rent production in the first quarter of next year. In just a matter of weeks, or a month or so, we're going to break ground in Sherman. So that's all very exciting and that is not changing.
Maybe the first part of your question, on the CapEx, short term, -- just keep in mind that the fourth quarter CapEx had the Lehi numbers there. So that -- that's why that number was higher, and now you're seeing that number come down in the first quarter. That's just we had about $800 million -- close to $900 million worth of CapEx. But our plans, the $2.5 billion run rate per year for '22, '23, '24, '25, of course, that's just an average. But that is still -- that is in place, and we're very excited about that.",204

So just to explain that. Customers that -- where their operations are being impacted, they would still like that product. And so they are not canceling those orders. They would still like to be in line and get that product as soon as they can take it. So that's what they're communicating to us from that. So that's why we're not -- that's not showing up as a cancellation though we are seeing the demand being impacted at this point.",81

While we strive to achieve our objective, we'll continue to pursue our 3 ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor.

Today's call is being recorded. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined with our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi.  
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.  
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.  
Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the third quarter of 2022.  
Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 6% sequentially and 14% year-over-year driven by growth across markets. Analog revenue grew 15%. Embedded Processing grew 5%, and our Other segment grew 19% from the year-ago quarter.  
Now let me comment on the environment in the second quarter to provide some context of what we saw with our customers and markets. As we spoke about in our last earnings call, April started out weak from COVID-19 restrictions in China. As those restrictions began to ease towards the latter part of May and into June, customers began to pull product generally consistent with their prior demand forecast at the start of the quarter.  
Moving on, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market from the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial market was up high single digits, and the automotive market was up more than 20%. We saw weakness throughout the quarter in personal electronics, which grew low single digits. Next, communications equipment was up about 25%. And finally, enterprise systems was up mid-teens.  
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",377

As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $836 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $66 million in the second quarter and are associated with the LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. Operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 23% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $2.3 billion or $2.45 per share.  
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and $2.8 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion.  
In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $6.2 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We retired $0.5 billion of debt in the quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.7%. Inventory dollars were up $139 million from the prior quarter to $2.2 billion. And days were 125, down 2 days sequentially and below desired levels. Accounts receivable for this quarter ended at $2.2 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago. This increase primarily reflects the higher proportion of shipments made near the end of the quarter as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in China and customers began pulling product.  
For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.51. This outlook comprehends the weaker demand we see, particularly from customers in the personal electronics market. We expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%.  
Lastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February capital management call, and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. We broke ground on the Sherman manufacturing complex in May. And work continues at RFAB2 and LFAB to prepare for production output.  
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",530

So they declined -- they were very strong objectively, but they declined sequentially from Q1 to Q2 even as revenue grew. And then I know you don't guide gross margins for next quarter, but if I sort of like squint at the math, they seem to be being guided down probably a little more than revenues. I'm just wondering if something is going on whether on the cost line or on the pricing line in this environment that may be influencing gross margins at all.",97

So first, as you pointed out, our gross margin in second quarter was about 70%. We are pleased with that performance. The fall-through on a year-on-year basis was almost 90%. I would also point out that -- and you can see this in our cash flow statement, depreciation increased sequentially by about $30 million. And that's the direct result of the investments in manufacturing capacity. On your second part of your question on a go-forward basis, as expected, depreciation is going to increase. We've talked about that in the February call. To help you, I'll tell you that for 2022, we expect depreciation to be about $1 billion for the full year. Do you have a follow-up?",124

It sounds like you had a surge in demand at the end of Q2 as everything opened up. So I guess that's leading into Q3. I'm just wondering if the shape of the revenue, the linearity through Q3 kind of looks the reverse of what we saw in Q2. We had a weak start and a strong finish in Q2. Do you think we have like a stronger start and then maybe a weaker finish into Q3 just given the, I guess, the demand surge that we got going into it?",93

So those shipments were scheduled earlier in the quarter, so really were reflective of the restrictions lifting and our ability to -- and customers' ability to be able to receive that product. So you have that noise going into it. But as we said in the prepared remarks that we did see weakness in the personal electronics market. And that weakness is comprehended in the guidance in third quarter.",90

So my follow-up is actually on free cash flow. If I go back to calendar '20, TI's free cash flow was 38% of sales. Last year, it was 34%. Now on a trailing 12-month basis, it's just 30%. And then you're guiding down Q3 below seasonal, and Q4 and Q1 tend to be below that also. And then you mentioned that you're committed to your CapEx plans. So is this a fair representation of how you think about free cash flow margins that we should just expect free cash flow margins to be at the lower end of the target range for the near to medium term?",113
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2022",2022-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,1999.0,2604727.0,98239129.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,12,"I'll take that question to few angles. First, tactically, second quarter, as we pointed out, was the revenue came in late in the quarter or a disproportionate amount of the revenue came in late. So that means that a lot of the cash was stuck in accounts receivable, as I talked about in the prepared remarks. So that's going to distort some of your trends from a cash flow standpoint a little bit.  
Beyond that big picture, we are very excited about these investments in manufacturing and technology. They're going to continue to position us well for the long term, giving us the manufacturing platform that's needed to support revenue growth. And that will have a CapEx increase, as we have talked about in February. In fact, at that time, we talked about for the next 4 years from 2022 to 2025 an average CapEx that's an average of $3.5 billion per year. For this year, it looks like we're going to be coming in at about $2.5 billion, about as expected. It could come in a little higher than that. And then obviously, since the average is $3.5 billion, you would expect the subsequent years to be incoming higher than that number.",204

You have a bunch of new facilities that are coming online. You talked about breaking ground in Sherman. But before that, you have RFAB2, and then you have LFAB. So can you just talk to us about when does that capacity come online where it can be a tailwind to revenue? And how should we think about the depreciation from those rolling in, acknowledging, of course, that, Rafael, you just told us we're going to have $1 billion for depreciation for this year as a whole?",97
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2022",2022-07-26,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,1999.0,2604727.0,98239132.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,15,"Correct. Correct. So first, as I talked about earlier, very excited about this investment. RFAB2 and LFAB, we're going to have RFAB2 sometime in the second half of this year supporting production and LFAB early '23. And then we -- on Sherman, we just broke ground on that a couple of months ago. And we expect the Sherman facility, the first factory there, to support revenue in 2025. So that's how you want to think about it.  
From a depreciation standpoint, I just gave you the $1 billion for this year. Beyond that, and I had already given you in February to expect about $2.5 billion of depreciation by 2025. And then from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, you can roughly approximate that linearly between the end of 2022 to 2025 to get to model how depreciation will likely come in.",141

The numbers that we have given you over the last 6 months or prior did not include any benefits from any of those bills. On the CHIPS Act specifically, it's great to see strong bipartisan support of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing that will boost domestic chip production and improve the industry's ability to remain competitive. These provisions will be meaningful and support our manufacturing, our road map. That bill hasn't passed yet. So when it passes, we'll be analyzing that. And as we assess the benefit that we'll get from that, and we should be a beneficiary from both of the grant portion and the investment tax rate portion. But as we assess that in more detail, we'll provide you updates as appropriate.",124

I would say, as we said in the prepared remarks, Joe, that customers were generally pulling with their original demand forecast, right? So meaning that as we looked at what was going on, we started the quarter, we were tracking lower. But as we talked about last quarter, customers weren't canceling orders. They weren't rescheduling. They still wanted to have that product. So that's really what made up the majority of that -- where we came in for the quarter. Does that help?",84

And then if you could just characterize your customers' kind of mentalities around inventories at this point. Obviously, we've been dealing with hot spots and tight conditions for a while. Do you feel like your customers in industrial and automotive markets are looking to build buffer stock inventory so that this is -- but again, just kind of how are people thinking about that?",67

I think many have reported, and we can see in the filings that our customers have had that there's clear signs of inventory being built over the last several quarters. And there is discussions on how much inventory do they hold more permanently and those types of things. We'll see how that behavior changes over time. I think there are some places where that probably will stick and probably some places where it won't. But I think the most important thing when we look at it because we won't manage our customers' inventory, but we can manage what we do. And we've long believed that owning and controlling our inventory is really a strategic advantage. 
So you've seen us take those actions over time. We finished the quarter with just a little over $2 billion of inventory. So whenever things do weaken, we'll take that time to replenish inventories that will keep lead times stable and low. And those are the best things that we can control and what we'll do as we move through the next few quarters.",180

That's what we can control, right? So we'll be increasing that with RFAB2 coming online soon, LFAB shortly after that and then in 2025, the first of the 4 factories in Sherman. So that will increase our ability to supply the market. 
And by the way, as you can see, we just put out a $5.2 billion of revenue and grew inventory again for, I believe, the fourth consecutive quarter. So that gives you also a sense of the increased ability that we're developing to supply the market.",96

First, on your pricing strategy going forward, just curious with RFAB2 ramping and LFAB ramping over the next 12 to 18 months and your peers much more supply constrained than you are, and they're all sort of facing inflationary pressures from their foundry partners, is there an opportunity for you to be a little bit more aggressive than historical trends and for you to pursue market share? Or would you look to follow suit and raise pricing along with your peers going forward?",88

I would say, as you've seen us behave in the past, our approach to pricing hasn't changed. Those pricing decisions are made at the product line level. We've got about 65 different product lines. So they're close to customers, close to the market, understand what their peers in the industry are doing. And to your point, many of our peers in the market that are outsourced, they do have to take action when they see pricing increases from their suppliers. So I think that just emphasizes the competitive advantage we have in manufacturing and technology and continues to highlight that and part of the reason why we're continuing to invest to strengthen that competitive advantage. Do you have a follow-on?",126

They're down 3% versus last year. They're down slightly sequentially.

What I would tell you the -- given our manufacturing process, the parts start as web, then they go to chips, then they go to finished goods. Overall inventory has been good as I pointed out over the last 4 quarters, this last quarter, $140 million.
But as you said, finished goods is still lean. Our goal is for inventory to continue to grow. We have talked about a target of 130 to 190 days. And as I have said before, I would not be uncomfortable to be at the high end of that range because ultimately, that inventory gives us just tremendous optionality, puts us in a really good position to support customers. 
And just given our business model, the -- lessens risk on that inventory is nil because that inventory goes to support products that sell to many, many customers and have very long lives. So we feel comfortable increasing inventory for that reason.",157

And let me just add that, Harlan, part of your question was that is that a reflection of direct customers. I just remind that we have 70% -- or actually last year around 70% of our revenue is direct. That includes revenue going through ti.com, which we still believe is going to be a significant strategic asset for us as we move forward.
And what goes through distribution, to my prior comment, we long believe that owning -- controlling that inventory is important. We're probably running 2 weeks or less than that inside of that. So when we ship revenue because we're owning and controlling that inventory, it really is reflective of what customers want inside of that quarter. So do you have a follow-on?",126

On the depreciation guide for the year, roughly up 35% half-on-half.

Is that kind of a ballpark kind of estimate, and maybe it comes in more like [ 9 25, 9 50 ] or just trying to understand the moving parts there, given that it's qualification of wafers, revenue of wafers, which sounds like it's really going to be later Q4 that really starts.",87

So we're just cautious to give a specific number as we look at it. We've got -- if you just took units and divided by revenue, that would give you an average price, which is what SIA is doing. We've got customers that are buying through ti.com. They're enjoying the convenience of having product that's immediately available. And in some regions, we're doing shipments more than once a day to the docks of those customers. So there's a convenience that they're enjoying. They pay a higher price for that. But -- so you've got that amount mixing in. So there's other factors besides that. There's mix in the types of products that we ship. We have products that we sell for a couple of pennies and products that we sell for thousands of dollars each. And depending on either end of that spectrum, it can move your ASP or your average selling price around. 
But that said, an environment like we've seen over the last several quarters just in price increases that customers for like-on-like product that we have seen that benefit as well. I'm sorry, I can't be more specific.",192

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi.  
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded, and you'll be able to get it via replay on our website.  
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.  
Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter's revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will come to results and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022.  
Starting with a quick overview of the third quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $5.2 billion, an increase of 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue grew 13%. Embedded Processing grew 11%, and our Other segment grew 20% from the year ago quarter.  
Now I'll provide some insight into third quarter revenue by market. This quarter, I'll focus on our sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, personal electronics declined mid-teens as we continue to see the weakness we described in the second quarter. Industrial was about even sequentially as we saw weakness begin to broaden in the industrial market. The automotive market remains strong and was about 10%.  
Next, communications equipment was up high single digits. And finally, enterprise systems was up mid-single digits.  
Turning to our expectations for the fourth. We expect that most of our end markets will decline sequentially with the exception of the automotive market. Lastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February capital management call and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. 
Customers especially value the geopolitically dependable footprint of our manufacturing additions. We are now in production in RFAB2 and expect production in LFAB later this year. In addition, construction of SM-1 and SM-2 in Sherman, Texas continues as planned.  
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",435

As Dave mentioned, third quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion or 69% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 110 basis points.  
Operating expenses in the quarter were $862 million, up 8% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.3 billion or 16% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $77 million in the third quarter and are associated with a LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. These charges will move to cost of revenue as we start production. The assets associated with the acquisition of the factory will begin to depreciate at the same time.  
Moving on, operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter or 51% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year ago quarter. [ Net income ] in the third quarter was $2.3 billion or $2.47 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance.  
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $790 million in the quarter and $3.1 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion.  
In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.1 billion in the past 12 months. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 8%, marking our 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. We also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $15 billion. These actions reflect our commitment to return of free cash flow to our owners.  
Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we issued $700 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.8%.  
Inventory dollars were up $205 million from the prior quarter to $2.4 billion, and days were 133, up 8 days sequentially and below the higher levels.  
For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $2. This outlook comprehends the market conditions that Dave previously mentioned.  
We continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2023, without additional changes to tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain above what it is in 2022 with a similar quarterly profile.  
Let me now make a few comments on the CHIPS Act that was recently signed-in to law. The combination of the investment tax credit, the grant as well as funding for research and development will help make the U.S. semiconductor industry more competitive. We accrued about $50 million on the balance sheet in third quarter due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow some statement as lower depreciation and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future.  
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow growth over the long-term.  
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",635

So on the first part, Tim, we didn't see really anything different between the direct business back going through distribution. As you know, we have had an effort over the past few years to have direct -- close-to-direct relationships with our customers. So the amount of revenue going through distribution is much lower today. So probably only about 30% of our revenue actually goes through distribution. We did see cancellations increased in the quarters just as customers work to align the backlog to their needs.

I know it's a little bit further out, but I just wanted to check what you're seeing in terms of consumer right now.

If you look at the market overall, personal electronics, a little more than 50% of the semiconductor market without memory. So we have less than half of the exposure there.
If you look at industrial and automotive, that makes up 62% of our revenues. And inside of the market, that's 26% of the market. So we're really highly exposed to both industrial and automotive, and that's not by accident, is probably more than a decade ago, we began allocating more of our resources to automotive and industrial and the emphasis there. So we're very pleased with our exposure. And we believe that, that will be there just will be more content added into those systems. 
Now that said, there's great opportunities inside of personal electronics, communications equipment and enterprise systems in the decades ahead. but we'll just have those secular tailwinds more than average inside of industrial and automotive. 
Do you have a follow-on, Vivek.",176

And interestingly, you're suggesting it can grow again in Q4. What's your sense of kind of the supply-demand balance in automotive among your Tier 1 and then the auto OEM customers? Many investors are concerned that this kind of rolling correction that we are seeing in semi is going to eventually hit automotive, which has been a very strong area over the last 1 to 2 years. So what's your sense of what kind of the supply-demand balance is in this automotive end market?",102

I'd say first, I think when you look at the secular trends inside of automotive, I think all of us know that it will be a great grower for us, and we're investing very broadly. So we're just thrilled with the position. 
If you look at second quarter of 2020, our growth there has, off the bottom been very, very strong. Will that market eventually roll over? It will. I mean that's just what happens. And we're not trying to predict when that will happen, we'll continue to ship product to customers as they request it. And we're really focused on making sure we've got capacity in place for them over the long-term. So we're not really trying to worry about when that will happen.

Did anything change materially through the quarter? Anything you can give us on linearity or by geography. As we think about what's baked into the guide, is it more, I guess, conservatism on the macro? Or was there really a material change in your customers' order patterns?",56

I would say if you look at the third quarter results across the board and also inclusive of industrial, the quarter came in as we expected. If you look at -- and even sequential is not unusual inside of industrial. That's about what we were expecting. 
But as we described it, the weakness began to broaden into that. So there wasn't one place that we could put the finger on to say it was one thing or one group of customers, but we did see just different signals inside of there that is leading us to that conclusion that it is -- that weakness is broadening. And in fact, we expect that weakness to broaden into most of the other markets as well as we move into fourth quarter, of course, with the exception of auto. 
So that's really what we're seeing. It's order rates. If you look at order rates quarter-to-date, they are, of course, consistent with our outlook, but they are weak quarter-to-date. And so it's those types of signals that are leading to the outlook. And really, those are the types of signals that really best inform what our shipments in the quarter and in the short term are going to be.  
Do you have a follow-up, Joshua?",217

That's very helpful. I also wanted to clarify the comments on the CHIPS Act. You mentioned $50 million was accrued on the balance sheet. Was that from the investment tax credit only? Because I know there's a second bucket for manufacturing incentives. And if not, when should -- when would you expect to, I guess, get more clarity on how much you'll be able to accrue for the manufacturing incentive portion of the CHIPS Act?",76
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2022",2022-10-25,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2531.0,2662795.0,100179066.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,15,"Yes. So first, let me step back. Big picture, the combination of the investment actually the grant as well as the funding for research and development will help. U.S. semiconductor are more competitive. We accrued the $50 million that we talked about in the prepared remarks that you referred to, that was for the 25% investment tax credit that is for manufacturing assets that will go into service in 2023 and beyond. And that is -- that was for $200 million. So 1/4 of that is what we accrued that we will receive from the government at some point in the future as lower taxes. 
But in the P&L, it flows. It will flow through lower depreciation. I think maybe what you're referring to when you talk about manufacturing is the grant portion. Is that what you're referring to? 
Well, maybe we'll answer them both. But if you are talking about the grant that is part of the CHIPS Act, but it's separate from the investment tax credit that remains to be seen as more. We will apply for those, the application window doesn't open until February. So we will apply for those. And as we learn more, we'll let you know. And big picture, when we get to February, the next capital management call, we will talk about the CHIPS Act, the overall investment will try to quantify that and what benefit we'll get. 
At the same time, since the last capital management call, our confidence around the long-term growth prospects in our industry, the secular trends that Dave talked about earlier. That confidence has only grown, so we feel really good about that. So we'll tell you about the net impact between those 2, the benefits of the CHIPS Act and the growing confidence at the next capital management call and any changes to our numbers based on that. So I think you dropped off.",317

So we don't have restrictions on those. Of course, there are restrictions specific to entities. There's the entity lease that you hear about, the FDPR, that's another list. And we, of course, follow all the regulations when it comes to that. So when an entity goes listed in there, we take that into account and restrict shipments as according to the law.

It's being in profit from operations the entire time all of this year. The first part of your question, big picture, we will give you an update in about 4 months at the capital management with all the puts and takes. But what I would tell you is that -- well, short-term, we expect our change -- our CapEx expectation for 2022 have not changed. That is $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion for this year; depreciation, about $1 billion for this year. I'm talking 2022. 
Bigger picture, as I said earlier, the CHIPS Act, great legislation. We're very excited about that. That is going to decrease on a net basis. our investment because we're going to get a 25% reduction from the investments that qualified and manufacturing investments in the United States. But on the other hand, as I alluded to earlier, our confidence around our long-term growth prospects have only grown over the last 6 to 12 months based on the secular trends based on input from our customers.

I wanted to ask about OpEx. So it's been running in the $800 million range, plus or minus, for quite a while. And frankly, people are wondering how you've been keeping it there. in such an inflationary environment. It is now ticking up, but it's ticking up as revenues are falling. 
I guess why is it increasing now where is it didn't increase before and what happens going forward? Because if I would just hold it flat on the revenue guide going forward to do something like 19% of revenue, so it is still below your kind of what you've talked about in terms of long-term targets for OpEx. So how do we think about that? Why is it growing now versus before? And how do we think about where the range might go going forward?",138

So here's how we think about it. Step back, for the last 5.5 years, really, we've been running OpEx on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how I prefer to look at it at $3.2 billion. Pretty consistently, we're really steady hand over that time. Our hiring has been very consistent during that time. And that is underpinned by our long-term expectations on growth. 
And inside of that, R&D has actually moved up. SG&A has moved down inside of that $3.2 billion, but it's been really consistent on that. This last quarter for the first time, it ticked up to $3.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. And I would expect that to continue ticking up over the next many quarters and years as we continue stepping up our investments. And that is, a, driven by the higher investments but, b, inflation is playing a factor. It's clearly wage inflation. We're not immune to that. So that is also affecting and will continue to affect those trends.",168

So I'm just kind of curious, and I guess we'll see what March brings, and I'm happy if you want to comment on that. But it seems like at least personal electronics is back to where you were in '19/'20. It seems like industrial is going to kind of get back there. 
And at that point, you're building inventories. You had more capacity than demand. So if we do go back to those levels and you're adding more capacity, I'm just trying to understand is still the view that you'll build inventory like you do in '19 and '20 and still roll out the capacity for the long-term.",134

Frankly, I didn't fully understand. You threw in several premises there. But let me just address it the best way I can. Levels and capacity. So capacity, we've been adding capacity incrementally for a number of quarters. Now RFAB2 is in production. Lehi is about to start production within a few months. So clearly, our incremental capacity is going up. 
At the same time, we've been increasing inventory very slowly. And now more recently, we added $200 million of inventory in this last quarter, but we are still below these higher levels. 
Okay. Keep in mind, our business model is such where we are targeting the vast major of our parts sell to many, many customers. So they're very broad in nature. The product life cycles of the parts is decades in many times. The products themselves last 10 years in inventory, most of them. So the risk of selection for the inventory is very, very low. The potential upside of having that inventory ready is very high. So that's why we prefer to have more than less inventory. 
So I would not be uncomfortable, as I said before, adding another $1 billion, $1.5 billion of inventory over the next several quarters to get us well positioned for the next upturn that invariably comes at some point.",223

I think -- as well documented, I think as we went through the pandemic, it had the deepest correction from a starting point standpoint. -- the mix of auto manufacturers to the high end. You've got EVs that are inside of those mix that are all adding to that to those secular trends. 
So I think that we're well positioned as we make investments across our businesses. We're investing in powertrain, which would include electric vehicles and hybrid. We're investing in ADAS systems. We're investing in infotainment systems. We're investing in body and lighting. That doesn't get talked about a lot on conference calls where we get excited about turn signals, as we do about BMS systems. And then we also invest in safety systems.

I think that whenever I'm asked that question, and it's always a lot more comfortable to be answering it when were up twice the rate of the market. You really need to look at it over a longer period of time. So look at the rate of growth of us versus the industry from fourth quarter of '19. I just picked that because it's a pre-pandemic number. And we look very, very good against those numbers. 
So we were, as you remember, as we went into the pandemic, we continued to build inventory. So the numbers initially looked very, very strong as customers pulled product from us. So when you look some of the sequentials were harder, and that's not making excuses. But when you look at our manufacturing footprint and how we're positioned, you look at the customer excitement around that manufacturing footprint and customers look at where that addition is coming and the geopolitical dependable locations of where that footprint is coming on.

No, I would tell you, we're very pleased with our gross margin performance. On a year-on-year basis, the third quarter that we just finished is -- the fall-through was close [indiscernible], and that is actually higher than the guidance that we've given on $70 million to $75 million. 
What I would point you to is, as you can see in the cash flow statement, depreciation is increasing sequentially -- has increased sequentially actually for a number of quarters. So this last quarter, $20-some million. Of course, that is a direct result of the CapEx investments that we're making. And so you should expect depreciation to continue ticking up. I said earlier in the call, we expect this year to be close to $1 billion. So you can obviously then do the math and get fourth quarter depreciation there. But clearly, that is ticking up and the bulk of that depreciation goes into cost of revenue.",156

I know you've talked about there being hotspots in the past few quarters. Has that gone now? Or your delinquencies kind of back to below normal levels? Or where are you out with that?,48

So we still do have hotspots in any market environment we've got hotspots, but we still do have them probably still most pronounced inside of automotive. Lead times didn't change much second quarter to third quarter. And at the same time, as we've talked about before, customers can get immediate availability of products on ti.com. So you have kind of all those dynamics going on. 
Do you have a follow-up, Joe.",72

We're hearing from some of your industrial and automotive customers desire to hold higher safety stock than what companies have historically held. Is that something that you guys see? Is that -- I mean, do you think it might affect TI? And just how do you think about that going forward? Do you think that's a normal state of affairs.",61

We've seen and heard and been in those discussions before. We know that some customers that are really taking a hard look at their supply chains, where their product is coming from, what technologies they're being built on, ensuring that they've got supply of those technologies. That's part of the reason why, when they look at product being built and the capacity we're putting in place at the 45 to 130 nanometer, they know they need that capacity for decades to come. So they get excited about when they see that capacity overall. 
But to change supply, the supply chains is really hard work. It will take a long time to be able to do it. And it's not oftentimes just as simple as carrying more inventory on the balance sheet. So there probably will be some of those customers that do that hard work and restructure the supply chains. And there probably will be some that once we get supply and demand imbalance, so it just kind of fall back into normal practices. So I think time will tell as that plays out. 
And Rafael, do you have...",190

No, I'll just add. At the end of the day, customers will do what they want to do, right? And of course, if they want to hold more inventory, they're welcome to do that. What we believe is that for us to hold more inventory, we're in a great position to do that, given the nature of that inventory that it's catalog in nature that can sell to many, many customers. So we're all better off, and our customers will be better off when we hold more of that inventory, and we can direct it where it's most needed. 
So that's why, as I said earlier, we -- our goal is to continue growing inventory. We're still below these higher levels, and we will add significantly more inventory over the quarters to come, be ready for the next upside.",140

In past quarters, I think maybe even a quarter ago, you talked about how percent of revenue from that channel had gone from less than 1% of sales to over 10%. I think that occurred in about a 1-year time frame. You just mentioned a moment ago, Dave, that this is the channel where customers can go for nearly immediate availability. 
So I would assume that they get that availability at a price and that when things start softening as you're alluding to on this call that perhaps that channel sees a more precipitous decline. Did we see that during the quarter? And do you anticipate that to happen in the coming quarter or 2?",122

Sort of along the same lines, there has been some speculation in the press, for example, that this has been a channel for companies that you might call brokers or some people call it the gray market of distribution to get their hands on TI product, and that perhaps there is still inventory that was acquired by such parties that is still sort of floating around and waiting to be sold on to end customers. I wonder whether you've found a better reason to maybe track that and measure it, and any observations you've made with regard to that?",100

And well, as you know, I spent 8 years in my career in sales, and there have always been brokers in our market. And as Rafael talked about, we've long believed that owning and controlling our inventory is a strategic advantage. 
So in having policies of like non-cancelable orders and things like that, as customers take product that they don't need, that's typically the source of that product going out the back door for brokers. So can brokers go on to ti.com and get products? They can. But that's pretty minimal in comparison to other sources that they might be able to get it. So overall, the majority of customers that we service are customers that we have large engagements with directly. And we'll go to the next caller please.",131

So again, we're not trying to provide guidance by quarter or by each market inside of that. We are Obviously, with the guide overall, it is a weaker fourth quarter than a typical fourth quarter. So with the exception of auto, as we've talked about, that we'll continue to see weakness inside of personal electronics, but we will see the other markets weaken as well. So we're not trying to get specific on that. So we'll finish up the quarter and report that out. But we do expect the weakness to broaden across those markets.

I guess as a follow-on question to China and obviously, you talked about very little impact from the embargo on your business.

But just curious how your thoughts are evolving for China as a competitor to you in the coming decades?",73

Dave, you want to chime in. But I would tell you, at the end of the day, it all comes down to our competitor advantages, right? And it starts with the broad portfolio that we have in the Analog and Embedded space, you need a huge portfolio to compete effectively, particularly in industrial and automotive. And we have 80,000 or so parts that we sell to 100,000 different customers. So you need that type of diversity. 
Then second is manufacturing and technology. These investments that are positioned 300-millimeter, first, but then all the investments that we're making are just building on that, right? So we have RFAB2 coming, that just came online. Our new factory in Lehi and the mega site that we just broke ground in Sherman that's going to have 4 factories, each one the size of RFAB2. So that really puts us in a in a very strong position to compete against anyone, whether it's in the United States or in China, okay.",169
