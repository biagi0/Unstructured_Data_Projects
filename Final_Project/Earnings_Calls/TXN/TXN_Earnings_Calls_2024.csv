I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'd like to provide some information that's important for your calendars. Next week, on Thursday, February 1, at 10 a.m. Central Time, we'll have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and our approach to capital allocation as we prepare for the opportunity ahead. Moving on, today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. I'll then provide an annual summary of revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2024. 
Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 13% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue declined 12% year-over-year and Embedded Processing declined 10%. Our Other segment declined 25% from the year ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. Our results reflect increasing weakness in industrial and a sequential decline in automotive as customers work to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-teens as we saw that increasing weakness. The automotive market was down mid-single digits after 3.5 years of very strong growth. Personal electronics was about flat. And next, communications equipment was down low single digits. And lastly, Enterprise Systems grew low single digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market. 
As a percentage of revenue for 2023, Industrial was 40%, automotive was 34%, Personal Electronics 15%, Communications Equipment 5%, Enterprise Systems 4% and other was 2%. In 2023, industrial and automotive combined made up 74% of TI's revenue, up about 9 percentage points from 2022 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to Analog and Embedded technologies to make their end products more reliable, more affordable and lower empower. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",557

As Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.1 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.4 billion or 60% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansions and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 650 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $898 million, up 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 21% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.5 billion in the quarter or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 30% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.49 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $65 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter. marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $4.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4 billion, up $91 million from the prior quarter, and days were 219, up 14 days sequentially. 
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2023, cash flow from operations was $6.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $5.1 billion. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.3 billion or 8% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model as well as our decisions to invest in 300-millimeter manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook, for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.16. 
We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",501

I think at the midpoint, you're guiding revenue down 12% or so, which is clearly well below what we consider to be typical seasonality. Any end markets or regions or device types that you can call out that's driving that view? Or is it broad-based weakness across all applications.",56

Thanks for the question. In fourth quarter, we did see weakness in industrial increasing weakness there. We saw the sequential decline in automotive. And as the guide would suggest we believe that we'll just continue to operate in a weak environment and one where customers are continuing to rebalance their inventories overall. So -- but nothing specific to comment on. Do you have a follow-up?",70
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2024",2024-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2383.0,3002065.0,109784980.0,Question,Toshiya Hari,,Analysts,6,"I do. Just on gross margins, I think you guys did a good job in explaining what's driving it. Still, I'm a little bit surprised with the year-over-year kind of drop through, if you will, gross margin dollars essentially dropping as much as your revenue. I understand the underutilization, the increase in depreciation. But what are you seeing from a pricing perspective? Is it more pricing than volume that's driving the revenue decline and the decline in gross margins? Or if you can kind of speak to your strategy from a pricing perspective, what you're seeing in the marketplace, that would be helpful.",103
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2024",2024-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2383.0,3002065.0,109784981.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,7,"Yes. Toshiya, and I'll remind everyone else, I know you know the industry well. But pricing just doesn't move quickly in our markets overall. And nor is it the primary reason why a customer chooses our products. So -- and as we've mentioned before, our pricing strategy hasn't changed. And of course, we're always regularly monitoring the market and pricing our products appropriately. And as we've talked about now for, I think, a couple of quarters, as we expected supply and demand to come more in balance that we would expect pricing to revert back to how it's behaved over the last 10 or 20 years. And over the last 6 months or so, that's what we've seen. So somewhat of a low single-digit decline is what we're expecting out in time and I wouldn't describe that as unusual.",139

Dave, gross margin was down maybe 250 basis points. It's kind of implied to be down 250 basis points. Even if I strip out depreciation, it's down about 100 basis points from March. So it seems like utilization is coming down a bit. And CapEx also came in a little bit lower, too, for December. So the first question on that is, can you talk about loadings. Is March going to be the bottom in loadings and we should see inventory begin to come down also in March? And then I had a follow-up on that, too.",104

So thanks for the question. So step back in third quarter, at the end of the third quarter, we talked about this as we have near our inventory levels, then we have adjusted our factory loadings accordingly. So in third quarter, we did some of that, and that had an impact on gross margins and underutilization. Fourth quarter adjustment was bigger than third quarter. And now going into first quarter, we're taking that adjustment further. So the first quarter adjustment on the utilization will be will be bigger. But we continue to have an upward bias on inventory as we continue to build the right buffers for the right parts to be ready on the other side of the cycle. Do you have a follow-up?",126

Yes. So then on CapEx, can you talk about that? It was a little lower. It's running actually quite a bit below the $5 billion run rate now. So are you actually cutting CapEx now with -- since you're bringing on factory loading?",45

In fact, CapEx came in as expected, $5.1 billion, and we've been talking about $5 billion per year. So it was right on target. And you should expect and we expect to continue running at about $5 billion per year through 2026 as we complete the investment plans that we've been talking about.",56

So is the target, I guess, inventory level, has that not changed for you guys? And so do you expect utilization rates to bottom in Q1? Or do you think you might have some more inventory adjustments going into Q2 for TI?",50

No, thanks, Chris. So our -- broadly speaking, our inventory targets have not changed over the last 6, 9 months. through this cycle. So we still have some ways to go clearly less than we did 6 months ago. But we will still have some ways to go on that front. At one point, I talked about $4 billion to $4.5 billion worth of inventory. So that's in the ballpark. And we just finished just shy of $4 billion. But as far as when underutilization bottom, that's going to depend on revenue expectations and at this point, we're only -- as always, we only give 1 quarter at a time. So we'll see where we are 90 days from now, and we'll tell you about that.",127

It's -- we look at things like how many customers are buying the product, what the buying patterns look like, how long it takes us to manufacture of the product. So it's really a bottoms-up plan built on that very, very specifically. So that's what drives that target overall, and we want to have inventory positioned to support growth. over the long term. This is a side comment. So you have a follow-on, Chris?",88

I guess just a little bit of color on the end market commentary. Thanks for that. On the industrial side, it sounds like most of the downside is due to excess inventory, not demand. I was hoping you could confirm that. And then with automotive weakening, is there any reason why automotive wouldn't fall under the same issues that the industrial end markets/inventory would as well.",67
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2024",2024-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2383.0,3002065.0,109784992.0,Answer,Dave Pahl,,Executives,18,"Yes. So I'll start and then Rafael, if you want to add anything. I would say that the demand signals that we get from customers are orders that they place, whether that's either directly or through consignment fees. So that's the data that we can see. We actually can't see their inventory levels we can anecdotally as we see a market like personal electronics is down 30%, 40%. We know handsets and PCs that market hasn't gone down as much as that. So we know anecdotally that we're shipping below demand. So we believe that that's what's going on in industrial. 
We have customers who have told us that they have built inventory and plan to correct that. So having a real clear picture of what their demand looks like and their channel inventories look like isn't something that we can see directly overall. So -- and the comment on automotive. We know that customers there did want to build inventory. And we believe that they're in a good position now. So it wasn't surprising that we saw a sequential decline there. So thanks, Chris. We will go to our next caller please.",193

When you set out in the quarter baked into your expectations, where you're kind of looking at these 2 businesses both a little bit better than they came in or was one a bit worse than the other versus your expectations? And then just in terms of the timing of the quarter, it looks like your finished goods inventory went up a bit. more than your other buckets. And I just wanted to understand, is that just because later in the quarter, customers were signaling some weaker trends? Or is there any reason behind the dynamic there?",110

And Dave, do you want to take the first one, better. Second part, that's just a reflection of our ability to build those inventory buffers that we're talking about. And what you're seeing there is on the finished goods side. That's one, as Dave alluded to earlier, that's one set of targets that we have. That's at the finished goods level. Remember, we have 100,000 different parts. And the vast majority of those are what we call catalog, which means they sell to many, many customers. So we want to build certain finished good level for each one of those parts. But we're also building at the chip level. Think of a chip can go into 2, 3, 10 different finished goods. So it works out well to have some chip level inventory operationally. But you also have -- want to have finished goods. So that's what [indiscernible] you saw there.",161

And by end markets, Tom, our guidance, as you saw where our revenues came in, we were, I think, less than 1% from the midpoint of the guidance range.

So revenues there were stronger for a longer period of time. The second consideration is that embedded relies on foundry wafer supply more heavily. Most of our analog business is done internally. So There, the constraints lasted longer and have now been resolved and are behind us. So that created some of the lag between there as well. So -- and as you know, our CapEx plans and spend will have more of our wafers overall built internally, which is inclusive of Embedded. Do you have a follow-on?",120

And it's kind of a cyclical question. You guys are astute students of cyclicality of this whole industry. I think this is going to be included in your guide, the sixth quarter of negative year-over-year comps. Do you see anything that's TI-specific that's different this cycle, pricing just got so good before. Now it's a bigger headwind. You kind of addressed the pricing dynamic a little bit before. But what's making this duration so much longer? And is any of it TI specific?",86

All cycles are the same, and they're all different, right, as we've all studied them over time. What's clearly different this time is how the markets have behaved in the bifurcation. We saw personal electronics begin to weaken the second quarter a year ago. And automotive, just we saw a sequential decline in this last quarter. So in the other markets, somewhere in between. So -- and then in addition, I think that we've had lots of other noise that's inside of the system, whether that's been pricing, as you mentioned. 
We've had noncancelable non-reschedule orders and other longer-term contracts that have required customers to take product that they don't need whether companies are using distributors more heavily than others. So all of that adds noise into it. So I think we just need to let that noise bring itself out over the cycle. And what we're focused on, of course, is investing in our competitive advantages, getting stronger, we believe that we're in a great position to continue to gain share over the long term.",191

I just want to clarify for those who maybe new on the call, when they've talked about our non-cancel, non returnable orders, that's not, we don't do that. Many of our competitors have done that. So that, in our view, is towards the market that wasn't the case with us. And the second point, distributors, same thing. Our distribution footprint is much smaller than with many of our competitors.

No, happy to talk about that. So first, let me address the ITC first, and then I'll go to the grant. So the ITC investment tax credit, 25% credit on CapEx for manufacturing in the United States, we have accrued to date over the last 1.5 years or so, $1.4 billion. We expect to get about $500 million of that later this year, probably in the fourth quarter as far as the current law and regulations stipulate. And we'll get the rest further down the road, mostly the following year and then after that. And we'll continue to accrue that benefit just again, 25% on anything we spend in the United States for manufacturing. That's the cash side and the balance sheet. 
On the P&L, you're already we're already seeing the benefit of lower depreciation. And that tends to be -- that benefit tends to be small, has been small so far because, for example, some of that is for buildings that haven't even started to depreciate but it will build up over time on that front. So that's the ITC. The grant we submitted our application for those in December. And at this point, we will wait to hear from the Department of Commerce and see what happens there.",211

First, I would point you to our operating cash. Our business model is very strong. And our operating cash flow is very strong, and it supports our investment for growth through the cycle. So clearly, with the levels of CapEx that we have right now that hits the free cash flow, but big picture understand and look at the operating cash even in a depressed environment with the revenue [indiscernible] the operating cash flow is very strong. We also have a very strong balance sheet, and we just finished the year $8.6 billion. When it comes to repurchases, I would take you to our objectives on capital management for cash return. And our objective is to return all free cash flow via dividends and repurchases. Each one of those has different objectives on dividends and repurchases. But we have a really good track record over many years of doing both of those.",153

I would say when you look regionally this quarter from a -- just from a dollar standpoint, you've got -- sequentially, all the regions were down with the exception of the rest of Asia.

Big picture, we have a disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D and SG&A to the best opportunities.

Remember, of course, these investments, particularly industrial automotive, which is where we're biasing investments, they're very long term in nature. You're not going to -- what you say now is going to -- would hurt your long-term revenue growth. So we're not going to do that. So we're going to maintain those investments for the long term.",117

I guess I wanted to ask about your fixed cost leverage. I mean, in the past, you've talked about, I think, 75% gross margin fall through on incremental revenue. Is that still the right metric we should be using given revenues, a good amount lower and depreciation is larger. I'd just be curious to hear if anything in the mechanics of that math has changed. And basically, when can the incremental 300-millimeter capacity start flowing through to gross margin and be margin accretive?",84
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q4 2023 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2024",2024-01-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,2383.0,3002065.0,109785019.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,45,"Yes. So the math is still the same. The fall-through [indiscernible] is 70% to 75%. That is still a reasonable starting point. You then have to adjust for depreciation, as you alluded to in our depreciation. I gave you an update on that 90 days ago, but I'll reinforce that in a second, but you have to adjust for that. And then there are always puts and takes on any given quarter like right now, it's under utilization, but at some point, that goes the other way. Throughout this time, as you pointed out, we will continue to benefit increasingly from 300-millimeter -- more 300-millimeter wafers, which have a cost advantage. So let me go back to depreciation, just to make sure everybody has the right numbers. It's the same as what I said 90 days ago for 2024, expect $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and for 2025, expect $2 million to $2.5 million.",154

Yet at the same time, your inventory is roughly double. And so curious, how are you thinking about kind of normalized inventory over time?

What I would tell you, high level, we're very comfortable with our inventory level. Right now, we're just shy of $4 billion. As I said earlier on the call, we have a continued upward bias for at least one more quarter probably a couple of quarters at least an upward bias on that. But that is good inventory for catalog parts that sell to many customers that last a long time. So I feel really good about that. But we'll see how things play out in the early part of the cycle and depending on demand and different things. But I would expect to continue holding relatively high levels of inventory. 
We are just in a different position than we were even 3 or 4 years ago in terms of how much of our revenue and our parts are in industrial automotive, in catalog type of parts that last a long time. So our strategy is such that it makes sense to have to have that inventory. Our order fulfillment processes have also improved. We have ti.com and different tools that we can leverage to go direct to market. We have a much higher percent of our revenue, now 35% is direct. So all those factors play into having more inventory as a real leverage point that we can use to serve our customers even better.",237

No. Unfortunately, no, there's nothing we can share. It's really up to the Department of Commerce. We sent our application, and we'll see where that goes.

Do you think perhaps some of your customers were delaying their inventory adjustments until they saw lead times for the rest of the industry come down because we know that's also some of your competitors lagged your lead time normalization. Perhaps that was a factor here.,98

As Rafael was talking about building inventory, we've got essentially all of our catalog products or almost all of our catalog products are now immediately available on ti.com. And our objective with inventory and the capacity we're putting in place is to have our customer service metrics remain high, which means keeping time lead times stable. 
So I think in some markets, we've seen customers that have told us that they were planning and have built their capacity and their inventories to grow at 25% in the coming year. And they showed up and their plans change, and they're only going to grow 10%, right? So they told us they won't be ordering product for some time as they equalize those numbers. they're still going to have healthy growth, but it's hard to put that across all of those 100,000 customers into one short concise statement.

Fair enough. And if you could help us with the impact of the underutilization right now how much of a headwind is that providing right now on a cost of sales basis? And then on the other side of this, when we finally get to a recovery, what will be the right way to model this. Will there be a bigger snapback as some of the underutilization comes off? Or do we just kind of go back to sort of those mid-70s incremental margins on the way back up.",90

So what I would tell you, first, we don't quantify on the utilization, but you can fairly reasonably back into it, just looking at our numbers, our midpoint or our range, our midpoint and then consider the depreciation -- expected depreciation increase and it'd be relatively straightforward for you to back into something reasonable for first quarter on the underutilization impact there. Now after that, it's all going to depend on revenue and revenue expectations because, of course, depending what those are in the second half of the year, let's say, 90 days from now, then that will be a big factor in determining how the factories will run. 
But the bigger picture is all deployment of CapEx that we're doing is all on 300-millimeter, which has a 40% cost advantage versus 200-millimeter. As several questions people asked earlier, has ITC benefits on that. So the -- is coming in at 25% discount on the ITC, and we'll see how much we get on grant. So the fall-through on those investments for many, many years will be very positive, I would say. So with that, Dave?",187

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into first quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for the second quarter of 2024. 
Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.7 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 14% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing declined 22%. Our Other segment declined 33% from the year ago quarter. 
Now I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end market. Revenue declined sequentially across all of our end markets. Our results reflect the current environment as customers continue to reduce their inventory levels. 
Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down upper single digits. The automotive market was down mid-single digits. Personal electronics was down mid-teens. Next, communications equipment was down about 25%. And lastly, enterprise systems was down mid-teens. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",339

As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $3.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 57% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced factory loadings and our planned capacity expansions. Gross profit margin decreased 820 basis points. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $933 million, flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 22% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.3 billion in the quarter or 35% of revenue and was down 34% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.20 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.10 benefit that was not in our original guidance, primarily due to the sale of a property. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion in the quarter and $6.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter and $5.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $940 million. 
In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And in the past 12 months, we returned $4.8 billion to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $10.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In first quarter, we issued $3 billion in debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%. 
Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $84 million from the prior quarter, and days were 235, up 16 days sequentially. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.25. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. 
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",431

If and when revenues begin to recover, how do we think about what that would imply for your factory utilization given your current inventory position as well as additional capacity coming online, which I guess sort of just naturally gives a downward bias to utilization anyways? Like I guess how long would you need to take utilizations up? Or how much revenue growth would you need to start taking utilizations up given your positioning on inventories and capacity additions?",86

So Stacy, it's a good question, but it's a complex question. And it's -- at the end of the day, it's going to depend. It's going to depend on a number of factors, what kind of revenue profile you -- we're faced with and not just in 1 or 2 quarters but really over a longer horizon. Maybe the best thing I can tell you is don't expect a significant or even any drain on inventory because just given our business model and how we want to run the company, keeping lead times short and also the upside potential that we have with having this inventory and the capacity in place is so much higher than the downside risk. So hopefully, that gives you some good insight into how we're thinking. Do you have a follow-up?",137

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about pricing. So I think last quarter, you'd suggested that pricing was sort of resuming historical trends, which -- I think it suggests it was down -- I think it was low to mid-single digits. Is there any update on what you're seeing in terms of the pricing environment? Is that still the environment that we're in? Are things better? Are things worse? Like where do you see that going as we go forward?",86

Stacy, I'll comment on that. As I said last quarter, really, we began seeing things change mid last year, in the back half of last year as we began discussions with customers for their demand in the following year and out in time, whenever those pricing windows would open up. And those are really just going back to what we've seen in the last 10, 20 years kind of pre-pandemic. So describe it roughly in the low to very low single-digit declines over time. And I'd say just generally that's what we're continuing to see.",96

I want to give you a bonus answer. You always ask about OpEx. So you're not asking, but I'm going to give you OpEx.

So my question is, should we think of Q2 as kind of a normal seasonal quarter? Just any more color on what you're seeing real time. Are we past the industry inventory correction? Are we kind of getting back to some semblance of -- on normalcy from a demand perspective? Any other color you could give from an end market or geo perspective. Just you are the largest, right, most influential vendor in the market. So I think your perspectives would be very useful to understand where we are in the inventory and the broader demand cycle.",122

Vivek, let me start with what we saw happen in the last quarter because I think it's helpful. First, we saw personal electronics was the first market that went into the correction. It really is -- was the first to come out in the last few quarters. I'd describe it as behaving more seasonal.
If you go to the other end of the spectrum, we've had industrial, which has been declining sequentially from some time. And over the last few quarters, we've been talking about how there's some asynchronous behavior inside of the 12, 13 sectors that we have there. That continued inside of the quarter. So we've got some of the later-cycle sectors that are continuing to decline and declining at double-digit rates. But there are some that are beginning to begin to slow in the declines and even a couple that grew sequentially. 
So that I would just describe as being more mixed this quarter, which is certainly different than last quarter. So -- and look, historically, second quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for us. So it's not unusual for us to see sequential growth sequentially. Do you have a follow-on?",195

For Q2, specifically industrial and automotive, do you think -- is your assumption that customers will continue to work down inventory? Or do you think that they have worked down most of the inventory and we are getting back to some semblance of what normal demand looks like for TI in Q2? Like what does your guidance actually imply, that are we below seasonal? Are we seasonal? Or are we something different?",81

Thanks, Tom, for that question. And I would say no change over the last couple of months. But I think, certainly, over the last few years, there's many things that are changing in China. We've got very competent local competitors there as well as there's subsidized capacity going in place. And when you compare that to 5 or 10 years ago, is it harder to compete there? It certainly is. But again, I would not describe that as a competitive landscape that's changing overnight. And we've talked about that for some years. 
So China is an important market for us. That -- it continues to be a growing market. And we can and will compete there to support our customers. So our competitive advantages, whether that's our manufacturing and technology, the breadth of the portfolio, the reach of the markets, all serve us very, very well in China.

Just on auto particularly. I know that you're not guiding the out-quarter, but just conversations that you've had since you last updated us with those customers. I think you just mentioned that inventories are coming down. But through the pandemic, there was a kind of change of stated ordering patterns of just-in-time to just-in-case. Do you see that kind of persisting? Or do you think that we're moving back to a situation in which customers really want to have much lower inventory on their balance sheet? Obviously, you have a unique supply chain, but just any thoughts on just the auto environment, particularly through the last several months.",109

Thanks again, Tom. I would say that many customers, and especially those in automotive, as they went through and dealt with the disruptions that they had in supply chains actually, were very thoughtful in looking at where their supply is coming from, what things that they can do differently well beyond just carrying extra days of inventory. And when they went through that analysis, I think many found that they have a pretty significant dependence on wafers coming out of both China and Taiwan. 
And what they described that to us is geopolitically dependable capacity is what they're seeking. And again, we've talked about that before in our capital management updates. We believe that that's going to be highly sought after. It is -- we are seeing that today. And so I think we're in a position to be able to support customers and that growth that will come from that.",153

Rafael, you talked a little bit about the trajectory of the grant side of the CHIPS Act -- or excuse me, the ITC side and where you're getting the money in over time. Does any of that inflows of cash have a differing impact on the income statement? Or is it just the same, it's just a matter of timing and when you're getting that $1 billion as opposed to, I think, you said $500 million before?",79

No, no direct impact on the income statement. That's already played in as the lower depreciation and are already flowing through the P&L and in our expectations on depreciation. Of course, having more cash does have an impact in terms of you have more cash, you're going to have more interest income. But put that aside, that's kind of below the profit line or the operating profit line. 
So speaking of depreciation, let me give you an update on that. We've been talking about depreciation for this year, $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. That is -- we continue to expect that, but we're more likely to come in at the bottom half of that range. And for 2025, we continue to expect $2 billion to $2.5 billion in depreciation.",130

So you guys have seen the share count kind of flatten out here for the last 4 or 5 quarters, and then you're building cash and increasing your debt. I guess what's changed? Traditionally, you've sort of taken the share count down slowly but steadily. Any sort of changes in the long-term thinking there on cash, usage of cash, et cetera?",71

When it comes to capital management, it all depends, and it depends on circumstances. And at the moment, our objective when it comes to -- you can -- you've known us for a while. We return all cash flow -- or cash flow to the owners of the company, and we do that over time. But there are times to increase liquidity and to build up cash. So you have seen us over the last couple of years do that and steadily increase the cash on the balance sheet. We finished at $10.4 billion last quarter. 
And we've done that very consciously, right, to protect the investments that we're making, particularly the $5 billion per year CapEx investments in manufacturing because that is the most important allocation of capital, has been for the last few years and will continue to be for the next 3 years.

So I'll start and, Dave, if you want to chime in. But as Dave alluded to earlier on the call, China is a very important market. We need to compete there. We do compete there, and we compete to win there. China, there -- it's pretty clear that there's an incentive to design local semiconductor suppliers. I think that's what you're referring to as insourcing. And today, that share, my guess, my sense is 10% to 15% of the local content is sourced by local semiconductor suppliers. I think the exact number is 12%, the one I saw. So that means there's another 88% that is shared now between U.S. and European suppliers. And our goal is to continue that fight and maintain and gain that share, competing with local suppliers but also competing with U.S. and European semiconductor suppliers.",141

And maybe I'll just add. In China -- in any market, we've just got to have the best parts. And when we have that, that means we've got to be ahead of competitors, whether that's on performance, on support, availability and cost. So -- and we have customers in every region that are beginning to think about where they're sourcing products from. So customers that aren't in China are looking at our, as they describe it, geopolitically dependable capacity. And that's about 80% of our revenue. 
The 20% that's in China, we have customers in China that have and support global markets. And they're coming and describing our geopolitical dependable capacity and wanting to have access to it because it is very unique. We're the only ones that are building at scale outside of China and Taiwan capacity. So customers understand that. They understand it both in China as well as outside.",153

Can you talk about how you think about pricing kind of more strategically as you contemplate having a decent amount of capacity, more 300-millimeter capacity, more subsidization?

So the answer will be amazingly consistent with how you've asked it before. But we haven't changed our strategy on pricing. You know that pricing doesn't move quickly in our industry, and it isn't the primary reason why customers choose our products overall. So we regularly monitor pricing for all of our products. That includes all end markets and all product categories and all regions. And we price to be competitive. And we can do that because we've got a great product portfolio, and we've got great access to the markets through our channels.

So I think in the near term, of course, we're not going to be immune to cycle-related corrections.

But I guess the question is, what would be the trigger for being able to resume some degree of buybacks? We realize that the intention is to return 100% of excess free cash flow. But at what point does the cash in the balance sheet and kind of industry conditions allow you to kind of come back to what you've been doing previously?",80

Well, a couple of things. For example, the data point that I'll give you is our free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $940 million. And we returned in -- also in trailing 12 months $4.8 billion. So one catalyst for a change there would be once we're past this investment phase that is consuming a good chunk of that free cash flow. Another catalyst is obviously revenue and how that behaves over a number of years. But -- so these are just some of the puts and takes that we think about when we're allocating capital.",100

And I guess the question is about where TI is allocating the R&D investment going forward and how that may be changing. Over last year, it looks like auto industrial is about 70% of your revenue, and I know that's by design. But you've got some segments such as comm equipment that have been down a lot more. As we look out over the next 2 years or so, do you think that percentage of revenue on the segments kind of stays about where it is right now? Or based on the R&D investments you're making, do you think that changes substantially?",104

And it's a great question, Chris. So let me just use as a backdrop for those that hadn't looked at our capital management slide deck. And Slide 21 shows our percentage of our revenue by end market. And the middle column there talks about what we're doing directionally from an R&D spend. So -- and we've talked about for some time that -- our belief that there's going to be secular trends and increasing semiconductors in industrial and automotive. And as a result of that, we have been taking investments up there. 
And the other markets, though, if you look at personal electronics and communications equipment, our investments there have been and continue to be very steady because we can find great opportunities inside of those markets. And so we'll continue those investments. 
And then enterprise systems, we've taken up the investments there slightly. And there's just opportunities, and enterprise systems likely will be a good grower as well. It doesn't have quite the same dynamics as industrial and automotive for us. But certainly, things that sit inside of enterprise, we believe, will make that an above-average grower over the next decade plus. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap up.",206

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. 
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially for management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for the third quarter of 2024. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.",210

Let me also start by welcoming everyone to the call. I'm looking forward to joining our quarterly earnings calls moving forward and sharing more details about our business strategy with the investment community. It is an opportunity for me to directly share more information about our results and our strategic progress. With that, I'll start with a quick overview of the second quarter. 
Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and a decrease of 16% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 11% year-over-year and Embedded Processing declined 31%. Our Other segment declined 22% from the year-ago quarter. 
Now I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end market. Our results continue to reflect the asynchronous behavior across our end markets that we've seen throughout this cycle. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. 
First, the industrial market was down low single digits. The automotive market was down mid-single digits. Personal electronics grew mid-teens with broad-based growth while demonstrating continued improvement compared to its low point in the first quarter of 2023. 
Next, communication equipment was up mid-single digits. And finally, enterprise systems was up about 20%. 
Lastly, before I pass it on to Rafael, I'd like to share a few comments regarding our capacity investments. We and our customers remain pleased with our progress of the expansion of our 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity. These investments reflect our confidence in the opportunity ahead, which remains high for several reasons, first, we have a high level of confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content particularly in industrial and automotive, where we have greater exposure and strong product position. 
Second, geopolitically dependable low-cost 300-millimeter capacity will be increasingly critical and valuable, and our investments enable us to support customer demand at scale. To share more details on our progress, which we believe is helpful for all of our shareholders to understand, I plan to hold an off-cycle capital management call with Rafael and Dave on August 20. During the call, I will provide more granularity on our capacity investments along with a framework of revenue and free cash flow per share scenarios. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",388

As Haviv mentioned, second quarter revenue was $3.8 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.2 billion or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher revenue as well as lower manufacturing unit costs due to increased factory loadings and more manufacturing internally with more wafers on 300-millimeter. 
Operating expenses in the quarter were $963 million, up 3% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 23% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter or 33% of revenue, and was down 37% from the year ago quarter. 
Net income in the second quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.22 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $6.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter and $5 billion over the last 12 months. 
Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.5 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow includes benefits from the CHIPS Act investment tax credit, which was $312 million for second quarter. 
In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $71 million of our stock. In total, we returned $4.9 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $300 million of debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $23 million from the prior quarter, and days were 229, down 6 days sequentially. 
For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.94 billion to $4.26 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.48.  We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be above 13%. 
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. 
We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",453

One of the candidates is talking about the China-Taiwan relationship and -- and I'm just asking how the geopolitical environment is sort of impacting your customers' buying decisions? I think you said last call that even some of your Chinese customers who are exporting product want geopolitically dependable capacity. And I think you talked about that being kind of an increasingly big factor in autos. Can you talk about that? And is that beginning to drive some share gains for you?,89
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3078.0,3193578.0,113922002.0,Answer,Haviv Ilan,,Executives,6,"Thanks, Tim. I'll take that, it's Haviv. First, geopolitical dependable capacity is not a new thing for us. We have started to see these requests coming, I think, 2 or 3 years ago when tension started to rise. But as we reflect on it now 3 years in, it's obvious that there is more and more tension. Usually at the highest levels of our customers, I'm talking about leadership, or CEO or Chief Purchasing Officer looking at their supply chain and making sure that they are going to be immune from whatever is thrown at them, part of it is geopolitical tension. And this is where TI is a great answer. 
We are a very unique supplier in the sense of we can provide capacity at scale, meaning the amount of wafers and the size of the capacity that we are building is very high. It is a very affordable capacity us building our parts on 300-millimeter wafers allows for a lower cost per chip, and then building them internally in our assembly and test houses also provides a very good low cost structure. 
And last but not least, is this geopolitically dependable capacity, meaning our fabs are being built in the U.S., mainly in Texas and in Lehi, Utah. And we provide capacity that is at scale, affordable and dependable. And yes, every time there is some news out there, we are seeing more interest. We have seen that grown over the last several years. And in that sense, our discussions with our customers are providing us more opportunity to win positions in future platforms. I do believe we are taking a bigger share, and this is part of our confidence to continue with our investments to serve that opportunity moving forward. 
Last but not least, you have touched China. Yes, you're right. If I take an example and just on the automotive side, our customers in China do care a lot about their export business. In that sense, our capacity is highly welcomed by them because we can compete at the market price with a very competitive offering, yet have that dependability to serve our customers, not only in China, but also outside of China for their export business.",371

So on the grants, frankly, we're still going through the process. So we submitted the application, and we're just working through the details with the CHIPS program office. But given your question, let me comment also on the ITC, the investment tax credit. To date, we have accrued about $1.8 billion in total, that's under 25% ITC. This benefit already started flowing through the income statement as lower depreciation. In addition, in second quarter, we received, as I said in the prepared remarks, $312 million of cash benefits, and that is reflected in operating and free cash flow, and we expect to receive another $200 million in 3Q and for a total of $1 billion for 2024.",120

And maybe calculators as well, I don't know, Other was pretty strong. I was wondering if you could give us some color on where your expectations for the growth in Q3 sequentially is coming from? Is it still primarily a personal electronics. And I guess maybe calculators or other stuff. How do I think about the end market trends as we go forward in the next quarter?",85

I'll start, and I'll let Dave add some more color on Q2. So if I go back to the second quarter, yes, if you look at our results, Industrial did decline at the low single digits. Automotive continue to decline at mid-single digits. That was the third quarter in a row of that decline. Although from a year-over-year perspective, it's still doing well, meaning less than 10% of a decline, a decline about 9% in Q2. 
Yes, there is strength in personal electronics, and I do see that market. It went through the entire cycle. It troughed sometime in the first quarter of 2023 and we've seen that market strengthening. And again, it grew mid-teens sequentially, but close to 20% year-over-year. So there is definitely strength over there. And I would also say that on the enterprise market, again, a smaller revenue for us, but we are seeing a recovery over there. And I believe that inventory correction is behind us. 
Regarding the Other business, it grew thanks to our calculator business, as you mentioned, but also our DLP business, which mainly serves the personal electronics market. And Dave, maybe you can add some more color on the sectors as we talk about Q2.",209

I think as we have seen, even inside of industrial, we've had sectors behave asynchronously. So when we first began to see weakness in industrial, which really began in the third quarter, that was the peak in third [indiscernible] that was the peak in industrial. 
We talked about seeing about half of the sectors or so show weakness and those early [ .com ] earlier stage sectors, some of them have found bottoms and begun to grow, and you can see some of that bottoming process taking place.
The Others, we're only 3 or so quarters in, and we've got several of them that are continuing to decline at double-digit rates. So again, as we've seen all of our markets behave asynchornously inside of the sectors, we've seen that in Industrial as well.

Because every time this question is asked to industries, not just AI, the answer is always that, well, the IP is not there, they don't have product breath and whatnot, but they're still buying a lot of trailing edge equipment. So at what point, Haviv, does that start to become a concern from just a global capacity and global pricing perspective for Texas Instruments?",103

Let me start with the first part of your question on how the China market did because I think it was a good quarter for our China business. Our China headquarters business grew sequentially at about 20% versus the first quarter. And we've seen the momentum across all markets. I mean, all 5 markets grew sequentially, I think, 15% or 20%. So they all did well. And this is after 7 quarters of sequential decline. So if you think about the way I look at the China market, and it was exposed to all -- to all end markets for TI, it took 7 quarters for this asynchronous cycle to go through, starting with PE, personal electronics, then spreading to industrial and enterprise and just lately to automotive. But all of these have now corrected and Q2 was a good quarter for our business. And I believe we are now shipping to end demand, meaning customers have stopped managing their inventories over there. 
Now in terms of the competition in China, I don't think that's -- I mean, we've been very vocal about it. This is first not new, that competition has intensified over the last -- the past several years. And I think it's growing stronger. I think it's a mistake for us to think that these guys are only doing simpler parts. These are very ambitious, highly educated competitors. And our job here in TI, and that's what I tried to teach the team is to compete. 
And I will tell you that, yes, the market is more competitive in China, but we can compete and we can win business in very attractive margins. So we are going to continue to do that. Our goal -- objective is to continue and gain market share in China.",300

Yes. I was -- I think what we can see, Vivek,  of course, we don't get any data fees on customer inventory. We don't get any data feeds on customer shipments, but we can look into things like the order patterns, we can look at fees that we get in consignment, we can see what's happening in -- with our inventories and our position. 
So as we've talked about, cancellations, as an example, as a measure, have continued to come down, our lead times, I described is very stable. We've got immediate availability of almost all of our products. So that does drive lower visibility with backlog because customers can get product when they need it.
And we do believe that some markets, PE bottomed back in first quarter of '23, and it's been more seasonal since then. We've seen some of the other markets that -- as we've shared earlier, are beginning to grow, so there's likely a bottom forming within some of those markets. We've got industrial and automotive that have continued to decline. 
Now I'd say within Industrial, I mentioned earlier, some of the sectors are forming a bottom. Others are continuing to decline. In Automotive, Where we've got 3 quarters behind us, right? So that's how, as we look into where we are positioned today, but we don't have a strong signal that can tell us exactly to be able to answer the question that you asked.",242

The only one comment I will add Vivek in terms of the difference. So automotive, so far at least just year-to-date is down mid-single digits, and that is off of a very good 2023 for us, right? We grew about 17% in 2023. And I think it's just helped by the strong secular content growth that we see in automotive. And this is across both combustion engines or ICE and EVs. So that's maybe the difference -- the slight difference I see between these 2 markets.",87

So I'll ask one for you and maybe Rafael would chime in as well. You guys have given at least, Rafael in the past some mid-quarter updates or earnings call updates on CapEx and depreciation versus your pre-existing plan. So are you still planning to spend $5 billion a year? And does the depreciation ranges, Rafael, you gave before still apply? Or are we going to have some more flexibility on those metrics going forward?",89

I'll start and Rafael, maybe you can provide some more color. So first, again, our strategy has not changed and it continues to serve us well, as I said before, the secular growth in industrial & automotive and our position, our market position and our product portfolio position gives us the confidence that there is a higher opportunity over there. 
On top of it, as we said earlier, customers do want and value geopolitically dependable capacity. So we are pleased with our progress. Our CapEx strategy provides us both with capacity for growth and flexibility. And at the end of the day, CapEx supports revenue growth and need to be prepared for different scenarios. 
Now, we always continue to evaluate our plans and investments based on what we see on the demand environment, the dynamics, the growth opportunities in the market. And to talk more about it, we -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we see our -- we are going to have our off-cycle capital management call in a month in 4 weeks. It's just an opportunity to share just additional insight. 
So we'll go through our investment plan with more granularity on what exactly we are doing per factory, and then we'll provide a framework of revenue scenarios and what would free cash flow per share and CapEx do versus each and every scenario. And regarding depreciation, Rafael, I don't know if you want to add anything?",242

So I'll just comment on depreciation. Ross, I'm going to narrow that depreciation range a little bit, both for '24 and '25.

So one for you, Rafael, if I heard you right on the gross margin rising in the second quarter, you mentioned that loadings increased. I thought that they were going to decrease to burn some inventory now that you have that at kind of the $4 billion target. So did something change there? And what's the expectations for utilization going forward?",72

No. So the loadings came in about as expected. But let me just tell you more about it. Second quarter loadings were up versus first quarter. And as you saw, we're essentially flat on inventory. So essentially, the ins and outs were pretty much offsetting. When it comes to third quarter, we expect utilization or factory loadings to be flat to slightly up. And in our base case for our -- the EPS guidance that we have, that's what we have in there. But of course, we have time during the quarter to adjust those load is depending on what we expect for fourth quarter. 
On GPM specifically for third quarter, I would in that base case at the midpoint of our guidance, I would expect GPM percent to be up versus second quarter.",135

So depreciation is going up like $100 million roughly per quarter for next year. But if utilization rates keep going up, i.e., if nothing gets any worse, do you think is it possible that your gross margins are bottoming now? Or is there anything else that could drive them lower or maybe provide a tailwind? Just give us maybe the mechanics around it for the next several quarters?",80
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3078.0,3193578.0,113922032.0,Answer,Rafael Lizardi,,Executives,36,"%Sure. Sure. I'll be happy. And I'll keep it -- well, at the end of the day, yes, it is possible. That is the case. It's all going to depend on revenue, of course. So the main driver is revenue. So as we -- and in addition to revenue as we bring more executing on our strategy to load more 300-millimeter wafers and bringing more external loadings internal the fall-through excluding depreciation will likely turn more in the range of 75% to 85% on a year-on-year basis. 
Now of course, any 1 quarter, even any 1 year, you may have puts and takes that utilization or factory loadings is one of those that sometimes it goes against you, sometimes it goes in favor. But in general, expect that fall through on 75% to 85%, not counting depreciation. So, you do the math, whatever revenue assumptions you want to put over the next several quarters or years do that fall through and you can very easily model where -- and I just gave you depreciation, right? So you can then model what gross margins can do over the next several years.",190

Thanks for the additional bread crumbs. They're very useful. My follow-up is just on bookings. I think last quarter, you said that bookings were increasing every month. Is that still true? And do you think that for the industrial automotive space we're at least getting close to the bottom there? Or do you feel any better about either of those end markets on a relative basis?",67

So again, as you look at those things, revenue did increase as well as orders throughout the quarter, which is very typical that we would see in the second quarter. And certainly, as we've got growth at the midpoint, that would not be unexpected. Again, those other sides of lead times really on all of our products, having immediate availability and stable lead times, cancellations continuing to decline. All those things, I think, point to supply and demand becoming more in balance and that availability. 
So -- and there is a second part of your question, Chris, that I'm not addressing, I'm not sure what it was. Could you just repeat it for me?",115

Overall, it's been elongated, but if you look at it sector by sector, it's probably a better view overall. And in auto, this is our third quarter of decline. We're down about 13% from where the revenue peaked. It's a pretty shallow decline compared to how the other markets had behaved so far. So that's what we see. So thank you, Chris.",85

You've always had this slide in your capital management call deck where you show revenue supported. I think you have for '26, you had $30 billion; for 2030, you had $45 billion. I know you're constantly evaluating your plans and you talked about presenting various scenarios on the August call. But I'm curious, is the $30 billion for '26 and $45 billion for 2030, are those still kind of the base case scenarios for you? Or has there been any change post conversations with customers?",100

So I think it's going to be just a better environment to go provide this information. We'll also provide supporting materials and we'll update the presentation where you'll see as I said, the different scenarios and how we see them. And to me, step-by-step, right now, when I think about how we establish our CapEx plan, we need to think about what the next peak wants to do. We'll discuss that. We'll discuss different scenarios of revenue leading to the next peak and what will CapEx do accordingly. And as a result, what free cash flow per share will be.

Just a question on embedded processing. Revenue was down sequentially and the year-over-year decline actually accelerated. Analog, we've seen some stabilization. So I'm just curious what you're seeing in the embedded processing side. Is this purely volume pressure? Or is there a pricing or competitive component here as well. I think operating margins for that business came in a little bit as well sequentially. So just curious?",68
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3078.0,3193578.0,113922041.0,Answer,Haviv Ilan,,Executives,45,"Yes. Let me start first on high level embedded business. So when I look at the underneath beyond the numbers, it's getting stronger. Our product portfolio is improving, and when I look at the -- this decade, the -- just the opportunity for that business to be a major contributor for TI's growth of free cash flow per share is very high. So I'm very encouraged by the progress of the business. 
Now regarding the cycle first embedded as a little bit of a different structure compared to analog. It's mainly composed of industrial and automotive. So it has less exposure into personal electronics, enterprise or communication equipment. And these 2 markets stick later, right? So if you look at the embedded business versus analog, it's picked a year after middle 2023 versus the middle of '22 for the analog business. 
In addition to that, the embedded business today, although as Rafael mentioned, is being changed was mainly supported from foundry wafers during the up cycle, and we felt more limitation over there compared to our internal supply capacity. So now when these supply issues are resolved, we are seeing customers just adjusting their inventory. 
That's what I believe is happening and therefore, embedded is seeing -- that suffer a correction. But again, when I look at it from the top, embedded is strengthening, and I think we'll continue to serve us very well moving forward.",236

Just as a reminder, as Haviv said, traditional embedded has relied on external wafers, but we now have -- we're bringing them in, and we have the Lehi factory is disproportionately will serve embedded. And therefore, embedded is taking disproportionate amount of the fixed cost charges there. But just like that is put right now, it will be a tailwind. It's a headwind now, it will be a tailwind in the future as we qualify more and more parts, embedded parts as well as analog at that Lehi factory.",103

Maybe to follow up on the embedded question, right, because this business grew 3% last year versus your Analog business, which is down 15%. Yes, year-to-date, it's down about as much as your peers or I would argue slightly better. You've articulated the positive strategy changes previously like more catalog, broad market focus. So bottom line, again, over the past few years, it seems like you've made good improvements in this business. So as theme moves embedded more to internal manufacturing, combined with the strategy shift maybe Haviv, can you just comment on the design win momentum? What areas are you particularly doing well in, and I'm not sure Rafael, how should we think about the improvement in embedded margins as you move what was once mostly outsourced to internal manufacturing?",139
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3078.0,3193578.0,113922045.0,Answer,Haviv Ilan,,Executives,49,"Yes. Let me start, and I'll let Rafael add some more color. But again, as you mentioned, the Embedded business has gone through a change in the last 4 or 5 years. And [ Anika ] has done a great job to position the business, such that it benefits our competitive advantages. Think about manufacturing and technology, so shifting really from almost like 80% external to, when done maybe the opposite, 80% internal build -- building a higher breadth of products or not less concentration of revenue per socket and us expanding our product portfolio, utilizing the reach of our market channels. Think about the large sales team of TI, think about ti.com, the more catalog is the product, the better fit to our strategy. So in that sense, that is moving well. 
In terms of design in momentum, again, it's mainly an industrial and automotive business. So very high visibility on the automotive side. But as you also know, it takes time. So I'm encouraged with the designing momentum, our funnel increased tremendously when I compare it to the Analog side because every funnel of every supplier grows, but we've seen a disproportional growth of our design in momentum for Embedded versus previous year and also versus Analog just in terms of the rates. 
And I will give some examples. We see good momentum in real-time control. Think about EVs, onboard chargers, think about traction inverters. Very good momentum in connectivity, automotive and beyond. Think about car entries, tire pressure monitoring and other body related opportunities in the automotive market. 
I can continue with more application-specific products like our radar systems. We have great position and growing position in radar, winning a lot of new business both with the Tier 1s and the OEMs. This is from imaging radar for the front to the corner radar to even parking assist and also in-cabin sensing, that radar is taking a bigger and bigger part in the automotive market. 
And many other examples on the industrial side, here, the number of end equipment is really vast, hundreds of end equipments. But this is where our catalog MCUs that we are really reviving the presence of TI and building a new portfolio based on our MSP family, is doing very well in winning new business across the board, across the market, utilizing our channel advantage. 
So I can go on and on here. But again, just the evidence of my excitement of what this business can do for us in the second half of this decade.  Rafael?",425

Of course, we don't give guidance for the segments. So the 75% to 85% gross margin fall-through ex depreciation that I talked about earlier, applies to both. Outside of -- if we didn't have Lehi, and I'll address that in a second, but we didn't have that, I would say, generally, Analog would be at the higher end of that range Embedded will be at the lower end. 
But for the next year, 2 or 3 because Lehi, all those cost are -- all those fixed costs are already there, including people. We're going to have some nice tailwind and all of -- a good portion of that will go to Embedded. But over the longer time frame, 75% to 85% ex-depreciation is a good guide to us.",139

As you sort of potentially pass the bottom of sort of the current cycle here, Wondering if there's been any notable movement or trends in ti.com?

Let me start more in the mid to longer term, and I'll let Dave add some more color on how it looks versus the cycle. So in terms of the investments in ti.com, yes, they are continuing. These are very strategic and important investment for us. We believe there is a huge opportunity to digitize what we call the last mile or that interface between us and the customers. There are many, many customers still a long tail of customers that we can't see today. But as they move to ti.com, we can supply them with more information. We can even provide opportunity to place backlog electronically, directly with TI. 
And in that sense, the important for us is to just know our customers better understand the end equipment and provide the relevant product portfolio to serve their growth and win market share, right? So that data is, to us, very, very important and the direct connectivity with the customer is important. To do just that, we are investing in IT systems. We are investing in warehouses. So if you will, logistics to serve these customers just in time as they need it. And that is part of the way customers would opt to TI and just connect directly to us. 
Now in terms of the short term, Dave, maybe you can talk a little bit about what we're seeing there through the cycle.",235

And as we would have expected orders that are placed through ti.com are down significantly from its peak, just I think just telling of where we are with availability of product. But the great thing with ti.com is customers connect through APIs and put their planning systems on that. When they do have a shortage, they can look into our inventory, they can see it -- some have even automated that process and have products shipped [indiscernible] in many cases, the same day. So we think the long-term strategic value of ti.com is much higher than the transactions that will cross it here in the short term.

And we believe it's important to keep that not only now when it's kind of easy and we have a market cycle that you can call it at a low point. 
The test for our company would be at the next up cycle, okay, not only upcycle, it is -- you can model Joe any upcycle that you want, but we want to be supporting our customers at the highest level even if the cycle looks like a very steep one. And we model, for example, the COVID cycle is a similar one, and that's what drives our investments. 
I think it's very, very important to serve your customers ahead of the competition at times like that because that's the opportunity to gain share, and we are going to be prepared for that opportunity. Having said that, all that is done in a very thoughtful way. Inventory is being built at the right part, where we have this diversity and longevity positions such that we don't risk the scrap of the inventory. 
And I'm pleased with the progress we have made, but the test will come, and I'm sure it will come at the next up cycle. I don't know if you want to add anything, Dave.",229

I mean just to follow up on that, to the extent that your competition is doing things more the way they traditionally have and probably will see boom bust cycles. What happens in the next upturn, if they can't get parts from 3 of your competitors, is there a way you can keep them from accumulating inventory of TI components, even though they shouldn't need to. I mean that seems like it's part of kind of the industry behavior in the past. Just how focused are you on trying to dampen that?",93

So our intention is to maintain lead times through the cycle. It depends what cycle is thrown at us. There is always going to be that one cycle or that steep cycle that maybe we won't be able to do it. 
But we have modeled the company in such a way that in most demand situation, we would be able to maintain a good customer or high customer service levels through the cycle, which hopefully, will keep the lead time short in which I'm pretty sure will encourage customers not to hold inventory. That has to be proven, but that's the way we want to prepare for the future.",138

Joe, I never once took a double order. And so trying to control customer behavior when things get short, people want to build more inventory, right? And so that's just the behavior that I think that will be in our industry for the foreseeable future, but we can gain share in those periods of time, and that's the advantage of having the capacity in place.",81

It sounds like that rebounded fairly robustly in the first quarter. Could you give some more color on what you were seeing within China? And then do you think -- do you feel all those Chinese customers are still burning through inventory? Are you still under shipping demand there?,60
140283.0,"Texas Instruments Incorporated, Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2024",2024-07-23,48.0,Earnings Calls,Texas Instruments Incorporated,3078.0,3193578.0,113922060.0,Answer,Haviv Ilan,,Executives,64,"Yes, thanks for the question. First, I would say that in China, it's -- there is a very distinct signal that customers have worked down their inventories. And we've seen that spreading through time with the market. If you think about the asynchronous behavior that we have described of the different markets, we saw the same in China.  
The personal electronics business peaked in China somewhere in 2021, enterprise and industrial, sometimes in '22 and then automotive picked sometime in '23. So you saw that peak spread over 3 years, which I think is the reason we saw such elongated decline of 7 quarters in a row. And we went backwards to our history, and it's been one of the longest, if not the longest cycle we have seen. 
But I can see clearly that it's mainly played out. Of course, you will always find pockets and a few sectors in the industrial market that are still going through that. But it's very clear that once you start to shift to end demand, you will see such behavior of, in our case, 20% sequential growth. And that momentum is being built across the markets. All markets did very well in China, growing between 15% to 20-something percent, okay? So very robust, coherent, and that's like a recovery looks like. 
Now we haven't seen that across the other markets. I will even tell you that the areas like Europe and Japan are in an early phase. And hopefully, it doesn't take 7 quarters per geography. But China was the first into the up cycle, the beginning of COVID, the first one to correct on the down. And now, to me, the first one raising a very strong sequential growth with momentum. So that's the way I would summarize it without trying to imply that we'll see the same behavior in each and every other market.",314

And just a quick follow-up, and I'm sure this is another thing you'll address on the August call. But you narrowed the range for depreciation next year -- next year down a little bit. Last quarter, you talked about CapEx kind of being around this $5 million level per year. It was down sequentially in the second quarter is $5 billion still reasonable way of looking CapEx this year?",71

At our core, we are engineers. Our technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. 
While we strive to achieve our objective, we'll continue to pursue our 3 ambitions: First, we will act like owners, we'll own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of, and we would want as our neighbor. 
When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening.",129
